            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough none of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of these Nations can, in propriety of speaking, be a stranger to the Royal Family, from whom every single person receives the daily emanations of many Blessings; yet besides this, there is much in your Royal Highness by which your Princely Person is related to all amongst us that are or would be excellent. For where Vertue is in her exaltation, to that excellent Person all that are or would be
<pb facs="tcp:98913:3"/>
thought vertuous do address themselves, either to be directed or encouraged, for example or for patronage, for the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of affection or likeness of design; and therefore, <hi>Madam,</hi> although it is too great a confidence in me, something a stranger, to make this Address to so high-born and great a <hi>Princess;</hi> yet when I considered that you are the Sister of my <hi>King,</hi> and the Servant of my God, I know there was nothing to be expected but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity and sweetness, gentleness and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Royal favours and Princely graces; and therefore in such fruitful showers I have no cause to fear that my fleece shall be dry, when all that is round about it shall be made irriguous with your Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly influence. I shall therefore humbly hope that your Royal Highness will first give me pardon, and then accept this humble oblation from him who is equally your
<pb facs="tcp:98913:3"/>
servant for your great Relations, and for your great Excellencies: For I remember with what pleasure I have heard it told, that your Highness's Court hath been in all these late days of sorrow a Sanctuary to the afflicted, a Chappel for the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a Refectory to them that were in need, and the great Defensative of all men and all things that are excellent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is but duty, that by all the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of Religion that honour should be paid to your Royal Highness, which so eminent vertues perpetually have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But because you have long dwelt in the more secret recesses of Religion, and that for a long time your Devotion hath been eminent, your obedience to the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rules of Religion hath been humble and diligent, even up to a great exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that the service of God hath been your great Care and greatest Imployment,
<pb facs="tcp:98913:4"/>
your Name hath been dear and highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable amongst the Sons and Daughters of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and we no more envy to <hi>Hungary</hi> the great Name of St. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to <hi>Scotland</hi> the glorious memory of St. <hi>Margaret,</hi> to <hi>France</hi> the triumph of the piety of St. <hi>Genovese,</hi> nor St. <hi>Katharine</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> since in your Royal Person we have so great an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our own, one of the Family of Saints, a Daughter to such a glorious Saint and Martyr, a Sister to such a <hi>King,</hi> in the arms of whose Justice and Wisdom we lie down in safety, having now nothing to employ us, but in holiness and comfort to serve God, and in peace and mutual cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to enjoy the blessings of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under so great, so good a <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Royal <hi>Madam,</hi> I have yet some more personal ground for the confidence of
<pb facs="tcp:98913:4"/>
this Address; and because I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the great honour of your reading and using of divers of my Books, I was readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited to hope that your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness would not reject it, if one of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired upon a special title to kiss your Princely hand, and to pay thanks for the gracious reception of others of the same Cognation. The stile of it is fit for Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets, plain and useful; the matter is of the greatest concernment, a rule for the usage of the greatest solennity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For as the Eucharist is by the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Fathers of the Church called <hi>the Queen of Mysteries;</hi> so the worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating in this, is the most Princely Conjugation of Graces in the whole Rosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christian Religion; and therefore the more proportioned and fitted for the handling of so Princely a Person, whom the beauty of the Body, and the greatness
<pb facs="tcp:98913:5"/>
of Birth, and excellency of Religion, do equally contend to represent excellent and illustrious in the eyes of all the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> it is necessary that you be all that to which these excellent graces and dispositions do design you: and to this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end, this <hi>Manual</hi> may if you please add some moments; the effecting of which is all my design, except only that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and I humbly pray that it may be look'd upon as a testimony of that greatest Honour which is paid you by the hearts and voyces of all the Religious of this Church, and particularly of</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen St. <hi>Joseph</hi> and the Blessed Virgin Mother had for a time lost their most holy Son, they sought him in the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the high-ways, in the retinues of their kindred, and the Caravans of the <hi>Galilean</hi> Pilgrims; but there they found him not: At last, almost despairing, faint and sick with travel and fear, with desires and tedious expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they came into the Temple to pray to God for conduct and success; knowing and believing assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, that if they could find God, they should not long miss to find the Holy Jesus; and their faith deceived them not: For they sought God, and found him that was God and man in the midst and circle of the Doctors. But being surprised with trouble and wonder, they began a little to expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with the Divine Child, why he would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent so long, and leave them (as it must needs be when he is absent from us) in sorrow and uncertain thoughts. This question brought forth an answer which will be for ever useful to all that shall inquire after this Holy Child: For as they complained of his absence, so he reproved their ignorance; How is it that you have so fondly looked for me, as if I were used to wander in unknown paths without
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98913:9"/>
skill, and without a guide? why did ye inquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me in high-ways, and village-fields? ye ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew me wander, or lose my way, or abide but where I ought; why therefore did ye not come hither to look for me? <hi>Did ye not know that I ought to be in</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">So the <hi>Syriac</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter renders the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

So <hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio, Piscator,</hi> and our English Bibles. But the second reddition is more agreeable with the words of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and the first is more consonant to the use of that phrase in the <hi>N. T.</hi> So <hi>Joh.</hi> 19.27.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; Whither do you drive the just man? do you not know that where-ever he sets his foot, he is within his fathers house, or territory?</note> 
               <hi>my fathers house?</hi> that is, there where God is worshipped, where he loves to dwell, where he communicates his blessing and holy influences, there and there only we are sure to meet our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Lord.</p>
            <p>For this reason, the place of our address to God and holy conversation with him, he is pleased to call <hi>his house,</hi> that with confidence we may expect to meet him <hi>there</hi> when we go to worship: and when the Solemnities of Religion were confined to the Tabernacle, he therefore made it to be like a house of use and dwelling, that in that figure he might tell us where his delight and his aboad would be; and therefore God furnished the Tabernacle with the Utensils of a Prophets room at least, a Table and a Candlestick; and the Table must have dishes and spoons, bowls and covers belonging to it; the Candlesticks must have Lamps, and the Lamps must be continually burning. And besides this, the house
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98913:9"/>
of God must have in it a continual fire, the fire must not go out by night nor day; and to this the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet alludes; God] <hi>hath his fire in Sion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 31.9.</note> 
               <hi>and his hearth or furnace in Jerusalem:</hi> And after all, there must be meat in his house too. And as this was done by the Sacrifices of old, so by the Lords Supper in the New Testament; So that now it is easie to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the place and the reason of Christs aboad; even in his Fathers house, there where his Father dwells, and loves to meet his servants, there we are sure to finde the Lord. For as God descended and came into the Tabernacle invested with a cloud; so Christ comes to meet us clothed with a Mystery;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>O Tarpeie Pater, qui Templa se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundam Incolis à coelo se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> —</note> he hath a house below as well as above; here is his dwelling, and here are his Provisions; here is his fire, and here his meat; hither God sends his Son, and here his Son manifests himself: the Church and the holy Table of the Lord, the Assemblies of Saints, and the Devotions of his people, the Word and the Sacrament, the Oblation of Bread and Wine, and the offering of our selves, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration and the Communion, are the things of God, and of Jesus Christ; and he that is imployed in these, is there where God loves to be, and where Christ is to be found; in the Imployments in which God delights, in the Ministries of his own choice, in the work of the Gospel, and the methods of Grace, in the oeconomy of Heaven, and the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of eternal happiness.</p>
            <p>And now that we may know where to find him, we must be sure to look after him; he hath told us where he would be, behind what pillar, and under what cloud, and covered with what vail, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed by what ministry, and present in what Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and we must not look for him in the high-wayes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98913:10"/>
of ambition and pride, of wealth or sensual pleasures; these things are not found in the house of his Father, neither may they come neer his dwelling. But if we seek for Christ, we shall find him in the methods of Vertue, and the paths of Gods Commandments; in the houses of Prayer, and the offices of Religion; in the persons of the poor, and the retirements of an afflicted soul: we shall find him in holy reading and pious meditation, in our penitential sorrows, and in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in Pulpits and upon Altars, in the Word and in the Sacraments: If we come hither as we ought, we are sure to finde our Beloved, him whom our soul longeth after.</p>
            <p>Sure enough Christ is here; but he is not here in every manner, and therefore is not to be found by every inquirer, nor touched by every hand, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all comers, nor entertained by every guest. He that means to take the air, must not use his fingers, but his mouth; and he that receives Christ must have a proper, that is, a spiritual instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a purified heart, consecrated lips, and a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed mouth, a tongue that speaks no evil, and a hand that ministers to no injustice, and to no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness: For a disproportionate intrument is an undecency, and makes the effect impossible both in nature and morality. Can a man bind a thought with chains, or carry imaginations in the palm of his hand? Can the beauty of the Peacocks train, or the Estrich plume, be delicious to the palat and the throat? Does the hand intermeddle with the joys of the heart, or darkness that hides the naked, make him warm? Does the Body live as does the Spirit, or can the Body of Christ be like to common food? Indeed the Sun shines upon the good and bad; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98913:10"/>
the Vines give Wine to the drunkard, as well as to the sober man: Pirates have fair winds and a calm Sea, at the same time when the just and peaceful Merchant man hath them. But although the things of this world are common to good and bad, yet Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments and spiritual joys, the food of the soul and the blessing of Christ, are the peculiar right of Saints: and the Rites of our Religion are to be handled by the measures of Religion, and the things of God by the rules of the Spirit; and the Sacraments are Mysteries, and to be handled by Mystic persons, and to be received by Saints; and therefore whoever will partake of Gods secrets, must first look into his own; he must pare off what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is amiss, and not without holiness approach to the Holiest of all Holies, nor eat of this Sacrifice with a defiled head, nor come to this feast without a nuptial garment, nor take this remedy without a just preparative. For though in the first motions of our spiritual life, Christ comes alone and offers his Grace, and enlivens us by his Spirit, and makes us begin to live, because he is good, not because we are; yet this great mysterious Feast, and magazine of Grace and glorious mercies, is for those only that are worthy;<note place="margin">

The Wrastler that <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> tells us of, addressing himself to his contention, and espying the Statue of <hi>Jupiter Pisaeus,</hi> prayed aloud; If all things, O <hi>Jupiter,</hi> are rightly prepared on my part, if I have done all that I could do, then do me ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and give me the Victory: And this is a brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate of our case. <hi>He that runneth in races,</hi> saith the Apostle, he that contends for mastery, <hi>is temperate in all things,</hi> and this at least must he be that comes

to find Christ in these Mysteries; he must be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the rules and method of the Sanctuary; there is very much to be done on his part, there is an heap of duties, there is a state of excellency, there are preparations solemn and less solemn, ordinary and extraordinary, which must be premised before we can receive the mysterious blessings, which are here not only consign'd, but collated and promoted, confirmed and perfected.</p>
            <p>The holy Communion, or Supper of the Lord, is the most sacred, mysterious and useful conjugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of secret and holy things and duties in the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It is not easie to be understood, it is not lightly to be received: It is not much opened in the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the New Testament, but still left in its my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Nature: It is too much untwisted and nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by the writings of the Doctors, and by them made more mysterious; and like a Doctrine of Phylosophy, made intricate by explications, and difficult by the aperture and dissolution of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So we sometimes espie a bright cloud formed into an irregular figure; when it is observed by unskilful and phantastick travellers, looks like a Centaure to some, and as a Castle to others: some tell that they saw an Army with Banners, and it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies War; but another wiser than his fellow says, it looks for all the world like a flock of Sheep, and foretels Plenty; and all the while it is nothing but a shining cloud, by its own mobility and the activity of a wind cast into a contingent and inartificial shape: So it is in this great Mystery of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in which some espie strange things which God intended not, and others see not what God hath plainly told: some call that part of it a Mystery which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>none, and others think all of it nothing but
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98913:11"/>
a meer ceremony and a sign: some say it signifies, and some say it effects, some say it is a Sacrifice, and others call it a Sacrament; some Schools of learning make it the Instrument of Grace in the hand of God; others say that it is God himself in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of Grace: some call it venerable, and others say as the vain men in the Prophet, that <hi>the Table of the Lord is contemptible</hi>: some come to it with their sins on their head, and others with their sins in their mouth: some come to be cured, some to be quickned, some to be nourished, and others to be made alive: some out of fear and reverence take it but seldom, others out of devotion take it frequently; some receive it as a means to procure great graces and blessings, others as an Eucharist, and an office of thanksgiving for what they have received: some call it an act of obedience meerly, others account it an excellent devotion, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising of the virtue of Religion; some take it to strengthen their Faith, others to beget it, and yet many affirm that it does neither, but supposes Faith before-hand as a disposition; Faith in all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, according to the degree of Grace whither the Communicant is arrived: Some affirm the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are to be blessed by prayers of the Bishop or other Minister; others say, it is only by the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal words, the words of institution; and when it is blessed, some believe it to be the natural body of Christ; others, to be nothing of that, but the blessings of Christ, his Word and his Spirit, his Passion in representment, and his Grace in real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition: And all these men have something of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for what they pretend; and yet the words of Scripture from whence they pretend, are not so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are the several pretensions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98913:12"/>My purpose is not to dispute, but to persuade; not to confute any one, but to instruct those that need; not to make a noise, but to excite devotion; not to enter into curious, but material inquiries, and to gather together into an union all those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral portions of truth, and differing apprehensions of mysteriousness, and various methods and rules of preparation, and seemingly opposed Doctrines, by which even good men stand at distance, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of each other: For since all societies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians pretend to the greatest esteem of this, above all the Rites or external parts and ministries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it cannot be otherwise, but that they will all speak honourable things of it, and suppose holy things to be in it, and great blessings one way or other to come by it; and it is contemptible only among the prophane and the Atheistical; all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable differences which are in the discourses and consequent practices relating to it, proceed from some common truths, and universal notions, and mysterious or inexplicable words, and tend all to reverential thoughts, and pious treatment of these Rites and holy Offices; and therefore it will not be impossible to find honey or wholsome dews upon all this variety of plants; and the differing opinions, and several understandings of this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which (it may be) no humane understanding can comprehend, will serve to excellent purposes of the Spirit; if, like men of differing interest, they can be reconciled in one Communion, at least the ends and designs of them all can be conjoyned in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and ligatures of the same reverence, and piety, and devotion.</p>
            <p>My purpose therefore is to discourse of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98913:12"/>
excellencies, uses, and intention of the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the blessings and fruits of the Sacrament, all the advantages of a worthy Communion, the publick and the private, the personal and the Ecclesiastical, that we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what it is, what we go about, and how it is to be treated. I shall account also concerning all the duties of preparation, ordinary and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, more and less solemn; of the rules and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of deportment in the receiving; the gesture and the offering, the measures and instances of our duty, our comport and conversation in and after it; together with the cases of conscience that shall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur under these titles respectively, relating to the particular matters.</p>
            <p>It matters not where we begin; for if I describe the excellencies of this Sacrament, I find it engages us upon matters of duty, and inquiries practical. If I describe our duty, it plainly signifies the greatness and excellency of the Mystery: the very notion is practical, and the practice is information; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discourse of the secret, but by describing our duty; and we cannot draw all the lines of duty, but so much duty must needs open a Cabinet of Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. If we understand what we are about, we cannot chuse but be invested with fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; and if we look in with fear and reverence, it cannot be but we shall understand many secrets. But because the natural order of Theology is by Faith to build up good life, by a rectified Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to regulate the Will and the Affections, I shall use no other method, but first discourse of the excellent Mystery, and then of the duty of the Communicant, direct and collateral.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen our Blessed Lord was to nail the hand writing of Ordinances to his Cross, he was pleased to retain two Ceremonies, Baptism and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper; that Christians may first wash, add then eat; first be made clean, and then eat of the Supper of the Lamb: and it cannot be imagined but that this so signal and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar retention of two Ceremonies is of great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose and remarkable vertues. The matter is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the instance of Baptism; and as the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is of the foundation of Religion, so the vertue of it is inserted into our Creed, and we all <hi>believe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98913:13"/>
one Baptism for the remission of our sins</hi>;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1.2.</note> and yet the action is external, the very Mystery is by a Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, the allusion is bodily, the Element is water, the minister a sinful man, and the effect is produced out of the Sacrament in many persons and in many instances, as well as in it; and yet that it is effected also by it and with it,<note place="margin">Act. 2.38.</note> in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with due dispositions of him that is to be baptized, we are plainly taught by Christs Apostles and the symbols of the Church.</p>
               <p>But concerning the other Sacrament there are more divisions and thoughts of heart; for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expressly joyned with a word of promise, and where mention is made of it in the Gospels, it is named only as a duty and a Commandment, and not as a grace, or treasure of holy blessings; we are bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to do it, but promised nothing for a reward, it is commanded to us, but we are not invited to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by consideration of any consequent blessing: and when we do it, so many holy things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us, which as they are fit to be done; even when we do not receive the Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; so they effect salvation to us by vertue of their proper and proportioned promises in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Christs death however apprehended and understood.</p>
               <p>Upon this account some say that we receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the B. Eucharist; but we commemorate many blessed things which we have received; that it is affirmed in no Scripture that in this mystery we are to call to minde the death of Christ, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we already have it in our minde, we must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so have it in our hearts, and publish it in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and Sacramental representment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98913:14"/>
it is not the memory, but the commemoration of Christs death; that as the anniversary sacrifices in the law were <note n="*" place="margin">

                        </gap>.</p>
                  </note> a commemoration of sins every year; not a calling them to minde; but a confession of their guilt and of our deserved punishment; so this Sacrament is a representation of Christs death by such symbolical actions as himself graciously hath appointed: but then, excepting that to do so is an act of obedience, it exercises no other vertue, it is an act of no other grace, it is the instrument of no other good; it is neither vertue nor gain, grace nor profit. And whereas it is said to confirm our faith, this also is said to be unreasonable; for this being our own work, cannot be the means of a Divine grace; <hi>not naturally</hi>; because it is not of the same kind, and faith is no more the natural effect of this obedience; than chastity can be the product of Christian fortitude; <hi>not by Divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi>; because we find no such order; no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, no intimation of any such event; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the thing it self indeed shall have what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God please to apportion to it as it is obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet of it self it hath no other worthiness; it is not so much as an argument of persuasion; for the pouring forth of wine can no more prove or <hi>make faith</hi> that Christs blood was poured forth for us, than the drinking the wine can effect this persuasion in us that we naturally, though under a vail, drink the natural blood of Christ; which the Angels gathered as it ran into golden phials, and Christ multiplied to a miracle like the loaves and fishes in the Gospel. But because nothing that naturally remains the same in all things as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can do any thing that it could not do before; the Bread and wine which have no natural change, can effect none; and therefore we are not to look
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98913:14"/>
for an egge where there is nothing but order; and a blessing where there is nothing but an action; and a real effect where there is nothing but an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, a Sacrament, a mystical representment, and something fit to signify, and many things past, but nothing that is to come. This is the sense and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of some persons that call for an express word, or a manifest reason to the contrary, or else resolve that their belief shall be as unactive as the Scriptures are silent in the effects of this mystery. Only these men will allow the Sacraments to be, <hi>marks of Christianity, symbols of mutual Charity, testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of a thankful mind to God, allegorical admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christian mortification, and spiritual alimony, symbols of grace conferred before the Sacrament, and rites instituted to stir up faith by way of object and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi>; that is, occasionally and morally, but neither by any Divine or physical, by natural or supernatural power, by the work done, or by the Divine institution. This indeed is something but very much too little.</p>
               <p>But others go as far on the other hand and affirm that in the Blessed Sacrament we receive the body and blood of Christ; we chew his flesh, we drink his blood; <hi>for his flesh is meat indeed and his blood is drink indeed,</hi> and this is the <hi>Manna</hi> which came down from heaven; our bodies are nourished, our souls united to Christ; and the Sacrament is the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible instrument of pardon to all persons that do not maliciously hinder it; and it produces all its effects by vertue of the Sacrament it self so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and that the dispositions of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants are only for removing obstacles and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, but effect nothing; the sumption of the Mysteries does all in a capable subject; as in infants
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98913:15"/>
who do nothing, in penitents who take away what can hinder; for it is nothing but Christ himself; the body that dyed upon the crosse is broken in the hand of him that ministers, and by the teeth of him that communicates; and when God gives us his Son in this Divine and glorious manner, with heaps of miracles to verify heaps of blessings, how shall not he with him give us all things else? They who teach this doctrine call the holy Sacrament; <hi>The host, the unbloody sacrifice; the flesh of God, the body of Christ, God himself, the Mass, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar.</hi> I cannot say that this is too much; but that these things are not true; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all that is here said, that is of any material benefit and reall blessing is true; yet the blessing is not so conferred, it is not so produced.</p>
               <p>A third sort of Christians speak indefinitely and gloriously of this Divine mystery; they speak enough, but they cannot tell what; they publish great and glorious effects; but such which they ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by similitude and analogy, such which they desire, but cannot prove; which indeed they feel, but know not whence they do derive them: they are blessings which come in company of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but are not alwayes to be imputed to them; they confound spiritual senses with mystical expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and expound mysteries to natural significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: that is, they mean well but do not alwayes understand that part of Christian Philosophy which explicates the secret nature of this Divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the effect of it is this; that they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put too great confidence in the mystery; and look for impresses which they find not, and are sometimes troubled that their experience does not answer to their Sermons; and meet with scruples

instead of comforts, and doubts instead of rest. and anxiety of mind in the place of a serene and peaceful conscience. But these men both in their right and in their wrong enumerate many glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the holy Sacrament which they usually signifie in these excellent appellatives, calling it, <hi>the Supper of the Lord; the bread of elect souls, and the wine of Angels, the Lords body, the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the calice of benediction, spiritual food, the great Supper, the Divinest and Archisymbolical feast; the banquet of the Church, the celestial dinner, the spiritual, the sacred, the mystical, the formidable, the rational Table, the supersubstantial bread, the bread of God, the bread of life, the Lords mystery, the great mystery of salvation, the Lords Sacrament,</hi>

               <p>IT is strange that Christians should pertinaciously insist upon carnal significations and natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in Sacraments and Mysteries, when our blessed Lord hath given us a sufficient light to conduct and secure us from such mis-apprehensions. [The flesh profiteth nothing: the words which I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life,] that is, the flesh is corruption, and its senses are Ministers of death: and this one word alone was perpetually sufficient for Christ's Disciples. For when upon occasion of the grosse understanding of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters words by the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> they had been once clearly taught that the meaning of all these words was wholly spiritual; they rested there and inquired no further: insomuch that when Christ at the institution of the Supper affirmed of the bread and wine, that they were his body and his blood, they were not at all offended, as being sufficiently before instructed in the nature of that Mystery. And besides this, they saw enough to tell them that what they eat was not the natural body of their Lord: This was the body which himself did or might eat with his body: one body did eat, and the other was eaten; both of them were his body, but after a diverse manner. For the case is briefly this;</p>

glorification, and our faith into Charity; and all the way our souls live a new life by Christ, of which, eating and drinking is the Symbol and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is not done to make this mystery obscure, but intelligible and easie. For so the pains of hell are expressed by fire, which to our flesh is most painful; and the joyes of God by that which brings us greatest pleasure, by meat and drink, and the growth in grace by the natural instruments of nutrition; and the work of the Soul by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the body, and the graces of God by the blessings of nature, for these we know, and we know nothing else, and but by phantasmes and ideas of what we see and feel we understand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all.</p>
               <p>Now this is so far from being a diminution of the glorious mystery of our Communion, that the changing all into spirituality is the greatest increase of blessing in the world: And when he gives us his body and his blood, he does not fill our stomachs with good things, for of whatsoever goes in thither, it is affirmed by the Apostle, that <hi>God will destroy both it and them,</hi> but our hearts are to be replenished, and by receiving his spirit we receive the best thing that God gives; not his liveless body, but his flesh with life in it, that is, his doctrine and his spirit to imprint it, so to beget a living faith and a lively hope that we may live and live for ever.</p>

But what is the advantage we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98913:22"/>
by the Sacraments, besides that which we get by the other and distinct ministeries of faith, I thus account in general.</p>
               <p>The <hi>word</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> are the <hi>flesh</hi> and the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ; that is the ground of all. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are two great Sermons of the Gospel which are the summe total and abbreviature of the whole word of God, the great messages of the word incarnate, Christ was pleased to invest these two words with two Sacraments, and assist those two Sacraments, as he did the whole word of God, with the presence of his Spirit, that in them we might do more signally and solemnly what was in the ordinary ministrations done plainly and without extraordinary regards.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Believe and repent</hi>; is the word in Baptisme, and and there solemnly consigned; and here it is that <hi>by faith</hi> we feed on Christ: for <hi>faith</hi> as it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>works,</hi> that is, the <hi>new Covenant of faith</hi> as it is opposed to the <hi>old Covenant of works,</hi> is the covenant of repentance; repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is expressly included in the new covenant, but was not in the old; but by faith in Christ we are admitted to pardon of our sins if we repent and forsake them utterly. Now this is the word of faith; and this is that which is called the flesh or body of Christ, for this is that which the soul feeds on, this is that by which the just do live; and when by the operation of the holy spirit, the waters are reformed to a <hi>Divine Nature</hi> or efficacy, the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized are made clean, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98913:22"/>
Christ when we are in baptisme incorporated into his body; we are baptized in the passion of our Lord,</hi> so <note n="*" place="margin">Tingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur in passione Domini. Tertul. <hi>l.</hi> de bapt. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to the same sense with that of St. <hi>Paul, we are buried with him in baptisme into his death</hi>; that is, by baptisme are conveyed to us all the effects of Christ's death; the flesh and blood of Christ crucified are in baptisme reached to us by the hand of God, by his holy spirit, and received by the hand of man, the Ministery of a holy faith. So that it can without difficulty be understood that as in receiving the word and the spirit illuminating us in our first conversion, we do truely feed on the flesh and drink the blood of Christ who is the bread that came down from heaven; so we do it also, and do it much more in baptisme, because in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all that was before, there was superadded a rite of Gods appointment. The difference is only this; That out of the Sacrament, the spirit ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with the word in the ministery of man; in Baptisme the spirit operates with the word in the ministery of God. For here God is the preacher, the Sacrament is Gods sign, and by it he ministers life to us by the flesh and blood of his Son, that is, by the death of Christ into which we are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>And in the same Divine method the word and the spirit are ministred to us in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. For as in Baptisme so here also there is a word proper to the ministery. <hi>So often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye declare the Lords death till he come.</hi> This indeed is a word of comfort. <hi>Christ died for our sins</hi>; that is, our repentance which was consigned in baptisme shall be to purpose; we shall be washed white and clean in the blood of the sacrificed Lamb. This is <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum visibile</hi>; the same word read to the eye and to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98913:23"/>
the ear. Hear the word of God is made our food in a manner so near to our understanding, that our tongues and palats feel the Metaphor and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental signification; here faith is in triumph and exaltation: but as in all the other ministeries Evangelical, we eat Christ by faith, here we have faith also by eating Christ: Thus eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is faith; it is faith in mystery, and faith in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony; it is faith in act, and faith in habit; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised and it is advanced; and therefore it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that here we eat the flesh and drink the blood of Christ with much eminency and advantage.</p>
               <p>The sum is this. Christs body, his flesh, and his blood are therefore called our meat and our drink, because by his incarnation and manifestation in the flesh he became life unto us: So that it is mysterious indeed in the expression, but very proper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible in the event, to say that we eat his flesh and drink his blood, since by these it is that we have and preserve life. But because what Christ begun in his incarnation, he finished in his body on the crosse, and all the whole progression of mysteries in his body, was still an operatory of life and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual being to us; the Sacrament of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per being a commemoration and exhibition of this death which was the consummation of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his body and blood, does contain in it a <hi>visible word,</hi> the word in symbol and visibility, and special manifestation. Consonant to which Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crtine, the Fathers by an elegant expression call the blessed Sacrament, [the extension of the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.]</p>
               <p>So that here are two things highly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98913:23"/>1. That by whatsoever way Christ is taken, <hi>out of the Sacrament,</hi> by the same he is taken <hi>in the Sacrament</hi>: and by some wayes here, more than there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the eating and drinking the consecrated symbols is but the body and lesser part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the life and the spirit, is believing greatly, and doing all the actions of that believing, direct and consequent. So that there are in this, two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducations, and <hi>Sacramental,</hi> and the <hi>Spiritual.</hi> That does but declare and exercise this: and of the sacramental manducation as it is alone, as it is a ceremony, as it does only consigne or expresse the internal; it is true to affirm that it is only an act of obedience: but all the blessings and conjugations of joy which come to a worthy Communicant proceed from that spiritual eating of Christ, which as it is done out of the Sacrament very well, so in it and with it, much better. For here being (as in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme) a double significatory of the spirit, a word, and a sign of his own appointment, it is certain he will joyn in this Ministration. Here we have bread and drink, flesh and blood, the word and the spirit, Christ in all his effects, and most gracious communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
               <p>This is the general account of the nature and purpose of this great mystery. Christians are spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men, faith is their mouth, and wisdom is their food, and believing is manducation, and Christ is their life, and truth is the Air they breath, and their bread is the word of God, and Gods spirit is their drink, and righteousness is their robe, and Gods laws are their light, and the Apostles are their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98913:24"/>
salt; and Christ is to them all in all: for we must put on Christ, and we must eat Christ, and we must drink Christ: we must have him within us, and we must be in him: he is our vine, and we are his branches; he is a door, and by him we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; he is our shepherd, and we his sheep: <hi>Deus meus &amp; omnia,</hi> he is our God, and he is all things to us: that is, plainly, he is our Redeemer, and he is our Lord: He is our Saviour and our Teacher: by his Word and by his Spirit he brings us to God and to felicities eternal, and that is the sum of all. For greater things than these we can neither receive nor expect: But these things are not consequent to the reception of the natural body of Christ, which is now in heaven; but of his Word and of his Spirit, which are therefore indeed his body and his blood, because by these we feed on him to life eternal. Now these are indeed conveyed to us by the several ministries of the Gospel, but especially in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, where the Word is preached and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, and the Spirit is the teacher, and the feeder, and makes the Table full, and the Cup to overflow with blessing.</p>

               <p>IN explicating the Nature of this Divine mystery in general, as I have manifested the nature and operations and the whole ministery to be spiritual, and that not the natural body and blood of Christ is received by the mouth, but the word and the spirit of Christ, by faith and a spiritual hand, and upon this account have discovered their mistake, who think the secret lies in the outside, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that we tear the natural flesh of Christ with our mouthes: So I have by consequent explicated the secret which others indefinitely and by conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and zeal do speak of, and know not what to say, but resolve to speak things great enough; it remains now that I consider for the satisfaction of those that speak things too contemptible of these holy mysteries; who say, it is nothing but a commemoration of Christs death, an act of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, a ceremony of memorial, but of no spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual

effect, and of no proper advantage to the soul of the receiver. Against this, besides the preceding discourse convincing their fancy of weakness and derogation, the consideration of the proper excellencies of this mystery in its own seperate nature will be very useful. For now we are to consider how his natural body enters into his oeconomy and dispensation.</p>
               <p>For the understanding of which are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that Christ besides his <hi>Spiritual</hi> body and blood did also give us his <hi>natural,</hi> and we receive <hi>that</hi> by the means of <hi>this.</hi> For this he gave us but once, then, when upon the Crosse he was broken for our sins; this body could die but once and it could be but at one place at once, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was the place appointed for it, and at once all was sufficiently effected by it which was design'd in the Counsel of God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or by the vertue of that death Christ is become the Author of life unto us and of salvation; he is our Lord and our Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; but it he received all power in heaven and earth, and by it he reconciled his Father to the world, and in vertue of that he intercedes for us in heaven, and sends his spirit upon earth, and feeds our souls by his word, he instructs us to wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and admits us to repentance, and gives us pardon, and by means of his own appointment nourishes us up by holinesse to life eternal.</p>
               <p>This body being carried from us into heaven; cannot be touch'd or tasted by us on earth; but yet Christ left to us symbols and Sacraments of this natural body; not to be, or to convey that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body to us, but to do more and better for us; to convey all the blessings and graces procured for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98913:25"/>
us by the breaking of that body, and the effusion of the blood: which blessings being spiritual are therefore called <hi>his body</hi> spiritually, because pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by that body which died for us; and are therefore called our food, because by them we live a new life in the spirit, and Christ is our bread and our life, because by him after this manner we are nourished up to life eternal. That is plainly thus: Therefore we eat Christs spiritual body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath given us his natural body to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and his natural blood to be shed, for the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our sins and for the obtaining the grace and acceptability of repentance. For by this gift, and by this death, he hath obtained this favour from God, that by faith in him and repentance from dead works, by repentance towards God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, we may be saved.</p>
               <p>To this sense of the Mystery are those excellent words of the Apostle:<note place="margin">

Certainly by all these it appears, that this Sacrament is the great ministry of life and salvation: here is the publication of the great word of salvation: here is set forth most illustriously the body and blood of Christ, the food of our souls; much more clearly than in Baptism, much more effectually than in simple enunciation, or preaching and declaration by words; for this preaching is to strangers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in Christ to produce faith, but this Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal enunciation is the declaration and confession of it by men in Christ; a glorying in it, giving praise for it, a declaring it to be done, and own'd, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and prevailing.</p>

for neither the external act, nor the internal grace and morality, does effect our pardon and salvation; but the spirit of God, who blesses the symbols, and assists the duty, makes <hi>them</hi> holy, and <hi>this</hi> accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Only they that attribute the efficacy to the Ministration of the Sacrament, chose to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the immediate work of man, rather than the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate work of God, and prefer the external, at least in glorious appellations, before the internal: and they that deny efficacy to the external work, and wholly attribute the blessing and grace to the moral cooperation, make too open a way for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisers to neglect the divine Institution, and to lay aside or lightly esteem the Sacraments of the Church. It is in the Sacraments as it is in the Word preached, in which not the sound, or the letters and syllables, that is, not the material part, but the formal, the sense and the signification, prepare the mind of the hearer to receive the impresses of the holy spirit of God, without which all preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and all Sacraments are ineffectual: so does the internal and formal part, the signification and sense of the Sacrament, dispose the spirit of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the rather to admit and entertain the grace of the spirit of God there consigned, and there exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and there collated: but neither the outward nor the inward part does effect it, neither the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament nor the moral disposition; only the spirit operates by the Sacrament, and the Communicant receives it by his moral dispositions, by the hand of faith. And what have we to do to inquire into the philosophy of Sacraments? these things do not work by the methods of nature: But here the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is imputed to this cause, and yet can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced without this cause, because this cause is but a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98913:27"/>Thus Baptism was the instrument and sign in the hands of God to confer the holy Spirit upon belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: but the holy Ghost sometimes comes like lightning, and will not stay the period of usual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; for when <hi>Cornelius</hi> had heard St. <hi>Peter</hi> preach, he received the holy Ghost: and as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the holy Ghost was given because they had been baptized, now he and his company were to be baptized because they had received the holy Ghost: and it is no good argument to say, The graces of God are given to believers out of the Sacrament, <hi>ergo,</hi> not by or in the Sacrament; but rather thus, If Gods grace overflows sometimes, and goes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his own instruments, much more shall he give it in the use of them: If God gives pardon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sacrament, then rather also with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For supposing the Sacraments in their design and institution to be nothing but signs and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet they cannot hinder the work of God: and therefore holinesse in the reception of them, will do more than holinesse alone: for God does nothing in vain; the Sacraments do something in the hand of God, at least they are Gods proper and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed times of grace; they are <hi>his seasons</hi> and <hi>our opportunity:</hi> when the Angel stirs the pool, when the Spirit moves upon the waters, then there is a ministry of healing.</p>
               <p>For consider we the nature of a Sacrament in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, &amp; then pass on to a particular enumeration of the blessings of this, the most excellent. When God appointed the bow in the clouds to be a Sacrament, and the memorial of a promise, he made it our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, but his own sign:<note place="margin">Gen. 9.15.</note>

               <p>And because the Sacraments Evangelical be of the like kind of mystery with the Sacraments of old; from them we can understand, that even signs of secret graces, do exhibit as well as signifie: for besides that there is a natural analogy between the ablution of the body and the purification of the soul, between eating the holy bread and drinking the sacred calice, and a participation of the body and blood of Christ, it is also in the method of the divine oeconomy; to dispense the grace which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self signifies in a ceremony of his own institution; thus at the Unction of Kings, Priests and of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the sacred power was bestowed, and as a <hi>Canon is invested in his dignity by the tradition of a book,</hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98913:30"/>
operates only by the vertue of the spirit of God; so the spirit ordinarily works by the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of the Sacraments. And we may as well say, that faith is not by hearing, as that grace is not by the Sacraments, for as without the spirit, the word is but a dead letter, so with the spirit, the Sacrament is the means of life and grace: And the meditation of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> is very pious and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, <q>If we were wholly incorporeal, God would have given us graces unclothed with signs and Sacraments, but because our spirits are in earthen vessels, God conveyes his graces to us by sensible ministrations.</q>] The word of God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates as secretly as the Sacraments, and the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as powerfully as the word, nay the word is alwayes joyned in the worthy administration of the Sacrament, which therefore operates both as word and sign by the ear and by the eyes and by both in the hand of God, and the conduct of the spirit, effect all that God intends, and that a faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver can require and pray for.</p>
               <p>For justification and sanctification are continued acts: they are like the issues of a Fountain into its receptacles, God is alwayes giving, and we are alwayes receiving, and the signal effects of Gods holy spirit, sometimes give great indications, but most commonly come without observation, and therefore in these things we must not discourse as in the conduct of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>her causes and operations natural: for although in natural effects, we can argue from the cause to the event, yet in spiritual things we are to reckon only from the sign to the event. And the signs of grace we are to place in stead of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral causes, because a Sacrament in the hand of God, is a proclamation of his graces, he then gives us
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98913:30"/>
notice that the springs of heaven are opened: and then is the time to draw living waters from the fountains of salvation. When <hi>Jonathan</hi> shot his arrows beyond the boy, he then by a Sacrament sent salvation unto David; he bad him be gone and flie from his Fathers wrath; and although <hi>Jonathan</hi> did do his business for him by a continual care and observation, yet that symbol brought it unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid; for so are we conducted to the joyes of God by the methods and possibilities of men.</p>
               <p>In conclusion; the sum is this, The Sacraments and symbols if they be considered in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are just such as they seem, water, and bread, and wine; they retain the names proper to their own natures; but because they are made to be signs of a secret mystery; and water is the symbol of purification of the soul from sin, and bread and wine, of Christs body and blood; therefore the symbols and Sacraments receive the names of what themselves do sign; <note n="*" place="margin">

               <head>SECT. IV. The blessings and Graces of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament enumerated and proved par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</head>
               <p>IN the reception of the blessed Sacrament; there are many blessings which proceed from our own actions, the conjugations of moral duties, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of preparation and reception, the reverence and the devotion; of which I shall give account in the following Chapters; here I am to enumerate those graces which are intended to descend upon us from the spirit of God in the use of the Sacrament it self precisely.</p>
               <p>But first I consider that it must be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain that great spiritual blessings are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to the worthy receiving this Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; because it is not at all received but by a spiritual hand: for it is either to be understood in a carnal sense that Christs body is there eaten, or in a spiritual sense. If in a carnal, it profits no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If in a spiritual he be eaten, let the meaning of that be considered, and it will convince us that innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable blessings are in the very reception and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Now what the meaning of this spiritual eating is; I have already declared in this chapter,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98913:31"/>
and shall yet more fully explicate in the sequel.<note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3. Sect. 5.</note> In the Sacrament we do not receive Christ carnally; but we receive him spiritually; and that of it self is a conjugation of blessings and spiritual graces. The very understanding what we do, tells us also what we receive. But I descend to particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And first I reckon that the Sacrament is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to increase our faith: for although it is with us in this Holy Sacrament, as it was with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the Sacrament of circumcision; he had the grace of faith before he was circumcised; and received the Sacrament after he had the purpose and the grace; and we are to believe, before we receive these symbols of Christ death; yet as by loving we love more, and by the acts of patience we increase in the spirit of mortification; so by believing we believe more; and by publication <note n="*" rend="inter">Ante communicationem corporis Christi &amp; sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis, juxta Orientalium par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium morem, unanimiter clarâ voce sacratissimum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei recenseant Symbolum, ut primum populi quam credulitatem teneant, fate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antur.

               <p n="3">3. The blessed Sacrament is of great efficacy for the remission of sins; not that it hath any formal efficacy, or any inherent vertue to procure pardon, but that it is the ministery of the death of Christ and the application of his blood, which blood was shed for the remission of sins, and is the great means of impetration, and as the Schools use to speak, is the meritorious cause of it. For there are but two wayes of applying the death of Christ: an internal grace and an external mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. Faith is the inward applicatory, and if there be any outward at all, it must be the Sacraments; and both of them are of remarkable vertue in this particular; for by baptisme we are baptized into the death of Christ, and the Lords supper is an appointed enunciation and declaration of Christs death, and it is a Sacramental participation of it. Now to partake of it Sacramentally, is by Sacrament to receive it, that is, so to apply it to us, as that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98913:34"/>
can be applyed: it brings it to our spirit, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it to our faith, it represents it as the matter of Eucharist, it gives it as meat and drink to our souls, and rejoyces in it in that very formality in which it does receive it, viz, as broken for, as shed for the remission of our sins. Now then what can any man suppose a Sacrament to be, and what can be meant by sacramental participation? for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Sacraments do communicate what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to; they are no communion or communication at all; for it is true that our mouth eats the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial signs; but at the same time, faith eats too, and therefore must eat, that is, must partake of the thing signified; faith is not maintained by ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies: the body receives the body of the mystery; we eat and drink the symbols with our mouths, but faith is not corporeal, but feeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mystery it self; it entertains the grace, and enters into that secret which the spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyes under the signature. Now since the mystery is perfectly and openly expressed to be the remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins; if the soul does the work of the soul, as the body the work of the body, the soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives remission of sins, as the body does the symbols of it and the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But we must be infinitely careful to remember that even the death of Christ brings no pardon to the impenitent persevering sinner; but to him that repents truely, &amp; so does the Sacrament <note n="*" place="margin">Qui scel eratè vivunt in Ecclesiâ, &amp; communicare non desinunt putantes setali communione mundari, discant nihil ad emundationem proficere dicente prophetâ, quid est quod dilectus meus facit in domo meâ scelera multa? nunquid carnes sanctae auferent à te malitias tuas? <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.15. <hi>Isidor.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98913:34"/>
death; this can do no more than that: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no man come with his guilt about him, and in the heat and in the affections of his sin, and hope to find his pardon by this ministery. He that thinks so will but deceive, wil but ruine himself. They are excellent but very severe words, which God spake to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which are a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reproof of all unworthy Communicants in these divine mysteries, <hi>What hath my beloved to do in my house seeing she hath wrought l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The holy flesh hath passed from thee when thou doest evil,</hi> that is, this holy sacrifice, the flesh and blood of thy Lord shall slip from thee without doing thee any good, if thou hast not ceased from doing evil. But the vulgar Latin reads these words much more emphatically to our purpose, <hi>Shall the holy flesh take from thee thy wickedness in which thou rejoycest?</hi> Deceive not thy self; thou hast no part nor portion in this matter. For the holy Sacrament operates indeed and consigns our pardon, but not alone; but in conjunction with all that Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as conditions of pardon; but when the conditions are present, the Sacrament ministers pardon, as pardon is ministred in this world; that is, by parts, and in order to several purposes, and with power of revocation, by suspending the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath, by procuring more graces, by obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time of repentance; and powers and possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of working out our salvation; and by setting forward the method and Oeconomy of our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For in the usual methods of God, pardon of sins is proportionable to our repentance; which because it is all that state of Piety we have in this whole life after our first sin; pardon of sins is all that effect of grace which is consequent to that repentance; and the worthy receiving of the holy Communion,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98913:35"/>
is but one conjugation of holy actions and parts of repentance, but indeed it is the best and the noblest, and such in which man does best cooperate towards pardon, and the grace of God does the most illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously consign it. But of these particulars I shall give full account when I shall discourse of the preparations of repentance.</p>

               <p>This is a great and a mysterious truth, which as it is plainly manifested in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> so it is understood by the ancient and holy Doctors of the Church. So St.<hi>Ambrose.</hi> [Now Christ is offered, but he is offered as a man, as if he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his passion; but he offers himself as a Priest, that he may pardon our sins; here in image or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation, there in truth, as an Advocate inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding with his Father for us.] So St. <hi>Chrysostom;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98913:36"/>
In Christ once the Sacrifice was offered, which is powerful to our eternal salvation; but what then do we? do not we offer every day? what we daily offer is at the memorial of his death, and the Sacrifice is one, not many; because Christ was once offered: but this Sacrifice is the example or representation of that.</hi> And another: <hi>Christ is not impiously slain by us, but piously sacrificed; and by this means we declare the Lords death till he come: for here through him we humbly do in earth, which he as a son who is heard according to his reverence, does powerfully for us in heaven, where as an advocate he intercedes with his Father, whose office or work it is; for us to exhibit and interpose his flesh which he took of us and for us, and as it were to presse it upon his Father.</hi> To the same sense is the meditation of St. <hi>Austin: By this he is the Priest and the Oblation, the Sacrament of which he would have the daily Sacrifice of the Church to be; which because it is the body of that head, she learns from him to offer her self to God by him, who offered himself to God for her.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this whole Office is called by St. <hi>Basil,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the prayer of oblation, the great Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sacrifice and Oblation in which we present our prayers and the needs of our selves and of our brethren unto God in virtue of the great Sacrifice, Christ upon the Crosse, whose memorial we then celebrate in a divine manner, by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The effect of this I represent in the words of <hi>Lyra:</hi> [That which does purge and cleanse our sins must be celestial and spiritual, and that which is such hath a perpetual efficacy, and needs not to be done again; but that which is daily offered in the Church, is a daily commemoration of that one Sacrifice which was offered on the Crosse, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98913:37"/>
to the command of Christ, Do this in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration of me.]</p>
               <p>Now this holy Ministry and Sacrament of this death, being according to Christs commandment and in our manner a representation of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sacrifice, an imitation of Christs intercession in heaven in vertue of that Sacrifice, must be after the pattern in the Mount, it must be as that is, <hi>pur â prece,</hi> as <hi>Tertullians</hi> phrase, is by pure prayer; it is an intercession for the whole Church present and absent in the virtue of that Sacrifice. I need add no more, but leave it to the meditation, to the joy and admiration of all Christian people to think, and to enumerate the blessings of this Sacrament, which is so excellent a representation of Christs death, by Christs commandment; and so glorious an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that intercession which Christ makes in heaven for us all; it is all but the representment of his death, in the way of prayer and interpellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Christ as head, and we as members; he as High Priest, and we servants as his Ministers: and therefore I shall stop here, and leave the rest for wonder and Eucharist: we may pray here with all the solemnity and advantages imaginable; we may with hope and comfort use the words of <hi>David, I will take the cup of salvation,</hi>

On a sudden being initiated in the laws of Christ, and renewed by the Mysteries of Salvation, thou didst passe suddenly into the body of the Church not by seeing, but by believing, and from a son of perdition, thou hast obtained to be adopted a son of God by a secret purity: remaining in a visible measure, thou art invisibly made greater than thy self, without any increase of quantity, thou art the same thou wert, and yet very much another person in the progression of Faith, to the outward nothing is added, but the inward is wholly changed, and so a man is made the son of Christ, and Christ is formed in the mind of a man. As therefore suddenly without any bodily

               <p n="2">2. Let no man be lesse confident in his holy faith and persuasion concerning the great blessings and glorious effects which God designs to every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obedient soul in the communication of these Divine mysteries, by reason of any difference of judgement which is in the several Schools of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians concerning the effects and consequent bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of this Sacrament. For all men speak honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things of it, except wicked persons, and the scorners of Religion, and though of several per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons like the beholders of a dove walking in the sun, as they stand in several aspects and distances, some see red and others purple, and yet some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing but green, but all allow and love the beauties: so do the several forms of Christians, according as they are instructed by their first teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, or their own experience conducted by their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98913:41"/>
fancy and proper principles, look upon these glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mysteries some as vertually containing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of obedience, some as solemnities of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and records of blessings, some as the objective increasers of faith, others as the Sacramental parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations of Christ, others as the acts &amp; instruments of natural union, yet all affirm some great things or other of it, and by their differences confesse the immensity and the glory. For thus Manna repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to every man the taste that himself did like, but it had in its own potentiality all those tasts and dispositions eminently, and altogether, those feasters could speak of great and many excellencies, and all confessed it to be enough, and to be the food of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: so it is here, it is that to every mans faith, which his faith wisely apprehends; and though there are some who are of little faith, and such receive but a less proportion of nourishment, yet by the very use of this Sacrament the appetite will increase, and the apprehensions grow greater, and the faith will be more confident and instructed; and then we shall see more, and feel more. For this holy nutriment is not only food, but physick too, and although to him who believes great things of his Physitian, and of his medicine, it is apt to do the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; yet it will do its main work, even when we understand it not, and nothing can hinder it; but direct infidelity, or some of its foul and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ministers.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They who receive the blessed Sacrament must not suppose that the blessings of it, are effected as health is by physick, or warmth by the contact and neighbourhood of fire; but as musick one way affects the soul, and witty discourses another, and joyful tidings a way differing from both the former, so the operations of the Sacrament are produced by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98913:41"/>
an energy of a nature intirely differing from all things else; But however it is done, the thing that is done is this, no grace is there improved, but what we bring along with us: no increases but what we exercise; we must bring faith along with us, and God will increase our faith, we must come with charity, and we shall go away with more, we must come with truly penitential hearts, and to him that hath shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly: he shall be a better penitent: when he hath eaten the sacrifice that was slain for our sins, and died in the body, that we might live in the spirit and die no more. For he is the bread from heaven, he is the grain of wheat which falling into the earth, unless it dies it remains alone, but if it dies, it brings forth fruit and brings it forth abundantly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Although the words, the names, and sayings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Blessed Sacrament are mysterious and inexplicable, yet they do, nay, therefore weare sure they signifie some great thing, they are in the very expression beyond our understanding, &amp; therefore much more are the things themselves too high for us: but therefore we are taught three things. 1.

For though it be true, that faith comes by hearing; yet it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that by hearing alone faith is ingendred; for the faith of the Apostles came by seeing; and St. <hi>Pauls</hi> faith did not come by hearing; but by intuition and revelation; and <hi>hearing</hi> in those words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not signifie the manner of ministration;<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.1.</note> but the whole Oeconomie of the word of God, the whole office of preaching; which is done most usefully to babes and strangers by ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and homily, but more gloriously and illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to men, by Sacraments. But however, be it so or otherwise; yet one ordinance ought not to exclude the other, much less to disparage the other, and least of all to undervalue that which is the most eminent: but rather let every Christian man and woman think; that if the word mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by the spirit is so mightie, it must be more, when the word and the spirit joyn with the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is their proper significatorie. He that is zealous for the word of God does well; but let him remember, that the word of God is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ring and leads us into the circles of a blessed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but because the Sacrament is not without the word, they are a jewel encha'sd in gold when they are together.

Let no man in the reception of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in his expectation of blessings and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents from it, limit his hopes and belief to any one particular, for that will occasion a littleness of faith, and may make it curious, scrupulous and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tastical; rather let us adore the secret of God, and with simple expectations receive it; disposing our selves to all the effects that may come rather with fear and indefinite apprehensions, than with dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and confident limitations; for this may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get scruples and diminution of value; but that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders nothing, but advances the reverential treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and opinion.</p>

These are such events which God hath not made the effects of religion; but are the hopes and expectations of vain and superstitious people. and I remember that Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third in the Council of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran</hi> wrote to the Bishop of S. <hi>Agatha</hi> advice how to treat a woman who took the Holy Sacrament into her mouth, and ran with it to kiss her husband,<note place="margin">Concil.

He that watches for the effects and blessings of the Sacrament, must look for them in no other manner, than what is agreeable to the usual dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; we must not look for them by measures of nature and usual expectations: not that as soon as we have received the Symbols, we shall have our doubts answered; or be comforted in our spirit as soon as we have given thanks for the holy blood; or be satisfied in the inquiries of faith, as soon as the prayers of consecration and the whole ministery is ended; or prevail in our most passionate desires as soon as we rise from our knees; for we enter into the blessings of the Sacrament by prayer, and the exercise of proper graces; both which being spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual instruments of vertues, work after the manner of spiritual things; that is, not by any measure we have, but as God please; only that in the last e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of things, and when they are necessary, we shall find them there: Gods time is best, but we must not judge his manner by our measures, nor measure eternity by time, or the issues of the spirit, by a measuring line.

find thy faith as dead after the reception as it was before; it may be it is because thy faith was not only little, but reprovable: or thou didst not pray vehemently, or thou art indisposed by some secret disadvantage: or thou hast not done thy duty: and he shall imprudently accuse that physick for useless and unfit, that is not suffered to work by the incapacity, the ill-diet, the weak stomack, or some evil accident of the patient.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Let no man judge of himself or of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and efficacy of the Sacrament it self, or of the prosperity and acceptation of his service in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery by any sensible relish, by the gust and delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which he sometimes perceives, and other times does not perceive For these are fine accidents and given to some persons often, to others very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to all irregularly, as God please: and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are the effects of natural and accidental dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, and sometimes are illusions. But that no man may fall into inconvenience for want of them: we are to consider that the want of them proceeds from diverse causes. 1. It may be the palate of the Soul is indispos'd by listlesness or sorrow, anxiety or weariness. 2. It may be we are too much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merg'd in secular affairs and earthly affections. 3. Or we have been unthankfull to God when we have received some of these spiritual pleasures, and he therefore withdraws those pleasant entertainments. 4. Or it may be, we are therefore without relish and gust, because the Sacrament is too great for our weakness, like the bright Sun to a mortal eye; the object is too big for our perceptions, and our little faculties. 5. Sometimes God takes them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way least we be lifted up and made vain. 6. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the confirmation and exercise of our faith;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98913:45"/>
that we may live by faith and not by sense. 7. Or it may be that by this driness of spirit God intends to make us the more fervent and resign'd in our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and solemn devotions, by the perceiving of our wants and weakness, and in the infinite inability, and insufficiency of our selves. 8. Or else it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to us irremediably and inevitably, that we may perceive these accidents are not the fruits of our labour, but gifts of God, dispensed wholly by the measures of his own choice. 9. The want of just and severe dispositions to the Holy Sacrament may possibly occasion this uncomfortableness. 10. Or we do not relish the Divine Nutriment now, so as at other times, for want of spiritual mastication, that is, because we have not considered deeply, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated wisely and holily. 11. Or there is in us too much self-love and delight in, and adherence to the comforts we find in other objects. 12. Or we are carelesse of little sins, and give too much way to the dayly incursions of the smaller irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of our lives. If upon the occasion of the want of these sensible comforts and delightful relishes, we examine the causes of the want, and suspect our selves in these things, where our own faults may be the causes, and there make amends; or if we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our selves in those particulars where the causes may relate to God, we shall do well, and receive profit. But unlesse our own sin be the cause of it, we are not to make any evil judgment of our selves by reason of any such defect; much lesse diminish our great value of the blessings consequent to a worthy communion.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But because the pardon of sins is intended to be the great effect of a worthy Communion, and of this men are most solicitous, and for this they
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98913:45"/>
pray passionately, and labour earnestly, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all their lives, and it may be in the day of their death have uncertain souls; and therefore of this men are most desirous to be satisfied, if they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend themselves in danger, that is, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their sin, and be truly penitent; although this effect seems to be least discernable, and to be a secret reserved for the publication and trumpet of the Arch-Angel at the day of Doom; yet in this we can best be satisfied. For because when our sins are unpardoned, we are under the wrath of God to be expressed as he pleases, and in the method of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death; now if God intends not to pardon us, he will not bless the means of pardon; if we shall not return to his final pardon, we shall not passe through the intermedial; if he will never give us glory, he will never give us the increase of grace. If therefore we repent of our sins, and pray for pardon: if we confess them and forsake them: if we fear God and love him: if we find that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to please him do increase, that we are more watchful against sin, and hate it more: that we are thirsty after righteousnesse: if we find that we increase in duty, then we may look upon the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the holy Sacramental Symbols as a direct consignation of pardon: not that it is them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated; for it is a work of time, it is as long in doing as repentance is in perfecting, it is the effect of that, depending on its cause in a perpetual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but it is then working, and if we go on in duty, God will proceed to finish the methods of his grace, and snatch us from eternal death which we have deserved, and bring us unto glory. And this he is pleased by the Sacramental all the way to consigne: God speaks not more articulately in any
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98913:46"/>
voice from Heaven than in such real indications of his love and favour.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Lastly, since the Sacrament is the great so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of prayer, and imitation of Christs inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in Heaven; let us here be both charitable and religious in our prayers; interceding for all states of men and women in the Christan Church; and representing to God all the needs of our selves and of our Relatives. For then we pray with all the advantages of the spirit, when we pray in the faith of Christ crucified, in the love of God and of our neighbour, in the advantages of solemn piety, in the communion of Saints, in the imitation of Christs intercession, and in the union with Christ himself Spiritual and Sacramental; and to such prayers as these nothing can be added, but that which will certainly come, that is, a blessed hearing and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious answer.</p>

               <head>SECT. I. Of Examination of our selves in order to the Holy Communion.</head>
               <p>THere is no duty in Christianity that is partly solemn and partly moral, that hath in it more solemnity and more morality than this one duty; and in the greatest declension of Religion, still men have fear when they come to receive this holy Sacrament. They that have no Religion will fear when they come to die; and they who have but a little, will fear when they come to communicate. But although men who believe this to be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est secret and sacrednesse of our Religion, do more in their addresses to this than to any thing else, yet many of them that do come, consider that they are only commanded to examine themselves; and <hi>that</hi> according to the ordinary methods is easily done. It is nothing but asking our selves a few questions: Do I believe? Do I repent? and am I in charity? To these the answers are ready enough; I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Christ gave his body and blood for me, as for all mankind; and that Christ is mystically pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Sacrament: I have been taught so all my life, and I have no reason to doubt it. 2. I do also repent according to the measures I am taught: I am sorry I have sinned, I wish I had not done it;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98913:50"/>
and I promise to do so no more: and this I do constantly before every Communion; and before the next comes I have reason enough to renew my vows; I was never so good as my word yet, but now I will. 3. I am also in charity with all the World; and against this good time, I pray to God to forgive them; for I do. This is the usual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of Consciences; to which we add a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting day, and on that we may say more prayers than usual; and read some good discourses of the Sacrament; and then we are dressed like the friends of the Bridegroom, and with confidence come to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb. But this exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, hath it self need to be examined. <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> laboured a hundred years together in making the Ark that he and a few more might be saved: and can we think in an hour to prepare our souls for the entertainment of him that made all the World? This will very hardly be done. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our duty of preparation is contained in this one word, of [<hi>Try,</hi> or <hi>Examine</hi>] it being after the manner of mysteries, mysteriously and secretly described, yet there is great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there is in it very much duty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we search into the secret of the word, and to what purposes it is used in the New-Testament.</p>

               <p>EVery one that comes to the holy Sacrament must have earnest affections and desires towards God and Religion, and particularly toward these Divine mysteries, and therefore he must examine accordingly whether or no he be willing and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately desirous to do all his duty? His saying that he is so, I do not suppose to be a sufficient satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to a serious inquiry, unless he really feels himself to be so. For we find that all men pretend that they have earnest desires to be saved; and very many espying the beauties of wisdom, the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of chastity, the health of temperance, the peace of meek persons, and the reputation an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they consider not, that it is the splendor, not the vertue; the reputation, not the usefulness; the reward, and not the duty that they are in love withal: our desires of holiness are too often like our desires of being cut of the stone, or suffering causticks or cupping-glasses, an unwilling willingness, a hard and a fatal necessity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore something of a consequent choice; since it can
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98913:53"/>
be no better, it must be no worse: but this can never make our duty pleasant, we can never be heartily reconciled to the things of God as long as we feel smart and pain in the ministeries of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: we <hi>suffer</hi> Religion, and <hi>endure</hi> the laws of God, but we <hi>love</hi> them not. He that comes to God whether he will or no, confesses the greatness of God and the demonstrations of Religion, but sees no amability and comeliness in it; and shall find as little of the reward.</p>
               <p>It is true that force and fear may bring us in to God; and <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom</hi>; and Christ said, <hi>compel them to enter,</hi> and our natural needs, or our superinduced calamities may force us to run to God, and affright us into Religion as into a Sanctuary: but then if we enter at this door we must examine whether we be taken with the beauties of the interior house: does fear make us look, and does looking make us like? if holy desires, and love be not in the beginning or the progression, we shall do the work of grace pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and our preparations coldly, and our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions distractedly, and receive the Sacraments without effect.</p>
               <p>Now concerning our desires, we shall best judge of them by the proper effects and significations of desire.</p>

They that are easily diverted from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating and apt to be excused from the solemnity, these men have just cause to suspect their desires to be too cold to kindle the fires upon this altar, and to consume this sacrifice, they have not love, and come against their will, some men are hindred by

every thing; if a stranger come to the house, if they be indisposed with a littlehead ach, if they have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the world, if a neighbour be angry with them, if a merry meeting be appointed the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; this is a suspicious indifferency and lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. They that are not desirous to use all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and to take all advantages, and long for all the benefits, want very much of that hunger and thirst after the righteousness of God which is fulfilled in those mysteries, and to which Christ hath promised such ample satisfaction. I do not say that every man is bound to communicate every time that he can have it, and that it is lukewarmness not to desire it so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as it is in our power, but he that refuses it, when it is in his opportunity, when his circumstances are fitted, when by the measures of piety and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it is decent and useful to him to do it, (of which I shall afterwards give account) that man is guilty of a criminal indifference, and when he does come, may fear that he hath not spiritual hunger enough for so divine a banquet.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They that in their preparation take the least measures that are practised or allowed, and rest there and increase not, have neither value for the Sacrament, nor desires of the blessing, nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of any fruit; and therefore cannot have this holy appetite in due proportion, because they see no sufficient moving cause; and they look for little, and finde less, and therefore can never be true desirers: For he that thinks there is no great matter in it, will have no great stomach for it; and he that will do no great matter for it, certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects no great excellency in it: and such are all they that take the least measures of preparation, who therefore shall find the least measures of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98913:55"/>
and in spiritual things that which is called <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively</hi> the least, is just none at all; he that <hi>shall be called least in the kingdom,</hi> shall be quite shut out. This is an indifferency both in the cause and in the effect: They feel no great blessings consequent to their reception, and therefore their aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="5">5. They only can be confident that their desires are right, who feel sharpnesses and zeal in their acts of love. For in spiritual things every abatement is by the mixture of the contrary; and therefore when things are ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fferent, we cannot tell which shall be accepted or accounted of; and when there is as much evil as good, the evil is only abated, but the good is destroyed, and is not accepted: and therefore till the victory be clear and evident, we cannot have much comfort; but the strong desire is only certain and comfortable to the spirit. Great desires are a great pain; and the <hi>Spouse</hi> in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> complains that she is <hi>sick of love,</hi> and then calls upon Christ to <hi>comfort her with flaggons</hi> of wine. Lesse desires than the greatest, if they be real and effective of the work, are fit for such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons as are not the greatest in Religion: but in all spiritual progressions we are sure that our desires shall never cease growing, till they be full of God, and are swell'd up to immensity; and till they come to some greatnesse, that they are like hunger and thirst, or like the breasts of a fruitful Nurse, full and in pain till they be eased, we cannot be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that things are well with us in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Are we in trouble till we converse with our Lord in all the ways of spiritual entercourse? Do we rejoyce when a Communion day comes? And
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98913:55"/>
is our joy fixed upon consideration of that holy necessity of doing good works at that time especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and receiving the aids of Grace, and the helps of the Sacrament liberally? When it is thus, it is well; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> we can be sure of: All measures of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire which are so little, that we can compare them to no natural similitude of earnestnesse and appetite, we can only say that they are yet very uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and if we come often and pray that we may have lively relish and appetite to the Mysteries, it may be well in time; but as yet we cannot be sure that it is so.</p>
                  <p>There is only in this case one help to our exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and our confidence: He that comes because God commands him, in a direct and certain obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the words of Christ, or in a deep sorrow for his sins, coming hither in hopes of remedy; or in a great apprehension of his infirmity, addressing himself hither for support and strength; this man, although he feels no sensual punctures and natural sharpnesses of desire, yet he comes well, and upon a right principle: For <hi>St. Austin</hi> reckoning what predisposition is necessary by way of preparation to the holy Sacrament, reckons <hi>hunger, and the sense of our sins and our infirmities</hi>; but if he wants the pleasure of these passionate indications, he must be careful that he be sure in the intellectual and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious choice; for that is the thing which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be signified by all the exterior passions: but when he hath no sign, he must be the more careful he have the thing signified, and then all is right again.</p>
                  <p>But happy is that soul which comes to these springs of salvation as the Hart to the water

brooks, panting and thirsty, longing and passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, weary of sin, and hating vanity, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the heart and hands to Christ; and this we are taught by the same Mystery represented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der other Sacraments; the waters of the spiritual Rock of which our fathers drank in the wilderness; the Rock was Christ, and those waters were his blood in Sacrament: and with the same appetite they drank those Sacramental waters withal, we are to receive these divine Mysteries Evangelical.</p>
                  <p>Now let us by the aids of memory and fancy consider the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the wildernesse, in a barren and dry land where no water was, marching in dust and fire, not wet with the dew of heaven, wholly without moisture save only what dropt from their own brows: the air was fire, and the vermin was fire; the flying serpents were of the same cognation with the firmament, their sting was a flame, their venome was a fever, and the fever a calenture, and their whole state of abode and travel was a little image of the day of judgment, when the elements shall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent heat: These men like Salamanders walking in fire, dry with heat, and scorched with thirst, and made yet more thirsty by calling upon God for water; suppose, I say, these thirsty souls hearing <hi>Moses</hi> to promise that he will smite the Rock, and that a River should break forth from thence; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve how presently they ran to the foot of the springing stone, thrusting forth their heads and tongues to meet the water, impatient of delay, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out that the water did not move like light, all at once: and then suppose the pleasure of their drink, the unsatiableness of their desire, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensity of their appetite; they took in as much as
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98913:56"/>
they could, and they desired much more. This was their Sacrament of the same Mystery, and this was their manner of receiving it; and this teaches us to come to the same Christ with the same desires: For if that water was a type of our Sacrament, or a Sacrament of the same secret blessing, then that thirst is a signification of our duty, that we come to receive Christ in all the ways of reception with longing appetites, preferring him before all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests in the world, as birds do corn above jewels, or hungry men meat before long orations.</p>

this, we can never be sure but by the event of things, and the heart being deceitful above all things, we secretly love what we professe to hate, we deny our lovers, and desire they should still press us, we command away the sin from our presence, for which we dy if it stayes away; therefore while we are in this prepartaory duty of examination, the best sign whereby we can reasonably suppose all affection to sin to be gone away, is if we really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we shall never any more commit that sin to which we are most tempted, and most inclined, and by which we most frequently fall. Here is a copious matter for examination.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When thou doest examine thy self, thou canst not but remember how often thou hast sinned by wantonnesse, perhaps, or by intemperance; but now thou sayest thou wilt do so no more. If thou hadst never said so and failed, it might have been likely enough; but the Sun does not rise and set so often as thou hast sinned and broken all thy holy vows: and thy resolution to put away thy sin is but like <hi>Amnon</hi> thrusting out his sister after he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed her and was weary: Sin looks ugly after it hath been handled; and thou having lost thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and thy peace for nothing but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of shame and indignation, thou art vexed, peevish, and unsatisfied, and then thou resolvest thou wilt sin no more. But thou wilt find this to be no <hi>great matter,</hi> but a <hi>great deception</hi>; for thou only desirest it not, because for the present the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is gone; thou hast no fondness for it, because the pleasure is gone; and like him who having scratched the skin till the blood comes, to satisfie a disease of pleasure and uncleannesse, feeling the smart thou resolvest to scratch no more.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:98913:60"/>3. But consider I pray and examine better; is the disease cured because the skin is broken? will the appetite return no more? and canst not thou again be tempted? is it not likely that the sin will look prettily, and talk flattering words, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thee with softnesses and easie fallacies? and wilt not thou then lay thy foolish head upon the lap of the Philistian damsel, and sleep till thy locks be cut, and all thy strength is gone? wilt not thou forget thy shame and thy repentance, thy sick stomach and thy aking-head, thy troubled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science and thy holy vows, when thy friend calls thee to go and sin with him, to walk aside with him into the regions of foolish mirth and an unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved death? Place thy self by consideration and imaginative representment in the circumstances of thy former temptation; and consider when thou canst be made to desire, and art invited to desire, and naturally doest desire, can thy resolution hold out against such a battery:</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In order to this; examine whether there be in thee any good principle stronger than all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and flatteries of thy sin? but above all things, examine whether there be not in thee this principle, <hi>that if thou dost sin again in great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that thou wilt and mayest repent again?</hi> Take heed of that: for it is certain, no man lives in the regions of temptation, to whom sin can seem plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, but he will fall when the temptation comes strongly, if he have this principle within him, that though he do commit that sin, he may and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: for then sin hath got a Paranymph and a sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor, a warrant and an advocate; if you think that you can so order it, that you shall be as sure of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98913:61"/>
heaven, though you do this sin as though you do it not, you can have no security; your resolutions are but glass; they may look like diamonds to an undescerning eye, but they will last no longer then till the next rude temptation falls upon them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Examine yet further: is your case so, that you have no reserves of cases in which your sin shall prevail? you resolve to leave the partner of your follies, and you go from her lest you be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? It is well; it is very well: but is not your heart false as water; and if you should see her again, do you not perceive that your resolution hath brought you to a little shame, because it will upbraid thy falshood and inconstancy? you resolve against all intemperate anger, and you deny the importunity of many trifling occurrencies: but consider; if you be provoked, and if you be despised, can your flesh and blood endure it then? It may be <hi>Calpurnius</hi> or <hi>Tocca</hi> shall not perswade thee to go to the baths of <hi>Lucrinus</hi>; but if <hi>Mecoenas</hi> calls thee, or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul desires thy company, thou canst resist no longer. Thou didst play the fool with poor <hi>Calenia,</hi> and thou art troubled at thy folly; and art ashamed when thou doest remember how often thou wentest into the <hi>Summoenium</hi> and peeped into the titles of those unhappy women whose bodies were the price of a Roman penny: but art thou so severe and chast that thou wilt die rather than serve the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious lust of <hi>Julia?</hi> or wilt thou never be scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the flames of <hi>Corinna's</hi> beauty? It is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to despise a cheap sin and a common tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but art thou strong enough to overcome the strongest argument that thy sin hath? Examine thy self here wisely and severely. It is not thy part saying, I will sin no more. He that hath new
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98913:61"/>
dined can easily resolve to fast at night: but when thou art hungry, and invited, and there is rare meat on the table, and thy company stayes for thee and importunes thee, canst thou then go on with thy fasting day? if thou canst, it is as it should be: but let not thy resolution be judged by short say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but first by great considerations, and then by proportionable events. If neither the biggest temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, nor thy trifling hopes, nor thy foolish prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nor weak propositions can betray thee, then thou mayest with reason say that you have no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection so strong as the love of God, no passion so great as thy repentance, no pleasure equal to that of an holy conscience, and then thou mayest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably believe that there is in thee no affection to sin remaining. But something more is to be added.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In the examination of this particular; take no accounts of your self by the present circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and by your thoughts and resolutions in the dayes of Religion and solemnity: but examine how it is with you in the dayes of ordinary conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in the circumstances of secular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For it is with us in our preparations to the holy Communion, as it is with women that sit to have their pictures drawn: they make themselves brave and adorned and put on circumstances of beauty to represent themselves to their friends and to their posterity with all the advantages of art and dressing. But he that loves his friends picture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is like her, and desires to see in image what he had in dayly conversation, would willingly see her in picture as hee sees her every day; and that is most like her, not which resembles her in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and by the sophistrie of dressing, but as she looked when she went about in the government of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98913:62"/>
her family. So must we look upon our selves in the dresses of every day in the week; and not take accounts of our selves as we trick up our souls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a communion day. For he that puts on fine cloaths for one day or two, must not suppose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be that Prince which he only personates. We dresse our selves upon a day of Religion; and then we cannot endure to think of sin; and if we do we sigh, and when we sigh, we pray, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that if we might die upon that day, it would be a good dayes work; for we could not die in a better time. But let us not deceive our selves. That is our picture that is like us every day in the week: and if you are as just in your buying and selling, as you are when you are saying your pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; if you are as chast in your conversation, as you are in your religious retirement; if your temperance be the same every day, as it is in your thoughts upon a fasting day; if you wear the same habits of virtue every day in the week, as you put on upon a Communion day, you have more reason to think your selves prepared, than by all the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> piety and solemn Religion that rises at the sound of a Bell, and keeps her time by the Calendar of the Church, more than by the laws of God.</p>
                  <p>This is not so to be understood as if it were not fit that against a solemn time and against a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion day, our souls should be more adorned, and our lamps better dressed, and our lights snuffed, and our Religion more active, and the habits of grace should exercise more acts: But this is meant only; that though the acts of virtue are not so frequent on ordinary dayes, yet there must be no act of vice upon them at all; and the habits of grace must be the same, and the inclinations
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98913:62"/>
regular, and the disposition ready, and the desires prest: and you shall better know the estate of your soul by examining how you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with your Merchant, than by considering how cautiously you converse with your Priest. He that talks to a Prince will talk as wisely as he can, but if you will know what the man is, inquire after him in his house, and how he is with all his relations. For no man stands upon his Guard alwayes, as he does sometimes. If therefore, upon examining you would understand what you are, examine your self; not by your cloaths, but by your body; not by the extraordinaries of a solemn religion, but by the ordinaries of a daily conversation.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="signs">
                  <head>These are the best Signs I can tell of; but they are to be made use of, with the following cautions.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. Although in trying whether your resolutions are likely to hold, and your affections to sin are gone, you must not rely upon words, but place your self in the scene and circumstances of your temptation, and try whether you be likely to hold out when sin comes with all the offers of advantage; yet be carefull that this examination of your own strength against temptation become not a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you, and this is especially to be attended to in the matter of lust and fear.</p>
                  <p>For the very imaginations of a lustfull object are of themselves a direct temptation; and he that dresses his fancie with remembrances of this vanitie, opens a door to let the sin in. <hi>Murenia's</hi> little boy being afraid of the wolf at the door, opened the door to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98913:63"/>
see if he were gone, and let the beast in: and since the fancy is the proper scene of lust, he that brings the temptation there, brings it where it can best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Therefore in our examination concerning this evil, and whether we be likely to stand in this war, we are to examine our selves only, whether we are perfectly resolved to fly and not to fight, that is, whether we will secure our selves by the proper arts of the spirit of prudence: for if any thing can make us come neer this Devil, we are lost without remedy.</p>
                  <p>The temptations in the matter of fear are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, if you will examine whether you love God so well that you would dye for him, inquire as well and wisely as you can, but be not too particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Satisfie your self with a general answer, and rest in this, if you finde that the apprehension of death is not so great as the apprehension of sin; if you pray against fear, and heap up arguments to confirm your courage and your hope, if you finde that you despise those instances of persecution that you meet with; for the rest, believe in God, who it may be will not give strengths before you need them; and therefore be satisfied with thus much, that your present strength is sufficient for any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent trial; and when a greater comes, God hath promised to give you more strength when you shall have need of more. But examine your self by what is likely to fall upon you actually. It may be you have cause to fear that you shall be made poor for a good conscience, or imprisoned for your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or banished for religion, consider if you love God so well that you are likely to suffer that, which is likely to happen to you; but do not dress your examination with rare contingencies and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98913:63"/>
accidents, and impossible cases. Do not ask your self whether you would endure the rack for God, or the application of burning Basons to your eyes, or the torment of a slow fire, or whether you had rather go to hell than commit a sin; this is too phantastick a trial; and when God (it may be) knowing your weakness, will never put you to it really, do not you tempt your self by fancy, and an afflictive representment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Domitian</hi> was a cruel man, false and bloody; and to be neer him was a perpetual danger: enough to try the constancy of the bravest <hi>Roman.</hi> But once that he might be wanton in his cruelty; he invited the chiefest of the <hi>Patricii</hi> to Supper; who coming in obedience and fear enough, entred into a Court all hanged with blacks, and from thence were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted into dining rooms by the <hi>Pollinctors,</hi> who used to dress the bodies unto Funerals: the lights of heaven (we may suppose) were quite shut out by the approaching night and arts of obscurity; when they were in those charnel houses (for so they seemed) every one was placed in order, a black Pillar or Coffin set by him, and in it a dim taper besmeared with brimstone that it might burn faint, and blew, and solemn; where when they had stood a while like designed sacrifices, or as if the Prince were sending them on solemn Embassie to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Prince of Darkness; on a sudden entred so many naked Black-Moors, or Children besmear'd with the horrid juice of the <hi>sepia,</hi> who having dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a little in phantastick and Devils postures, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired a while, and then returned serving up a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet as at solemn funerals; and Wine brought to them in Urnes instead of Goblets; with deepest silence, now and then interrupted with fearful
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98913:64"/>
groans and shriekings. Here the Senators, who possibly could have strugled with the abstracted thoughts of death, seeing it dressed in all the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful imagerie and Ceremonies of the grave; had no powers of Philosophy or Roman courage; but falling into a <hi>lipothymie</hi> or deep swooning, made up this pageantry of death with a representing of it unto the life. This scene of sorrows was over-acted, and it was a witty cruelty to kill a wise man, by making him too imaginative and phantastical. It is not good to break a staffe by too much trying the strength of it, or to undo a mans soul by a useless and so phantastick a temptation. For he that tries himself further than he hath need of, is like <hi>Palae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> shepherd, who fearing the foot-bridge was not strong enough to try it, loaded it so long, till by his unequal trial he broke that which would have born a bigger burden than he had to carry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it. <hi>Some things will better suffer a long usage, than an unequal trial.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When any man hath by the former measures examined himself, how his affections do stand to sin and folly, by whatsoever signs he is usually made confident; let him be sure to make abatements of his confidence, if he have found that he hath failed already in despight of all his Arts, and all his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. If we have often fallen back from our reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, there is then no sign left for us but the thing signified: nothing can tell us how our affections are, but by observing what they do. For he that hath broken his word with me, when it was in his power to keep it; hath destroyed my confidence in him: but if he hath deceived me twice or thrice in the same thing; for shame and prudence sake I will venture no more, if I can be disobliged. If we
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98913:64"/>
therefore have fail'd of our promises to God so many times, that we can speak nothing reasonably of our proceedings, nor imagine what thoughts God hath concerning us, but the hardest and the worst; though we have great reason to rejoyce in Gods long suffering and infinite patience, yet by any signs which can be given we have no reason to trust our selves.</p>

                     </gap>or if we shall now examine; we can tell no more than we could do before, we were alwayes deceived in our conjectures and pretences; and it is more likely now; because sin hath so long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; and by our frequent relapses we must at least learn this truth, that our hearts are false, and our promises are not to be trusted. In this case, no testimony is credible but an eye witnesse. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us leave all artificial examinations and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our selves to the solid and material practices of a religious life. We must do something really, before we can by inquiring tell how it is with us. When we have resolved, and in some measure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our resolution; when we have stood the shock of a temptation and found our heart firm as in a day of religion; when we perceive sin to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and the kingdom of grace to grow in power; when we feel that all our holy vows are more than words, and that we are not the same easie fools, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes giving God good words but never perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them; but that now we have set our foot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemy, and are not infallibly carried away when our temptation comes; then we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further, and look after the former signes and indications of spiritual life, and the just measures of preparation. Till then let us not trouble our selves with the particulars of spiritual arts and the artificial

methods of religion; for things are not so well with us as we suppose.</p>

               <head>SECT. IV. Of Examination of our selves in the matter of our Prayers in order to a Holy Communion.</head>
               <p>THe Holy Sacrament is in its nature and design a solemn prayer, and the imitation of the intercession which our glorious High Priest conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually makes for us in heaven; and as it is our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,<note place="margin">See Chap. 1. Sect. 4. N. 4.</note> and contains our duty, it is nothing else but the solemnity and great oeconomy of prayer, for the whole, and for every member, and for all and every particular necessity of the Church; and all the whole conjugation of Offices, and union of hearts, and conjunction of Ministers, is nothing but the advantages, and solemnity, and sanctification of Prayer; and therefore in order to do this work <hi>in solemnity</hi> as we ought, it were fit that we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our selves how we do it in ordinary and daily offices.</p>
               <p>For since there are so many excellent promises made to Prayer, and that nothing more disposes us
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98913:65"/>
to receive the grace of the Sacraments, and the blessings of Communion, than holy Prayer; since Prayer can obtain every thing, it can open the windows of heaven, and shut the gates of hell; it can put a holy constraint upon God, and detain an Angel till he leave a blessing; it can open the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of rain, and soften the iron ribs of rocks, till they melt into tears and a flowing river: Prayer can unclasp the girdles of the North, saying to a Mountain of Ice, Be thou removed hence, and cast into the bottom of the Sea; it can arrest the Sun in the midst of his course, and send the swift winged winds upon our errand; and all those strange things, and secret decrees, and unrevealed transactions which are above the clouds, and far beyond the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the stars, shall combine in ministery and advantages for the praying man: It cannot be but we should feel less evil, and much more good than we do, if our Prayers were right. But the state of things is thus: It is an easie duty, and there are many promises, and we do it often, and yet we prevail but little. Is it not a strange thing, that our friends die round about us, and in every family some great evil often happens, and a Church shall suffer persecution for many years together without remedy, and a poor man groans under his oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, who is still prosperous, and we cannot rescue the life of a servant from his fatal grave; and still we pray, and do not change the course of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a single instance many times, whether the instance be of little or of great concernment: what is the matter? we patiently suffer our prayers to be rejected, and comfort our selves by saying, that it may be the thing is not fit for us, it is against the decree of God, or against our good, or to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied is better; and there is a secret order of thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:98913:66"/>
and events, to which a denial does better minister than a concession. This is very true, but not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways when we are denied; for it is not always in mercy, but in anger very often we are denied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our duty is ill performed: For if our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were right, the Providence of God would often find out ways to reconcile his great ends with our great desires; and we might be saved hereafter, and yet delivered here besides; and sometimes we should have heaven and prosperity too, and the crosse should be sweetned, and the days of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should for our sakes be shortned, and death would not come so hastily, and yet we should be preserved innocent in the midst of an evil generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though it waited for the periods and usual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of nature: Let us rectifie our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and try what the event will be; it is worth so much at least; but however, as to the present case, if we perform this duty pitifully and culpably, it is not to be expected we should communicate holily. The gradation and correspondencies of this holy ministry will demonstrate this truth.</p>
               <p>For what Christ did once upon the Crosse in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Sacrifice, that he always does in heaven by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual representment and intercession; what Christ does by his supream Priest-hood, that the Church doth by her ministerial; what he does in heaven, we do upon earth; what is performed at the right hand of God, is also represented and in one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner exhibited upon the holy Table of the Lord: and what is done on Altars upon solemn days, is done in our Closets in our daily offices; that is, God is invocated, and God is appeas'd, and God is reconciled, and God gives us blessings and the fruits of Christs passion in the vertue of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98913:66"/>
Lamb; that is, we believing and praying, are blessed and sanctified and saved through Jesus Christ. So that as we pray so we communicate: if we pray well, we may communicate well, else at no hand. Now in this, besides that we are to take account of our Prayers by all those measures of the Spirit which we have learned in the holy Scriptures, there are two great lines of duty by which we can well examine our selves in this particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our Prayers must be the work of our hearts, not of our lips; that is, that we heartily desire what we so carefully pray for: and God knows this is not very ordinary. For besides that we are not in love with the things of God, and have no worthy value for Religion, there are many things in our Prayer which we ask for, and do not know what to do with if we had them, and we do not feel any want of them, and we care not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have them or no. We ask for the Spirit of God, for Wisdom, and for a right Judgment in all things; and yet there are not many in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Assemblies who use to trouble themselves at all with judging concerning the Mysteries of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Men pray for humility, and yet at the same time think that all that which is indeed humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, is a pitiful poornesse of spirit, pusilanimity, and want of good breeding. We pray for contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a broken heart; and yet if we chance to be melancholy we long to be comforted, and think that the Lectures of the Crosse bring Death, and therefore are not the way of Eternal Life. We pray sometimes that God may be first and last in all our thoughts; and yet we conceive it no great matter whether he be or no; but we are sure that he is not, but the things of the world do take up the place of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98913:67"/>
God; and yet we hope to be saved for all that, and consequently are very indifferent concerning the return of that Prayer. We frequently call upon God for his grace, that we may never fall into sin; now in this, besides that we have no hopes to be heard, and think it impossible to arrive to a state of life in which we shall not commit sins, yet if we do sin, we know there is a remedy so ready, that we believe we are not much the worse if we do. Here are prayers enough, but where are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires all this while? We pray against covetousnesse, and pride, and gluttony; but nothing that we do but is either covetousnesse or pride; so that our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are terminated upon a word, not upon a thing. We do covetous actions, and speak proud words, and have high thoughts, and do not passionately desire to have affections contrary to them, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to such notions of the sin as we have entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are such as will do no real prejudice or mortification to the sin: and whatever our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are, yet it is certain our desires are so little, and so content with any thing of this nature, that for very many spiritual petitions we are indifferent whether they be granted or not.</p>
               <p>But if we are poor or persecuted, if we be in fear or danger, if we be heart-sick or afflicted with an uncertain soul, then we are true desirers of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and mercy; we long for health, and desire earnestly to be safe; our hearts are pinch'd with the desire, and the sharpnesse of the appetite is a pain; then we pray, and mind what we do. * He that is in fear of death, does not when he prays for life think upon his money and his sheep; the entring of a fair woman into the room does not bend his neck, and make him look off from the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98913:67"/>
Princes face of whom he sues for pardon. And if we had desires as strong as our needs, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions answerable to our duty, it were not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that a man should say his prayers and never think of what he speaks: but as our attention is, so is our desire, trifling and impertinent; it is frighted away like a bird, which fears as much when you come to give it meat, as if you came with a design of death.</p>
               <p>When therefore you are to give sentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Prayers, your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. If you will know how it is with you in the matter of your Prayers, examine whether or no the form of your Prayer be the rule of your life. Every Petition to God is a Precept to man; and when in your Litanies you pray to be delivered from malice and hypocrisie, from pride and envy, from fornication and every deadly sin; all this is but a line of duty, and tells us that we must never consent to an act of pride, or a thought of envy, to a temptation of uncleannesse, or the besmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and evil paintings of hypocrisie. * But we when we pray against a sin think we have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; and if we ask for a grace, suppose there is no more required. Now Prayer is an instrument of help, a procuring auxilliaries of God, that we may do our duty; and why should we ask for help, if we be not our selves bound to do the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98913:68"/>
thing? Look not therefore upon your prayers as a short method of ease and salvation, but as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual monition of duty; and by what we require of God, we see what he requires of us; and if you want a system or collective body of holy precepts, you need no more but your prayer book; and if you look upon them first as duties, then as prayers, that is things fit to be desired, and fit to be laboured for, your prayers will be much more usefull; not so often vain, nor so subject to illusion, not so desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of effect, or so failing of the promises. The prayers of a Christian must be like the devotions of the husbandman. God speed the plough, that is, labour and prayer together; a prayer to bless our labour. Thus then we must examine.</p>
               <p>Is desire the measure of our prayer? and is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the fruit of our desire? if so; then what we ask we shall receive as the gift of God and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our labour; but unless this be the state of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r prayer, we shall finde that the receiving of the Sacrament will be as ineffective because it will be as imperfect as our prayer. For prayer and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion differ but as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>little</hi> in the same kinde of duty. Communion is but a great, publick and solemn addresse and prayer to God through Jesus Christ: and if we be not faithful in a little we shall not be intrusted in a greater; he that does not pray holily and prosperously, can never communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate acceptably. This therefore must be severely and prudently examined.</p>
               <p>But let us remember this; that there is nothing fit to be presented to God but what is great and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; for nothing comes from him but what is great and best; and nothing should be returned to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98913:68"/>
him that is little and contemptible in its kinde. It is a mysterious elegancie that is in the Hebrew of the Old Testament;<note place="margin">Gen. 35.15.</note> when the Spirit of God would call any thing very great, or very excellent, he calls it [of the Lord]; so <hi>the affrightment of the Lord</hi>; that is, a great affrightment fell upon them; and the fearful fire that fell upon the shepherds and sheep of <hi>Job</hi> is called <hi>the fire of God</hi>:<note place="margin">Job 1.16.</note> and when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took the speare and water-pot from the head of <hi>Saul</hi> while he and his guards were sleeping, it is said, that <hi>the sleep of the Lord,</hi> that is, a very great sleep was fallen upon them. Thus we read of the <hi>flames of God,</hi> and a <hi>land of the darknesse of God,</hi> that is, vehement flames,<note place="margin">Cant. 8.6. Jerem.</note> and a land of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darknesse: and the reason is, because when God strikes, he strikes vehemently, so that it is a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: And on the other side, when he blesses he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses excellently; and therefore when <hi>Naomie</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Boaz,</hi> she said, <hi>Let him be blessed of the Lord,</hi> that is, according to the Hebrew manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let him be exceedingly blessed. In propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all this, whatsoever is offered to God should be of the best; it should be a devout Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a fervent, humble, passionate supplication. He that prays otherwise, must expect the curses and contempt of his lukewarmness, and will be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely unworthy to come to the holy Communion, whether they that come intend to present their Prayers to God in the union of Christs intercession, which is then solemnly imitated and represented. An indevout Prayer can never be joined with Christs Prayers. Fire will easily combine with fire, and flame marries flame; but a cold devotion and the fire of this Altar can never be friendly and unite in one pyramid to ascend together to the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98913:69"/>
regions of God and the Element of love. If it be a <hi>prayer of God,</hi> that is, fit to be intitled, fit to be presented unto him, it must be most vehement and holy. <hi>The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man,</hi> only can be confident to prevail; nothing else can ever be sanctified by a conjunction with this sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of prayer, which must be consumed by a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly fire. There is not indeed any greater indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our worthiness or unworthiness to receive the holy Communion than to examine and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the state of our daily prayer.</p>

               <head>SECT. V. Of preparatory examination of our selves in some other instances.</head>
               <p>HE that comes to the holy Communion must examine himself concerning his passions; whether that which usually transports him to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and shame, to sin and folly, be brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of grace, under the command of reason, under the Empire of the spirit. For the passions of the soul are the violences and storms of reason, neither reason nor grace can be heard to speak when they are loud; and in vain it is that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98913:69"/>
you tell a passionate person of the interests of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Religion. We see it in fools who have no allay of reason; their anger is rage, their jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie is madness, their desires are ravenous, their loves are troublesome and unseasonable, their hopes are groundless but ever confident, their fears are by chance, but alwayes without measure: and a fool when his belly is full may as soon be perswaded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temperate discourses, as he that is passionate, to be obedient to God and to the rules of his own felicity.</p>
               <p>A great fear and a constant vertue are seldom found in one man; and a coward is vertuous by chance, and so song as he is let alone; but unless the fear of God be greater than the fear of man, it is in the power of his enemy whether that man shall be happy or wise. And so it is in a great or easie anger; every man and every thing can put a peevish person out of his Religion. It cannot in these and all the like cases be well, unless by examining we find that our spirit is more meek, our passion easier overcome, and the paroxysms or fits return lesse frequently, and the symptomes be lesse malignant. In this instance we must be quick and severe; and begin betimes to take a course with these vermin and vipers of the soul. <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells, that when the witty flatterers of <hi>Cesar</hi> had observed that no frogs did breed in his Grandfathers <hi>Villa</hi> which was in the suburbs of Rome, they set themselves to invent a reason which should flatter the Prince, and boldly told abroad that when young <hi>Octavius</hi> was a childe he once in sport forbad them to make a noise, and for ever after they were silent and left those pools; ever since <hi>Octavius</hi> began to speak, they left off to make their noises and their
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98913:70"/>
dwellings there. If we suppresse our passions that make inarticulate noises in the soul, if betimes and in their infancie we make them silent, we shall find peace in all our dayes. But an old passion, an inveterate peevishness, an habitual impotency of lust and vile desires are like an old Lion; he will by no means be made tame and taught to eat the meat of peace and gentleness.</p>
               <p>If thy passion be lasting and violent, thou art in a state of evil: if it be sudden and frequent, transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and volatile, thou wilt often fall into sin; and though every passion be not a sin, yet every excess of passion is a diminution of reason and Religion; and when the acts are so frequent that none can number them, what effects they leave behind, and how much they disorder the state of grace, none can tell. Either therefore suffer no passion to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and govern you, or no examination can signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any thing. For <hi>no man can say that a very passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate man is a very good man</hi>; or how much he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God who playes the fool so frequently; nor how long God will love him who is at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his imperious passion,<note place="margin">Dolori si fraena re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseris nulla me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria non est maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</note> which gives him laws and can every day change his state from good to bad. It was well said of one; If you give the reines to grief, every thing that crosses thee can produce the biggest grief; and the causes of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions are as they are made within. He that checks at every word, and is jealous of every look, and disturb'd at every accident, and takes all things by the wrong handle, and reflects upon all distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, switches and spurs his passion, and strives to overtake sin and to be tied to infelicity: but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can secure our Religion, but binding our passions in chains, and doubling our guards upon

                  <p>Are your desires unreasonable, passionate, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and transporting?

                  <p n="2">2. He that comes to the Holy Communion must examine himself whether his lusts be mortified, or whether they be only changed. For many times we have a seeming peace when our open enemies are changed into false friends; and we think our selves holy persons because we are quit of carnal crimes, and yet in exchange for them, we are dying with spiritual. It is an easie thing to reprove a murderer, and to chide a foolish drunkard, to make a liar blush, and a thief to run away. But you may be secretly proud when no man shall dare to tell you so; and to have a secret envy and yet to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with the best and most religious persons. A little examination will serve your turn to know whether you have committed adultery, or be a swearer; but to know whether your intentions be holy, whether you love the praise of men more than the praise of God, whether religious or secular interest be the dearer, whether there be any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie or secret malice in your heart, hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of more secret consideration. Do not you sometimes secretly rejoyce in the diminution or disparagement of your brother? Do not you tell his sad and shameful story with some pleasure? Are you not quick in telling it, and willing enough it should be believed? Would you not fain have him
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98913:71"/>
lesse than your self; not so eminent, not so well esteemed, and therefore do not you love to tell a true story of him that is not so very much for his commendation?</p>
                  <p>These things must be examined, not that it can be thought that a man must be without fault when he comes, but that he must cherish none, he must leave none unexamined; he must discover as much as he can and crucifie all that he can discover. He that hath mortified his carnal appetite, and is proud of his conquest; or prayes often &amp; reproaches him that does not; and gives almes, and secretly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues him that cannot; or is of a right opinion, but curses him that is in the wrong; or leaves his ambitious pursuits and vain glorious purposes, but sits at home and is idle, is like a man who stands by a fire in a wide and a cold room; he scorches on one side and freezes on the other: whereas the habits of vertue are like a great mantle, and the man is warm and well all over. But it is an ill cure for the ague to fall into a feavour, or to be eased of sore eyes by a diversion of the rheum upon the lungs: and that soul that turns her back upon one sin and her face to another is (it may be) weary of the instance, but not of the iniquity: and rolling upon an uneasie bed of thorns, chooses only to be tormented in another part: but finding the same sense there because the part is informed by the same spirit, and no difference between the thorn in the side and the thorn in the hand, perceives her self miserable and incirled with calamity. But when from carnal crimes which bring shame, a man falls into spiritual crimes which most men let alone; from those sins which every thing can reprove to a secret venom and an undiscerned ulcer; a man may
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98913:72"/>
come to the Communion, and the holy man that Ministers cannot reject him; but he causes no joy before the Angels; and because he does not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine wisely and judge severely, he is discerned by God, and shall be judged, when to be <hi>judged,</hi> means all one with <hi>being condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we examine our selves in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the blessed Sacrament, we must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we do not limit our examination; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it to the time since our last receiving. For some persons who think themselves spiritual, usually exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how they have comported themselves since the last communion only, and accordingly make judgement upon themselves; and these men possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly may do well enough; if they be of the number of them of whom our blessed Saviour affirms, that they need no repentance, that is, no change of life, no inquiry but into the measures of progression. But there are but few who live at that rate, and they that do, it may be have not that confidence. But to them and all men else, it were safe advice, that the inquiry how they have lived since the last communion should be but one part of their exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because they who so limit their inquiries must needs suppose that till then all was well, and that they communicated worthily; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that all the whole work and Oeconomy of salvation was then performed; every one of which supposals hath an uncertain truth, but a very certain danger.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They who so limit their examination suppose that at every Communion they begin the world
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98913:72"/>
anew; whereas our future life is to be a progressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the old stock, and judgement is to be made of this that comes after by that which went before; and therefore these limited examinations must needs be of lesse use and purpose. True it is, that at every Communion we are to begin a new life; and so we ought every day; that is, we ought to be as zealous, and as penitent, and resolute and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, as if we never had begun before; we ought so to suspect the imperfection of what is past, that we are to look upon our selves but as new be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners; that by apprehending the same necessity we may have the same passion, the same fervour and holy fires. But in the matter of examining we must consider how much hath been pardoned, that we may examine how thankful we have been, and what returns we have made: we must observe all our usual failings, that we may now set our guards accordingly: we must remember in what weak part we were smitten, that we may still pray against it; and we must renew our sad remembrances that we may continue our sad repentances, and we must look upon our whole life that we may be truely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. He that only examines how it is with him since the last Communion, will think too well of himself if he spies his bills of accusation to be small, but every man will find cause enough to hide his face in the dust, and to come with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling when he views the sum total of his life, which certainly will appear to be full of shame and of dishonour.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are not to limit our examinations to the interval since the last Communion, because much of our present duty is relative to the first parts of our life. For all the former vows of obedience
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98913:73"/>
though we have broken them a thousand times, yet have still an obliging power; and there are many contingencies of our life which require peculiar usages and treatments of our selves, and there are many follies which we leave by degrees, and many obligations which are of continual duty; and it may be that our passion did once carry us to so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream to intollerable a violence; perhaps twenty years ago, that we are still to keep our fears and tremblings about us, lest the same principle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the same evil event. When <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> had won that glorious victory over the three <hi>Sabine</hi> Brothers, and entring gloriously into <hi>Rome</hi> espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his sister wetting his Laurel with her unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tears for the death of one of them whom she love with the honour of a wife and the passion of a lover; and being mad with rage and pride, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her sorrow allayd his joyes and glory, kill'd her with that sword by which her servant died: Sometimes passion makes a prodigious excursion and passes on to the greatest violence, and the most prodigious follies; and though it be usually so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by reason and Religion that such transvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are not frequent; yet one such act is an eternal testimony how weak we are, and how mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous a passion can be. It is a miracle of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that in the midst of all the rudenesses and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of the world, a man preserves his eyes, which every thing can extinguish and put out: and it is no lesse a miracle of grace, that in the midst so many dishonourable loves there are no more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid tragoedies: and so many brutish angers do not produce more cruel sudden murders; and that so much envy does not oftener break out into open hostilities; it is indeed a mighty grace that pares the nails of these wild beasts, and makes them more
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98913:73"/>
innocent in their effects, than they are in their nature; but still the principle remains: there is in us the same evil nature, and the same unruly passion, and therefore as there ought to be continual guards upon them, so there must be continual inquiries made concerning them; and every thing is to be examined, lest all be lost upon a sudden.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We must not limit our examination to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of the last Communion, because our first repentances must still proceed and must never be at an end. For no man was so pardoned at the last Communion but that he is still obliged to beg pardon for those sins he then repented of. He must always repent, &amp; always pray and never be at peace with the first sins of his youth; and the sorrows of the first day must be the duty of every day; and that examination must come into this account; and when we inquire after our own state we must not view the little finger, but the whole man. For in all the forrest the ape is the handsomest beast so long as he shewes nothing but his hand; but when the inquiring and envious beasts looked round about him, they quickly espied a foul deformity.</p>
                  <p>There are in the state of a mans soul some good proportions, and some well dayes, and some for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate periods, but he that is contented with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them alone, cares more to please himself than to please God, and thinks him to be happy whom man, not whom God approves. By this way twenty deceptions and impostures may abuse a man. See therefore what you are from head to foot, from the beginning to the end, from the first entry to your last progression; and although it be not necessary that we always actually consider all;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98913:74"/>
yet it will be necessary that we alwayes truly know it all, that our relative duties, and our imperfect actions, and our collateral obligations, and the direct measures of the increase of grace may be justly discerned and understood.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that examines himself and would make right judgement of his state and of his duty must not do it by single actions, but by states of life and habits of Religion. If we can say truly that neither prosperity nor adversity, neither crosse nor crown, imployment nor retirement, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offices nor houshold-cares do disorder us in our duty to God and our relations; that is, if we safely and wisely passed through, or converse in any one of these states of life, it is very likely that things are well with us. But the consideration of single actions will do but little. Some acts of charity, and many prayers, and the doing one noble action, or being once or twice very bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or the strugling with one danger, and the speaking for God in one contestation; these are excellent things, and good significations of life, but not alwayes of health and strength, not of a state of grace. Now because in the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion we are growing up to the measures of the fulness of Christ, we can no otherwise be fitted to it, but by the progressions and increase of a man, that is, by habits of grace and states and permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Religion; and therefore our examinations must be accordingly.</p>

               <head type="sub">Question. Whether Infants are to be admitted to the Holy Communion?</head>
               <p>WHether the holy Communion may be given to Infants, hath been a great question in the Church of God; which in this instance hath not been as in others, divided by parties and single persons, but by whole ages: for from some of the earliest ages of the Church,<note place="margin">St. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus lib. de lapsis.</note> down to the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, that is, for above six hundred years, the Church of God did give the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to newly baptized Infants. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts a miracle of an Infant, into whose mouth (when the parents had ignorantly and carelesly left the babe) the Gentile Priests had forced some of their Idol Sacrifice: But when the Minister of the Church came to pour into the mouth the Calice of our Lord, it resisted, and being over-powred grew sick, and fell into convulsions. By which narrative the practice of the Church of that age is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared. Of the matter of fact there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; but they went further.</p>
               <p>The Primitive Church did believe it necessary to the salvation of Infants: St. <hi>Austin</hi> believed that this Doctrine and practice descended from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98913:82"/>
that without both the Sacraments no person could come to life, or partake of the Kingdom of heaven; which when he had endeavoured to prove largely, he infers this conclusion: It is in vain to promise salvation and life eternal to little children,<note rend="inter">Si ergo, ut tot &amp; tanta Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vina testimonia concinunt, nec salus nec vita aeterna sine baptismo &amp; corpore &amp; sanguine Domini cuiquam expectanda sunt, frustra si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne his promittitur parvu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. lib. 1. de peccat. merit. &amp; remiss. cap. 20. &amp;c. 24. vide eundem de verbis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postoli ad Bonifac.

               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and some few others, are the only refusers and condemners of this ancient and Catholick practice: But upon their grounds they cannot reasonably deny it. 1. Because Infants are by them affirmed to be capable of the grace and benefits of the Eucharist: for to them who put no bar (as Infants put none) the Sacraments by their inherent virtue confer grace, and therefore parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly it is affirmed, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Franc. à victor. de Euchar. n.</hi> 75.</note> that if Infants did now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Eucharist, they should also receive grace with it: and therefore it is not unreasonable to give it to them, who therefore are capable of it, because it will do them benefit; and it is conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently (upon these grounds) uncharitable to deny it. For,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:98913:83"/>2. They allow the ground upon the supposition of which the Fathers did most reasonably proceed; and they only deny the conclusion. For by the words of Christ, it is, absolutely necessary <hi>to eat his flesh and drink his blood</hi>:<note place="margin">
                     <p>John 6.53.</p>
                     <p>John 3.5.</p>
                  </note> and if those words be understood of Sacramental manducation (in which interpretation both the ancients and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do consent) then it is absolutely necessary to communicate. For although there are other ways of <hi>eating his flesh and drinking of his blood,</hi> besides the Sacramental manducation, yet Christ in this place meant no other; and if of this he spake when he said [<hi>Without doing this we have no life in us,</hi>] then it will not be sufficient to baptize them, though it baptism they should receive the same grace as in the Eucharist; because abstracting from the benefit and grace of it, it is made necessary by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, and by the will of God it is become a means indispensibly necessary to salvation. It is necessary by a necessity of the <hi>means,</hi> and a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>precept.</hi> True it is, that in each of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments there is a proportion of the same effect, as I have already discoursed <note place="margin">Chap. 1. Sect. 3.</note>; yet this cannot les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the necessity that is upon them both; for so <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream was doubled, not to signifie divers events, but a double certainty; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though children even in baptism are partakers of the death of Christ, and are incorporated into and made partakers of his body; yet because Christ hath made one as necessary as the other, and both for several proportions of the same reason, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must either quit the Principle, or retain the consequent; for they have digged a ditch on both sides, and on either hand they are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to inconvenience. But it will be more material to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98913:83"/>
consider the question as it is in it self, and without relation to any Schools of learning. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is certain that in Scripture there is nothing which directly forbids the giving the Holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to Infants. For though we are commanded to examine, and so to eat; yet this precept is not of it self necessary, but by reason of an introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cause; just as they are commanded to believe and repent who are to be baptized; that is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that need it, and that can do it, they must: and Infants without examination can as well receive the effect of the Eucharist, as without repentance they can have the effect of Baptism. For if they be communicated, they and the whole Assembly do declare the Lords death; for that is done by vertue of the whole solemnity, and it is done by the conj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nct devotion of the whole Community; it is done by the Prayers and Offices of the Priest, and it is done by the action of every one that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates: it is done in Baptism; and yet they are baptized who cannot with their voices publish the Confession. Infants indeed cannot discern the Lords body, so neither can they discern truth from falshood, an Article of Faith from an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Doctrine; and yet to discern the one, is as much required as to discern the other: but in both the case is equal; for they must discern when they can confound or dishonour; but till they can do evil, they cannot be tied to do good. And it were hard to suppose the whole Church of God in her best and earliest times to have continued for above six hundred years in a practical error; it will not well become our modesty to judge them without further inquiry and greater evidence.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:98913:84"/>4. But as there is no prohibition of it, so no command for it. For as for the words of our blessed Lord recited by St. <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 6.53.</note> upon which the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did principally rely, they were spoken before the Institution of both the Sacraments, and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently relate to either; that is, indeed to them both, as they are the ministries of faith; but to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in themselves directly, or in any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, or for any other cause; for faith is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal that is there intended; for the whole analogy of the discourse drawn forth of its cloud and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, infers only the necessity of being Christs Disciples, of living the life of grace, of feeding in our hearts on Christ, of living in him, and by him, and for him, and to him; which is the work of faith,<note place="margin">See Chap. 1. Sect. 2. &amp; 3.</note> and believing in Christ, as faith signifies the being of Christs Disciple.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The thing it self then being left in the midst, and undetermined, it is in the power of the Church to give it or to deny it: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or in all things where Christ hath made no Law, the Church hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to do that which is most for the glory of God, and the edification of all Christian people. And therefore although the Primitive Church did confirm newly baptized persons, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate them; yet as with great reason she did change the time of <hi>Confirmation</hi> from their first Baptism, till they could give an account of their faith; so with equal authority, when she hath an equal reason, she may change and limit the time of ministring the Communion. The Church is tied to nothing but to the Laws of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the Laws of Reason, and the Laws of Charity. But that either of them is reasonable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98913:84"/>
may appear in the following considerations.</p>
               <p>For the Primitive Church had all this to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their practice: That the Sacraments of the Gospel are the great channels of the grace of God: * That this grace always descends upon them that do not hinder it, and therefore certainly to Infants; And some do expresly affirm it, and none can with certainty deny, but that Infants if they did receive Communion, should also in so doing receive the fruits of it: * That to Baptism there are many acts of predisposition required, as well as to the Communion; and yet the Church, who very well understands the obligation of these precepts, supposes to children to be obliged to those predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions to either Sacrament, but fits every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment to a capable subject: * That there is something done on Gods part, and something on ours; that what belongs to us, obliges us then when we can hear and understand, but not before; but that what is on Gods part is always ready to them that can receive it: * That Infants although they cannot alone come to Christ, yet the Church their Mother can bring them in her arms: * That they who are capable of the grace of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may also receive the sign; and therefore the same grace being conveyed to them in one Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, may also be imparted to them in the other: * That as they can be born again without their own consent, so they can be sed by the hands of others; and what begins without their own actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al choice, may be renewed without their own actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al desire: * and that therefore it may be feared lest, if upon the pretence of figurative speeches, allegories and allusions, and the injunction of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain dispositions, the holy Communion be denied
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98913:85"/>
them, a gap be opened upon equal pretences to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them Baptism. * That since the Jewish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants being circumcised, is used as an argument that they might be baptized their eating of the Paschal Lamb may also be a competent warrant to eat of that Sacrament, in which also, as in the other, the sacrificed Lamb is represented as offered and slain for them. Now The Church having such fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and prudential motives, and no prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is she shall use her power to the purposes of kindnesses and charity, she is not easily to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, lest without necessity we condemn all the Primitive Catholick Church, and all the Modern Churches of the East and South to this day; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since without all dispositions Infants are baptized; there is less reason why they may not be communicated, having already received some real dispositions towards this, even all the grace of the Sacrament of Baptism, which is certainly something towards the other: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, the refusing to communicate Infants entred into the Church, upon an unwarrantable ground. For though it was confessed that the Communion would do them benefit, yet it was denied to them then when the Doctrine of Transubstantiation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,<note place="margin">

                  </note> upon pretence lest by puking up the holy Symbols the Sacrament should be dishonoured; which indeed, though that Doctrine were true, were infinitely unreasonable; as supposing that Christ, who suffered his body to be broken upon the Cross that he might convey grace to them and us, would refuse to expose the symbols to the accidents of a childs stomach, and rather deny them that grace than endure that sight; who yet does daily suffer mice and mouldiness to do worse unto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98913:85"/>But on the other side, they that without interest and partiality deny to communicate Infants, can consider that Infants being in Baptism admitted to the Promises of the Gospel, and their portion in the Kingdom of Christ, can have upon them no necessity to be communicated. For by their first Sacrament they are drawn from their meer natural state, and lifted up to the adoption of Sons; and by the second Sacrament alone they can go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: * That although the first grace which is given in Baptism be given them as their first being, yet the second graces are given to us upon other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, even for well using the first free grace: * That in Baptism there were promises made, which are to be personally accepted and verified before any new grace can be Sacramentally imparted: * That it was necessity which gave them Baptism before their Reason; and that necessity heing ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, there can be no profit in proceeding upon the same method without the same reason: * That Baptism is the Sacrament of the new born, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the gate of the Church, the entry of the Kingdom, the birth of a Christian; but the holy Eucharist is the Sacrament of them that grow in grace, of them that are perfect in Christ Jesus: * And lastly, to him that lists to be contentious, we are to say as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>We have no such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, nor the Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these probabilities on both sides may both of them be heard, and both of them prevail in the sense of the former determination: For by the first it may appear that to communicate Infants is lawful; but the second proves that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary: for having in baptism received sufficient

title to the Kingdom of Heaven, they who before the use of reason cannot sin and cannot fall from the grace they have received, cannot be obliged to the use of that Sacrament which is for their reparation and security: and therefore in this case the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent practice of the Church is to be our rule and measure of peace, and determination of the Article.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. Whether Innocents, Fools, and Mad-men may be admitted to the Holy Communion?</head>
               <p>TO this I answer, That if fools can desire it, and can be kept innocent, the Church did never deny it to them; but unless they be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of love and obedience in some degree, they must in no case be admitted. A vicious fool is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable; and he that knows nothing of it, nor can be taught any thing, must be permitted to the mercies of God and the prayers of the Church; but he that is not capable of Laws, can be no part of a Society, and therefore hath nothing to do with Communion. If he can but learn so much that it is good for his soul, if he can desire to go to God, and if he can in any degree believe in Christ, he will be judged according to what he hath, and not according to what he hath not; but if he cannot discern between good and evil, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ndifferently
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98913:86"/>
likes and does one and the other, though mercy is to be hoped for him in the last account, yet because he does that which is materially evil, and cannot discern what is spiritually good, he must not be admitted so much as to the Symbols of the divine Mysteries.</p>
               <p>But concerning <hi>Mad men</hi> the case is otherwise; and therefore I am to answer with a distinction. If from a state of sin and debauchery they entred into their madness, their case is sad and infinitely to be deplored; but their debt-books are sealed up, they are like dead men, until they be restored to reason they cannot be restored to grace, and therefore not admitted to the Sacrament. But if they were men of a good life, they may in their intervals, that is, when they can desire it, and when they will not use the Sacrament irreverently, be communicated. For the seed of God abides within them, and no accident of nature can destroy the work of God, and the impresses of the spirit; nothing but their own wills can do that.</p>
               <p>For in these cases it is a good rule, and of great use in the practice of the Sacrament: <hi>Whoever can communicate spiritually, may be admitted to communicate Sacramenttally</hi>; that is, they who are in a state of grace, and can desire it, must not be rejected: And therefore good men falling into this calamity, when they have any ease from their sadnesse, and that they can return to words of order, and composed thoughts, though but for a while, though but in order to that ministery, are not to be rejected.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:98913:87"/>But on the other side, whoever can hinder the effect of the Sacrament, they are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to it, unless they do not only not hinder it, but actually dispose themselves to it: For if they can do evil, they can and ought to do good; and therefore vicious madmen having been and still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in a state of evil, cannot be admitted till they do good; and therefore never while their madnesse remains. The godly man that is so affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted may; but yet not till the fire that was hidden makes some actual and bright emissions.</p>
               <p>But then lastly, For others who are of a <hi>probable</hi> life, concerning whom no man can tell whether they be in the state of grace or no; because no man can tell whether he that comes with that sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse be capable or no, no man can tell whether he does well or ill; and therefore he must determine himself by accidents and circumstances, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential considerations, having one eye upon the designs and compliances of charity, and the other upon the reverence of the Sacrament. And the case is in all things alike with dying persons, past the use of speech and reason.</p>

               <p>BEsides the faith that is previous to Baptisme, or is wrapped up in the offices of that Sacrament, the Church of God admitted only such persons to the Sacrament whom she called <hi>Fideles</hi> or Faithful, by a propriety or singularity and eminency of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation. They accounted it not enough barely to believe or to be professors; for the penitents, and the lapsed and the Catechumens were so; but they meant, such persons whose faith was operative and alive and justifying; such men whose faith had overcome the world, and overcome their lusts, and conquered their spiritual enemy; such who by faith were real servants of Christ, disciples of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, subjects of his Kingdom and obedient to his institution. Such a faith as this is indeed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to every worthy communicant; because with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such a faith a Christian is no more but a name; but the man is dead; and dead men eat not. Of this therefore we are to take strict and severe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: which we shall best do by the following measures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every true Christian believer must consent to the Articles of his belief by an assent firmer than can be naturally produced from the ordinary argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98913:88"/>
of his persuasion. Men believe the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; but it is because they are taught it in their child-hood, and they inquire no further in their age: their Parents and their Priests, the laws of the Church and the Religion of the Country make up the demonstration; but because their faith is no stronger than to be the daughter of such argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we find they commonly live at such a rate, as if they did neither believe nor care whether it were so or no. The confidence of the article makes them not to leave off violently to pursue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of this world, and to love and labour for the other. Before this faith can enable them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist a temptation they must derive their assent from principles of another nature; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause few men can dispute it with arguments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible and demonstrative and such as are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apt to produce the most perfect assent, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that these men of all other should believe it because it is said to come from God, and rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it because it brings to God, trust it because it is good, acknowledge it certain because it is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; that there may be an act of the will in it, as well as of the understanding, and as much love in it as discourse.</p>
               <p>For he that only consents to an article because it is evident, is indeed convinced, but hath no excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in his faith but what is natural, nothing that is gracious and moral: true Christian faith must have in it something of obscurity, something that must be made up by duty and by obedience: but it is nothing but this; we must trust the evidence of God in the obscurity of the thing. Gods testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny must be clear to him, and the thing in all other senses not clear; and then to trust the article be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98913:88"/>
God hath said it, must have in it an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency which God loves and that he will reward. In order to this, it is highly considerable that the greatest argument to prove our Religion, is the goodness and the holiness of it: it is that which makes peace and friendships, content and comfort, which unites all relations and endears the relatives, it relieves the needy and defends the widdow, it ends strife and makes love endless; all other arguments can be opposed and tempted by wit and malice, but against the goodness of the Religion no man can speak, by which it appears that the greatest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is that which moves love intending by love to convince the understanding.</p>
               <p>But then for others who can enquire better; their inquiries also must be modest and humble, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the things, and to the designes of God: they must not disbelieve an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in Christianity which is not proved like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion in Geometry; they must not be witty to object, and curious to enquire beyond their limit: for some are so ingeniously miserable, that they will never believe a proposition in Divinity if any thing can be said against it; they will be credulous enough in all the affairs of their life, but impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable by a Sermon of the Gospel; they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the word of a man and the promise of their neighbour; but a promise of Scripture signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unless it can be proved like a proposition in the Metaphysicks. If <hi>Sempronius</hi> tell them a story, it is sufficient if he be a just man, and the narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive be probable: but though Religion be taught by many excellent men who gave their lives for a testimony, this shall not passe for truth till there is no objection left to stand against it. The reason
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98913:89"/>
of these things is plain: they do not love the thing; their interest is against it: they have no joy in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; they are not willing and desirous that the things shall appear true. When love is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, the thing is easie to the understanding, the objections are nothing, the arguments are good, and the Preachers are in the right. Faith assents to the revelations of the Gospel, not only because they are well proved, but because they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things; not only because my reason is convinced; but my reason yields upon the fairer termes because my affections are gained. For if faith were an assent to an article but just so far as it is demonstrated, then faith were no vertue, and infidelity were no sin; because in this there is no choice, and no refusal: but where that which is probable is also naturally indemonstrable, and yet the conclusion is that in which we must rejoyce, and that for which we must earnestly contend, and that in the belief of which we serve God, and that for which we must be ready to die. It is certain that the understanding observing the credibility, and the will being pleased with the excellency, they produce a zeal of belief, because they together make up the demonstration. For a reason can be opposed by a reason, and an argument by an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but if I love my Religion, nothing can take me from it, unless it can pretend to be more useful and more amiable, more perfective and more excellent than heaven and immortality, and a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and a crown of peace, and all the things and all glories of the Eternal God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That faith which disposes to the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion must have in it a fulness of confidence and relying upon God, a trusting in, and a real ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

                  </gap> for the things of this life to them that serve him. They who have great revenues and full bags can easily trust this promise: but if thou hast neither mony nor friends, if the labour of thy hands, and the successe of thy labour fails thee, how is it then? Can you then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon the promise? What means your melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and your fear, your frequent sighs and the calling of your self miserable and undone? Can God only help with means? or cannot he also make the means, or help without them; or see them when you see them not? or is it that you fear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will or no? He that hath promised, if he be just, is alwayes willing, whether he be able or no; and therefore, if you do not doubt of his power, why should you at all doubt of his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? For if he were not able, he were not Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; if he were not willing to perform his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, then he were not just: and he that suspects that, hath neither faith nor love for God, of all things in the world, faith never distrusts the good will of God, in which he most glories to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him self to mankind. If yet your fear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and sayes that all is well on Gods part; but you have provoked him by your sins, and have lost all title to the promise; I can say nothing against that, but that you must speedily repent and amend your fault, and then all will be quickly well on your part also, and your faith will have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and your fears will have no excuse. When the glutton <hi>Apicius</hi> had spent a vast revenue in his prodigious feastings, he kill'd himself for fear of starving: but if <hi>Caesar</hi> had promised to give him all <hi>Sicily</hi> or the revenues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the beast would have lived and eaten. But the promises of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98913:90"/>
God give to many of us no security, not so much as the promise of our rich friend, who yet may be disabled, or may break his word, or die. * But let us trie again. *</p>
               <p>God hath promised that <hi>all things shall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that fear him.</hi> Do we believe that our present affliction will do so? Will the loss of our goods, the diminution of our revenue, the amission of our honour, the death of our eldest son, the unkindness of a husband, the frown of our Prince, the defeating of our secular hopes, the unprosperous event of our imployment? Do we find that our faith is right enough really to be satisfied in these things so much as to be pleased with Gods order and method of doing good to us by these unpleasing instruments? Can we rejoyce under the mercy by the joys of believing at the same time when we groan under the affliction by the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of sense? Do we observe the design of cure, when we feel the pain and the smart? Are we pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent under the evil,<note place="margin">Quae<expan>

               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells that when the cowards of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemon</hi> depicted upon their shields the most terrible beasts they could imagine, their design was to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright their enemies that they might not come to a close fight; they would fain have made their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies afraid; because themselves were so. Which when <hi>Lacon</hi> espied, he painted upon a great shield nothing but a little fly for his device; and to them who said he did it that he might not be noted in the battle, he answered; yea but I mean to come so neer the enemy, that he shall see the little fly. This is our case, our afflictions seem to us like Gorgons
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98913:90"/>
heads, Lions and Tigres, things terrible in picture, but intolerable in their fury; but if we come neer and consider them in all the circumstances; they are nothing but a fly upon a shield, they cannot hurt us, and they ought not to affright us, if we remember that they are conducted by God, that they are the effect of his care and the impresse of his love, that they are the method and order of a blessing, that they are sanctified and eased by a promise;<note place="margin">poenam Phaethon pro mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> and that a present ease it may be would prove a future infelicity. If our faith did rely upon the promise, all this were nothing; but our want of faith does cause all the excesse of trouble. For the question is not whether or no we be afflicted, whether we be sick, or crossed in our designs, or deprived of our children, this we feel and mourn for: but the question is, whether all this may not, or be not intended to bring good to us? Not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God smiles or no, but to what purposes he smiles? Not whether this be not evil, but whether this evil will not bring good to us? If we do believe, why are we without comfort and without patience? If we do not believe it, where is our faith?</p>
               <p>And why does any of us come to the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion if we do not believe it will be for our good? but if we do think it will, why do we not think so of our crosse? for the promise is that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing shall. Cannot the rod of God do good as well as the bread of God? and is not he as good in his discipline as in his provision? Is not he the same in his School as at his Table? Is not his physick as wholesome as his food? It is not reason, but plainly our want of faith that makes us think otherwise. Faith is the great magazine of all the graces and all the comforts of a Christian: and therefore the Devil
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98913:91"/>
endeavours to corrupt the truth of it by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingling errours, the sincerity of it by hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, the ingenuity of it by interest, the comforts of it by doubting, the confidences of it by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and secular experiences and present consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; by adherence to humane confidences, and little sanctuaries, and the pleasures of the world and the fallibilities of men. * When <hi>Xerxes</hi> had a great army to conduct, and great successes to desire, and various contingencies to expect, he left off to sacrifice to his Country gods, forsook <hi>Jupiter</hi> and the Sun, and in <hi>Lydia</hi> espying a goodly Platan tree, tall and strait and spread, he encamped all his army in the fields about it, hung up brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and coronets upon the branches, and with costly offerings made his petitions to the beauteous tree; and when he march'd away he left a guard upon his God, lest any thing should do injury to the plant of which he begged to be defended from all injury. By such follies as these does the Devil endeavour to deflour our holy faith and confidences in God: we trust in man who cannot trust himself; we relie upon riches, that relie upon nothing; for they have no stabiliment, and they have no foundation; but are like atoms in the air; the things them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d the foundation cannot bear them. In our afflictions we look for comfort from wine or company, from a friend that talkes well, or from any thing that brings us present ease, but in the mean time we look not into the promises of God which are the store houses of comfort; and like the dogs at <hi>Hippocrene,</hi> we lick the water drops that fall upon the ground and take no notice of the fountain and the full vessels. These things are so necessary to be considered in order to our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98913:91"/>
to the Communion, as they are necessary to be reduced to practice in order to a Christian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation: for the holy Communion is the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and compendium of the Religion and duty of a whole life; and as faith cannot be <hi>holy, material</hi> and <hi>acceptable</hi> without it contain in it a real trust in the promises of God; so neither can it be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent disposition to the receiving the divine myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries unlesse upon this ground it be <hi>holy, acceptable</hi> and <hi>material.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That faith which is a worthy preparatory to the holy Communion must be the actual principle and effective of a good life: a faith in the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> and in the <hi>Commandments</hi> of God. Who can pretend to be a Christian and yet not believe those words of St. <hi>Paul [Follow after peace with all men and holiness, without which no man shall see God?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.14.</note>] and yet if we do believe it, what do we think will become of us, who neither follow peace nor holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but follow our anger and pursue our lust? If we do believe this, we had need look about us and live at another rate than men commonly do. But we still remain peevish and angry, malicious and unplacable, apt to quarrel and hard to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, lovers of money and lovers of pleasures, but careless of holiness and Religion; as if they were things fit only to be talked on, and to be the subject of Theological discourses, but not the rule of our lives and the matter of our care. <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.28.</note> It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said by St. <hi>Paul; He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.</hi> Now if we observe what crouds of people in great Cities come to the holy Communion, good and bad, penitent and impenitent, the covetous and the proud, the crafty Merch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

fraud, and the wanton fool from his last nights lust, we may easily perceive that not many men believe these words. He that sayes to me, drink not this for it is poyson, hath given me a law and an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightment, and I dare not disobey him, if I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him; and if we did believe St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I suppose we should as little dare to be damned as to be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd.<note place="margin">Mat. 7.2.</note> Our Blessed Saviour told us, that <hi>with what measure we mete to others, it shall be measured to us again</hi>; but who almost believes this, and considers what it means? Will you be content that God should despise you as you despise your brother? that he should be as soon angry with you, as you are with him? that he should strike you as hastily, and as seldom pardon you, and never bare with your infirmities, and as seldom interpret fairly what you say or do, and be revenged as frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as you would be? And what think we of these sayings [<hi>Into the heavenly Jerusalem there shall in no wise enter any thing that defileth,</hi>

For if these words be true; will men leave their sins, or are they resolved to suffer damnation, as being lesse troublesome than to quit their vain Mistresses? surely that's not it; but they have some little subterfuges and illusions to trust to. They say
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98913:92"/>
they will relie upon Gods mercy. Well they may; if in <hi>well doing they commit their souls to him as to a faithful Creator</hi>: but will they make God their enemy, and then trust in him while he remains so? That will prove an intollerable experiment; for so said God, when he caused his name to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed to the host of Israel; <hi>The Lord God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and gracious:</hi> he caused to be added; <hi>and that will by no means quit the guilty.</hi> By no means? No, by no means, let us believe that as well as the other. For the passion of our Redeemer, the intercession of our high Priest, the Sacraments of the Church, the body and blood of Christ, the mercies of God, the saying Lord, Lord, the priviledges of Christians, and the absolution of the Priest, none of all this, and all this together shall do him no good that remains guilty, that is, who is impenitent, and does not forsake his sin. If we had faith we should believe this, and should not dare to come to the holy Communion with an actual guiltiness of many crimes, and in confidence of pardon, against all the truth of Divine relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore without faith.</p>
               <p>But then here we may consider, that no man in this case can hope to be excused from the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a holy life upon pretence of being saved by his faith. For if the case be thus; these men have it not. For he that believes in God, believes his words; and they are very terrible to all evil persons: For in Christ Jesus nothing can avail, but a new creature, nothing but keeping the Commandments of God, nothing but faith work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by charity: they are the words of God. Wicked men therefore can never hope to be saved by their faith, or by their faith to be

worthy Communicants, for they have it not. Who then can?</p>
               <p>He only by his faith is worthily disposed to the Communion, and by his faith can be saved, who by his faith lives a life of grace; whose faith is to him a magazine of holy principles, whose faith endears obedience, and is the nurse of a holy hope, and the mother of a never failing charity. He shall be saved by his faith who by his faith is more than conquerour; who resists the Devil and makes him flie, and gives laws to his passions, and makes them obedient; who by his faith overcomes the world and removes mountains, the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of pride and vanity, ambition and secular designs; and whose faith casteth out Devils, the Devil of lust and the Devil of intempe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>SECT. V. Of the proper and Specifick work of Faith in the reception of the holy Communion.</head>
               <p>HEre I am to enquire into two practical questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 1. What stresse is to be put upon faith in this Mystery: that is, how much is every one bound to believe in the article of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before he can be accounted competently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in his understanding, and by his faith?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:98913:94"/>2. What is the use of faith in the reception of the Blessed Sacrament? and in what sense, and to what purposes, and with what truth it is said that in the holy Sacrament we receive Christ by faith?</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>How much every man is bound to believe of this mystery.</head>
                  <p>If I should follow the usual opinions, I should say that to this preparatory faith it is necessary to believe all the niceties and mysteriousnesse of the blessed Sacrament. Men have introduced new opinions and turned the key in this lock so often till it cannot be either opened or shut, and they have unravel'd the clue so long till they have intangled it; and not only reason is made blind by staring at what she never can perceive, but the whole article of the Sacrament is made an objection and temptation even to faith it self; and such things are taught by some Churches and some Schooles of learning, which no Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy did ever teach, no Religion ever did reveal, no prophet ever preach, and which no faith ever can receive: I mean it in the prodigious article of Transubstantiation;<note place="margin">vide <hi>Real presence</hi> per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</note> which I am not here to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, but to reprove upon practical considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and to consider those things that may make us better, and not strive to prevail in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. That therefore we may know the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per offices of faith in the believing what relates to the holy Sacrament, I shall describe it in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propositions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It cannot be the duty of faith to believe any
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98913:95"/>
thing against our sense; what we see and taste to be bread, what we see and taste and smell to be wine, no faith can engage us to believe the contrary. For by our senses Christianity it self, and some of the greatest Articles of our belief were known by them who from that evidence conveyed them to us by their testimony; and if the perception of sense were not finally to be relied upon,<note place="margin">1 John 1.1, 2, 3.</note> Miracles could never be a demonstration, nor any strange event prove an unknown proposition: for the Miracle can never prove the Article, unless our eyes or hands approve the miracle; and the Divinity of Christs person, and his mission and his power could never have been proved by the Resurrection, but that the resurrection was certain and evident to the eyes and hands of so many witnesses. Thus Christ to his Apostles proved himself to be no spirit, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing his flesh and bones to be felt; and he wrought faith in St. <hi>Thomas</hi> by his fingers ends; the wounds that he saw and felt were the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his faith: and in the Primitive Church the <hi>Valentinians</hi> and <hi>Marcionites,</hi> who said Christs bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was phantastical, were confused by no other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument but of sense: For sense is the evidence of the simple, and the confirmation of the wise; it can confute all pretences, and reprove all deceitful subtilties; it turns opinion into knowledge, and doubts into certainty; it is the first endearment of love, and the supply of all understanding: from what we see without, we know what to believe within; and no demonstration in the world can be greater than the evidence of sense. Our senses are the great arguments of vertue and vice; and if it be not safe to rely upon that evidence, we cannot tell what pleasure and pain is; and a man that is born blind may as well have the true idea of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98913:95"/>
as we could have of pain, if our senses could not tell us certainly: and all those arguments from heaven by which God prevails upon all the world, as Oracles, and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and still voices, and loud thunders, and the daughter of a voice, and messages from above, and Prophets on earth, and lights and Angels, all were nothing; for faith could not come by hearing, if our hearing might be illusion. That therefore which all the world relies upon for their whole Religion, that which to all the world is the great means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the glorification of God, even our seeing of the works of God, and eating his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, and beholding his light; that which is the great ministery of life, and the conduit of good and evil to us, we may rely upon for this article of the Sacrament: what our faith relies upon in the whole, she may not contradict in this. <hi>Tertullian</hi> said, that [It is (not only unreasonable, but) unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to contradict the testimony of our sense, lest the same question be made of Christ himself, lest it be suspected that he also might be deceived when he heard his Fathers voice from heaven] That therefore which we see upon our Altars and Tables, that which the Priest handles, that which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant does taste, is bread and wine; our senses tell us that it is so,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Real Presence, Sect.</hi> 10.</note> and therefore faith cannot be enjoined to believe it not to be so. Faith gives a new light to the soul, but it does not put our eyes out; and what God hath given us in our nature, could never be intended as a snare to Religion, or to engage us to believe a lie. Faith sees more in the Sacrament than the eye does, and tastes more than the tongue does, but nothing against it: and as God hath not two wills contradictory to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so neither hath he given us two notices and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98913:96"/>
perceptions of objects, whereof the one is affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and the other negative of the same thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatsoever is against right reason, that no faith can oblige us to believe. For although reason is not the positive and affirmative measures of our faith, and God can do more than we can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and our faith ought to be larger than our reason, and take something into her heart that reason can never take into her eye; yet in all our Creed there can be nothing against reason. If true reason justly contradicts an article, it is not <hi>of the houshold of faith.</hi>

Rule 3.</note> In this there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that in practice we take care that we do not call that reason which is not so: for although a mans reason is a right Judge, yet it ought not to passe sentence in an inquiry of faith, until all the information be brought in; all that is within, and all that is without; all that is above, and all that is below; all that concerns it in experience, and all that concerns it in act; whatsoever is of perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent observation, and whatsoever is revealed: for else reason may argue very well, and yet conclude falsly; it may conclude well in Logick, and yet infer a false Proposition in Theology: but when our Judge is fully and truly informed in all that where she is to make her judgment, we may safely follow it, whithersoever she invites us.</p>
                  <p>If therefore any society of men calls upon us to believe in our Religion what is false in our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; to affirm that to be done, which we know is impossible it ever can be done; to wink hard that we may see the better; to be unreasonable men, that we may off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He that speaks against his own reason, speaks against his own conscience; and therefore it is certain, no man serves God with a good conscience that serves him against his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For though in many cases reason must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to faith, that is, natural reason must submit to supernatural, and the imperfect informations of art to the perfect revelations of God; yet in no case can a true reason and a right faith oppose each other: and therefore in the article of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the impossible affirmatives concerning Transubstantiation, because they are against all the reason of the world, can never be any part of the faith of God.</p>

soul, or the calice purifie our spirits; <hi>how</hi> Christ is united to us and yet we remain imperfect even then when we are all one with him that is perfect: there is no want of faith though we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the secret manner how Christ is really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and yet this reality be no other but a reality of event and positive effect; though we know not that <hi>Sacramental</hi> is more than <hi>figurative,</hi> and yet not so much as <hi>natural,</hi> but greater in another kind. It is not a duty of our faith to discern how Christs body is broken into ten thousand pieces and yet remains whole at the same time; or how a body is present by faith only, when it is naturally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and yet faith ought to believe things to be as they are, and not to make them what of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they are not. We need not to be amazed concerning our faith, when our overbusie reason is amazed in the article; and our faith is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective though we confesse we do not understand how Christs body is there incorporeally, that is, a body after the manner of a Spirit; or though we cannot apprehend how the Symbols should make the grace presential, and yet that the grace of God in the receiver can make the Symbols ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and energetical.</p>
                  <p>The faith that is required of those who come to the holy Communion is of what is revealed plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and taught usually; what sets devotion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not what ministers to curiosity; that which the Good and the plain, the easie and the simple man can understand.

                     <hi>What is the use of faith in this Sacrament?</hi> It is tied but to little duty, and a few plain articles; what then is the use and advantages of it? To what graces does it minister, and what effect does it produce? To this the answer is easie, but yet such as introduces a further enquiry. Faith indeed is not curious but material: and therefore in the contemplation of this mysterious Sacrament and its Symbols, we are more to regard their signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation than their matter; their holy imployment than their natural usuage, what they are by grace than what they are by nature; what they signifie rather than what they are defin'd. Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders not how they nourish the body, but how they support and exalt the soul: that they are Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental not that they are also nutritive; that

For to faith Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; by faith we eat his flesh, and by faith we drink his blood; that is, we communicate not as men, but as faithful and believers; the meaning, and the duty, and the effect of which are now to be inquired.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It signifies that Christ is not present in the Sacrament corporally; or naturally, but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; for thus the carnal and spiritual sense are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. So St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> upon those words of Christ; <hi>the flesh profiteth nothing</hi>: <q>what is it to understand carnally?</q> To understand them simply and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are spoken. For they are not to be judged as they seem, but all mysteries are to be considered with internal eyes, that is, spiritually. For the carnal sense does not penetrate to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so great a secret, saith St. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not devourers of flesh, because we understand these things spiritually. So <hi>Theophilaect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since the spiritual sense excludes the natural and proper, it remains that the expression which is natural be in the sense figurative and improper; and if the holy Sacrament were not a figure, it could neither be a sign nor a Sacrament. But there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called the body and blood of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the figure of them; as St. <hi>Austin</hi> largely discourses;<note place="margin">Epist. 23. ad Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac. vide eundem contr.

we say to morrow or the next day is the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our Lord; although that passion was but once, and that many ages since: and upon the Lords day, we say, to day our blessed Lord arose from the dead although so many years be passed since; and why is no man so foolish as to reprove us of falshood, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on these dayes is the similitude of those things which were done so long since. Was not Christ once sacrificed? and yet he is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed still on the solemnities of Easter, and every day in the Communions of the people; neither does he say false, who being asked, shall say that he is sacrificed; for if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments had not a similitude of those things whereof they are Sacraments, they would be no Sacraments at all. But most commonly, by their similitudes things receive their names.</q>

                  <p n="3">3. But St. <hi>Austin</hi> added well; The body of Christ is truth and figure too. The holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not only called the Lords body and blood, for the figure, similitude and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; but for the real exhibition and ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.

                     </note> by St. <hi>Ambrose:</hi> for by this means it can very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called the body and blood of Christ; since it hath not only the figure of his death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally, but internally it hath hidden and secret the proper and divine effect, the life-giving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his body; so that though it be a figure, yet it is not meerly so; not only the sign and memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of him that is absent, but it bears along with it the very body of the Lord, that is, the efficacy and divine vertue of it. Thus our blessed Saviour said of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> that <hi>Elias</hi> is already come, because he came in the power and spirit of <hi>Elias.</hi> As <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Elias,</hi> so is the holy Sacrament the body and blood of Christ, because it hath the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and spirit of the body of Christ. And therefore the ancient Doctors of the Church in their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of these divine Mysteries, use the word <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> not understanding these words in the natural or Philosophical, but a Theological, in a sense proper to the Schools of Christians; by <hi>Substance</hi> meaning the power of the substance; by <hi>Nature,</hi> the gracious effect of his natural body: the nature and use and mysteriousnesse of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so allowing them to speak, and so requiring us to understand.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And now to this spiritual food must be sitted a spiritual manner of reception; and this is the work of faith; that spiritual blessings may invest the spirit, and be conveyed by proportioned instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, lest the Sacrament be like a treasure in a dead hand, or musick in the grave. But this I chuse rather to represent in the words of the Fathers of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98913:100"/>
the Church than mine own. [<q>We see (saith St. <hi>Epiphanius)</hi> what our Saviour took into his hands, as the Gospel says,<note place="margin">In Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato.</note> he arose at supper and took this, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But that which we have heard, that we believe; that it is his.] And again, [The bread indeed is our food; but the virtue which is in it, is that which gives us life: by faith and efficacy, by hope and the perfection of the Mysteries, and by the title of sanctification, it should be made to us the perfection of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.<note rend="inter">Autor lib. de coenâ Dom.

S.</note>] saith St. <hi>Athanasius.</hi> Therefore because Christ said, This is my body, let us not at all doubt, but believe, and receive it with the eye of the soul; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing sensible is delivered us; but by sensible
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98913:101"/>
things he gives us insensible or spiritual,] so St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>:<note place="margin">S. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. ubi suprà in Mat. 26.</note> [For Christ would not that they who partake of the divine Mysteries should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the nature of the things which are seen, but let them (by faith) believe the change that is made by grace.<note place="margin">Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret. dial. 1.</note> [For according to the substance of the creatures, it remains after consecration the same it did before: But it is changed inwardly by the powerful vertue of the holy Spirit; and faith sees it,<note place="margin">Bertram de corp. &amp; sang.

                  </p>
                  <p>From these excellent words we are confirmed in these two things. 1. That the divine Mysteries are of very great efficacy and benefit to our souls. 2. That Faith is the great instrument in conveying these blessings to us.<note place="margin">ubi supra.</note> For as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirms, the Sacraments of themselves cannot be without their own vertue; and the divine Majesty does at no hand absent it self from the Mysteries.] But then unless by faith we believe all this that Christ said, there is nothing remaining but the outward Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols, and the sense of flesh and blood, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits nothing. But to believe in Christ, is to eat the flesh of Christ.<note place="margin">John 6.35.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me shall not hunger</hi>; that is, he shall be filled with Christ: <hi>and he that believeth in me shall not thirst</hi>: coming to Christ, and believing in him, is the same thing: that is, he that believes Christs Words and obeys his Commandments; he that owns Christ for his Law-giver and his Master, for his Lord and his Redeemer; he who lays down his sins in the grave of Jesus, and lays down himself at the foot of the Crosse, and his cares at the door of the Temple, and his sorrows at the Throne of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98913:101"/>
Grace; he who comes to Christ to be instructed, to be commanded, to be relieved, and to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; to this person Christ gives his body and blood, that is food from heaven. And then the bread of life, and the body of Christ, and eating his flesh, and drinking his blood, are nothing else but mysterious and Sacramental expressions of this great excellency; that whoever does this, shall partake of all the benefits of the Crosse of Christ, where his body was broken, and his blood was poured forth for the remission of our sins, and the salvation of the world. But still that I may use the expression of St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">in Lucam lib. 6. c. 8.</note> Christ is handled by faith, he is seen by faith, he is not touched by the body, he is not comprehended by the eyes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But all the inquiry is not yet past: For thus we rightly understand the mysterious Propositions; but thus we do not fully understand the mysterious Sacrament. For since coming to Christ in all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses of Christian Religion, that is, in all the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of faith, is eating of the body and drinking the blood of Christ, what does faith in the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the blessed Sacrament that it does not do without it? Of this I have already given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 1. Sect. 2.</note>: But here I am to add, That in the holy Communion all the graces of a Christian, all the mysteries of the Religion are summ'd up as in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine compendium; and whatsoever <hi>moral</hi> or <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious</hi> is done without, is by a worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant done more excellently in this divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for here we continue the confession of our faith which we made in Baptism; here we perform in our own persons what then was undertaken for us by another; here that is made explicit which was but implicit before; what then was in the root,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98913:102"/>
is now come to a full year; what was at first done in mystery alone, is now done in mystery and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions and vertuous excellencies together: here we do not only here the words of Christ, but we obey them; we believe with the heart, and here we confesse with the mouth, and we act with the hand, and incline the head, and bow the knee, and give our heart in sacrifice: here we come to Christ, and Christ comes to us; here we represent the death of Christ as he would have us represent it, and remember him as he commanded us to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him; here we give him thanks, and here we give him our selves; here we defie all the works of darknesse, and hither we come to be invested with a robe of light, by being joined to the Son of Righteousnesse, to live in his eyes; and to walk by his brightnesse, and to be refreshed with his warmth, and directed by his spirit, and united to his glories. So that if we can receive Christs body and drink his blood out of the Sacrament, much more can we do it in the Sacrament: For this is the chief of all the Christian Mysteries, and the union of all Christian Blessings, and the investiture of all Christian Rights, and the exhibition of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all Christian Promises, and the exercise of all Christian Duties. Here is the exercise of our faith, and acts of obedience, and the confirmation of our hope, and the increase of our charity. So that although God be gracious in every dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he is bountiful in this: although we serve God in every vertue, yet in the worthy reception of this divine Sacrament there must be a conjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vertues, and therefore we serve him more: we drink deep of his loving kindnesse in every effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it; but in this we are inebriated: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fills our cup, but here it runs over.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

That faith which is necessary to the worthy receiving this divine Sacrament, is all that which is necessary to the susception of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptism, and all that which is produced by hearing the word of God, and all that which is exercised in every single grace; all that by which we live the life of grace, and all that which works by charity, and makes a new creature, and justifies a sinner, and is a keeping the Commandments of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the manducation of Christs flesh and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his blood be spiritual, and done by faith, and is effected by the spirit, and that this faith signifies an intire dedition of our selves to Christ, and sanctification of the whole man to the service of Christ, then it follows,<note place="margin">Panis qui de coelo descend it non nisi ab eo accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur qui Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet &amp; Christi mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum est.

Thee his God and Father he appeased, and reconciled unto the world, and freed all men from the instant anger: He was born of a Virgin, born in flesh; He is God, and the Word, the beloved Son, the first born of every creature; according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies which went before him, of the seed of of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and of the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi>

suffered all shame and reproach.

For they that speak distinctly, and give proprieties of employment to the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by that which is most signal and eminent in them both respectively, call Baptism the Sacrament of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Eucharist the Sacrament of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>; that is, Faith in Baptism enters upon the work of a good life; and in the holy Eucharist it is actually productive of that Charity, which at first was designed and undertaken.</p>
               <p>For Charity is that fire from heaven, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it does enkindle the Sacrifice, God will never accept it for an atonement. This God declared to

You can best tell whether you have charity to your brother, by your willingnesse to oblige him, and do him real benefit, and keeping him from
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98913:109"/>
all harm we can. Do you do good to all you can? Will you willingly give friendly counsel? Do you readily excuse your neighbours faults? Do you rejoyce when he is made glad? Do you delight in his honour and prosperity? Do you stop his entry into folly and shame? Do not you laugh at his miscarriages? Do you stand ready in mind to do all good offices to all you can converse with? For nothing makes Societies so fair and lasting, as the mutual endearment of each other by good offices; and never any man did a good turn to his brother, but one time or other himself did eat the fruit of it. The good man in the Greek Epigram that found a dead mans scul unburied, in kindnesse digging a grave for it, opened the inclosures of a Treasure: And we read in the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> that when <hi>Goutran</hi> King of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was sleeping by the murmurs of a little brook, his Servant espied a Lizard coming from his Masters head, and essayed to passe the water; but seeming troubled because it could not, he laid his sword over the brook, and made an iron bridge for the little beast, who passing entred into the earth, and speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned back to the King, and disturb'd him (as it is supposed) into a dream, in which he saw an iron bridge which landed him at the foot of the mountain, where if he did dig he should find a great heap of gold. The servant expounded his Masters dream, and shewed him the iron bridge; and they digged where the Lizard had entred, where they found indeed a Treasure; and that the Servants piety was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded upon his Lords head, and procured wealth to one and honour to the other. There is in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature a strange kind of noblenesse and love to return and exchange good offices: but because

there are some dogs who bite your hand when you reach them bread, God by the ministery of his little creatures tells, that if we will not, yet he will certainly recompence every act of piety and charity we do one to another. * This the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In all the Sacrifices of the Ancients they were hugely kind to one another; they invited their friends to partake the Sacrifice, and called them to a portion of the pardon, that they might eat of that mercy and that forgivenesse which they expected from their God. Then they sent portions to the absent; then they renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Leagues, and re-established Peace, and made marriages, and joined Families, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hearts, and knitted Interests by a thred and chain of mutual acts of kindness and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And so should we, when we come to this holy Sacrifice; we must keep our hearts entire to God, and divide them amongst our Brethren, and heartily love all them who feed upon the same Christ, who live by the same faith,

Rule 15. <hi>Irenae.</hi> lib. 4. c. 34.</note>; therefore he referrs these words to the celebration of the Christian Eucharistical Sacrifice and Oblation; concerning which he hath these excellent words: <q>From the beginning God respected <hi>Abels</hi> offering because he offered in righteousness and singleness of heart. But God regarded not the Sacrifice of <hi>Cain,</hi> because he had a heart divided from his Brother, full of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98913:112"/>
zeal and malice, and therefore God who knoweth all secrets thus reproves him. If thou doest rightly offer, but not rightly divide, be quiet, God will not be appeased with thy sacrifice. For if any one in outward appearance offers a clean, a right, and a pure sacrifice, but in his soul does not truly apportion his communion to his neighbour, he hath sin within, and by his external sacrifice does not bring God unto him, neither will the oblation profit him at all, unless the malice that he hath conceived within does cease, but that sin will make him every day more and more a murderer.</q>] In pursuance of this; St. <hi>Cyril</hi> tells,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Cyril. Hier. my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stag.

               <p>And our blessed Saviour himself adds a parallel to the first precept, which gives light and explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it: [<hi>When you stand praying, if you have any thing against any man forgive him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 11.25.</note> 
                  <hi>that your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven may forgive you your tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes</hi>] and so Christ taught us to pray [<hi>Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.</hi>] Let us consider what we do, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what we say. Do we desire to be forgiven no otherwise? Do not we exact every little igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and grow warm at every mistake? And are not we angry at an unavoidable chance? Would we have God do so to us, and forgive us in no other manner than as we do, that is, turn his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into every shape, and smite us in every part? Or would we have God pardon us only for little things, for a rash word, or an idle hour spent less
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98913:113"/>
severely? If we do so to our Brother, it is a great matter, but if he reviles us to our head, if he blasphemes, and dishonours us, if he rob us, if he smite us on the face, what then? We rob God of his honour, his Priests of their reverence, his houses of their beauty, his Churches of their maintenance: we talk vile things of his holy Name, we despise Religion, we oppose his Honour, and care not for his Service. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we do not usually forgive things of this nature to our brother; what then will become of our prayer? And what will be the effect of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion? And yet it is certain, there is nothing in the world easier than to forgive an injury. It costs us nothing, after it is once suffered; and if our passions and foolish principles would give us leave to understand it; the precise duty of forgiveness is a perfect negative; it is a letting things alone as they are, and making no more evils in the world, in which already there was one too many, even that which thou didst suffer.

For without love and without peace it is to no purpose to pray. The devotion of a man that is not in actual peace and kindness with his wife, is like a hot dead coal, it will burn his fingers that touches it; but it is wholly useless: but he that lives in peace with her, in love and prudent conduct, his devotion is a flaming fire; it kindles all that is round about it, it warms and shines, it is beauteous in it self, and it is useful to others; it is fit for the house, and fit for the Altar; it will set the Incense on smoaking, and put the sacrifice on fire.

He sheweth no mercy to a man that is like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and doth he ask forgiveness for his own sins? If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sins?</q>] The duty is plain, and the reason urgent, and the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment express, and the threatning terrible, and the promise excellent. There is in this no more to be said; but that we consider concerning the manner of reducing it to practice, in order to our prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a worthy Communion: and consider the special cases of conscience relating to this great duty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore we are bound to forgive every man that offends us. For concerning every one of our Brethren it is equally true, that he is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creation, that he is thy brother, that he is heir of the same hopes, born to the same inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, descended of the same Father, nursed by the Church which is his Mother and thine; that there is in him Gods Image drawn by the same hand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the same lines; that there are in him many good things for which he can be loved, and many reasons in him for which he ought to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; God hath made many decrees for him, and the Angels minister to him, and Christ died for him, and his soul is very precious in the eyes of God, and in Heaven it self the man whom thou ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test is very considerable; and there, there are great desires for his temporal and eternal happiness, and why shouldest thou despise, and why shouldest thou stand out against all this?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Not only every man, but every offence must be forgiven. The Wise man saies, [<hi>That for some things there will be no returning again:</hi> a blow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

He will pardon every sin of ours, for the pardon of which we can rightly pray; but yet we must pray for it, and hope it upon no measures but those of our, forgiveness;<note rend="inter">

               <p n="3">3. Although in these things there is no difficulty; yet in the intention and expressions of this duty there is some. For if it be inquired what is meant by forgiving; many men suppose it is nothing but saying, <hi>I forgive him with all my heart, and I pray God forgive him</hi>; But this is but words, and we must have more material significations of it then so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing can commute for the omission of the

necessary parts of this duty. It is therefore necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we observe these measures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every man that hath received injuries be they never so great, must have a mind perfectly free from all intentions of revenge in any instance whatsoever. For when the question is concerning forgiving him that did the wrong, every man can best answer his question by placing himself in the seat of him that did the offence, and considering to what purposes, and by what significations, and in what degrees, and to what event of things himself would fain be pardoned, if he were in his case and did repent the injury and did desire pardon. That's the measure and the rule; and we learn it from <note n="*" rend="inter">Homo sine peccato esse non potes, &amp; vis semper tibi dimitti. Dimitte sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

                  <p>If he have done me no wrong, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be forgiven; and if he offers to give me satisfaction, he is out of my debt. But if he hath been injurious, and does not repair me, then I have something to pardon.

For by this means we may have injuries enough, and sin shall live at the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98913:120"/>
charge of the good mans piety, and charity shall be the fuel of malice; what therefore is our duty in this case?</p>
                  <p>I answer, That there is a double sort of pardon or forgivenesse: The first and least is that which neither exacts revenge our selves, nor requires it of God, nor delights in it if it happens: and this is due to all; those very enemies that do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that cease not still to persecute you with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, must thus be pardoned; whether they care for it or no, whether they ask it or ask it not. For these we must also pray, we must blesse them, we must speak as much good of them as occasion and justice do require, and we must love them; that is, do them justice, and do them kindnesse; and this expresly required of us by our blessed Saviour <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 5.24.</note>.</p>
                  <p>But there is also another forgivenesse; that is, a restitution to the first state of trust; to love him as well, to think as well of him; and this is only due to them that repent, and ask pardon and make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends as they can: for then the proper office of thy charity is to pity thy brothers infirmity, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his sorrow, to entertain his friendship and his amends, and to put a period to his repentance for having troubled thee. For his satisfaction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution hath taken away the material part of the injury; and thou art as well as thou wert before, or at least he would fain have thee so; and then there can be nothing else done but what is done by thy charity; and by this thou must bear a share in his sorrow, believe his affirmation, accept his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, cancel his guilt, take off the remanent obligations, remove suspicion from him, entertain no jealousies of him, but in all things trust him where charity is not imprudent.</p>

                     <pb n="225" facs="tcp:98913:120"/>For it is not always safe to imploy a person that hath deceived my trust and done me wrong. But if you perceive that he may wisely be trusted and imployed, charity must take off the objection of his former sailing.

Which thing if wisely and without pretences thou canst really perceive, to trust or to imploy him in such instances in which he formerly did thee injury, is not prudent nor safe; and no charity ties thee to be a fool, and to suffer thy self to be tempted.

And if any man think it hard so often to be tied to accept his repentance, let him understand that it is because himself hath not yet been called to judgment; he hath not heard the voice of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actor, he hath not yet been delivered to the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors,

                  <p>I answer, that for this circumstance there is as proper an use and exercise of our charity as in the direct forgiveness.

If you can reasonably think so, you are bound to think so; for after all the signs of repentance in the world he may deceive you; and whether his heart be right or not, you can never know but by the judgment of charity; and that you may better use betimes. For when ever your returning enemy saies he does repent (that is, gives humane and probable indications of his repentance;) you cannot tell but that he saies true; and therefore you must forgive.

After the first forgivenesse, and at the second and third offence, we are not obliged so readily to believe his saying, as after the first offence; at which time although he did violence to justice and charity, yet he had not broken his faith as now he hath; and therefore the oftner he hath relapsed, the more significations he ought to give of the truth of his repentance.<note place="margin">Veniam delicti as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequutus, si iterum peccat, gravius judicium sibi pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat. <hi>Summ. moral.</hi>

even after a thousand injuries, if he does truly repent; yet this person cannot expect to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, or to be returned to all his former capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of good; because it is plain, he hath not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the evil principle, the malicious heart, or the evil eye, the slanderous tongue, or the unjust hand; his covetous desire, and his peevish anger: and then though we must be ready in heart to receive him to all the degrees of his former condition, when he shall be capable, and is the same man that ought to be imployed; yet till he be so, or appears so in prudent and reasonable indications, he must be pardoned heartily, and prayed for charitably, but he must be handled cautiously, It must not be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for thee to pardon him after ten thousand re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapses and returns: but after so much variety of folly and weak instances, it will be much harder for him to say and prove he does repent. But in this our charity must neither be credulous, nor morose; too easie, nor too difficult; but it is secure, if it pardons him, and prayes for him whether he repents or no.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are some significations of repentance, which charity never can refuse; but must accept the offending person as a convert and a penitent.</p>

And this can no waies be abated, unless he have done so before; and that his confession is but formal, and his shame is passed into shameles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

If cutting off his arm would make mine grow; if striking him upon the face would bring me a new tooth in stead of that which he struck out of mine, then there might be a just cause of going to Law; but when the evil remains after all that the Law can do; it is enough that I lost a limb, I will not lose my charity; which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The treaty was accepted, and the two Kings withdrew into an old Chappel in the field; where when they had dicours'd themselves into kindness, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to part friends and to appoint Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to finish the Treaty. But as they were going out, a great Serpent issued out of the ruinous wall and made toward the Kings, who being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the danger, drew their swords and in that manner ran out of the Chappel. Their guards who in equal numbers attended at the door, seeing their Princes in a fright and with their swords drawn, suppos'd they were fighting, and without any sign, instantly drew upon each other; which alarm the two armies taking, instantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a bloody fight, and could not for all the power of their Kings be totally disengag'd till the night parted them. Just such is the danger of an angry and quarrelsome spirit. He hath his sword by his side, and his army in the field, his hand is up and his heart is ready; and he wants nothing but an occasion, a Serpent to set him on; and that will
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98913:127"/>
never be wanting as long as the old Serpent the Devil hath any malice or any power. But let us not deceive our selves: we are bound very far by the laws of charity to the soul of our Brother; and we are very much concern'd that he be saved, and therefore our Blessed Saviour commanded us, <hi>if</hi> our <hi>brother have sinned against us, to reprove him</hi>;<note place="margin">Luke 17.3.</note> not presently to hale him up to the Judge, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up to the Law; but to use meanes and charitable instruments, not for his vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but his conversion.

                  <p>But to return to the particular case. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of every evil is not a sufficient pretence (though it were true) to commence a suit at Law, For when our blessed Saviour commands us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our offending brother; he speaks of such a one as is still in wrong and the state of injustice, a person from whom we are not sure but we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another injury, and yet even to this person we are commanded to be charitable in our reproof and private admonition, but are not permitted to be quick and fierce in our complaints at Law. For it is not dishonourable if a wise man be railed at, be smitten, be cheated, be derided by fools and evil persons: but to do any thing of this again, that is inhumane and inglorious. But this case is fully determined even by a heathen:<note place="margin">

If we can be secured without his affliction, we must take that way to be secured; but if by revenges and direct inflictions of evil, or procurations of punishment, we attempt it, we are not charitable. And this is the perfect meaning of our blessed Saviour, <hi>If thine enemy take thy cloak, let him take thy coat also; and if he strike thee on thy right cheek, tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what if he that smote one cheek will smite no more? or will smite the same? How if we are not able to bear a second blow? Or how if the offering the other cheek pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke thy enemy to scorn thee, and tempt or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to strike thee, who intended no such se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond blow? And were it not evidently better to withdraw from him that smites? or to sweeten him with gentle language? It is therefore certain these words are to be understood in the sense of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,

equity, and charity; that is, when you are injured, you may use all that is for your innocent defence and unmingled guards; you may without all peradventure pray him to be quiet, you may give him reasons and arguments to let you alone; you may give good words; you may give <hi>blessing for cursing,</hi> that's certainly permitted; or you may run away; you may <hi>flee from City to City</hi>; or you may complain to him; you may reprove him, and expostulate the injury with him, as Christ did, and as did St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But what is then meant by turning the other cheek?

The latter the Law of Charity and collateral duties do permit or enjoyn respectively; but of the former our Blessed Saviour hath made special provision. For when our blessed Lord commanded us first to reprove secretly our offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brother, and then before witnesse if there be need; the reason he gives is only that we may bring him to repentance, that you may gain him by rescuing his soul from guiltinesse, and his actions from injuriousnesse. If this course will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, then tell it to the Church; complain of him publickly, bring him before the Christian Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories; but still that he may repent; for if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, he must be thy brother still, lov'd as dearly, treated as friendly, caressed as sweetly, handled as tenderly, conversed with as obligingly. But if none of all this will prevail for his good, then look you only to the other part of the permission; that

is, that you be secured from his evil: you have done all that you are tied to do for his repentance in this method, but you have not yet done all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for my own, according to their condition and states of life; if this provision be but necessary or competent, according to prudent, modest, and wise accounts, and be not a contention for excesses and extravagancies of wealth. He that goes to Law for another, hath greater warrant than he that does it for himself; for it is more likely to be charity in their case, and revenge in my own; and certainly in the disputes of charity our children are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before our enemies.</p>

It is very considerable, that in many cases, even when it is lawful to bring a Criminal to punishment, or to go to Law, and that it is just so to do; yet this whole dispute being a question of charity, we are to go by other measures than in the other; and when in these cases we do nothing but what is just; we must remember that we are Christians, and must never expect to go to heaven, unless we do also what is charitable.</p>
                  <p>Therefore inquire no more into how much is just and lawful in these cases; but what is charitable, and what is best, and what is safest; for then the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of conscience are best determined, when our reward also shall greatly be secured. For it is in these inquiries of charity in order to the holy Communion, as it is in the Communion it self. Not every one shall perish that does not receive the holy Communion; but yet to receive it is of great advantage to our souls in order to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the joyes of heaven: so is every expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of charity; that very action which in some cases may be safely omitted, may in all cases, where there is not a contradicting duty, be done with great advantages. For he that thinks to have the reward, and the heaven of Christians by the actions of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and the omissions of charity, is like him who worships the Image of the Sun, while at the same time he turns his back upon the Sun himself. This is so essentially reasonable, that even the Heathens knew it, and urged it as a duty to be observed in all their sacrifices and solemnities. <q>When you pray to God (said one of their own Prophets) and offer a holy cloud of frankincense, come

               <p>For as in natural forms, the more noble they are, the more noble dispositions are required to their production; so it is in the spiritual: for when Christ is to be efformed in us, when we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God, flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone, we must be washed in water, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by faith, and sanctified by the spirit, and cleansed by an excellent repentance; we must be confirmed by a holy hope, and softned by charity. So God hath ordered in the excellent fabrick of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies: First our meat is prepared by fire, then macerated by the teeth, then digested in the stomach, where the first separation is made of the good from the bad, the wholesom juyces from the more earthy parts: these being sent down to earth, the other are conveyed to the Liver, where the matter is separated again, and the good is turned into blood, and the better into spirits; and thence the body is supplied with blood; and the spirits repair unto the heart and head, that thence they may be sent on Embassies for the ministeries of the body, and for the work of understanding. So it is in the dispensation of the affairs of the soul: The ear, which is the mouth of the soul, receives all meat, and the senses entertain the fuel for all passions, and all interests of vertue and vice. But the understanding makes the first separation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the clean from the unclean: But when the spirit of God comes and purifies even the separate matter, making that which is morally good to be spiritual and holy, first cleansing us from the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualities of flesh and blood, and then from spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual iniquities that usually debauch the soul,

his liberty in exchange for his outward worship of what he secretly hated: but by his external act he was brought to judgment, and condemned for his hypocrisie. This is the case of every one that in a state of sins comes to the holy Sacrament; he comes to receive the bread of God, and throws a stone at him; he pretends worship and secretly hates him; and no man must come hither, but all that is within him, and all that is without, must be symbolical to the nature and holiness of the mysteries, to the designs and purposes of God. In short; The full sense of all this is expressed in the Canon-Law, in a few words. <hi>A Sacrament is not to be given but to him that repents:</hi>

               <p>THe particular actions of repentance, which are to be performed in their proper seasons, which cannot be alwaies actual because they have variety, and cannot be attended to altogether, all such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of repentance are then in their season, they have this for their opportunity. For it is an admirable wisdom of God so to dispose the times and advantages of Religion, that by the solenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of duty our dispersions are gathered up, our wandrings are united, our indifferencies are kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, our weariness is recreated, our spirits are made busie, our attention is called upon, our powers are made active, our vertues fermented: we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, and looked after, and engaged. For as it is in motion, and as it is in lines, a long and a
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98913:142"/>
straight progression diminishes the strength, and makes languishing and infirmity; but by doubling the point, or making a new Centre the moving bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gathers up its parts and powers into a narrower compass, and by union, as by a new beginning, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued from weakness and diminution: So it is in the life of a Christian; when he first sets forth, he is zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and forward, full of appetite, and full of holy fires: but when his little fuel is consumed, and his flame abates, when he goes on &amp; grows weary, when he mingles with the world, and by every conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is polluted or allayed; when by his very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary affairs of life he is made secular and intere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, apt to tend his civil regards, and to be remiss in the spiritual; by often and long handling of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, beginning too much to love it: then we are interrupted in our declining piety, we are called upon by Religion, and by the sacrednesse of this holy duty are made to begin again, not to go back, but to be re-enkindled.</p>
               <p>Every time we receive the holy Sacrament all our duties are summed up; we make new vowes, we chastise our negligence, we mend our pace, we actuate our holy purposes, and make them stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, we enter upon Religion as if we had never done any thing before; we bring again our first pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential heats: and as when we pray, and pray long, our devotion slackens, and our attention becomes trifling, and by wandring thoughts we are gone very far from the observation of the offices; the good man that ministers calls out to us, <hi>Let us pray:</hi> and then the wandring thoughts run home, then we are troubled that we have lost so much of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

much we observe our selves to have been more negligent before. If God did not particularly call upon us by these religious necessities, and stop us by the solemn return of the Sacrament, and stir up our fires, and remind us of our duty, and make actual seasons and opportunities for actual and great attendencies on religion, if God did not make some daies, and some necessities, and some oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities for heaven; the soul and her interest would not be at all regarded. For this life is the day for the body, and our needs do indeed require so much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and imploy so much of our affections, and spend so much of our time, that it is necessary some abstractions and separations of time and offices be made.</p>
               <p>Receiving the holy Sacrament is like a Lock up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters; which makes them rise higher, and begin a fuller stream as from a new principle of emanation: So that the repentance which is the duty of our life and dispersed over all the parts and periods of it, like the waters in the first Creation upon the face of the whole earth, is gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the day of the Lords Communion as into a bosome and congregation of penitential wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. * Then you are to mourn for your sins, and to resolve against them, then you are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what vowes you have already made and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, how often you have prevaricated in your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and by what temptations you are used to fall: then you are to renew the strength of your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, to fortifie your tenderest part, and to cut off all advantages from the enemy: then you must prune your Vine,<note rend="inter">

               <p>There are some actions of repentance which must be finished and made perfect before we receive the holy Communion: and there are some which will be finishing all our life.

               <p>Those parts of repentance which must be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed before we approach the blessed Sacrament, are these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. We must have renounced, perfectly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all affections to sin, and firmly purpose to amend all, to sin no more, to lead a new life in all solid and material practises of vertue.

holy all them who use it with holy and salutary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses] and designs of living holily: not by a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and pompous profession only, but with a real and hearty resolution: resolving not to say so, and be a fool; but to say so, because indeed we mean so; not to profess it because it is the custome of Christians, and the expectation of the solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but because we intend really to be quit of the sin for ever. Now concerning our purposes of amendment, these things are to be taken careof:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they be made prudently, attentively, sincerely, and with intuition upon a credible, possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and designed effect. For there are some that make vowes (purposes I cannot call them) which they believe impossible to keep, and no man can wisely purpose such things, of which he hath such belief: but they believe themselves inevitably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to commit a sin, and yet as inevitably enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to say they will not. The Greeks tell of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fool among them; her name was <hi>Acco,</hi> who when she saw her self in a glasse, would discourse as wisely as she could to the other woman, and supposed her own shadow to be one of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; with whom sometimes she had great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but alwaies huge civilities; only she could never agree which of them should go away first, or take the upper hand. Such wise resolvers are some persons: they take the shadow of it for a substance, and please themselves by the entertainment of the images of things; and think that the outside and the words of a promise are the only thing that God requires; they and their promises do not know which shall go away first; the resolution quickly dies, and the man presently after; but the sin lives and abides there still, and will do so for ever.

about and see; you have promised what you are likely to perform; and do you intend it in good earnest never to consent to a sin, in no circumstance, and for no argument, and by no temptation? For he that resolves never to commit that, which he knows he shall commit, is like him who resolves he will never die; his vain resolution sets not his death back one hour. It is hypocrisie and lying to say it before God, and it is folly and madness to pretend that we will do it, to our selves; but of this I h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The first folly was too bad, but to do so often is intolerable. But here are two Cases to be resolved.</p>
               <div n="1" type="question">
                  <head>Question I. But of what nature and extent must our preparatory resolution be? Must we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve against all sin, or against some kinds only? If only against some sorts, then we are not clean all over. If against all, then we find it impossible for us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: And then either it is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to resolve, or not necessary to perform, or not necessary to Communicate.</head>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="275" facs="tcp:98913:145"/>I answer; It is one thing to say, I shall never fall, I shall never be mistaken, I shall never be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris'd, or I shall never slacken my watchfulness and attention; and another thing to resolve against the love and choice of every sin. It is not always in our powers to avoid being surprised, or being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or being dull and sleepy in our carefulnesse and watches. Every good and well-meaning Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian cannot promise to himself security; but he may be tempted, or over-pressed with a sudden fear when he cannot consider, and be put sometimes to act before he can take counsel: and though there is no one sin we do but we do it voluntarily, and might escape it if we would make use of the grace of God; yet the inference cannot run forth to all: we cannot therefore always escape all; any one we can, but not every one. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause concerning any one if we make a question, then we can and do deliberate; then we can attend, and we can consider, and summon up the arts and auxiliaries of Reason and Religion, and we can hear both sides speak; and therefore we can chuse: for he that can deliberate, can take either side; for if he could not chuse when he hath considered which to chuse, he were more a fool in considering, than by any inconsideration in the world; for he not only does unreasonably by sinning, but he considers unreasonably and to no purpose, since his conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot alter the case. Certain it is, by him that can consider, every sin can be avoided: But then, this is as certain, that it is not possible always to consider; but surprise and ignorance, haste and dulness, indifference and weariness, are the entries at which some things that are not good will enter; but these things are such, which by how much they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98913:146"/>
are the lesse voluntary, by so much they are the less imputed.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore he that means to Communicate worthily, must resolve against every sin, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and the least; that is, 1. He must resolve never to commit any sin concerning which he can delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate: and, 2. He must resolve so to stand upon his g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ard, that he may not frequently be surprised; he must use prayer against all, and prudent caution in his whole conversation, and all the instruments of grace for the destruction of the whole body of sin: and though in this valley of tears there are but few so happy souls as to triumph over all infirmities, we know of none, and if God hath any such on earth, they are peculiar jewels kept in undiscerned cabinets; yet all that intend to serve God heartily, must aim at a return to that state of innocence, to the possibility of which Christ hath as certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered us, as we lost it by our own follies and the sin of <hi>Adam:</hi> that is, we must continually strive, and every day get ground of our passions, and grow in understanding and the fear of God, that we be not so often deluded, nor in so many things be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, nor be so easily surprised, nor so much complain of our weakness, nor the imperfection of our actions be in so many instances unavoidable. But in the matters of choice, in voluntary and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate actions, we must resolve not to sin at all. In these things we must be more than conquerors.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He that intends worthily to Communicate, before his coming must quit all his next and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate occasions <note n="*" place="margin">Invitat autem pauperes, debiles, caecos, ut ostendatur quod nulla debilitas cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris excludit à regno rarius<expan>

evil, by which so long as he dwells he cannot stand uprightly. For to resolve against all sin, and yet to retain that temptation, which hath been to this time stronger than all your resolutions, is to abide in the midst of a torrent, against which you cannot swim, and yet resolve never to be drown'd <note n="*" rend="inter">Qui proponit sibi, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit habere volo quod vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam: hoc est, vivere desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dero, &amp; volo sub ruinâ, <hi>August. de singul.

There is no dallying in this case: He that will not throw out the bond woman and her son, he that will still retain the concubine, let him resolve what he will, and will what he is commanded, and profess what he purposes; his profession is nothing but words, and his resolutions will prove as unstable as the thinnest air, which is not able to support a fly, unless with her wings she fans it into an accidental thicknesse.</p>
                  <p>This may seem the hardest commandment of Christianity; and Christ calls it a <hi>cutting off the right hand,</hi> and <hi>plucking out the right eye</hi>; as if it were the greatest violence of the world. Indeed it is often times a great inconvenience to our affairs and fortune: For it may be he by whom we live is he by whom we sin, and we cannot eat but we must be in danger. If the case be so, it is indeed harder to leave the sin;<note place="margin">Projice quae cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que cor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niant, quae si ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi nequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, cor ipsum cum illis evellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum erat.</note> but yet the command of pulling out our eye is not the hardness, but is an act of easiness, and an instrument of facilitation: For first it must be remembred, that it is a question of souls, and no interest can be laid in balance against a soul; it is moments against Eternity, money against heaven, life eternal against a little pension; and therefore this precept of pulling out the right eye is very easie, when it is made the price or instrument of avoiding eternal torments: A man had better pull his heart
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98913:147"/>
out, than nurse a lust by which he shall die for ever.</p>
                  <p>But then next to this it is considerable, that this precept of putting out the right eye, that is, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the next occasion of sin, is so far from being an hard commandment, that it is perfectly a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with our infirmities, and a securing of our greatest interests; by this he conducts us tenderly, because we have no strength. For if Christ had done as <hi>Xenocrates</hi> in <hi>Valerius,</hi> and commanded his Disciples to dwell in danger that they might tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph more gloriously, we had reason to suspect our selves, and to tremble under the load of the imposition; but Christ knew it would never consist with our safety, and never conduce to his Fathers glory; therefore Christ bids us to avoid the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">

For as <hi>Trithemius</hi> observes, good Angels never appeared in the likenesse of women, they are tempters and temptations: and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the danger Christ would not have us look; unlesse we can do it with safety, we must not be in their company. And therefore as God gave us legs and hands in great kindnesse, yet we give money to have them cut off when they endanger the whole body: so must we quite cut off the advantages of our estate, and the pleasures of our life, rather than die eternally. There is no other variety but this; if we be tempted in our state of life or of socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we must do violence to our fortune or our will: But the particulars of the case are these.</p>

                        </gap>.</note> It is better to decline a trial than to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape from under it: And so it is here: It is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indeed to escape; but it is the safer way not to put it to the venture; and therefore when you can, decline the trial; for he that resolves to live, and yet will live under the ruins of a falling house, is but little better than a fool.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If it be difficult to part with the tempting occasion of your sin, then consider whether you can dwell with it, and yet not sin; if you can, you may; for if you neither love your danger, nor can easily part with it, it is sufficient that by plain force you resist it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. I answer, That it is impossible he should. If you live in delights your chastity is tempted; your humility is assaulted by receiving honour;<note place="margin">

To that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98913:149"/>
therefore the answer is certain and indisputable; that the occasion that is immediate to the sin, must be quitted in that in which it does minister to sin. A woman is not bound to spoil her face, though by her beauty she hath fallen: because her beauty was not the immediate cause; it was her unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conversation, and looser society; the laying her treasure open, or her wanton comportment. For beauty will invite a noble flame, as soon as kindle a smoaking brand; and therefore the face may be preserved and the chastity too, if that be removed which brings the danger and stands closer to the sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When <hi>Dionsius</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> gave to <hi>Aristippus</hi> five Attick talents, he and his servant dragged them home upon their backs: but finding himself too glad of his mony, he threw it into the sea, as supposing the money to be the tempter, and no safety to be had, as long as it was above the water. If he had thought right, he had done right: if he could not have cured his covetousness and kept the mony, he had done well to part with it; but it may be he might have been as safe, and yet wiser too. But the resolution is this. In this question distinguish the next occasion from that which is farther off; and we are bound to quit <hi>that</hi> not <hi>this,</hi> because the vertue may be secured without it. A man may very well live in the world, and yet serve God; and if he be hindred by the world, it is not directly that, but something else by which the cure must be effected: but if nothing else will do it, then there is no distinction, no difference between the neerest occasion and that which is far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off: for they must be all quitted: the face must be disordered, the beauty sullied, the mony thrown away, the world renounced, rather than God be

                  <p>I answer: That a man is not tied in that Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical instant in which he remembers his injustice to go and make restitution. He is not tied to go out of the Church, or to rise at midnight, or to leave his meat, as <hi>Tobit</hi> did to go and bury the dead; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

must do it, whether it be convenient or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, whether it be seasonable or not. But every man is bound to do it as soon as he morally can, and he must go about it, as he does about other actions in which he is mightily concerned. If a man d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d diligently examine himself, and yet thought not of the obligation (though that can hardly be supposed; yet if it be so, and he did not think of it) till he were kneeling before the holy Table, then it were sufficient to resolve to do it speedily after, because he cannot without scandal remove and go forth, but without prejudice to his brother he can stay till next day. If he inquired diligently, and had a mind ready to do every thing which he could learn to be his duty, there was no unworthiness in him to hinder him from coming; and this cannot be prejudiced by a new and sudden discovery, if it be entertained with the same justice and readiness of mind. But else; what you can learn in these cases ought to be done at all, must be done before the Communion, if we can: that is, there must be no let in the will, no imperfect resolution, no indifference of affections to it. If it can be done before, it must. For so said our blessed Saviour, <hi>If at the Altar thou remembrest, go and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> That is, if thou art not reconciled, if thou art not in charity, or if thou beest in thy heart still injurious, and hast not a just and a righteous soul, go even from before the Altar; but if thou hast a real charity, and hast done the duties of these graces by a moral diligence; you may come; and a sudden remembrance of an undiscovered obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion need not to expose thee to the reproach of a sudden departure: provided I say alwaies that thou wert indeed truly reconciled, and truly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable. For by our Lords express command you
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98913:151"/>
must at no hand offer till thou beest in charity: till thou hast forgiven, or till thou doest cease to hate, till thou beest <hi>reconciled,</hi> that's our Saviours word; for it is the inward grace which thou art tied to in all circumstances, and therefore in that; but to the outward, something else may be necessary and fit to be considered. Nothing can hinder thee from charity, in any circumstances whatsoever; from present or actual restitution, many things may, and yet thou be innocent. But if thou beest an angry person, or an unjust, or malice be upon thy heart, or injustice upon thy hand, let not thy hand be upon the Altar, nor thy heart upon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If thy Brother hath ought against thee, I know not why thou shouldest make hast to receive the Sacrament, make hast to be reconciled: There is haste of this; there is no such haste of the other, but that thou mayest stay, till thou hast done thy duty.</p>
                  <p>Only remember this: Every deferring of it, is some degree of unwillingness to do it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not good to trust thy own word, till thou hast served thy own end. After thou hast received, thou wilt think that there is less need than before, and therefore thou wilt make less haste. For what a religious man said in the case of a dying person, is also in proportion true of him who is to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. He that will not restore presently if he can, is not to be absolved, is not to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, although he promise restitution. Because it cannot be likely that he intends it heartily, that puts it off longer than the day of its extreme, or the day of its positive necessity.<note place="margin">Qui tardè vult. diu noluit.</note> Let us not deceive our selves: of all the things in the world the holy Sacrament was never intended to give countenance

               <head>SECT. IV. How far we must have proceeded in our General repentance and emendation of our lives before we Communicate?</head>
               <p>TO this I answer, that <hi>No man is fit to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, but he that is fit to die</hi>: that is, he must be in the state of grace; and he must have trimmed his lamp: he must stand readily prepared by a state of repentance; and against the solemn time, he must make that state more actual, and his graces operative.</p>
               <p>Now in order to this, it is to be considered; that preparation to death hath great latitude; and not only he is fit to die who hath attained to the fulness of the stature of Christ, to a perfect man in Christ Jesus; but every one who hath renounced his sin with heartinesse and sincerity, and hath begun to mortifie it. But in these cases of beginning, or of Infancy in Christ; though it be certain that every one who is a new Creature, though but newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98913:153"/>
so, is born of God, and hath life abiding in him, and therefore shall not passe into condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: yet concerning such persons the Rulers of Souls and Ministers of Sacraments have nothing but a judgment of charity, and the sentences of hope relating to the persons; the state is so little and so allayed, and so near to the late state of death from which they are recovering, that God only knows how things are with them; yet because we know that there is a beginning in which new converts are truly reconciled, there is a first period of life, and as we cannot say in many cases that <hi>this is it</hi>; so in many we cannot say, <hi>this is not</hi>; therefore the Church hopes well of persons that die in their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly progressions of piety; and consequently refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses not to give to them these divine Mysteries. Whoever are reconciled to God, may be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Church; whose office it is only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Divine Sentence, and to administer it, and to help towards the verification of it.</p>
               <p>But because the Church cannot be surer of any person that his sins are pardoned, that he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God, that he is in the state of Grace, that if he then dies he shall be saved, than a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self can be of himself and in his own case, which certainly he knows better than any man else; and that our degrees of hope and confidence of being saved when it is not presumption, but is prudent and reasonable, does increase in proportion to our having well used and improved Gods grace, and inlarges it self by our proportions of mortification and spiritual life; and every man that is wise and prudent, abides in fears and uncertain thoughts, till he hath gotten a certain victory over all his sins; and though he dies in hope, yet not without trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, till he finds that he is more than conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98913:153"/>
therefore in proportion to this address to death, must also be our address to the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For no man is fit to die, but he that can be united unto Christ; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he only that can be so, must be admitted to a participation of his body and his bloud. It is the same case, in both we dwell with Christ; and the two states differ but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; it is but a passing from altar to altar, from that where the Minister of the Church officiates, to that where the head of the Church does inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede.</p>
               <p>There is this only difference; there may be some proportions of haste to the Sacrament, more than unto death, upon this account; because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Sacrament in worthy dispositions does increase those excellencies in which death ought to find us; and therefore we may desire to communicate, because we perceive a want of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace; and yet for the same reason we may at the same time be afraid to die; because after that, we can receive no more; but as that finds us, we shall abide for ever. But he that fears justly, may yet in many cases die safely; and he shall find that his fears when he was alive were useful to the caution and zeal and hastiness of repentance; but were no certain indication that God was not reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The best and severest persons do in the greatest parts of their spiritual life complain of their imperfect state, and feel the load of their sins, and apprehend with trembling the sad consequents of their sins, and every day contend against them; and forget all that is past of good actions done, and press forwards still to more grace, and are as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry as if they had none at all and those men if they die, go to Christ and shall reign with him for
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:98913:154"/>
ever; and yet many of them go with a trembling heart, and though considering the infinite obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of them they cannot over-value their sins, yet considering the infinite goodness of God, and his readiness to accept it, they undervalue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and are safe in their humility, and in Gods goodness, when in many other regards they think themselves very unsafe. Now such men as these must not be as much afraid to communicate as they are afraid to die; but these and all men else must not communicate till they be in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that if they did die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would go well with them: and the reason is plain: because every friend of God dying so, is certainly saved; and he that is no friend of God is unworthy to partake of the Table of the Lord.</p>
               <p>But for the reducing the Answer of this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to practice and to particular considerations: I am to advise these things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because no man of an ordinary life, and a newly begun repentance ought hastily to pronounce himself acquitted, and in the state of grace, and in the state of salvation, in this rule of proportion; we are only to take the judgment of charity, not of certainty, and what is usually by wise and good men sup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>osed to be the certain, though the least measure of hopeful expectations in order to death, that we must suppose also to be our least measure of repentance preparatory to the blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This measure must not be taken in the daies of health and carelesness; but when we are either actually in apprehension, or at least in deep medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98913:154"/>
of death; when it is dressed with all such ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and material considerations, that it looks like the King of terrors, and at least makes our spirits full of fear and of sobriety.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This measure must be carefully taken without the allay of foolish principles, or a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less spirit, or extravagant confidences of personal predestination, or of being in any sect; but with the common measures which Christians take when they weigh sadly their sins and their fears of the Divine displeasure; let them take such proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which considering men relie upon when they indeed come to die; for few sober men die upon such wild accounts as they rely upon in talk and interest when they are alive. He that prepares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to death, considers how deeply God hath been displeased, and what hath been done towards a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and he that can probably hope by the usual measures of the Gospel that he is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of pardon, hath by that learnt by what measures he must prepare himself to the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Some persons are of a timorous conscience, and apt to irregular and unreasonable fears, and nothing but a single ray from heaven can give them any portions of comfort, and these men never trust to any thing they do, or to any thing that is done for them; and fear by no other measures but by consideration of the intolerable misery which they should suffer if they did miscarry; and because these men can speak nothing and think nothing comfortable of themselves in that agony, or in that meditation; therefore they can make use of this rule by the proportions of that judgment of charity
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98913:155"/>
which themselves make of others; and in what cases, and in what dispositions they conclude others to die in the Lord; if they take those or the like measures for themselves, and accordingly in those dispositions address themselves to the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will make that use of this rule which is intended, and which may do them benefit.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As there are great varieties and degrees of fitness to death; so also to the holy Sacrament; he that hath lived best, hath enough to deplore when he dies, and causes enough to beg for pardon of what is past, and for aids in the present need; and when he does communicate, he hath in some proportion the same too; he hath causes enough to come humbly, to come as did the Publican, and to say, as did the Centurion, <hi>Lord, I am not worthy</hi>: but he that may die with most confidence because he is in the best dispositions, he also may communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with most comfort, because he does it with most holiness.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But the least measures of repentance; less than which cannot dispose us to the worthy recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the holy Mysteries are these:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As soon as we are smitten with the terrors of an afflicted conscience, and apprehend the evil of sin, or fear the Divine Judgments, and upon that account resolve to leave our sin, we are not instantly worthy and fit to communicate. Attriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a competent disposition to the blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; because although it may be the gate and entrance of a spiritual life, yet it can be no more, unless there be love in it; unless it be contrition, it is not a state of favour and grace, but a disposition
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98913:155"/>
to it. He that does not yet love God, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with Christ; and he that resolves against sin out of fear only, or temporal regards, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven too great testimony that he loves the sin still, and will return to it, when that which hinders him shall be removed. Faith working by charity is the wedding garment; and he that comes hither not vested with this, shall be cast into outer darkness. But the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> are express as to this particular.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> 
                  <hi>In Christ Jesus nothing can avail but faith working by love</hi>; and therefore without this, the Sacrament it self will do no good; and if it does no good, it cannot be but it will do harm. Our repentance disposing us to this Divine feast, must at least be contrition, or a sorrow for sins, and purposes to leave them, by reason of the love of God working in our hearts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But because no man can tell whether he hath the love of God in him, but by the proper effects of love, which is keeping the Commandments; no man must approach to the holy Sacrament upon the account of his mere resolution to leave sin: untill he hath broken the habit, untill he hath cast away his fetters, untill he be at liberty from sin, and hath shaken off its laws and dominion; so that he can see his love to God entring upon the ruines of sin, and perceives that Gods Spirit hath advanced his Scepter, by the declension of the sin that dwelt within; till then he may do well to stand in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Courts; lest by a too hasty entrance into the Sanctuary he carry along with him <hi>the abominable thing,</hi> and bring away from thence the <hi>intolerable sentence</hi> of condemnation. A man cannot rightly judge of his love to God, by his acts and transports of fancy, or the emanations of a warm passion;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98913:156"/>
but by real events and changes of the heart. The reason is plain, because every man hath first loved sin, and obeyed it, and untill that obedience be changed, that first love remains, and that is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inconsistent with the love of God: an act of love, that is, a loving ejaculation, a short prayer affirming and professing love, is a very unsure warrant for any man to conclude that his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is indeed contrition: for wicked persons may in their good intervals have such sudden fires; and all men that are taught to understand contrition to be a sorrow for sins proceeding from the love of God, and that love of God to be sufficiently signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by single acts of loving prayer, can easily by such forms and ready exercises fancy, and conclude themselves in a very good condition at an easie rate. But contrition is therefore necessary, because attrition can be but the one half of repentance; it can turn us away from sin, but it cannot convert us unto God; that must be done by love, and that love, especially in this case, is manifestly nothing else but obedience: and untill that obedience be evident and discernable, we cannot pronounce any comfort concerning our state of love; without which no man can see God, and no man can taste him or feel him without it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A single act of obedience in the instance of any kind where the scene of repentance lies, is not a sufficient preparation to the holy Sacrament, nor demonstration of our contrition: unless it be in the case of repentance only for single acts of sin. In this case, to oppose a good to an evil, an act of proportionable abstinence to a single act of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, for which we are really sorrowful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (as we suppose) heartily troubled, and confess it,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:98913:156"/>
and pray for pardon, may be admitted as a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent testimonial that this sorrow is real, and this repentance is contrition; because it does as much for vertue, as in the instance it did for vice: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies provided that whatsoever aggravations or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental grandeurs were in the sin, as <hi>scandal, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, malice, mischief, hardness, delight,</hi> or <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy,</hi> be also proportionably accounted for in the reckonings of the repentance. But if the penitent return from a habit or state of sin, he will find it a harder work to quit all his old affection to sin, and to place it upon God intirely; and therefore he must stay for more arguments than one or a few single acts of grace: not only because a few may proceed from many causes accidentally, and not from the love of God; but also because his love and habitual desires of sin must be naturally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by many contrary acts of virtue; and till these do enter, the old love does naturally abide. It is true, that sin is extinguished not only by the natural force of the contrary actions of vertue, but by the Spirit of God, by aids from heaven, and powers supernatural; and Gods love hastens ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> pardon and acceptation; yet still, this is done by parts and methods of natural progression; after the manner of nature, though by the aids of God; and therefore it is fit that we expect the changes, and make our judgment by material events, and discerned mutations, before we communicate in these mysteries, in which whoever unworthily does communicate, enters into death.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that hath resolved against all sin, and yet falls into it regula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therefore although he be bitten [or griev'd] with sin, let him for the future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all will to sin, and before he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate let him satisfie with prayers and tears; and being confident of the mercy of our Lord, who uses to pardon sins upon a pious confession, let him come to the Eucharist without doubting. But this I say of him who is not pressed with capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and deadly sins; for such a person, if he will not receive the Eucharist to judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, let him make amends by publick pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and being reconcil'd by the Bishop or Priest, let him communicate. I doubt not also but such grievous sins may be extinguish'd by private satisfactions; but this must be done by changing the course of his life, by a professed study of Religion, by a daily and perpetual mourning or contrition, that through the mercy of God he may do things contrary to these whereof he does repent; and then humbly and suppliant let him every Lords day communicate to the end of his life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This advice of <hi>Gennadius</hi> declares the sentiment of the Church, that none must communicate till they have worthily repented, and in the way of piety and contrition made amends for their faults as well as they may; and have put themselves into a state of vertue contrary to their state of sin, that is, have made progression in the reformation of
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98913:162"/>
their lives; that they are really changed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come new men, not in purpose only, but actually and in the commencement of holy habits. And therefore it is remarkable that he advises that these persons who do not stand in the place of publick penitents, should upon the commission of grievous faults enter into Religion; he means into solitude, and retirement, and renunciation of the world, that by attending wholy to the severities and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a religious life, they may by such strictnesses and constant piety be fitted for the communion. Now whatever ends besides this, the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence might have, yet it is not to be neglected, that when the ancient discipline of the Church, of penances and satisfactions was gone into desuetude, the <hi>Spirit of Religion</hi> entred more fully into the world, and many religious orders and houses were instituted, that at least <hi>there,</hi> the world might practise that severity in private which the change of affairs in the face of the Church had taken from the publick ministeries; Penance went from the Churches into desarts and into Monasteries; but when these were corrupted, and the manners of men were worse corrupted, it is hard to say whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is gone now. It may be yet done in private, and under the hand of a spiritual guide; or by the spirit of penance in the heart of a good man, and by the conduct of a wise counsellor; but besides that the manners of men are corrupted, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines also are made so easie, and the Communion given to sects and opinions, or indifferently to all; that it is very rare to see them who have sinn'd grievously repent worthily; who therefore can never be worthy communicants, for no impenitents can partake of Christ,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Hierom in Isai. c.</hi> 3.

On the other side, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sayes; if thou hast received so great a wound, and contracted so violent a disease, that such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are to be deferr'd; every such man ought by the authority of the Bishop to be remov'd f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98913:164"/>
should be doing penance, and not according to his own pleasure offer himself to, or withdraw himself from the Communion. But if his sins be not so great, as to deserve excommunication, he ought not to separate himself from the dayly medicine of the Lords Body. Between these, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly a man may determine the question better; if he admonishes that men should abide in the peace of Christ. But let every one do what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his faith he piously believes ought to be done. For neither of them dishonours the body and blood of the Lord, if they in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral wayes contend who shall most honour the most holy Sacrament. For <hi>Zachaeus</hi> and the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion</hi> did not prefer themselves before one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when the one received Christ into his house, and the other said he was not worthy to receive him under his roof; both of them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring our Blessed Saviour by a divers, and almost a contrary way, both of them were mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by sins, and both of them obtain'd mercy.</q>] Now from the words of these two Saints put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may collect these resolutions.</p>

lest by frequency of receiving they should less esteem the Divine mysteries, and fall into luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmness and indevotion; the consideration is good: and such persons indeed may not receive it often, but not for that reason; but because they are not fit to receive it at all. For whoever grows worse by the Sacrament, as <hi>Judas</hi> after the Sop, hath an evil spirit within him; for this being by the design of God a savour of life; it is the fault of the receiver if it passes into death, and diminution of the spiritual life. He therefore that grows less devout, and less holy, and less reverent, must start back and take physick and throw out the evil spirit that is within him; for there is a worm in the heart of the tree, a peccant humour in the stomach, it could not be else, that this Divine nutriment should make him sick.</p>

How often should a healthful man eat; or he that hath infirmities, take Physick? And if any man should say that a good man should do well to pray three times a day; he said true; and yet it were better to pray five times, and better yet to pray seven times; but if he does, yet he must leave spaces for other duties. But his best measures for publick and solemn prayer, is the custom of the Church in which he lives; and for private, he can take no measures but his own needs, and his own leisure, and his own desires, and the examples of the best and devoutest persons, in the same circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. And so it is in the frequenting the holy Communion. <hi>The laws of the Church must be his least measure.

                     </note> But if he be a devout person; <hi>the spirit of devotion will be his certain measure</hi>; and although that will consult with prudence and reasonable opportunities, yet it consults with nothing else; but communicates by its own heights and degrees of excellency.<note place="margin">

But I desire these things may be observed:</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="322" facs="tcp:98913:169"/>1. That when the Fathers make a question con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a frequent Communion, they do not dispute whether it be adviseable that good people should communicate every month, or every fortnight, or whether the more devout and less imploy'd may communicate every week; for of this they make no question; but whether every days Communion be fit to be advised, that they question: and I find, that as they are not earnest in that, so they indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely give answer, that a frequent Communion is not to be neglected at any hand, if persons be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily prepared.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The frequency of Communion is to be esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the measures of devout people in every Church respectively. And although in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical Ages they who Communicated but once a fortnight were not esteemed to do it frequently; yet now they who communicate every month, and upon the great Festivals of the year besides, and upon other solemn or contingent occasions, and at marriages, and at visitations of the sick, may be said to communicate frequently, in such Churches where the Laws enjoyn but three or four times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year, as in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches. But this way of estimating the frequency of Communion is only when the causes of inquiry are for the avoiding of scandal, or the preventing of scruples; but else, the inward hunger and thirst, and the spirit of devotion mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to opportunity, can give the truest measures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They that communicate frequently, if they do it worthily, are charitable and spiritual persons, and therefore cannot judge or undervalue others
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98913:169"/>
that do not. For no man knows concerning others by what secret principles and imperfect propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they are guided. For although these measures we meet with in Antiquity are very reasonable, yet few do know them; and all of them do not rely upon them; and their own customs, or the private word of their own guides, or their fears, or the usages of the Church in which they live, or some leading example, or some secret impediment which ought not, but is thought sufficient; any of these, or many other things, may retard even good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons from such a frequency as may please others; and that which one calls opportunity, others do not; but however, no man ought to be prejudiced in the opinion of others: For besides all this now reckoned, The receiving of the holy Sacrament is of that nature of good things which can be suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by internal actions alone, or sometimes by other external actions in conjunction; and it hath a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletory of its own, <hi>viz. Spiritual Communion,</hi> (of which I am to give account in its proper place.) And when we consider that some men are of strict con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and some Churches are of strict Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and will not admit Communicants but upon such terms which some men cannot admit, it will follow that as S. <hi>Austins</hi> expression is, <hi>Men should live in the peace of Christ, and do according to their Faith:</hi> but in these things no man should judge his Brother. In this no man can directly be said to do amiss, but he that loathes Manna, and despises the food of Angels, or neglects the Supper of the Lamb, or will not quit his sin, or contend towards perfection, or hath not the spirit of devotion, or does any way by implication say, That the Table of the Lord is contemptible.</p>

                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:98913:170"/>4. These rules and measures now given, are such as relate to those who by themselves or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are discernably in, or discernably out of the state of grace. But there are some which are in the confines of both states, and neither themselves nor their guides can tell to what dominion they do belong. Concerning such, they are by all means to be thrust or invited forward, and told of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of a real or seeming neutrality in the service of God; of the hatefulnesse of tepidity, of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortablenesse of such an indifference: and for the Communions of any such person, I can give no other advice, but that he take his measures of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency by the Laws of his Church, and add what he please to his numbers by the advice of a spiritual guide, who may consider whether his Penitent, by his conjugation of preparatory actions, and heaps of holy duties at that time usually conjoyn'd, do or is likely to receive any spiritual progresse: For this will be his best indication of life, and declare his uncertain state, if he thrive upon his spiritual nourishment. If it prove otherwise, all that can be said of such persons is, that they are members of the visible Church, they are in that net where there are fishes good and bad, they stand amongst the wheat and the tares, they are part of the lump, but whether leavened or unleavened, God only knows; and therefore they are such to whom the Church denies not the bread of Children; but whether it does them good or hurt, <hi>the day</hi> only will declare: for to such persons as these the Church hath made Laws for the set time of their Communion.<note place="margin">An.

Now by these Laws of the Church, it is intended indeed that all men should be called upon to discusse and shake off the yoke of their sins, and enter into the salutary state of repentance; and next to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Sermons of the Church, she had no better means to ingage them into returns of piety; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that by the grace of God and the blessings of the Sacrament, the repentance which at these times solemnly begins, may at one time or other fix and abide; these little institutions and disciplines being like the sudden heats in the body, which sometimes fix into a burning, though most commonly they go away without any further change. But the Church in this case does the best she can, but does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume that things are well; and indeed as yet they are not: and therefore such persons must passe further, or else their hopes may become illusions, and make the men asham'd.</p>

Of the same consideration it is, if a person whose life should be very exemplar, is guilty of such a single folly which it may be would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour a meaner man, but is a great vanity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to him; a little abstention, and a penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al separation (when it is quit from scandal) was sometimes practis'd in the Ancient Church, and is adviseable also now in fitting circumstances. Thus when <hi>Gerontius</hi> the Deacon had vainly talked that the Devil appear'd to him one night, and that he had bound him with a chain, St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to abide in his house, and not to come to the Church, till by penances and sorrow he had expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such an indiscretion, which to a man had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation for wisdom, is as a fly in a box of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only uselesse, but mischievous.

                  <p n="4">4. One degree of curious caution I find beyond all this, in an instance of St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, in whose life we find, that he abstain'd some days from the holy Communion, because there was found in a Village neer to <hi>Rome</hi> a poor man dead, no man could tell how; but because the good Bishop fear'd he might have been starv'd, and that he died for want of provision; he supposing it might reflect

                  <p>If these things proceed from the sincerity of a well disposed spirit, that can suffer any trouble ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that of sin, the product is well enough, and in all likelihood would always be well, if the case were conducted by a prudent spiritual guide; for then it would not change into scruples and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition.

               <p>THis inquiry will quickly be answered, when we consider that the end why the Church en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns publick or private amends respectively to any convict or confessed Criminal, she only does it as a Mother and a Physician to souls, and a Minister of the Divine Pardon, and the Conductress of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Processes: she does it that the man may be recovered from the snare of the enemy, that she may destroy the work of the Devil, that the sinner may become a good Christian: and therefore the Church, when she conducts any mans repentance, is bound to enjoyn so many external Ministeries, that if they be really joyned with the external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and reformation, will do the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement in the Court of heaven. The Church can exact none but what she can see or some way take external notice of; but by these externals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to minister to the internal repentance; which when it is sufficiently signified by any ways that she may prudently rely upon as testimonies and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of a sufficient internal contrition and real amends, she can require no more, and she ought not to be content with lesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:98913:173"/>It is therefore infinitely unsafe and imprudent to receive the Confessions of Criminals, and after the injunction of certain cursory penances,<note rend="inter">Si cito rediret homo ad pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinam beatitudinem, ludus illi esset cadere in mortem. <hi>S.

And it is as bad when a notorious criminal is put to shame one day, for such a sin which could not have obtain'd the peace of the Church under the severity and strictness of fifteen years, amongst the holy Primitives. Such publick Ecclesiastical penances may suffice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the scandal from the Church, when the Church will be content upon so easie terms; for she only can tell what will please her self. But then such discipline must not be esteem'd a sufficient ministery of repentance, nor a just disposition to pardon. For the Church ought not to give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or to promise the peace of God upon terms easier than God himself requires; and therefore when repentance comes to be conducted by her, she
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:98913:173"/>
must require so much as will extinguish the sin, and reform the man, and make him and represent him good.</p>
               <p>All the liberty that the Church hath in this, is what is given her by the latitude of the judgment of charity; and yet oftentimes a too easie judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the greatest uncharitableness in the world, and makes men confident and careless and deceiv'd: and therefore although gentle sentences are useful when there is danger of dispair or contumacy, yet that is rather a palliation of a disease than a cure; and therefore the method must be chang'd as soon as it can, and the severe and true Sermons of the Gospel must be either proclaimed aloud, or insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated prudently and secretly, and men be taught to rely upon them and their consequents, and upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else; for they will not deceive us. But the corrupt manners of men, and the corrupt doctrines of some Schools, have made it almost impossible to govern souls as they need to be governed.</p>
               <p>The Church may indeed chuse whether she will impose on Criminals any exterior significations of repentance, but accept them to the Communion upon their own accounts of a sincere conversion and inward contrition; but then she ought to do this upon such accounts as are indeed real and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and effective and allowed; that is, when she can understand that such an emendation is made, and the man is really reformed, she can pronounce him pardoned; or which is all one, she may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him. And farther yet; she can by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons declare all the necessary parts of repentance, and the conditions of pardon, and can pronounce limited and hypothetical or conditional pardons;
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:98913:174"/>
concerning which the penitent must take care that they do belong to him. But if she does undertake to conduct any repentances exteriously, it is to very little purpose to do it any way that is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensurate to that true internal repentance which is effective of pardon. Indeed every single act of penance does something towards it; but why something should be enjoyned that is not sufficient, and that falls infinitely short of the end of its desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though the Church may use her liberty, yet it is not easie to understand the reason. But I leave this to the consideration of those who are concerned in Governments publick, or in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conduct of souls, to whom I earnestly and humbly recommend it; and I add this only, that when the Ancient Churches did absolve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate dying penitents, though but newly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from sin, they did it <hi>de benè esse,</hi> or with a hope it might do some good, and because they thought it a case of necessity, and because there was no time left to do better: but when they did as well as they could, they could not tell what God would do; and though the Church did well, it may be it was very ill with the souls departed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that is left to God, it is certain some things were done upon pious confidence and venture, for which there was no promise in the Gospel.</p>
               <p>That which the Church is to take care of is, that all her children be sufficiently taught what are the just measures of preparation and worthy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to these Divine mysteries; and that she admits none, of whom she can tell that they are not worthy; such as are notorious adulterers, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides, incestuous, perjurers, habitually peevish to evil effects, and permanently angry (for this I

It would be hard to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this rule to practice in all these instances, unless it be by consent and voluntary submission of penitent persons. But that which I remark is this: that Proud persons and the Covetous, the Envious and the Angry were esteemed fit to be excommunicate; that is, infinitely unfit to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the blessed Sacrament; and that by the rules of their discipline they were to do many actions of publick and severe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and mortifications before they would admit them.</p>
               <p>Now then the case is this. They did esteem more things to be requir'd to the integrity of repentance, and God not to be so soon reconcil'd, and the Devil not soon dispossess'd, and mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions not so fit to be trusted, and more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to pardon than confession and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing absolution; all this otherwise than we do, and therefore so long as they did conduct repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances; they requir'd it as it should be; being sure that no repentance that was joyned with hope and charity could be too much, but it might quickly be too little; and therefore although the Church may take as little as she please for a testimonial of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and suppose the rest is right though it be not signified; yet when she either in publick or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

is to manage repentances she must use no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but that which will procure pardon, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish both the guilt and dominion of sin. The first may be of some use in government; but of little avail to souls, and to their eternal interest: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the first she may use her liberty and give her self measures, in the latter she hath no other but what are given her by the nature of repentance, and its efficacy and order to pardon, and the designs of God, for the reformation of our souls and the extermination of sin.</p>

               <head>SECT. VI. Whether may every Minister of the Church and Curate of Souls reject impenitent persons, or any criminals from the holy Sacrament, until themselves be satisfied of their repentance and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends?</head>
               <p>SEparation of sinners from the Blessed Sacrament was either done upon confession and voluntary submission of the penitent; or by publick convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and notoreity. Every Minister of religion can do the first, for he that submits to my judgment, does choose my sentence; and if he makes me Judge, he is become my subject in a voluntary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore I am to judge for him when
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:98913:175"/>
it is fit that he should communicate: only, if when he hath made me Judge, he refuses to obey my counsel, he hath dissolved my Government, and therefore will receive no further benefit by me. * But concerning the latter of these; a separation upon publick conviction or notoreity; that requires an authority that is not precarious and changeable. Now this is done two waies; either by authority forbidding, or by authority restraining and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling; that is, by the word of our proper mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, disswading him that is unworthy from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and threatning him with Divine judgments if he does come; or else rejecting of him, in case that he fears not those threatnings, but persists in his desires of having it.</p>
               <p>Now of the first of these, every Minister of the Word and Sacraments is a competent Minister; for all that minister to souls are to tell them of their dangers, and by all the effects of their office to present them pure and spotless unto God; the Seers must take care that the people may see; lest by their blindness they fall into the bottomless pit. And when the Curates of souls have declared the will of God in this instance, and denounced his judgments to unworthy Communicants, and told to all that present themselves who are worthy, and who are not, they have delivered their own souls; all that remains is, that every person take care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his own affairs.</p>
               <p>For the second, <hi>viz</hi> denying to minister to Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals though demanding it with importunity; that is an act of prudence and caution in some cases, and of authority in others. When it is matter of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not a punishment but a medicine; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:98913:176"/>
to those excellent words of S. <hi>Cyprian; To be cast out (viz.</hi>; for a time, from the Communion) <hi>is a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and a degree towards the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our spiritual health:</hi>

                  </note> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is no more; it cannot be pretended to be any mans <hi>right</hi> to do it; but it may be in <hi>his duty</hi> when he can; but therefore this must depend upon the consent of the penitent. For a Physician must not in despite of a man cut off his leg to save his life: the sick man may choose whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he shall or no. But sometimes it is an act of authority; as when the people have consented to such a discipline, or when the secular arm by assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting the Ecclesiastical, hath given to it a power of mixt jurisdiction; that is, when the spiritual power of paternal regiment which Christ hath given to his Ministers the supreme Curates, is made opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive upon the persons and external societies of men. Now of this power the Bishops are the prime and immediate subjects, partly under Christ, and partly under Kings; and of this power, inferiour Ministers are capable by delegation,<note place="margin">See Rule of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, l. 3. c. 3. &amp; 4.</note> but no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; they being but Deputies and Vicars in the cure of souls under their superiours, from whom they have received their order and their charge. And thus I suppose we are to understand the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before our Communion office; which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is seldom practised otherwise than by reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting such persons by way of denunciation of the divine Judgments; and if it be so understood, the Curate hath done his duty which God requires; and I believe the Laws of <hi>England</hi> will suffer him to do no more by his own authority.</p>

do it whose case it is, and who is most concerned that it be done well; let it be done so that it may not be allayed and lessened by the judgment of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and therefore let a man do it himself: For when the Curate comes to do it, he cannot do it well, unless he do it with mercy; for he must make abatements, which the sinners case does not often need in order to his reconciliation and returns to God, where severity is much better than gentle sentences. But the Minister of Religion must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in some cases such persons who ought not to come, and who should abstain when themselves give righteous judgment upon themselves.</p>
               <p>For if it be lawful for Christian people to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with evil persons, it is lawful for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Priests to minister it; it being commanded to the people in some cases to withdraw themselves from a Brother that walks inordinately; but no where commanded, that a Minister of Religion shall refuse to give it to him that requires it, and is within the Communion of the Church, and is not yet as an heathen and a publican: and it is evident, that in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> the Communion was given to persons who for unworthiness fell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the divine anger; and yet no man was reprov'd but the unworthy Communicants, and themselves only commanded to take care of it. For he that says the people may not communicate with wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked persons, falls into the errour of the Donatists, which St. <hi>Austin</hi> and others have infinitely confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but he that says the people may, ought not to deny but that the Priest may; and if he may communicate with him, it cannot be denied but he may minister to him.

               <p>He that communicates every day, must live a life of a continual Religion; and so must he who in any sense communicates frequently, if he does it at all worthily; but he that lives carelesly, and dresses his soul with the beginnings of vertues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

a Communion day, is like him that repents not till the day of his death; if it succeeds well, it is happy for him; but if it does not, he may blame himself for being confident without a promise. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very worthy Communicant must prepare himself by a holy life, by mortification of all his sins, by the acquisition of all Christian graces; and this is not the work of a day, or a week; but by how much the more these things are done, by so much the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we are prepar'd.</p>
               <p>So that the actual addresse and proper prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Blessed Sacrament is indeed an inquiry whether we are habitually prepar'd; that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be in the state of grace; whether we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Christ, whether we have faith and charity, whether we have repented truly. If we be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate next week, or it may be to morrow, these things cannot be gotten to day, and therefore we must stay till we be ready. And if by our want of preparation we be compelled for the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ving of our souls, and lest we die, to abstain from this holy feast, let us consider what our case would be if this should be the last coming of the Brideg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oom. This is but the warning of that; this is but his last coming a little antedated; and God graciously calls us now to be prepared here, that we may not be unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then; but it is a formidable thing to be thrust out when we see others enter.</p>
               <p>And therefore when the Masters of spiritual life call upon us to set apart a day, or two, or three, for preparation to this holy Feast, they do not mean that any man who on the <hi>Thursday</hi> is unfit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, should be fitted to communicate on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>; but that he should on those days try whether
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:98913:187"/>
he be or no, and pass from one degree of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a greater, from the less perfect to the more; for let us think of it as we please, there is no other preparation; and it might otherwise seem a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to us, why St. <hi>Paul</hi> who particularly speaks of it, and indeed the whole New Testament, should say nothing of any particular preparation to this holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>SECT. II. Rules for Examination of our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences against the day of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</head>
               <p>HOw we are to examine our selves concerning such states of life and conjugations of duty as are properly relative to the great and essential preparation and worthiness to communicate, I have already largely consider'd <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>: Now I shall add such practical advices which may with advantage mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to the actual reception, such which concern the immediate preparatory and ornamental address; that we may reduce the former Doctrine to action and exercise against that time; and this will serve as an appendix, and for the compleating the former measures.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the days of your address consider the greatness of the work you go about; that it is the highest mystery of the whole Religion you handle; that it is no less than Christ himself in Sacrament that you take; that as sure as any Christian does ever receive the Spirit of God, so sure every good man receives Christ in the Sacrament; that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Christ in Sacrament is not a diminution or lessening of the blessing; it is a real communion with him, to all material events of blessing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; that now every Communicant does an act
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:98913:188"/>
that will contribute very much to an happy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy eternity; that by this act and its appendages a man may live or die for ever; that a man cannot at all be supposed in any state, that this thing will be indifferent to him in that state, but will set him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to some very great event; that this is the greatest thing that God gives us in the world, and if we do it well, it is the greatest thing we can do in the world; and therefore when we have consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered these things in general, let us examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be persons in any sense fitted to such glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous communications, and prepar'd by such disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the greatnesse of the Mystery may in its appearance seem to require. Some may perceive their disproportion at the first sight, and need to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine no farther. It is as if a Jew in <hi>Rome</hi> with his basket and bottle of hay should be advised to stand Candidate for the Consulship; you mock him if you speak of it: and therefore if you find your case like this, start back and come not neer. It is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, there's Divinity in it; and to the wicked it brings <hi>brimstone</hi> and fire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next to this general consideration, examine your self concerning those things in which you are or may be offensive to others: For although every man is to begin at home, yet that which is first to be chang'd is that which is not only evil in it self, but afflictive to others; that which is sin and shame, that which offends God and my neighbour too; that is, it is criminal, and it is scandalous. Examine therefore thy self about injuriousness, robbery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, obloquy, scolding, much prating, peevish conversation, ungentle nature, ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ness to quarrel, and the like: For thus if like <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> we walk unblameably, and unreprovable before
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:98913:188"/>
all the world, certain it is, the Church will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject us from the Communion; and we have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd a good deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee in the faith, and shall think our condition worth preserving and worth impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Examine thy self concerning all entercourses in the matter of men, whether any unhandsome contract was made, any fraudulent bargain, any sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise or out-witting of thy weaker, thy confident, or unwary Brother; and whatever you do, place that right: For money is a snare; and in contracts we are of all things soonest deceived, and are very often wrong, and yet never think so, and we do every thing before we part with this. But when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing is set right here, we may better hope of other things; for either they are right, or will with less difficulty be made so.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Like to this, for the matter of the inquiry, is that we examine our selves in the matter of our debts, whether we detain them otherwise than in justice we are oblig'd? Here we must examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be able to pay them? If so, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently or afterwards? By what we are disabled? Whether we can and ought to alter the state of our expences? What probability we have to pay them at all? How we can secure that they shall be paid? and if they cannot, how much can we do towards it? And what amends can we make to our Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors? And how we mean to end that entercourse? For this ought to be so far at least stated, that we may be sure we do no injustice, and do no injury that we can avoid. This is a material consideration, and of great effect unto the peace of conscience, and a worthy dispo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ition to the holy Communion.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:98913:189"/>5. Let us examine our selves how we spend our time. Is it imployed in an honest calling, in worthy studies, in useful business, in affairs of government, in something that is charitable, in any thing that is useful? But if we throw away great portions of it, of which we can give no sober account; although the Laws chastise us not, and appoint no guardians to conduct our estates, as it does to fools and mad men; yet we are like to fall into severer hands; and God will be angry. But they are very unfit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain Christ, who when they have received his Sacrament resolve to dwell in idleness and foolish divertisements, and have no business but recreation. At the best, it is but a suspicious state of life, that can give no wise account to God and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Examine thy self in the particulars of thy relation; especially where thou governest and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest accounts of others, and exactest their faults, and art not so obnoxious to them as they to thee. Princes, and Generals, and Parents, and Husbands, and Masters think more things are lawful to them towards their inferiours, than indeed there are; and as they may easily transgress in discipline and reproof, so they very often fail in making provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the souls and bodies of their inferiours; and proceed with more confidence and to greater progressions in evil because they pass without animadversion, or the notice of laws. These per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are not often responsible <hi>to</hi> their subordinates, but alwaies <hi>for</hi> them; and therefore it were good that we took great notice of it our selves, because few else do.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:98913:189"/>7. Let us examine our selves concerning the great and little accidents of our private entercourse and conversation in our family; especially between man and wife in the little quarrellings and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal unkindnesses wherein both think themselves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and it may be both are to blame. If the matter be disputable, then do thou dispute it with thy self, or rather condemn thy self; for if it be fit to be questioned, it is certainly in some measure fit to be repented of. For either in the thing it self, or in the misapprehension of the thing, or in the not expounding it well, or in the not suffering it, or in the not concealing it, or in the not turning it into vertue, or in the not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving it, or not conducting it prudently, it is great odds but thou art to blame. These little <hi>rencontres</hi> between man and wife are great hindrances to <hi>prayer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.7.</note> as St. <hi>Peter</hi> intimates; and by consequence do infinitely indispose us to the <hi>greatest solennity of prayer,</hi> the holy Sacrament; and therefore ought to be strictly surveyed, and the principles rescinded, and the beginnings stopt, or else we shall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate without fruit.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Be sure against a day of Communion to examine thy self in those things which no law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, but yet are of ill report, such as are sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous and expensive cloathing, great feasts, gaudy dressings, going often to Taverns, phantastick fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of fashions, inordinate merriments, living beyond our means; in these and the like, we must take our measures by a proportion to the prudence and severity of Christian Religion, and by obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the customs and usages of the best and wisest persons in every condition of men and women. For that we do <hi>things which are of good
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:98913:190"/>
report</hi> is a precept of the Apostle: and as by little illnesses in the body; so by the smallest indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the soul, if they be proceeded in, we may finish <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he method of an eternal death. And these things, although when they are argued, may in many particulars by witty men be represented in themselves as innocent, yet they proceed from an evil and unsafe principle, and not from a spirit fitted to dwell with Christ, and live upon Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and secret participations.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Let us with curiosity examine our souls in such actions which are condemned by the Laws of God and man respectively, but are not defined, and the guilty person cannot in many cases be argued and convinced; such as are pride and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness. For when external actions can proceed from many principles, as a haughty gate from pride, or an ill habit of body, or imitation, or carelesness, or humour; it will be hard for any man to say, I am proud because I lift up my feet too high; and who can say that a degree of care and thriftiness in my case and in my circumstances is covetousness? Here as we must be gentle to others, so we must be severe to our selves; and not only condemn the very first entries of an infant sin; but suspect his approaches, and acknowledge a fault before it be certain and evident.</p>
               <p>In these things we must the rather examine our selves; because we can be the most certain accusers of our selves; and the inquiries are of great concernment, because they are that curiosity of piety and security of condition which becomes persons of growth in grace, and such as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly fitted to the Communion: and indeed they
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:98913:190"/>
are of things most commonly neglected; men usually living at that rate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if they be not scandalous, they suppose themselves to be Saints and fitted for the nearest entercourse with Christ.</p>
               <p>These instances of examination do suppose that we have already examined our selves concerning all habits of sin, and laid aside every discernable weight, and repented of every observed crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal action; and broken every custome of lesser irregularities, and are reformed by the measures of Laws and express Commandments, and are changed from death to life; and that we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons so far advanced that we need not to regard what is behind, but to press forward towards the state of a perfect man in Christ Jesus. For he that is in that state of things, that he is to examine how many actions of uncleanness, or intemperance, or slander he hath committed since the last Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, is not fit to come to another, but must change his life, and repent greatly before he comes hither.</p>

IF on a Communion-day, we need very much examination, we can make but little supply of those many defects which it is likely a diligent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry will discover; and therefore it is highly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable, that as we ought to repent every day, and not put it all off till the day of our Communion or our death; so we should every day examine our selves, at the shutting in of the day, or at our going to bed; for so St. <hi>Basil,</hi> St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>

The more weaknesses we shall observe, and 2. the more faults correct, and 3. watch the better, and 4. repent the more perfectly, and 5. offend less, and 6. be more prepared for death, and 7. be more humble, and 8. with ease prevent the contracting of evil habits, and 9. inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the union of little sins into a chain of death,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:98913:191"/>
and 10. more readily prevail upon our passions, and 11. better understand our selves, and 12. more frequently converse with God, and 13. oftner pray, and 14. have a more heavenly conversation, and in fine, 15. be more fitted for a frequent and holy Communion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The end of examination is, 1. That we grieve for all our sins. 2. That we resolve to amend all. * 3. That we actually watch and pray against all: Therefore it is necessary that when we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined against a Communion day; 1.

               <p n="3">3. He that would communicate with fruit must so have ordered his examinations, that he must not alwaies be in the same method. He must not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be walking with a candle in his hands, and prying into corners; but they must be swept and garnished, and be kept clean and adorned. His examinations must be made full and throughly and be productive of inferiour resolutions, and must pass on to rules and exercises of caution. That is, 1. We must consider where we fail oftenest. 2. From what principle this default comes. 3. What are the best remedies. 4. We must pass on to the real and vigorous use of them: and when the case is thus stated and drawn into rules and resolutions of acting them; we are only to take care we do so; and every day examine whether we have or no. But we must not at all dwell in this relative and preparatory and ministring duty. But if we find
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98913:192"/>
that we have reason to do so; let us be sure that something is amiss; we have played the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and done the work of the Lord negligently or falsly.</p>

For this is a day of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and every sacrifice must be consumed by fire, and therefore, now is the day of improvement, and the proper season for the zeal of duty; and if upon the solemn day of the soul we do not take care of omissions, and repair the great and little forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesses, and omissions of duty, and pass from the infirmities of a man to the affections of a Saint, we may all our life time abide in a state of lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, disimprovement and indifference; To this purpose,</p>

But be sure never to think you are at all

               <p n="7">7. Upon or against a Communion day endeavour to put your soul into that order and state of good things, as if that day you were to die; and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that unless you dare die upon that day, if God should call you, there is but little reason you should dare to receive the Sacrament of life, or the ministry of death. He that communicates worthily is justified from sins; and to him death can have no sting, to whom the Sacrament brings life and health; and therefore let every one that is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate place himself by meditation in the gates of death, and suppose himself seated before the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal of Gods Judgment, and see whether he can reasonably hope that his sins are pardoned, and cured, and extinguished. And then if you judge righteous judgement, you will soon find what pinches most, what makes you most afraid, what was most criminal, or what is least mortified; and so you will learn to make provisions accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>

If you find any thing yet amiss, or too suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or remaining to evill purposes, the reliques of the scattered enemy after a war, resolve to use some general instrument of piety or repentance, that may, by being useful in all the parts of your life and conversation, meet with every stragling irregularity, and by perpetuity and an assiduous force clear the coast. 1. Resolve to have the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:98913:193"/>
of God frequently in your thought. 2. Or endeavour and resolve to bring it to pass to have so great a dread and reverence of God, that you may be more ashamed and really troubled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded to sin in the presence of God than in the sight and observation of the best and severest man. 3. Or else resolve to punish thy self with some proportionable affliction of the body or spirit for every irregularity or return of undecency in that instance in which thou sets thy self to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any one special passion or temptation: Or 4. Firmly to purpose in every thing which is not well, not to stay a minute, but to repent instantly of it, severely to condemn it, and to do something at the first opportunity for amends: Or 5. To resolve against an instance of infirmity for some short, sure, and conquerable periods of time: as if you be given to prating, resolve to be silent, or to speak nothing but what is pertinent for a day; or for a day not to be angry; and then sometimes for two daies; and so diet your weak soul with little por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of food till it be able to take in and digest a full meal: Or 6. Meditate often every day of death, or the day of judgment. By these and the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments it will happen to the remains of sin, as it did to the Aegyptians; what is left by the Hail, the Catterpiller will destroy; and what the Catter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piller leaves, the Locusts will eat.

               <p n="1">1. O Blessed Lord, our gracious Saviour and Redeemer Jesus, King of Kings and Lord of Lords; thou art fairer than the children of men; upon thee the Angels look and behold and wonder; what am I O Lord, that thou who fillest heaven and earth, shouldst descend and desire to dwell with me, who am nothing but folly and infirmity, misery and sin, shame and death?</p>
               <p n="2">2. I confess, O God, that when I consider thy greatness and my nothing, thy purity and my uncleanness, thy glory and my shame; I see it to be infinitely unreasonable and presumptuous that I should approach to thy sacred presence, and desire to partake of thy Sacraments, and to enter into thy grace, and to hope for a part of thy glory. But when I consider thy mercy and thy wisdome, thy bounty and thy goodness, thy readiness to forgive, and thy desires to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part thy self unto thy servants; then I am

But if I come to thee, I bring an unworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be united unto thee; if I come not, I shall remain unworthy for ever; If I stay away, I fear to lose thee; If I come, I fear to offend thee, and that will lose thee more, and my self too at last. I know O God I know, my sins have separated between me and my God; but thy love and thy passion, thy holiness and thy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience hath reconciled us: and though my sins deter me, yet they make it necessary for me to come; and though thy greatness amazes me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it is so full of goodness that it invites me.</p>

                  </gap>asted before they communicated, did not only give scandal to the Religion, but did infinitely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispose them that came, and dishonour the Divine Mysteries; and such feastings would for ever be a temptation and a snare, and therefore could not be cured so well as by taking the occasion away; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these things, the Church observed, that in the time of the Synagogue, the Servants of God did religiously abstain from meat and drink upon all their solemn feast days, till their great Offices of Religion were finish'd; and that upon this account the Jews were scandaliz'd at the Disciples for eating the ears of corn early on their Sabbath; and Christ
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:98913:198"/>
excus'd them only upon the reason of their hunger, that is, upon necessity or charity: and after all, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by natural reason and experience we find that they pray and worship best who are not loaden with meat and drink; and that therefore this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity being the greatest worship of God in the whole Religion, consequently ought to be done with all advantages; it was therefore very reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the Church took up this custom; and therefore they who causelesly do prevaricate it, shall bear their own burden, and are best reproved by St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words. <hi>We have no such custom, nor the Churches of God.</hi> But sick people and the weak are as readily to be excused in this thing, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were by Christ in the case before mentioned: For necessity and charity are to be preferr'd before such ceremonies and circumstances of address.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When you awake in the morning of your Communion day, give God thanks particularly that he hath blessed thee with so blessed an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of receiving the Symbols of pardon, the ministery of the Spirit, the Sacrament of Christ himself, the seed of immortality, and the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past of heaven, and hasten earlier out of your bed: The cock crowing that morning is like the noise that is made of the coming of the Bridegroom; and therefore go out to meet him, but rise that you may trim your lamp. When you are up, presently address your self to do such things as you would willingly be found doing when the Bridegroom calls, and you are to appear before him to hear your final sentence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Make a general confession of your sins, and be very much humbled in the sense and apprehension of them. Compare the state and union of all your
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:98913:198"/>
evils, with the state and grandeur of that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour which God intends that day to consign to you; and then think what you are, and what God is; what you have done, and what God intends to do; how ill you have deserved, and yet how graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously you are dealth with. And consider what an infinite distance there is between that state which you have deserved, and that good which you are to have; by considering how intolerable your case would have been, if God had dealt with you as you deserve, and as he hath dealt with very many who sinn'd no more than you have done; and yet in what felicities you are placed by the mercies of your good God; that you are in the hopes, and in the methods, and in the participations of pardon and eternal life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The effect of this consideration ought to be, that you make acts of general contrition for all your sins known and unknown: That you renew your purposes and vows of better obedience: That you exercise acts of special graces; and that you give God most hearty and superexalted thanks with all the transports and ravishments of spirit, for so unspeakable, so unmeritable, so unrewardable a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindness.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Worship Jesus</hi>: Love him; dedicate thy self to him; recollect what he hath done for thy soul, what glories he laid aside, with what meanness he was invested, what pains he suffered, what shame he endur'd, what excellencies he preach'd what wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom he taught, what life he liv'd, what death he died, what Mysteries he hath appointed, by what ministeries he conveys himself to thee, what rare arts he uses to save thee; and after all,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:98913:199"/>
that he intercedes for thee perpetually in heaven, presenting to his heavenly Father that great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of himself which he finished on the Cross, and commands thee to imitate in this Divine and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Sacrament; and in the midst of these thoughts and proportionable exercises and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, address thy self to the solemnities and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of the day.</p>

Remember that by mercy to the poor the sentence of dooms-day shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; because what we do to them we do to Christ; and who would not relieve Christ who hath made himself poor to make us rich? And what time is so seasonable to feed the members of Christ, as that, when he gives his body to feed us, and that, when his members are met together to confess, to celebrate, to remember, and to be joyned to their head and to one another? In short, The Church alwaies hath used at that time to be liberal to her poor; and that being so seasonable and blessed an opportunity, and of it self also a proper act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and sacrifice, of religion and homage, of thankfulness and charity; it ought not to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and it can have no measure, but that of your

Thou hast made me, and fed me, and blessed me, and preserved me, and sanctified me that I might love thee, and thou would'st have me to love thee, that thou mayest love me for ever. O give me a love to thee that I may love thee as well as ever any of thy servants loved thee; according to that love which thou by the Sacrament of love workest in thy secret ones.</p>

O most merciful and gracious God, Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory; thou art the great lover of souls, and thou hast given thy holy Son to die for our salvation, to redeem us from sin, to destroy the work of the Devil, and to present a Church to thee pure and spotless and undefiled; relying upon thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, trusting in thy promises, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my dearest Lord into my soul, I humbly represent to thy divine Majesty the glorious sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which our dearest Jesus made of himself upon the Cross, and by a never ceasing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession now exhibites to thee in heaven in the office of an eternal Priesthood; in behalf of all that have communicated this day in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mysteries in all the Congregations of the Christian world; and in behalf of all them that desire to communicate, and are hindred by sickness or necessity, by fear or scruple, by censures Ecclesiastical, or the sentence of their own consciences.</p>

               <head>SECT. III. An Advice concerning him who only Communicates Spiritually.</head>
               <p>THere are many persons well disposed by the measures of a holy life to communicate fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently; but it may happen that they are unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably hindred. Some have a timerous conscience, a fear, a pious fear, which is indeed sometimes more pitiable than commendable. Others are advis'd by their spiritual Guides to abstain for a time, that they may proceed in the vertue of repentance fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet, before they partake of the Sacrament of love: and yet if they should want the blessings and graces of the Communion, their remedy which is intended them would be a real impediment. Some are scandalized and offended at irremediable mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages in publick Doctrines or Government, and cannot readily overcome their prejudice, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile their consciences to a present actual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Some dare not receive it at the hands of a wicked Priest of notorious evil life. Some can have it at no Priest at all, but are in a long journey, or under a Persecution, or in a Country of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering perswasion. Some are sick; and some can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have it every day, but every day desire it.</p>

with all the essential and ornamental measures of address, and eanestly desire that they could actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communicate, they may place themselves upon their knees, and building an Altar in their heart, celebrate the death of Christ, and in holy desire joyn with all the Congregations of the Christian world, who that day celebrate the holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and may serve their devotion by the former Prayers and actions Eucharistical, changing only such circumstantial words which relate to the actual participation: And then they may remember and make use of the comfortable Doctrine of S. <hi>Austin</hi>;<note place="margin">Serm. 11. de verbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To this nothing is necessary to be added, but that this way, is to be used never but upon just necessity,
