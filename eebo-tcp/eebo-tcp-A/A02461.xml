            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath bin (Christian Reader) in the chiefe of my deſires, to ſeeke the peace of this church &amp; kingdome in which wee liue: to that end, being called to ſpeak at a viſitation vnto my brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I choſe to intreate of thoſe words in the Pſalme: <hi>O pray for the peace of Ieruſalem: let them proſper that loue her.</hi> In the vnfolding of which, according to that meaſure of grace, that God had giuen me; I ſought with all mildnes, to perſwade thoſe of my brethren (whoſe labours hath bin moſt fruitfull in the Lord) that for a Croſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18483:3"/>
and a Surpleſſe, they would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the worke of their God, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the people of their charge, of that bleſſed comfort which by their preaching they once receaued. At this I aimed, and their vntimely ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence (which after followed) I then greatly feared. Thus my loue to them, and the houſe of our God, imboldned me to ſpeak, that which <hi>Cartwright, Beza,</hi> and other of reuerend memory, before had deliuered: that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to vndergoe thoſe diſliked ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then for them to forſake their calling, to deſpiſe the flocke of Christ Ieſus, ouer which the holy Ghost had made them ouerſeers. For the queſtion then was not (as ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceaued) what in thoſe ceremonies was conuenient; that was by our rulers before ouerru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but what in this caſe, was for vs, and Gods Church moſt expedient: whether with them to continue, the
<pb facs="tcp:18483:3"/>
worke of our ministrie, or by our refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to yeeld co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to them, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the people of our charge, &amp; to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that holy functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vnto which God had called vs. This was the queſtion; to this, not only for the better ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men, but of our God; wee were to anſwere. And although thou ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt to the world for thy excuſe, to lay the cauſe and blame of this thy ſilence vpon thy rulers; becauſe they will not permit to thee the exerciſe of thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie, except thou ſubmit thy ſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe their impoſed ceremonies: yet becauſe thou art to anſwere, not ſo much for thy rulers and their doings, as for thy ſelfe and thy doings vnto thy God; enter into the chamber of thy conſcience, there ſeriouſly conſider, whether (the Magiſtrate comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding theſe) it be better for thee, to forſake theſe together with thy miniſtrie; or with theſe, (although with thy diſtaſt
<pb facs="tcp:18483:4"/>
and ſome diſlike) to continue thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed labours in the croſſe of God. This is that, on which wee ſhould eſpecially looke, what vpon their command is beſt beſeeming vs to doe. O let Gods glory and the good of his Church, ſo farre as it may be, euer weigh with vs. I doubt not but that thou wilt ſay, ſo it ſhall euer be with thee: but yet thou replieſt, thou maieſt not doe euill that good may come thereof; that God will haue his glory ſought by ſuch meanes which he approueth: this that is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is not that which God approueth, nay it is euil. This thing is in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; many (thou knoweſt) haue laboured to proue that they are not euil, that they are not ſuch which God hath diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Alas theſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely, galfull, and malice-ſhewing ſpeeches, as darke clouds obſcure the truth of Chriſts Goſpel; theſe as thorns in their eyes wound the conſciences of the weake, making them to thinke and ſay that ſuch bitter waters cannot flow from the profeſſors of Gods truth; theſe make <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Askalon</hi> of the vncircumciſed to reioyce, and giue great adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage to their cloſe-followed cauſe.

For they make the Croſſe in Baptiſme a needfull ceremonie; wee a conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: they ſigne the baptiſed and the water ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; we once: they put ſome religion and holines in the ſigne; wee put none: they croſſe the baptiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he receiueth his Chriſtendome; we after, and after he is receiued as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Church: they to driue out the diuell, and by that ſigne to feare him from returning; wee that it might

be an honorable badge, to remember vs with all boldneſſe to confeſſe Chriſt crucified, and to repute the cauſe of all our happines, the merit of Chriſts Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion endured on the Croſſe. Well may therfore the Croſſe be vſed of vs, which hath been moſt ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed by them. And ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by this ſigne thus remaining with vs, (ſince all other vſe of the croſſe is in no vſe with vs) wee may ſtop the mouthes of the ſlaundering Papiſts, which ſay that wee are enemies to Chriſt, and to his Croſſe: becauſe our Rulers haue broken downe his Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes and Croſſes, and becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not (as their Fathers did) ſigne themſelues with the ſign of the Croſſe. For this ſigne thus vſed in Baptiſme, ſheweth that wee are not enemies to Chriſt nor to his Croſſe, but to their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry &amp; ſuperſtition. And although we do not liue among the Iewes and Pagans, which ſeeke to ſhame vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we put our truſt in him, that was hanged on a tree: by this Croſſe to ſhew them, that that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch

wee repute our glory: yet ſince this is a doctrine needfull for all ſorts to learne, that not in the miniſter or water, but in the blood of Ieſus, they attaine the waſhing away and remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſinnes; ſince of this many of the people are very ignorant, not only by the word and Sacraments, the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed meanes of God, but by this ſigne alſo the people may be remembred as thought the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers, that Chriſt died for them on the Croſſe.<note place="margin">

that long before the time of <hi>Gregorie</hi> the Great, the faith of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, but not Engliſh (for of them in thoſe former times no mention is made) was famous amongſt all the Churches of God. Wherefore I would aduiſe thoſe my brethren, which are ſo ready to find fault with others, more aduiſedly to conſider of this and other their poſitions, before with ſo blacke a cole, they note their brethren for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters abroach of Popiſh errors.

The which although I will not take vpon mee at this time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, yet vpon theſe reaſons (iudge you what I ſay) I thinke that the Britaines firſt receaued Chriſtianity, not from Rome, but from ſome other place. For although all antiquity doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which we cannot gain-ſay, that of the Britaines, <hi>Lucius</hi> was the firſt Chriſtened King: yet as Chriſts religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was long before in Rome, before the Emperours embraced it, and were baptiſed: ſo might Chriſtianity be long before in this Iland, before the Prince receaued it, and by his publike autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity gaue countenance to it.<note place="margin">Joan.
