            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Queen of Great Brittaine (through the intention that She hath had to
preſerve the amity between the King and the Lords States) having omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

She doth finde her ſelfe at preſent ſo highly offended, that ſhe cannot
any longer (with the honour of the King) abſtain from making this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
which ſhe doth make to the Lords the States, upon the Order which hath beene
given to ſearch and arreſt a Veſſell which ſhe hath fraighted and laden with divers goods
belonging to her, for which the Lords States have granted her a Paſport; The Queene
doth make no difficulty to avouch the tranſporting of Ammunition, as far as it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary for her ſafeguard; She hath choſen to furniſh her ſelfe this way, rather
then by that of asking a licenſe, becauſe of an Order made by the States to hinder the
tranſporting of Armes and Ammunition for the King, or for the Parliament; which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the King hath had great reaſon to think very partiall for the Parliament, paralelling
them with him; but the not obſerving of this Order hath been more offenſive to him,
eſpecially ſince the aboveſaid <hi>Parliament</hi> have cauſed much Ammunition to bee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
over, and have bought Veſſels, to imploy them againſt the King. If the Queene
hath not demanded a licenſe for the things that ſhe had need of, it was not to put the
States to ſo much trouble, nor to deviate from their Order, nor juſtly to offend the King,
but rather that all the endeavoures of the Queene, and the precautions to preſerve the
good correſpondence between the King and the Lords States (which is eſtabliſhed by ſo
many Treaties) hath produced nothing but a Continuation of affronts and prejudice to
the Kings ſervice, ſhe is bound to make this Declaration:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THat ſhe doth receive this Order given for the arreſting of her Ship as a notable inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

               <lb/>
               <hi>WHerefore ſhee doth beleeve that the Lords States having better conſidered on it,
will connive for the departure of her Veſſell, with all that it doth carry for her
Service, without which the Queene is bound to demonſtrate to the Lords States, that this
injuſtice and affront, which ſhe ſhall receive by the arreſt of this Veſſell, cannot paſſe for
leſſe then a violating of the league betwixt the King and the States; the conſequences
whereof will be very dangerous, wherefore ſhe hopes that they will give ſuch a juſt cauſe
to the King and her of ſuch a diſpleaſure:</hi>
