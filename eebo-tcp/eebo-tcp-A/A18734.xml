            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHTE worshipfull his tried and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friend, Maister Christofor Hatton Esquier, Captaine of the Queenes Maiesties Garde, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of her highnesse priuie Chamber.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He long liking and good wyll with the fast frendship I finde in you (good maister Hatton) procures my penne presently to performe that I promised, no smal time since, touching a booke of al my English verses in miter. The offer wherof came from my selfe, not for the goodnes of the matter, but for the parfitnesse of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> persone to whom I me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to dedicate my woorke. And albeit your valeur may not bee seen in so simple a glas, yet I hope this my woorkes shall not hinder your deserued renowm, nor breed occasion to mislike my vnbridled boldnes. And for that from my head, hand and penne, can floe no farre fatched eloquence, nor sweete sprinklyng speaches (seasoned with spiced termes) I call my workes <hi>Churchyardes Chips,</hi> the basnes wherof can beguild no man with better opinion, than the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb facs="tcp:5240:3"/>
it selfe doth import, and in deed if any other tietle had bene geuen to my trifles, than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of chips, men might haue hoped for gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer matter then the natuer of my verses can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. VVherefor I prepared a title aunswerable to the weight of the worke, misdoubting not but that you will of cortesie behold what blaes of good wyll these my Chips will vtter to the worlde. Assuring my selfe and my friendes, that herein is no kinde of sparke, neither hurtfull nor vncomly. But as the world may iudge, among many chips may be sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie woodes, so the worst of them all makes but a crack, consumes with the coales, and turneth vnto sinders. VVhat fier can be made where neither smoek can be seen, nor hissing of stickes maye bee hard? And yet those two properties agree in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end to one flame, effect and purpose. I write of seuerall thinges, whose sondry foundations might leade me to diuers subiectes, but each of them in deede ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to one mans cogitacion and duetifull dealing towardes God and my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. And none of them hath any humour or disease, but sutch as eury body may broke, disgeste, and embrace, (bearing any graine of fauour to the wrytter) whiche I hope makes the reddier passage to that which I caused
<pb facs="tcp:5240:3"/>
to be Printed. My first booke hath but few things in it, but such varietie of matter as shall breed to the Reader rather pleasure than painfulnes. And the second shall contain a nomber of things I trust of no lesse pastime and commodity, waying mirrely the meaning of my Imaginacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. Thus making my choice of a sufficiente patroen, for a farre better woorke than my cunning can performe, (and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vnder the target of your protection) I weery you no further in reading of this my plain Epistle, committing to the Almighty, your worship, good naem, and most desired felicitie, with increace of wished fortune.</p>
