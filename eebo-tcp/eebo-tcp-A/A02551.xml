            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I doubt not but ſome will
bee ready to ſet this ſacred
Prognoſtication to another
Meridian; and indeed wee
know a generation that loues
themſelues too well, much
more then peace and truth;
ſo couetous that they would
catch all the world in S. <hi>Peters</hi>
net; proud boaſters of their
owne merits, perfections, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogations;
it would bee
long (though eaſie) to follow
all: we know where too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
treaſons are hatched; wee
know who in the height of
minde exalts himſelfe aboue
all that is called God; wee
know where pleaſure hath the
moſt delicate and debauch'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3864:5"/>
Clients; we know where De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
is profeſſedly formall,
and liues impure; and ſurely,
were wee clearely innocent of
theſe crimes, I ſhould be the
firſt that would caſt this ſtone
at <hi>Rome:</hi> but now, that wee
ſhare with them in theſe ſins,
there is no reaſon wee ſhould
bee ſeioyned in the Cenſure.
Take it among yee therefore,
yee Hypocrites of all profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
for it is your owne; <hi>Yee
haue a forme of Godlineſſe, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is an Hypocrite but a
Player, the <hi>Zani</hi> of Religion?
(as ye heard lately:) a Player
acts that he is not; ſo doe ye,
act good, and are wicked;
here is a ſemblance of good,
a forme of Godlineſſe; here
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3864:5"/>
is a reall euill, a deniall of the
power of Godlineſſe. There
is nothing ſo good as Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
yea, there is nothing
good but it; nothing makes
Godlineſſe to be good, or to
be Godlineſſe, but the power
of it; for it is not, if it worke
not, and it workes not if not
powerfully; now the denyall
of good muſt needs bee euill;
and ſo much more euill, as the
good which is denyed is more
good; and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall
of the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
muſt needs bee as ill, as
the forme or ſhew of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
would ſeeme good; and
as the power of Godlineſſe is
good: this is therefore the
perfect hypocriſie of faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Chriſtians; they haue the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3864:6"/>
forme, they deny the power;
here is then a direct and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

            </p>
            <p>As all ſinne is originally
from the Diuell, ſo eſpecially
Hypocriſie; hee is the father

1. TIM. 3. 2. <hi>in Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
ſpeaking Lyes.</hi> Now as
all things are more eminent in
their cauſes and originals, then
in the effects deriued from
them; ſo it muſt needs be ſaid,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3864:6"/>
that the greateſt Hypocrite in
the World is the Diuell: I
know hee heares what I ſay,
but wee muſt ſpeake truth
and ſhame him: For <hi>Satan is
trasformed into an Angel of light,</hi>
ſaith the Apoſtle; not he was,
but he is; ſo transformed that
he neuer did, neuer will put
off that counterfeit: and as all
his Impes are partakers of the
Satanicall nature; ſo in euery
Hypocrite there is both the
Angel and the Diuell; the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
Angel, is the <hi>forme of
Godlineſſe,</hi> the reall Diuell is
the <hi>denyall of the power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</hi>
It muſt be in another
ſenſe that that father ſaid, <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia
tempore poſterior eſt quam
malitia,</hi> I am ſure the Angel of
light was before the Satan; and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3864:7"/>
now becauſe hee is Satan, hee
puts on the Angel of light;
ſuch ſhall be our method in
this Hypocrite wee treat of:
firſt wee will begin with the
Angell of Hypocriſie; and
then ſhew you the Diuell in
his true ſhape.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, here is a forme,
and but <hi>a forme of Godlineſſe;</hi>
A forme do's well, but if it be
but a forme, it is an immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſhadow of Pietie: ſuch was
this of theſe men; for they
were vnnaturall, traytors, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
high-minded, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
Surely, if they were vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
they muſt needs bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian;
if they were tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to their King, they could
bee no Subiects to God; if
heady and high-minded, they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3864:7"/>
had nothing to doe with him

for their Idoll, they could not
haue the Lord for their God,
ſo as euen without God, they
had yet <hi>a forme of Godlineſſe;</hi>
Godlineſſe is a thing much
talkt of, little vnderſtood;
whiles the ancient Schoole had
wont to ſay, that it is not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall,
not ſpeculatiue, but
affectiue; their meaning was
that it is in all theſe; in the
heart, in the braine, in the
hand, but moſt in the heart;
it is ſpeculatiue, in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, practicall in the
Seruice to God, affectiue in
our feare of him, loue to him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3864:8"/>
ioy in him: Shortly then, to
apprehend God as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed,
to ſerue him as hee
hath required, to bee affected
to him as wee ought, is Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and the outward ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
and counterfaiſance
of all theſe is the <hi>forme of
Godlineſſe.</hi> To this out-ſide
of Godlineſſe then, belongs all
that glorious Pageant of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
profeſſion, which
wee ſee made in the World,
whether in wordes, geſture,
carriage.</p>
            <p>Firſt, here is a world of

Yet more, here is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Scoene of pious geſtures;
Knees bowed, hands erected,

deiected, ſighs aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
teares dropping, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

formality of deuout Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
is here vnacted? if the

            <p>Yet this is not all to make

here is a ſmooth face of

<hi>Saul</hi> wil be ſauing the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt

Lord his God; good man, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3864:9"/>
wil not haue God take vp vvith
the worſt; euery man is not of
this diet; too many think any
off all good enough for their

holds the beſt to be fitteſt for
thoſe ſacred Altars; when in the
meane time the Hypocrite
had already ſacrificed them to
his owne <hi>Mammon,</hi> and God
muſt take vp with the reuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Shall I tell you of another
as good, as deuout as he? Doe

euery word they proteſt and

hee would ſteale his Fathers

Godlineſſe;</hi> heare now the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall
of this power:</hi> How then
is it denyed; Surely, there
is a verball; there is a reall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall;
<hi>&amp; rebus &amp; verbis,</hi> as
<hi>Hilary,</hi> It is a miſtaking of
Logicians, that Negation is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3864:32"/>
the affection of a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
onely; No; God and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiuitie
finde it more in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
This very <hi>power</hi> is as
ſtoutly challenged by ſome
men in words, as truely deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in actions; As one ſayes of
the Phariſees anſwer concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<hi>Iohns</hi> calling, <hi>verum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebant
&amp; mentiebantur;</hi>
               <note place="margin">They told truth and yet lyed.</note> ſo may
I of theſe men; It is not in
the power of words to deny
ſo ſtrongly as deeds can; both
the hand, and the tongue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the heart, but the hand
ſo much more liuely, as there
is more ſubſtance in acts, then
ſounds; As he ſaid <hi>Spectamur
agendo;</hi> we are both ſeene and
heard in our actions. Hee that
ſayes there is no God is a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Atheiſt;</hi> hee that liues as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3864:32"/>
if there were no God is a <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
Atheiſt;</hi> he that ſhould ſay
Godlineſſe hath no power is
<hi>a verball Atheiſt;</hi> hee that ſhall
liue as if Godlineſſe had no
power, is a <hi>reall Atheiſt:</hi> they
are <hi>Atheiſts</hi> both. We would
flye vpon a man that ſhould
denye a God with <hi>Diagoras,</hi>
though (as <hi>Anſelme</hi> well) no
man can doe this <hi>interius,</hi>
from within; wee would
burne a man that ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Deitie of Chriſt with
<hi>Arrius;</hi> wee would rend our
clothes at the blaſphemie of
that man, who with the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures</hi>
and <hi>Apelleians</hi> ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
the cares and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God from the things
below; wee would ſpit at a
man that durſt ſay, there is
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3864:33"/>
no <hi>power</hi> in <hi>Godlineſſe:</hi> Theſe
monſters (if there bee ſuch)
hide their vgly heads, and
finde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it not ſafe to looke on
the light; Fagots are the beſt
language to ſuch miſcreants:
but theſe reall denyals are ſo
much more rife, and bold, as
they can take the aduantage
of their outward ſafety, and
vnconuincibleneſſe.</p>
            <p>Their wordes are honey,
their life poyſon, as <hi>Bernard</hi>
ſaid of his <hi>Arnoldus:</hi> And theſe
actions make too much noyſe
in the world; that which Saint
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaies of the laſt day,
that mens works ſhall ſpeake,
their tongues ſhal be ſilent; is
partly true in the meane time;
their workes cry out, whiles
their tongues whiſper: There
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3864:33"/>
is then really a double <hi>denial of
the power of Godlines;</hi> the one in
not doing the good it requires,
the other in doing the euill it
forbids: The one a priuatiue,
the other a poſitine denyall.</p>
            <p>In the former, what power
hath Godlineſſe if it haue not
made vs good? a feeble God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines
it is that is ineffectuall; if
it haue not wrought vs to bee
deuout to God, iuſt to men,
ſober and temperate in the vſe
of Gods creatures, humble in
our ſelues, charitable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
where is the Godliness?
where is the power? If theſe
were not aparantly done, there
were no forme of Godline, if
theſe be not ſoundly &amp; heartily
done, there is a palpable <hi>deniall</hi>
of <hi>the power of Godlines.</hi> Heare
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3864:34"/>
this then ye ignorant and ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſoules that meaſure your

liſt-leſſe eares ſeuered from
your wandring hearts, to the
Meſſages ſent from Heauen;
yee that come to Gods board,
as a ſurfeited ſtomacke to an
Hony-combe, or a ſicke ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke
to a Potion: Shortly, ye
that pray without feeling, hear
without care, receiue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
appetite; ye <hi>haue a forme of
godlines, but deny the power of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heare this, yee that weare

and yet ſhut to the cries
of the Poore, of the Orphan,

Debtor; ye that can
lift vp thoſe hands to heauen
in your faſhionable prayers,
which yee haue not reached
out to the reliefe of the needy
members of your Sauiour;
(whiles I muſt tell you by the
way that hard rule of <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Magis delinquit diues non
largiendo ſuperflua, quam pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

rich man offends more in not

the poore man in ſtealing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries)
Yee that haue a
fluent tongue to talke vnto
God, but haue no tongue to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3864:35"/>
ſpeake for God, or to ſpeake
in the cauſe of the dumbe: Ye
<hi>haue a forme of Godlineſſe, but
deny the power thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly, yee that haue no
feare of God before your
eyes, no loue to goodneſſe,
no care of obedience, no
conſcience of your actions,
no diligence in your Callings,
yee haue <hi>denied the power of
Godlineſſe;</hi> This very priuatiue
denial, ſhall without your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
damne your ſoules:
Remember, Oh, remember
that there needes no other
ground of your laſt and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uieſt

the Poſitiue denyall is yet
more irrefragable; If very
priuations and ſilence ſpeake,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3864:35"/>
much more are actions vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call:
Heare this then yee vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
of Chriſtianitie, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding

Coat, not conſidering that of

there cannot eaſily be a worſe

then Idolatry; either of them
both are enough to ruine any

whoſe very profeſſion is fraud
and cozenage; yee cruell V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers,

and enuious Detractors.
In a word, yee, who euer
yee are, that goe reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forward in a courſe of any

the men that ſpit God in the

            <p>But what of all this now,
<hi>the power of Godlineſſe</hi> is deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by wicked men; How
then? what is their caſe? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inexplicably, vnconceiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

How reuealed, ſay you?

Their impunitie makes them

Alas, wretched Soules!
The World hath nothing

this Oxe is fattened; <hi>Eaſe ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

22. This <hi>brasteata foelicitas,</hi>
which they inioy here, is but
as Carpets ſpread ouer the
mouth of Hell; For if they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
the power of Godlineſſe,</hi> the
God of power ſhall be ſure to
denie them: <hi>Depart from me
yee workers of iniquitie, I know
you not;</hi> There cannot bee a

from bleſſedneſſe, from life,
from hope, from poſſibility
of being any other then eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,

<hi>Qui te non habet Domine Deus,

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3864:38"/>
not thee, O Lord God, hath
loſt all, as <hi>Bernard</hi> truely; dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is but departing, but this
departing is the worſt dying;
dying in Soule, euer dying;
ſo as if there be an <hi>Ite, depart,</hi>
there muſt needs be a <hi>maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti,
depart ye curſed;</hi> curſed that
euer they were borne, who
liue to dye euerlaſtingly: For
this departure, this curſe ends
in that fire which can neuer,

ſoules that haue ſleighted
<hi>the power of Godlineſſe?</hi> what

what heart can bleed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
at the thought of thoſe

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3864:38"/>
but your finger for one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute

confuſion ſhall yee looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the frownes of an angry
God reiecting you; the vgly
and mercileſſe Fiends ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you to your torments, the
flames of Hell flaſhing vp to
meet you? with what horror
ſhall ye feele the gnawing of
your guilty conſciences, and
heare that helliſh ſhrieking,
and weeping, and wailing, and
gnaſhing? It is a paine to

mention theſe woes, it is more
then death to feele them, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreſeite
minas, formidate ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicia,</hi>
as <hi>Chryſoſtome.</hi> Certainly,
my beloued, if wicked ſinners
did truely apprehend an hell,
there would be more danger
of their deſpaire, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
then of their ſecuritie:
It is the Diuels policie, like a
Rauen, firſt to pull out the
eyes of thoſe that are dead in
their ſinnes, that they may not
ſee their imminent damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But for vs; Tell me, yee

            <p>But what an vnpleaſing, and

a Chrſtian Court, the Emblem
