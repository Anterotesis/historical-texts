            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Aggravations of the Evil of Shiſme, from the

herein. The charge of Schiſme not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed.
The iniquity of Accuſers juſtifys not the
Accuſed. Severall Perſons charged with
Schiſme on ſeverall accounts. The deſigne of
this diſcourſe in reference to them. Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of differences unpleaſant. Attempts for peace
and reconciliation conſidered. Severall perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

who undertake to treat of
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> to make their entrance with
<hi>Invectives</hi> againſt the evills thereof, with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115353:3"/>
aggravations of its heinouſneſſe. All men
whether intending the <hi>Charge</hi> of others, or
their own <hi>acquitment,</hi> eſteem themſelves

making it the <hi>greateſt</hi> ſinne imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
are uſually produced to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
A courſe this is which mens <hi>Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions</hi>

with the <hi>vehemency</hi> of men, contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for that, wherein their own <hi>intereſt</hi>
lay, might (if it were to our purpoſe) be
<hi>tranſcribed</hi> to this end. But as they had the

to many <hi>woefull</hi> miſtakes, and much dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the following Ages, I cannot ſo
eaſily give up the nature of this <hi>evill</hi> to

by virtue of that precept of our Saviour,
<hi>Call no man Maſter,</hi> in a good meaſure freed
it ſelfe from the bondage of ſubjection to
the dictates of men (and the innumerable
evills with endleſſe intanglements thence
inſuing) becauſe they lived ſo many
<hi>hundreds</hi> of years before us; that courſe
of procedure, though reteining its <hi>facility,</hi>
hath loſt its <hi>uſefullneſſe,</hi> and is confeſſedly
impertinent. What the Scripture expreſsly
ſaith of this <hi>ſinne,</hi> and what from <hi>that</hi> it
ſayth, may <hi>regularly</hi> &amp; rationally be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
(whereunto we ſtand and fall,) ſhall
be afterwards declared. And what is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115353:4"/>
ſuitably thereunto by any of <hi>Old,</hi> or
of <hi>Late,</hi> ſhall be cheerfully alſo received.
But it may not be expected that I ſhould
build upon their <hi>Authority,</hi> whoſe principles
I ſhall be neceſſitated to examine. And I
am therefore contented to lye <hi>low,</hi> as to
any expectation of <hi>ſucceſſe</hi> in my preſent
undertaking, becauſe I have the <hi>prejudice</hi> of
<hi>many Ages,</hi> the <hi>intereſt</hi> of moſt Chriſtians,
and the mutuall conſent of <hi>Parties</hi> at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance
(which commonly is taken for an
unqueſtionable evidence of truth) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
withall. But my endeavours being to
goe, <hi>non quà itur, ſed quà eundum eſt,</hi> I am
not ſollicitous about the <hi>event.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In dealing about this <hi>buſineſſe</hi> among
Chriſtians,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> the <hi>Advantage</hi> hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
hitherto on their part, who
found it their <hi>intereſt</hi> to beginne the
charge. For whereas perhaps themſelves
<hi>were,</hi> and <hi>are</hi> of all men moſt <hi>guilty</hi> of the
<hi>Crime,</hi> yet by their clamarous <hi>Accuſation,</hi>
putting others upon the <hi>defence</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
they have in a manner cleerly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped
from the triall of their own <hi>guilt,</hi>
and caſt the iſſue of the <hi>Question</hi> purely on
them, whom they have accuſed. The <hi>Actors</hi>
or <hi>Complainants</hi> part was ſo priviledged by
ſome <hi>Lawes</hi> and <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> that he who had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115353:5"/>
deſperately <hi>wounded</hi> another, choſe rather
to enter againſt him the <hi>frivolous</hi> plea,
that he <hi>received not his whole Sword into his
body,</hi> then to ſtand to his beſt <hi>defence,</hi> on the
complaint of the <hi>wounded</hi> man. An accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
mannaged with the <hi>craft</hi> of men
<hi>guilty,</hi> and a <hi>confidence</hi> becoming men
wronged and innocent, is not every ones
<hi>worke</hi> to ſleight &amp; wave. And he is in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
judgements immediately <hi>acquitted,</hi>
who averrs that his <hi>charge</hi> is but recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What advantage the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have
had on this account, how they have expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
in the aggravation of the ſinne of
<hi>Schiſme,</hi> whilſt they have kept others on the
<hi>defence,</hi> and would faine make the only
thing in <hi>Queſtion</hi> to be, whether they are
<hi>guilty</hi> of it or no, is known to all. And
therefore ever ſince they have been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of their <hi>diſability</hi> to debate the things
in difference <hi>between</hi> them and us, unto
any advantage, from the Scripture, they
have almoſt wholly inſiſted on this one
<hi>buſineſſe,</hi> wherein they would have it wiſely
thought, that our <hi>concernment</hi> only comes to
the <hi>triall,</hi> knowing that in theſe things
their <hi>defence is weake,</hi> who have nothing elſe.
Nor doe they need any other <hi>Advantage.</hi>
For if any <hi>party</hi> of <hi>men</hi> can eſtate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115353:5"/>
at <hi>large</hi> in all the <hi>priviledges</hi> gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
&amp; <hi>promiſes</hi> made to the <hi>Church</hi> in

Heathens</hi> or <hi>Publicans,</hi> by appropriating
the Priviledges mentioned unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
And whereas the parties <hi>litigant,</hi> by
all <hi>rules</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> ought to ſtand
under an equall regard, untill the <hi>ſeveralls</hi>
of their differences have been heard and

before it is heard: and it is all
<hi>one</hi> unto them, whether they are in the

               <p>In the meane time it cannot be denyed,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note>
but that their vigorous <hi>adhearing</hi> to the
advantage, which they have made to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
(a thing to be expected from men
wiſe in in their Generation) hath expoſed
ſome of them, whom they have <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

ſence of their own <hi>innocency,</hi> they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly

                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:115353:6"/>
it ſelfe whereof they are accuſed. Where
the thing in <hi>queſtion</hi> is but a <hi>name</hi> or <hi>terme

But who is <hi>ſufficient</hi> for ſuch an attempt?

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:115353:8"/>
is like <hi>opening</hi> the Booke in the <hi>Revelation:</hi>

dare ſay; that though men of a <hi>good zeale,</hi>

promiſe to themſelves much of <hi>peace,</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

(as they may be ſeverally favoured by

yet that a little <hi>Obſervation</hi> of <hi>Events,</hi> if they
are not able to <hi>conſider</hi> the <hi>cauſes</hi> of things,
with the light and <hi>poſture</hi> of the <hi>minds</hi> of

It is ſomething elſe, that muſt give <hi>peace</hi>

               <p>This I ſhall only adde as to the <hi>former</hi>
of theſe,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> of enforcing <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity;</hi> as it hath

(which with ſome is onely <hi>valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>

As it is <hi>ludicrouſly</hi> ſaid of <hi>Phyſitians,</hi>
the Effects of their skill lye in the <hi>Sunne,</hi>

the way there is one thing more, that I
would be willingly reſolved about in this

that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> by his <gap reason="foreign">

intend an enlargement beyond
the firſt and immediate direction to the
<hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> if by the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
as it is pleaded, he intend to expreſſe
that whole <hi>Region of Achaia,</hi> what either
the Apoſtle, or <hi>Clemens</hi> do obtain by that
enlargement, if reſtrained to that ſame
place.</p>
               <p>It is indeed ſaid,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> that at <hi>this time there were
many other Epiſcopall Sees in Achaia;</hi> which
untill it is attempted to be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſome kind of proof, may be paſſed by:
It is granted that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes of that
which was done at <hi>Corinth,</hi> to be done in
<hi>Achaia Rom. 15. 28.</hi> as what is done in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
is without doubt done in <hi>England:</hi>
But that which lies in expectation of ſome
light or evidence to be given unto it, is,
that there was a <hi>Metropoliticall See at Corinth,</hi>
at this time, whereunto many <hi>Epiſcopall
Sees in Achaia</hi> were in a ſubordination, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115353:22"/>
are called the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> by vertue
of their ſubjection thereunto; when this is
proved, I ſhall confeſſe ſome principles I
afterwards inſiſt on, will be impaired
thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This then is added by the ſame Author,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 18.</note>
That the Eccleſiaſticall eſtate was then conformed
to the Civill: where ever there was a Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
in a Civill-politicall ſence, there was ſeated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
a Metropoliticall Church; now that Corinth
was a Metropolis, the Proconſul of Achaia Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his reſidence there, in the firſt ſence is confeſſed.
<hi>And beſides what followes from</hi> thence,
<hi>by vertue of the</hi> principle <hi>now laid down,
Chryſoſtome</hi> calls it a <hi>Metropolis</hi> relating to
the time wherein <hi>Paul</hi> wrote his Epiſtle to
the <hi>Church</hi> there in the latter ſence alſo.</p>
               <p>The plea about <hi>Metropoliticall Churches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> I
ſuppoſe will be thought very <hi>impertinent</hi> to
what I have now in hand, ſo it ſhall not at
preſent be inſiſted on. That the <hi>ſtate</hi> of
Churches in after <hi>Ages</hi> was moulded and
framed after the patterne of the <hi>civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment</hi>
of the Roman <hi>Empire</hi> is granted;
And that conformity (without offence to
any be it ſpoken) we take to be a fruit of
the <hi>working of the myſtery of Iniquity.</hi> But that
there was any ſuch order <hi>inſtituted</hi> in the
Churches of Chriſt, by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or any
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115353:23"/>
inſtituted by the Authority from the <hi>Lord</hi>
and Ruler, is utterly denyed; nor is any
thing, but very uncertaine conjectures
from the <hi>ſayings of men</hi> of after Ages, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to atteſt any ſuch <hi>order,</hi> or conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
When the <hi>order, ſpirituality, beauty,</hi> and
glory of the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt ſhall returne,
and men obteine a <hi>light,</hi> whereby they
are able to diſcerne a beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency

part, indeed <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſoul</hi> of the worſhip
of God, theſe <hi>diſputes</hi> will have an iſſue.
<hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſayes indeed, that <hi>Corinth</hi> was
the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Achaia,</hi> but in what ſence
he ſayes not; the <hi>Politicall</hi> is granted, the

               <p>Of ſome,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> who withdraw themſelves

Now whether the men of theſe <hi>Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>

their crime in ſeparating themſelves to be
eſteemed <hi>Schiſme,</hi> it is not hard to judge:

have withdrawn themſelves from the
<hi>Communion</hi> of any Church of Chriſt, if
they have on any motives of <hi>feare,</hi> or <hi>love</hi>
apoſtatized from the faith of the Goſpell,
if they doe it, by <hi>walking</hi> diſorderly and

and ſo be no more able to beare the

that it is not at all to our purpoſe in

is confeſſed by others differing from me,

ordinary communion in any Church with diſlike,

how little the conſcience of a

is another <hi>common notion</hi> of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> which

that <hi>Schiſme</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the
<hi>breach of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> which I ſhall attend with
one reaſonable <hi>poſtulatum,</hi> namely, that this
<hi>union</hi> be an <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>appointment</hi> of Jeſus
Chriſt; The conſideration then of what,
or what ſort of union in reference to the
<hi>worſhip</hi> of God according to the Goſpell,
is inſtituted &amp; appointed by Jeſus Chriſt,
is the proper foundation of what I have
farther to offer in this buſineſſe. Let the

<hi>Schiſme,</hi> for being an evill, I ſhall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

It is not pleaded, that <hi>any</hi> kind of
relinquiſhment or deſertion of any <hi>Church</hi>
or Churches, is preſently <hi>Schiſme,</hi> but only
ſuch a ſeparation, as breakes the <hi>bond of

               <p>Now this union being inſtituted in the

Therefore for a diſcovery of the nature of

               <p>2. What that <hi>union</hi> is, and wherein it

               <p>In handling this <hi>triple</hi> propoſall, I deſire
that it may not be expected that I ſhould

The Church of Chriſt living in this

taken in Scripture three wayes.</p>
               <p>1. For the <hi>Myſticall body</hi> of Chriſt, his
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:115353:43"/>
                  <hi>Elect, Redeemed, Juſtifyed</hi> and <hi>Sanctifyed</hi>
ones throughout the world, commonly
called the <hi>Church-Catholick-Militant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. For the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of men through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the world, <hi>called</hi> by the preaching of

<hi>Church-Catholick viſible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. For a <hi>particular Church</hi> of ſome place,
wherein the inſtituted worſhip of God in
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is celebrated according to his
minde.</p>
               <p>From the Riſe &amp; <hi>nature</hi> of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> doth this diſtinction of the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word <hi>Church</hi> ariſe; for whereas
the <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>ſociety</hi> of men <hi>called</hi> out of the

<hi>twofold</hi> call in Scripture, one <hi>effectuall,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the purpoſe of God <hi>Rom. 8. 28.</hi>
the other only <hi>externall.</hi> The Church muſt
be diſtinguiſhed according to its <hi>anſwer,</hi>
and <hi>obedience</hi> to theſe calls, which gives us
the two firſt <hi>ſtates</hi> and <hi>conſiderations</hi> of it.
And this is confeſſed by the ordinary
gloſſe, <hi>ad Rom. 8. Vocatio exterior fit per
Praedicatores, &amp; eſt communis bonorum, &amp; malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,

whereas there are Lawes and externall
rules for joynt communion, given to them
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:115353:43"/>
that are called, (which is confeſſed) the
neceſſity of Churches in the laſt <hi>acceptation,</hi>
wherein <hi>obedience</hi> can alone be yeilded to
thoſe Laws, is thereby eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſence the Church hath as <hi>ſuch,</hi>

the properties of <hi>perpetuity, inviſibility, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
as to all neceſſary meanes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

Adjuncts of its nature, and exiſtence.
Neither are there any ſignes of <hi>leſſe</hi> or <hi>more</hi>

or known as ſuch; though there

               <p>In the ſecond,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> the Church hath <hi>perpetuity
viſibility,</hi> &amp; <hi>infallibility</hi> as qualifyed above,
in a ſecondary ſence; namely, <hi>not as ſuch,</hi>
not as <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>confeſſing,</hi> but as compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
the individualls whereof the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> doth conſiſt. For all that truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>profeſſe;</hi> though all that <hi>profeſſe,</hi> doe

               <p>Whether Chriſt hath had alwayes a

                  <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> and <hi>Acceptation</hi> of

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:115353:44"/>

yet there was in ſome of them

to render them fit to be owned and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

of Chriſt: but yet, though the notions of
men were generally <hi>corrupt,</hi> the practice of
all profeſſours throughout the world,
whereof ſo little is recorded, at leaſt of

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives us a deſcription of this

wreſted to ſerve every deſigne that was
needfull to be carryed on) to the intereſt
which he was to contend for, but in it ſelf
perfectly ridiculous. He tells us out of
<hi>Austine</hi> that the Church is a <hi>living Body,</hi>
wherein is a <hi>body</hi> and a <hi>ſoule,</hi> thence ſaith he
the <hi>ſoule</hi> is the <hi>internall graces</hi> of the ſpirit,
Faith, Hope, and Love: the <hi>body</hi> is the

faith, and the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of it; ſome are of
the <hi>ſoule</hi> that are not of the <hi>body,</hi> as the
<hi>Catechumeni,</hi> which are not as yet admitted
to be members of the <hi>viſible</hi> Church, but
yet are true believers. Some ſaith he, are of
the <hi>body,</hi> that are not of the <hi>ſoul,</hi> who having
no <hi>true grace,</hi> yet out of <hi>hope</hi> or <hi>temporall
feare,</hi> doe make profeſſion of the <hi>faith,</hi> and
theſe are like the <hi>haire, nailes,</hi> and ill <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours

               <p>The unity of <hi>members</hi> in the body natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

<hi>forſake his Father and his Mother and cleave to

that we ſpeake of, <hi>Coetus praedeſtinatorum
credentium,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves will grant
that Chriſt <hi>alone</hi> is its <hi>head,</hi> and that its <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
ariſeth from its <hi>ſubjection</hi> to him, and
dependance on him. Their modeſty makes
them <hi>contented</hi> with <hi>conſtituting</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>
in the roome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he is as it were
a <hi>politicall head</hi> for government; they have not
as yet directly put in their <hi>claime</hi> to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
as a <hi>mysticall Head, influencing</hi> the body
with Life and Motion: though by their
<hi>figment</hi> of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> communicating
<hi>grace, ex opere operato,</hi> and inveſting the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
power of <hi>diſpencing</hi> them in the <hi>Pope</hi>
only, they have contended faire for it. But
if any one can <hi>informe</hi> me of any other <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi>
or <hi>communion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> deſcribed
as above, then theſe <hi>laid downe,</hi> I ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
attend unto his inſtructions: In the
<hi>mean time,</hi> to carry on the preſent <hi>diſcourſe</hi>
unto that which is aimed at, it is manifeſt,
that the breach of this union muſt conſiſt
in theſe two things.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> the <hi>caſting</hi> out, <hi>expelling,</hi> and
looſeing that <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which abiding in us,
gives us this <hi>union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The <hi>loſſe</hi> of that <hi>love,</hi> which thence
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115353:51"/>
                  <hi>flowes</hi> into the <hi>body</hi> of Chriſt, and believers,
as parts and members thereof.</p>
               <p>This being the <hi>ſtate</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> under
the firſt conſideration of it,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> certainly it
would be an <hi>extravagancy</hi> ſcarcely to be <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd,</hi>
for any one to <hi>affirme</hi> a breach of
this <hi>union</hi> as ſuch, to be <hi>Schiſme</hi> under that
notion of it, which we are enquiring after.
But becauſe there is very little <hi>ſecurity</hi> to
be enjoyed in an <hi>expectation</hi> of the ſobriety
of men in things wherein they <hi>are,</hi> or ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
they may be concerned, that they
may know before hand, what is farther
<hi>incumbent</hi> on them, if in reference to us,
they would <hi>prevaile</hi> themſelves of any ſuch
<hi>notion,</hi> I here informe them that our <hi>perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
is, that this <hi>union</hi> was never utterly
<hi>broken</hi> by any man taken into it, or ever <hi>ſhall
be</hi> to the end of the World; and I ſuppoſe
they <hi>eſteeme</hi> it vaine to diſpute about the

               <p>But yet this <hi>perſwaſion</hi> being not <hi>common</hi>
to us, with them with whom we have to
<hi>doe</hi> in this matter, I ſhall not farther make

               </p>
               <p>2. But to take them as they <hi>are,</hi> as to
that alone wherein the firſt <hi>Councells</hi> had
any evidence of the preſence of the <hi>Holy

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of this Church,
namely, of the <hi>great ſociety of men profeſſing
the Goſpell,</hi> and obedience to Chriſt, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it, throughout the World, doth
conſiſt; this is ſummoned up by the Apoſtle
<hi>Eph. 4. 5. one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſme,</hi>
It is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the doctrine of Faith,</hi> which
men profeſſe, in ſubjection to <hi>one Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</hi> being initiated into that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
by Baptiſme; I ſay, the <hi>ſaving doctrine</hi>
of the Goſpell of Salvation by Jeſus
Chriſt, and obedience through him to God
as <hi>profeſſed</hi> by them, is the <hi>bond</hi> of that <hi>union,</hi>
whereby they are made <hi>one body,</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from all other <hi>ſocieties,</hi> have <hi>one

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115353:68"/>
they hold, and whileſt they doe ſo, are of
this body, in one profeſſed hope of their
calling.</p>
               <p>Now that this <hi>

required that all thoſe <hi>grand</hi> and <hi>neceſſary</hi>

and <hi>viſibly profeſſed</hi> in that variety of
<hi>waies,</hi> wherein they are, or may be called
out thereunto. There is a <hi>proportion of Faith
Rom: 12. 6.</hi> an <hi>

of ſaving Truths, the explicite knowledge
whereof in man, enjoying the <hi>uſe</hi> of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
within, and the <hi>means of grace</hi> without,
is of indiſpenſible neceſſary to Salvation,
without which it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> that any <hi>ſoule</hi>
in an ordinary way ſhould have <hi>communion</hi>
with God in Chriſt, having not <hi>light ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi>
for converſe with him, according to

                  </hi> in what
ſence ſoever it is ſpoken of, our inquiry
is, whether we are Guilty in any kind of
ſuch a <hi>breach,</hi> or the <hi>breach of ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
This then now inſiſted on being the union
of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> as viſibly profeſſing
the word, according to his own minde,
when I have laid down ſome <hi>generall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi>
of what is to enſue, I ſhall conſider
whether we are guilty of the breach of
this <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and argue the ſeverall preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of men againſt us, eſpecially of the
<hi>Romaniſts</hi> on this account.</p>
               <p>1. I confeſſe that this <hi>union</hi> of the generall
viſible Church was once comprehenſive of
all the <hi>Churches</hi> in the world;<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> the <hi>Faith</hi>
once delivered to the Saints being <hi>received</hi>
amongſt them. From this <hi>unity</hi> it is taken
alſo for granted, that a ſeparation is
made, and it continnes not as it was at the
firſt inſtitution of the <hi>Churches</hi> of Chriſt,
though ſome <hi>ſmall breaches</hi> were made upon
it, immediately after their firſt planting.
The Papiſts ſay, as to the <hi>Europaean Churches</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:115353:71"/>
wherein their and our concernment
principally lyes) this <hi>breach</hi> was made in
the dayes of our <hi>forefathers;</hi> by their <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
from the <hi>common</hi> faith in thoſe Ages,
though begunne by a few ſome Ages
before. We are otherwiſe minded, and
affirme, that this <hi>ſeceſſion</hi> was made by
them, and their <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> in <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> in
ſeverall generations by ſeverall degrees;
which we manifeſt, by <hi>comparing</hi> the preſent
<hi>profeſſion</hi> and worſhip, with that in each
kind, which we know was at firſt
embraced, becauſe we find it Inſtituted.
At once then, we ſay this <hi>Schiſme</hi> lyes at
their doors, who not only have deviated
from the <hi>common faith</hi> themſelves, but
do alſo <hi>actually cauſe,</hi> and attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
temporally and eternally all that
will not joyne with them therein. For as
the <hi>myſtery of iniquity began to worke in the
Apoſtles dayes;</hi> ſo we have a <hi>teſtimony</hi> beyond
exception in the complaint of thoſe that
lived in them, that not long after, the <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
of it became more effectuall, and
the infection of it to be more diffuſed
in the Church: This is that of <hi>Hegeſyppus</hi>
in <hi>Euſebius Eccleſ. Hiſt. lib. 3. cap. 26.</hi>
who affirmes that the Church <hi>remained</hi> a
<hi>Virgin</hi> (whilſt the <hi>Apoſtles lived)</hi> pure and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115353:72"/>
uncorrupted, but when that <hi>ſacred Society
had ended it's pilgrimage,</hi> and the <hi>generation
that heard and received the word from them were
fallen aſleep, many falſe doctrines were preached
and divulged therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know who hath endeavoured to <hi>elude</hi>
the ſence of this complaint,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> as though it
concerned not any thing in the Church,
but the <hi>deſpiſers and perſecutors of it, the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</hi>
But yet I know alſo, that no man
would ſo doe but ſuch a one, as hath a juſt
confidence of his <hi>own ability</hi> to make paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at leaſt, any thing that he ſhall ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay or utter. For why ſhould that
be referred by <hi>Hegeſyppus</hi> to the Ages after
the Apoſtles and their hearers were <hi>dead,</hi>
with an <hi>exception</hi> againſt its being ſo in
their days; when if the perſon thus <hi>expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi>
this <hi>testimony</hi> may be credited, the
<hi>Gnosticks</hi> were never more buſie nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent

to be the <hi>deflowring</hi> and <hi>violating</hi> of its <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,</hi>
which is commonly a great <hi>purifying</hi>
of it; ſo that ſpeaking of that broaching

                  <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> is, that <hi>Antichriſt ſits in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

omit the Examination of this pretence,
untill thoſe, who are concerned in it, will
profeſſedly owne it, as their <hi>plea;</hi> yet as it
lyes in our way, in the <hi>thoughts</hi> of ſome, I
ſay to it, that I am not ſo <hi>certaine,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">

ſignifies to <hi>ſit in the

the Temple of God. Aug. de Civitate Dei

expreſſion to be, as it's uſually <hi>received,</hi> it
imports no more, but that the <hi>man of ſinne</hi>
ſhall <hi>ſet up his power againſt God,</hi> in the <hi>midſt
of them,</hi> who by their outward viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:115353:78"/>
have right to be <hi>called his Temple,</hi>
which intitles him, and his Copartners in

their <hi>intereſt,</hi> with whom we have to do, we
have nothing requiring our Judgements
in the <hi>caſe,</hi> yet <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> we adde, that
we deny, that by the will and <hi>appointment</hi>
of Jeſus Chriſt, the <hi>Catholick Church viſible</hi>
is in any ſence <hi>intruſted</hi> with ſuch an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi>
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as that her <hi>declaration</hi>

<hi>contemptible</hi> individuall in the <hi>world;</hi> or that
it is <hi>poſſible</hi> that any voice of <hi>it</hi> ſhould be
<hi>heard</hi> or underſtood, but only this, I <hi>believe
the neceſſary ſaving Truths contained in the
Scripture;</hi> or that it can be <hi>conſulted</hi> with all,
or is, as ſuch, <hi>intruſted</hi> with any Power,
Authority, or Juriſdiction; nor ſhall we
ever conſent, that the <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi>
of the Scriptures, be actually taken from
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:115353:79"/>
it, on any <hi>pretence.</hi> As to that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
of <hi>telling the Church;</hi> it is ſo evidently
ſpoken of a <hi>particular Church,</hi> that may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
be <hi>conſulted</hi> in caſe of <hi>difference</hi>
between Brethren; and does ſo <hi>no way</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the buſineſſe in hand, that I ſhall
not trouble the Reader with a debate of
it. But doe we not receive the <hi>Scripture</hi> it
ſelfe upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church? I
ſay if we <hi>did</hi> ſo, yet this concernes not
<hi>Rome,</hi> which we account <hi>no Church</hi> at all.
That we have received the Scripture from
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at firſt, that is, ſo
much as the <hi>Book</hi> its ſelfe, is an <hi>intollerable
figment.</hi> But it is <hi>worſe,</hi> to ſay, that we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
and <hi>own</hi> their Authority, from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of any Church, or all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

its own <hi>Authority,</hi> is plainly to deny
<hi>them:</hi> on that account being brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, by the providence of God, (wherein

               </p>
               <p>But is not the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be interpreted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115353:79"/>
according to the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and are not thoſe <hi>interpretations</hi> ſo
made to be received?</p>
               <p>I ſay among all the <hi>figments</hi> that theſe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Ages</hi> have invented; I ſhall adde, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the true ſtories of <hi>Lucian,</hi> there is
not <hi>one</hi> more remote from Truth then this
<hi>Aſſertion;</hi> That <hi>all,</hi> that any <hi>one Text</hi> of
Scripture may be interpreted according to
the <hi>univerſall Tradition</hi> of the Catholick
Church, and be made appeare ſo to be,
any farther then that in Generall the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
Church hath not believed any ſuch
<hi>ſence</hi> to be in any portion of Scripture,
which to receive, were <hi>deſtructive</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And therefore the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> tell us,
that the preſent Church (that is theirs)
is the <hi>keeper</hi> and interpreter of theſe Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
or rather, that its Power, Authority,
and Infability, being the ſame that it hath
been in former Ages, what it <hi>determines,</hi> is
to be received to be the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the
Catholick Church; for the triall whereof,
whether it be ſo or no, there is no rule but
its own <hi>determination:</hi> which if they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in, I ſhall grant, that
they have <hi>acquired</hi> ſuch an abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and our <hi>Faith,</hi> that it is <hi>fit,</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:115353:80"/>
that we ſhould be <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> at their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſall.</p>
               <p>It being then the work of the Scripture,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
to <hi>propoſe</hi> the ſaving <hi>Truths</hi> of Chriſt, (the
beliefe and profeſſion whereof, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to make a man a <hi>member</hi> of the
Church) ſo as to make them of <hi>indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
neceſſity to be received; if they can from
them <hi>convince</hi> us, that we doe not <hi>believe</hi>
and <hi>profeſſe</hi> all &amp; <hi>every</hi> one of the <hi>Truths</hi> or
<hi>Articles</hi> of Faith, ſo neceſſary as expreſſed,
we ſhall <hi>fall</hi> down under the <hi>Authority</hi> of
ſuch conviction: If <hi>not,</hi> we profeſſe our
<hi>Conſciences</hi> to be no more concerned in the
Authority of their Church, then we <hi>judge</hi>
their Church to be in the <hi>priviledges of the
Church Catholick.</hi> But,</p>
               <p>2. It may be we are <hi>chargeable</hi> with
manifeſting ſome <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Prophaneneſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
wherewith the beliefe of the <hi>Truth,</hi> we
profeſſe, hath an abſolute inconſiſtency;
For thoſe, who are liable and obnoxious
to this <hi>charge,</hi> I ſay, let them plead for
themſelves. For let them profeſſe what
they will, and cry out 10000 times, that
they are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I ſhall never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
them for others then <hi>viſible enemies of
the Croſſe,</hi> Kingdome, and Church of
Chriſt. Traytors and Rebells are not <hi>de
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115353:80"/>
facto</hi> Subjects of that King or Ruler, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to whom, they are ſo. Of ſome,
who ſaid they were <hi>Jewes,</hi> Chriſt ſaid they
<hi>lyed, and were not, but the Synagogue of Satan,
Rev.</hi> 2 9. Though ſuch as theſe ſay they
are <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> I will be bold to ſay, <hi>they
lye, they are not, but ſlaves of Sathan.</hi> Though
they live within the <hi>Pale</hi> (as they call it)
of the Church, (the Catholick Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an incloſure as to profeſſion, not
place,) yet they are not <hi>within it,</hi> nor <hi>of it,</hi>
any more then a <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetan</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſame <hi>precinct:</hi> ſuppoſe they have been
<hi>Baptized,</hi> yet if their <hi>belly</hi> be their <hi>God,</hi> and
their lives dedicated to Satan, all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
they have thereby, is, that they are
<hi>Apoſtates</hi> and Renegadoes.</p>
               <p>That we have added any thing of our
owne,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note> making profeſſion of any thing in
Religion abſolutely deſtructive to the
<hi>fundamentalls</hi> we profeſſe, I know not that
we are accuſed, ſeeing our crime is aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to conſiſt in detracting not adding.
Now unleſſe we are convinced of failing
on one of theſe three accounts, we ſhall
not at all queſtion, but that we abide in
the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>viſible</hi> Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>It is the common cry of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi>
that we are <hi>Schiſmaticks.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> Why ſo? becauſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115353:81"/>
we have ſeparated our ſelves from the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
of the Catholick Church: what this
Catholick is, and how little they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in it, hath been declared How much
they have prevailed themſelves with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
ſoules by this plea, we know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nor
was any other ſucceſſe to be expected in
reſpect of many, whom they have wonne
over to themſelves, who being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ignorant of the <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> of God,
and the power of the Faith, they have
profeſſed, not having had experience of
communion with the Lord Jeſus, under
the conduct of them, have been upon
every provocation and temptation, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
prey to deceivers.</p>
               <p>Take a little view of their late <hi>Proſelyts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 11.</note>
and it will quickly appeare what little
cauſe they have to boaſt in them. With
ſome by the craft and folly of ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
they are admitted to treat, when
they are drawing to their diſſolution.
Theſe for the moſt part having been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of diſſolute and profligate lives,
never having taſted the power of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
whatever they have profeſſed, in
their weakeneſſe, and diſturbed dying
thoughts, may be apt to receive any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
that with confidence and violence
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115353:81"/>
is impoſed upon them. Beſides, it is a farre
eaſier propoſall to be reconciled to the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo by <hi>Purgatorie</hi> to get
to <hi>Heaven,</hi> then to be told of Regeneration,
Repentance, Faith, and the Covenant of
Grace, things of difficulty to ſuch poor
Creatures. Others that have been caſt
down from their hopes and Expectations;
or out from their enjoyments by the late
revolution in theſe Nations; have by their
<hi>diſcontent,</hi> or neceſſity, made themſelves
an eaſie prey to their zeale. What hath
been the reſidue of thir Proſelytes? What
one who hath ever manifeſted himſelfe to
ſhare in the power of our Religion, or was
not prepared by principles of ſuperſtition
almoſt as deep as their own, have they
prevailed on? But I ſhall not farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
on theſe things. To returne</p>
               <p>Our <hi>communion</hi> with the <hi>viſible Catholick
Church</hi> is in the unity of the <hi>faith</hi> only.<note place="margin">§. 12.</note>
The <hi>breach</hi> of this <hi>union,</hi> and therein a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhment
of the communion of the
Church, lyes in a relinquiſhment of, or
ſome oppoſition to, ſome or all of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
neceſſary truths of the Goſpell. Now
this is not <hi>Schiſme,</hi> but Hereſie or Apoſtacy;
or it is done by an open profligateneſſe of
life: ſo that indeed this charge is nothing
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:115353:82"/>
at all to the purpoſe in hand: though
through Grace in a confidence of our
own <hi>innocency</hi> we are willing to debate the
guilt of the crime under any name or title
whatever.</p>
               <p>Unto what hath been ſpoken,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> I ſhall
only adde the removeall of ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
objections, with a recharge on them,
with <hi>whom</hi> principally we have as yet had
to do, &amp; come to the laſt thing propoſed.
The caſe of <hi>ſome</hi> of old, who were charged
with <hi>Schiſme</hi> for ſeparating from the
Catholick Church on an account wholy
and cleerly diſtinct from that of a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the <hi>faith,</hi> is an inſtance of the
judgement of antiquity lying in an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the notion of departure from the
Church now delivered. Doth not <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
Doe not the reſt of his <hi>Orthodox
contemporaries,</hi> charge the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> with
Schiſme, becauſe they departed from the
Catholick Church? And doth not the
charge riſe up with equall efficacy againſt
you as them? At leaſt doth it not give you
the nature of Schiſme in another ſence
then is by you granted.</p>
               <p>The Reader knows ſufficiently,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> if he hath
at al taken notice of theſe things, whereto
find this cloud ſcattered, without the leaſt
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115353:82"/>
annoyance or detriment to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
cauſe, or of any concerned in that name,
however by leſſer differences diverſified
among themſelves. I ſhall not repeate
what by others hath been at large inſiſted
on. In briefe, put the whole Church of
God into that condition of libertie and
ſoundneſſe of Doctrine, which it was in
when the great uproare was made by the
<hi>Donatists,</hi> and we ſhall be concerned to
give in our judgements concerning
them.</p>
               <p>To preſſe an example of former dayes,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note>
as binding unto duty, or convincing of
evill, in reſpect of any now, without ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole <hi>ſubſtratum</hi> of the buſineſſe,
and compleat cauſe, as it was in the
dayes and ſeaſons, wherein the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
was given, we judge it not equall.
Yet although none can with ingenuity
preſſe me with the crime they were guilty
of, unleſſe they can prove themſelves to be
inſtated in the very ſame condition, as
they were againſt whom that <hi>crime</hi> was
committed, which I am fully aſſured <hi>none</hi>
in the world can; the communion of the
<hi>Catholick Church</hi> then pleaded for, being in
the judgement of all an effect of mens free
liberty, and choice, now preſſed as an iſſue
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115353:83"/>
of the Tyranny of ſome few; yet I ſhall
freely deliver my thoughts concerning
the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> which will be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
alſo of thoſe other, that ſuffer with
them in former and after ages, under the
ſame imputation.</p>
               <p>1. Then I am perſwaded,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> that in the
matter of fact, the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> were ſome of
them <hi>deceived,</hi> and others of them did <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi>
in charging <hi>Caecilianus</hi> to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>Traditores:</hi> which they made the
maine ground of their ſeparation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they took in other things, (as is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all)
into their defence afterward. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of themſelves were ordained by
ſuch perſons, as they are recharged, I know
not.</p>
               <p>2. On ſuppoſition that he was ſo,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> and
they that ordained him were known to
him to have been ſo; yet he being not <hi>guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the <hi>crime,</hi> renouncing <hi>Communion</hi> with
them therein, and themſelves repenting of
their ſinne, as did <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe ſinne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
theirs, this was no juſt cauſe of
caſting him out of <hi>Communion,</hi> he walking
&amp; acting in all other things, ſuitable to
principles by themſelves acknowledged.</p>
               <p>3.<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> That on ſuppoſition they had juſt
cauſe hereupon to renounce the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:115353:83"/>
of <hi>Caecilianus,</hi> which according to the
<hi>principles</hi> of thoſe days, retained by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
was moſt falſe; yet they had no
ground of ſeparating from the Church of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> where were many <hi>Elders</hi> not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to that charge. Indeed to raiſe a
<hi>jealouſy</hi> of a fault in any man, which is <hi>deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by him, which we are not able to
prove, which if it were proved, were of
little or no importance, and on pretence
thereof to ſeparate from all, who will
not believe what we ſurmiſe, is a wild and
unchriſtian courſe of proceeding.</p>
               <p>4. Yet grant farther,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> that men of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
conſciences, regulated by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
then generally received, might be
ſtartled at the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of that Church,
wherein <hi>Caecilianus</hi> did preſide; yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the height of madneſſe, pride, and
corrupt fleſhly intereſt, could make men
declare hoſtility againſt all the Churches
of Chriſt in the world, who would commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with, or did not condemne that
Church, which was to regulate all the
Churches in the world by their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and imagination.</p>
               <p>5.<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> Though men out of ſuch pride and
folly might judge all the reſidue of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
to be faulty and guilty in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115353:84"/>
of not condemning and ſeparating
from the <hi>Church of Carthage;</hi> yet to proceed
to caſt them out from the very name of
Chriſtians, and ſo diſanull their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and ordinances, that they had been
made partakers of, as manifeſtly they
did, by <hi>rebaptizing</hi> all that entered into
their communion, was ſuch unparalleld
<hi>Phariſaiſme,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> as was wholy to
be condemned, and untollerable.</p>
               <p>6. The <hi>Diviſions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Outrages,</hi> and <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall</hi>
furies and <hi>Riots</hi> that befell them, or
they fell into, in their way, werein my
judgement tokens of the hand of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: ſo that upon the <hi>whole matter,</hi>
their undertaking, and enterpriſe, was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
undue, and unlawfull.</p>
               <p>I ſhall farther adde,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> as to the mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>cauſe</hi> by their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> that
there is in theſe <hi>writings,</hi> eſpecially thoſe of
<hi>Auſtin</hi> (for the moſt part) as ſweet and
<hi>gratious ſpirit,</hi> breathing, full of <hi>zeale</hi> for
the glory of God, Peace, Love, Union a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Chriſtians; and as to the iſſue of
the cauſe under debate, it is evident, that
they did <hi>ſufficiently</hi> foyle their Adverſaries
on principles then <hi>generally confeſſed,</hi> and
acknowledged on all <hi>hands,</hi> though ſome
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:115353:84"/>
of them ſeem to have been conſidering,
<hi>Learned,</hi> and <hi>dexterous</hi> men.</p>
               <p>How little we are at this <hi>day,</hi> in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
that are mannaged amongſt us, about
the things of God, concerned in <hi>thoſe</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
of theirs, theſe <hi>few</hi> Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will evince; yet notwithſtanding all
this, I muſt take <hi>liberty</hi> to profeſſe, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the <hi>Fathers</hi> juſtly charged the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts</hi>
with diſclaiming of all the <hi>Churches</hi>
of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as a thing <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unjuſt,</hi> yet
many of the <hi>principles</hi> whereon they did it,
were <hi>ſuch,</hi> as I cannot <hi>aſſent</hi> unto. Yea I
ſhall ſay, that though <hi>Auſtin</hi> was ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cleare in the nature of the <hi>inviſible
Church Catholick,</hi> yet his frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
it with a miſtaken notion of the
<hi>viſible generall Church,</hi> hath given no ſmall
occaſion of <hi>ſtumbling,</hi> and ſundry unhappy
<hi>intanglements</hi> to diverſe in after Ages. His
own book <hi>De unitats Eccleſiae,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the ſumme and Subſtance of what he
had <hi>written</hi> elſewhere, or <hi>diſputed</hi> againſt the
<hi>Donatiſts,</hi> would afford me inſtances <hi>enough</hi>
to make good my aſſertion, were it now
under <hi>conſideration</hi> or proofe.</p>
               <p>Being then thus come off from this
part of our Charge and accuſation of

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:115353:85"/>

a thought of any ſuch thing. Let us
run a little over the <hi>foundations</hi> of this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Peter was the Prince of the Apoſtles.</hi> It
is denied; Arguments lye clear againſt it.
The <hi>Goſpell,</hi> the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, all
confute it. The expreſſe teſtimony of <hi>Paul</hi>
lyes againſt it; our Saviour <hi>denies</hi> it, that
it was ſo, gives Order that it ſhould not
be ſo. The <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing</hi> is forreigne to
the <hi>times</hi> of the Apoſtles. It was a <hi>Miniſtry,</hi>
not a <hi>Principality</hi> they had committed to
them; therein they were all <hi>equall.</hi> It is
from that <hi>Spirit,</hi> whence they enquired af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a Kingdome and Dominion, before
they had <hi>received</hi> the Spirit of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> as
it was diſpenſed after Chriſts Aſcenſion,
that ſuch aſſertions are now inſiſted on.
But let that be ſuppoſed, what is next? <hi>He
had an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Monarchicall Juriſdiction
committed to him over all Chriſtians. For Chriſt
ſaid, Tues Petrus, tibi dabo claves, &amp; paſce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
meas.</hi> But theſe termes are <hi>barbarous</hi> to
the Scripture; <hi>Monarchy</hi> is not the Engliſh
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115353:87"/>
of <hi>vos autem non ſic. Juriſdiction</hi> is a name of
a <hi>right,</hi> for the exerciſe of <hi>civill</hi> power.
Chriſt hath left no ſuch thing as <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
in the ſence wherein it is now uſed, to
<hi>Peter</hi> or his <hi>Church.</hi> Men do but make
ſports, and <hi>expoſe</hi> themſelves to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of <hi>conſidering</hi> perſons, who talke of
the <hi>inſtitution</hi> of our Lord, in the langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the <hi>laſt Ages;</hi> or expreſſions ſuitable
to what was in practice in them. He that

in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and under the <hi>Prelacy</hi>
here in England, had no more relation to
any inſtitution of Chriſt, (unleſſe it be,
that it effectually excluded the exerciſe of
his inſtitutions,) then other civill Courts
of Juſtice among Chriſtians have. <hi>Peter</hi>
had the Power and Authority of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had the reſt of the Apoſtles. But as to this
<hi>Monarchie</hi> of <hi>Peters</hi> over the reſt of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:115353:87"/>
let them ſhew what <hi>Authority he</hi> ever
exerciſed over them, while <hi>he</hi> and <hi>they</hi> lived
together; We read that he was <hi>once</hi> repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by one of them, not that <hi>he</hi> ever repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the meaneſt of them. If Chriſt made
the grant of <hi>preheminencie</hi> to him, when he
ſaid <hi>Tu es Petrus,</hi> why did the Apoſtles en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<hi>afterwards,</hi> who among them ſhould
be <hi>greateſt?</hi> And why did not our Saviour
on that diſpute, plainly ſatisfy them, that
<hi>Peter</hi> was to be <hi>chiefe?</hi> But choſe rather to
<hi>ſo determine</hi> the Queſtion, as to evince them
of the <hi>vanity</hi> of any ſuch enquiry? And yet
the determination of it, is that, that lyes
at the bottome of the <hi>Papall Monarchy.</hi> And
why doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that he was <hi>in nothing
inferiour to any of the Apoſtles,</hi> when, (if theſe
Gent: ſay true) he was in <hi>many</hi> things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to <hi>Peter?</hi> What ſpeciall place hath
the name of <hi>Peter,</hi> in the foundation of the
<hi>new Jeruſalem, Rev. 21. 14.?</hi> What exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath his <hi>Throne</hi> among the Twelve,
whereon the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> judge the World, and
<hi>houſe of Iſrael, Mat. 19. 28.</hi> What <hi>Eminencie</hi> of
commiſſion for <hi>teaching</hi> all <hi>Nations,</hi> or <hi>for,
giving</hi> ſinnes? What had his <hi>keys</hi> more then
<hi>thoſe</hi> of the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Joh. 20. 3.?</hi>
What was <hi>peculiar</hi> in that <hi>triple</hi> command
of <hi>feeding the ſheep of Christ,</hi> but his <hi>triple de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:115353:88"/>
that preceded? Is an injunction for
the performance of <hi>duty,</hi> a grant of <hi>new Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority?</hi>
But that we may make ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe,
ſuppoſe this alſo; Why, this <hi>Power,
Priviledge, and Juriſdiction of Peter, was to be
transferred to his ſucceſſors, when the power of all
the other Apoſtles, as ſuch, dyed with them.</hi> But
what pretence, or colour of it, is there for
this Aſſertion? What one <hi>title</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is
there in the whole <hi>book of God,</hi> giving the
leaſt <hi>countenance</hi> to this imagination? what
diſtinction between <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of
the Apoſtles on this account, is once made,
or in any kind inſinuated? Certainly this
was a thing of great <hi>importance</hi> to the
Churches, to have been acquainted with
it, When <hi>Paul</hi> ſo ſadly tells the Church,
that after his <hi>departure</hi> grievous <hi>Wolves</hi>
would ſpoyle the flock, and many <hi>among
themſelves</hi> would ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe
things, to draw <hi>Diſciples</hi> after them; why
did he not give them the leaſt direction, to
make their addreſſe to <hi>him,</hi> that ſhould
<hi>ſucceed Peter</hi> in his Power and Office, for
reliefe and <hi>redreſſe?</hi> Strange! that it ſhould
be of <hi>neceſſity to Salvation,</hi> to be ſubject to
him, in whom this <hi>power of Peter</hi> was to be
continued, that he was to be <hi>one,</hi> in whom
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:115353:88"/>
the Saints were to be <hi>conſummated;</hi> that in
Relation to <hi>him,</hi> the Unity of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church</hi> to be preſerved under paine
of damnation, ſhould conſiſt; and yet
not a word ſpoken of him in the whole
Word of God.</p>
               <p>But they ſay,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter had not only an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
power with the reſt of the Apoſtles; but alſo
an ordinary power that was to be continued in the
Church.</hi> But the Scripture being confeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſilent of any ſuch thing, let us heare
what proof is tendered for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this uncouth Aſſertion. Herein
then thus they proceed. <hi>It will be confeſſed
that Jeſus Chriſt ordained his Church wiſely,
according to his infinite wiſedome, which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
about his body; Now to this wiſdome of
his, for the prevention of innumerable evils, it is
agreeable, that he ſhould appoint ſome one perſon
with that power of declaring truth, and of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to enforce the receiving of it, which we
plead for. For this was in Peter, as is proved
from the texts of Scripture before mentioned,
therefore it is continued in them, that ſucceed
him.</hi> And here lyes the great ſtreſſe of their
cauſe; That to prevent evills and <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences,</hi>
it became the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of Jeſus
Chriſt to appoint a <hi>perſon,</hi> with all that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
power &amp; infallibility, to continue
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115353:89"/>
in his Church to the end of the world.
And this plea they mannage variouſly
with much <hi>Sophiſtry, Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
of Antiquity. But ſuppoſe all this
ſhould be granted; yet I am full well
aſſured, that they can never bring it home
to their concernment by any Argument,
but only the <hi>actuall claime</hi> of the Pope
wherein he ſtands ſingly now in the <hi>world:</hi>
which that it is <hi>ſatisfactory</hi> to make it good
<hi>de fide,</hi> that he is <hi>ſo,</hi> will not eaſily be
granted. The truth is, of all the attempts
they make againſt the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> this
is one of the greateſt, wherein they will
aſſert, that it became his wiſedome to doe,
which by no meanes they can prove that
he hath done: which is plainly to tell us,
what in their judgement he ought to have
done, though he hath not; &amp; that therefore
it is incumbent on them to ſupply what
he hath been defective in. Had he taken
the care he ſhould of them; and their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that he and they might have ruled
and reviled over, and in the houſe of God,
he would have appointed things as now
they are, which they affirme to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his wiſedome. He was a King that
once cryed, <hi>Si Deo in creatione adfuiſſem,
mundum melius ordinaſſem.</hi> But every <hi>Fryar</hi> or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115353:89"/>
                  <hi>Monck</hi> can ſay of Jeſus Chriſt, had they
been preſent at his framing the world
to come, (whereof we ſpeake) they would
have told him what had <hi>become</hi> his <hi>wiſedome</hi>
to do. Our Bleſſed Lord hath left ſufficient
proviſion againſt all future <hi>emergencies</hi> &amp; <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences</hi>
in his word &amp; Spirit <hi>given</hi> &amp; <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi>
to his Saints. And the one Remedie
which theſe men have found out with the
contempt and blaſpemy of him and them,
hath proved worſe then all the other <hi>evills</hi>
and diſeaſes, for whoſe prevention he
made proviſion; which he hath done alſo
for that remedy of theirs, but that ſome are
hardned through the <hi>righteous judgement</hi> of
God and deceitfulneſſe of ſin.</p>

communion with it.</p>
               <p>To give ſtrength to this Anſwer, they
farther adde, that though they grant the

               <p>I now deſcend to the laſt conſideration
of a <hi>Church</hi> in the moſt uſuall <hi>Acceptation</hi>
of that name in the New Teſtament;<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> that
is, of a <hi>particular inſtituted Church.</hi> A <hi>Church</hi> in
this ſence I take to be a <hi>Society of men, called
by the word to the obedience of the Faith in Chriſt
and joynt performance of the worſhip of God in the
ſame individuall Ordinances, according to the order
by Chriſt preſcribed.</hi> This generall <hi>deſcription</hi>
of it exhibits its <hi>nature</hi> ſo farre as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to cleare the ſubject of our preſent
<hi>diſquiſition.</hi> A more accurate definition
would only adminiſter farther occaſion of
<hi>conteſting</hi> about things, not neceſſary to be
determined as to the <hi>enquiry</hi> in hand. Such
as this was the <hi>Church at Hieruſalem,</hi> that
was <hi>perſecuted Act. 8. 1.</hi> The Church whereof
<hi>Saul</hi> made <hi>havock v. 3.</hi> The <hi>Church</hi> that was
vexed by <hi>Herod Act. 12. 1.</hi> Such was the

<hi>Hieruſalem</hi> conſiſted of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Act. 15. 22.</hi> The Apoſtles or ſome of
them being there then preſent, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no other conſideration to that Church
then that we are now ſpeaking of. Such
were thoſe mens Churches wherein Elders
were ordained by <hi>Pauls</hi> appointment <hi>Act.

which diſcourſe exhibits that ſtate of a

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:115353:103"/>
on the one hand, or the other, muſt
be examined, as to our concernment, by
what <hi>ought</hi> to have been done. But of thoſe
things afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now according to the <hi>courſe</hi> of proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
hitherto inſiſted on,<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> a Declaration of
the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Church</hi> in this ſenſe, what <hi>it
is,</hi> wherein it doth <hi>conſiſt,</hi> with what it is
to be guilty of the <hi>breach</hi> of that Unity,
muſt enſue; and this ſhall be done after I
have <hi>premiſed</hi> ſome few things <hi>previouſly</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
thereunto.</p>
               <p>I ſay then</p>
               <p>1. A man may be a <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church</hi> of Chriſt,<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> be united to him
by the <hi>inhabitation</hi> of his Spirit, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of his <hi>life</hi> from him, who upon
the account of ſome <hi>providentiall hinderance,</hi>
is never joyned to any <hi>particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
for the participation of <hi>Ordinances</hi> all
his daies.</p>
               <p>2. In like manner may he be a <hi>member</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> conſidered as <hi>profeſſing viſibly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
Seeing that he may doe all that is of him
required thereunto, without any ſuch <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi>
to a <hi>viſible particular</hi> Church. But
yet,</p>
               <p>3. I willingly grant,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> that every <hi>believer</hi>
is <hi>obliged,</hi> as in a <hi>part of his duty,</hi> to joyne
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115353:104"/>
himſelfe to ſome <hi>one</hi> of <hi>thoſe</hi> Churches of
Chriſt; that therein he may abide in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>

Goſpell, if he have advantage and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
ſo to doe; for,</p>
               <p>1. There are <hi>ſome</hi> duties incumbent on
us,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> which cannot <hi>poſſibly</hi> be <hi>performed,</hi> but

               </p>
               <p>2. There are ſome <hi>Ordinances</hi> of Chriſt,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note>

               <p>That there is an <hi>inſtituted</hi> worſhip of

                  <note place="margin">§. 14.</note>
untill the <hi>ſecond coming</hi> of Chriſt, I ſuppoſe

That for the <hi>whole</hi> of his worſhip,

no ground in the Scripture, but being
built <hi>meerly</hi> on the conceit of men, ſuited
to one carnall intereſt or other, I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly
debate it. That as to this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
under conſideration, there were <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches</hi> inſtituted by the <hi>Authority</hi> of
Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>owned</hi> and <hi>approved</hi> by <hi>him;</hi>
that <hi>Officers</hi> for them were of his <hi>appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and <hi>furniſhed</hi> with <hi>gifts</hi> from him for
the <hi>Execution</hi> of their employment; that
<hi>Rules,</hi> Cautions, and Inſtructions for the
due ſettlement of thoſe <hi>Churches,</hi> were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by him; that <hi>theſe Churches</hi> were made
the <hi>only ſeat</hi> of that <hi>worſhip,</hi> which in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
he <hi>expreſſed</hi> his will to have <hi>continued</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:115353:105"/>
untill he came, is of ſo much light in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he muſt <hi>wink hard,</hi> that will not
ſee it.</p>
               <p>That either he did not <hi>originally</hi> appoint
theſe things,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> or he did not <hi>give</hi> out the
<hi>gifts</hi> of his Spirit, in reference to the <hi>right</hi>
ordering of them, and exalting of his <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in them, or that having <hi>done ſo then,</hi> yet
that his <hi>inſtitutions</hi> have an end, being only
for a ſeaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it may be <hi>known</hi> when
the <hi>efficacy</hi> of any of his <hi>institutions ceaſeth,</hi>
or that he doth not now <hi>diſpenſe</hi> the gifts
and <hi>graces</hi> of his Spirit, to render them <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
is a difficult <hi>taske</hi> for any man to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to evince.</p>
               <p>There is indeed in the inſtitutions of
Chriſt,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> much that anſwers a <hi>naturall princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
in men, who are on <hi>many accounts</hi> formed
and fitted for ſociety. A <hi>Confederation and
conſultation</hi> to carrie on any deſigne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the concernment of the <hi>individualls</hi>
doth lye, within ſuch <hi>bounds,</hi> and in ſuch
<hi>order</hi> as lyes in a ready way to the <hi>end ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi>
at, is exceeding <hi>ſuitable</hi> to the <hi>principles</hi>
whereby we are acted and guided as men.
But he that would hence conclude, that
there is no more but this, and the acting of
theſe principles, in this Church <hi>conſtitution,</hi>
whereof we ſpeake, and that therefore
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115353:106"/>
men may be caſt into any <hi>prudentiall</hi> forme;
or appoint other <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>formes</hi> of it, then
thoſe mentioned in the Scripture, as <hi>appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and <hi>owned,</hi> takes on himſelfe the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating</hi>
that all things neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Church</hi> ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
are commanded by the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore allowed of, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
only by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; ſo to be wholy <hi>morall,</hi>
and to have nothing of <hi>inſtituted</hi> worſhip
in them; and alſo he muſt know, that
when on that ſuppoſition, he hath given a
probable Reaſon, why never any perſons
in the world fixed on ſuch <hi>ſocieties</hi> in all
<hi>Eſſentiall</hi> things as thoſe, ſeeing they are
<hi>Naturall,</hi> that he leaves leſſe to the <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
of men and to the ordering and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſing</hi>
of things concerning them, then
thoſe, who make them of pure <hi>inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
all whoſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from themſelves; as thoſe of things
purely <hi>morall</hi> may. But this is not of my

               <p>2. Nor ſhall I <hi>conſider,</hi>

be a property of the Church of Chriſt

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115353:106"/>
others; but whether by <hi>vertue of any

                  <hi>Mat. 16. 18. upon this Rock will I build my

away its <hi>force</hi> and <hi>efficacy. Mat. 18. 18, 20.</hi>
declares the preſence of Chriſt with his
<hi>Church</hi> where ever it be, not that a Church

<hi>viſibly</hi> profeſſing, being preſerved entire,
he that <hi>thinketh</hi> there needs a <hi>miracle,</hi> for
thoſe who are members of <hi>them,</hi> to joyne
in ſuch a <hi>Society,</hi> as thoſe now ſpoken of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, is a
perſon delighting in needleſſe <hi>ſcruples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt hath promiſed,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> that where <hi>two or
three are gathered together in his name, he will be
in the midſt of them, Mat. 18. 20.</hi> It is now
ſuppoſed, with ſome hope to have it gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that the <hi>Scripture</hi> being the power of
God to <hi>Salvation,</hi> hath <hi>(Rom. 1. 16.)</hi> a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>energie</hi> in it <hi>ſelfe,</hi> as to its
own <hi>kind,</hi> for the converſion of Soules; yea
let us, till <hi>oppoſition</hi> be made to it, take it
for granted, that by that force and <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
it doth <hi>mainly</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> evince its
own <hi>Divinity,</hi> or divine Originall. Thoſe,
who are contented for the honour of that
<hi>word,</hi> which God delighteth to <hi>magnify,</hi> to
grant this Suppoſition, will not I hope,
think it <hi>impoſſible,</hi> that <hi>though all</hi> Church
ſtate ſhould ceaſe in any <hi>place,</hi> and yet the
Scripture by the <hi>providence</hi> of God be there
in the hand of <hi>individualls</hi> preſerved, two
or three ſhould be <hi>called, converted,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated</hi>
by it. For my part, I think, he
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115353:107"/>
that <hi>queſtions</hi> it, muſt doe it on ſome <hi>corrupt
principle</hi> of a <hi>ſecondary dependent Authority</hi> in
the <hi>word of God</hi> as to us; with which ſort of
men I doe not now deale. I aske whether
theſe <hi>converted</hi> perſons may nor <hi>poſsibly</hi>
come together, or <hi>aſſemble</hi> themſelves in
the <hi>name of Jeſus?</hi> may they not upon his
<hi>command,</hi> and in <hi>Expectation</hi> of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of his <hi>promiſe,</hi> ſo <hi>come together,</hi>
with <hi>Reſolution</hi> to doe his will, and to <hi>exhort</hi>
one another thereto, <hi>Zech. 3. 10. Mal.
3. 10.</hi> Truly I believe they <hi>may,</hi> in what
part of the world ſoever their lot is fallen.
Here lye all the difficulties, whether being
come <hi>together</hi> in the name of Chriſt they
may <hi>doe,</hi> what he hath <hi>commanded</hi> them, or
no? whether they may exhort, and <hi>stirre up
one another</hi> to doe the will of Chriſt. Moſt
certain it is, that Chriſt will <hi>give them his
preſence,</hi> &amp; therewithall his Authority, for
the <hi>performance</hi> of any duty, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
at their hands. Were not men <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
troubled,</hi> and <hi>diſappointed,</hi> there would
be little <hi>difficulty</hi> in this buſineſſe. But of
this elſewhere.</p>
               <p>3. Upon this <hi>ſuppoſition,</hi> that particular
Churches are <hi>Inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
which is granted by <hi>all,</hi> with whom I have
to doe; I proceed to make <hi>enquiry</hi> into their
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115353:108"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> that ſo we may

               <p>1. There is a <hi>double foundation,</hi>

or cauſe of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of <hi>ſuch</hi> a Church; the
one <hi>externall,</hi> procuring, commanding; the
other <hi>internall,</hi> inciting, <hi>directing, aſſiſting.</hi>
The firſt is the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt,
before mentioned, requiring <hi>Peace,</hi> and
<hi>Order, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, Conſent,</hi> and <hi>Agreement,</hi> in and
among all the members of ſuch a Church;
all to be <hi>regulated, ordered,</hi> and <hi>bounded,</hi> by
the <hi>Rules, Laws, Preſcripts,</hi> which from him
they have received, for their walking in
thoſe Societies.</p>
               <p>The Latter is that <hi>Love</hi> without diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation,
which alwaies is, or which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ought to be, between all the <hi>members</hi>
of ſuch a Church, exerting it <hi>ſelfe</hi> in
their <hi>reſpective</hi> duties one towards another,
in that holy combination, whereunto they
are <hi>called</hi> and <hi>enter'd</hi> for the Worſhip of
God: whether they are <hi>thoſe,</hi> which lye in
the <hi>levell</hi> of the <hi>equality</hi> of their <hi>common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi>
of being <hi>Church-members,</hi> or <hi>thoſe which</hi>
are required of <hi>them</hi> in the ſeverall <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
whereby on any account whatever,
they are <hi>distinguiſhed</hi> one from another
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115353:108"/>
amongſt themſelves; for <hi>love is the bond of
perfectneſſe. Col. 3. 14.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence then it <hi>appears,</hi> what is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>
of ſuch a Church, and what is the <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
to be obſerved therein, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Jeſus Chriſt. The <hi>joynt conſent</hi> of
all the members of it, in obedience to the
command of Chriſt, from a <hi>principle of
Love,</hi> to walk together in the <hi>univerſall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration</hi>
of all the Ordinances of the

to be <hi>celebrated</hi> in ſuch a Church, and to

in this <hi>buſineſſe</hi> from any charge

becauſe I have no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some things there are,<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> which upon what

as <hi>granted</hi> in <hi>Theſi,</hi> untill I ſee them
otherwiſe diſproved, then as yet I have
done. Of theſe the firſt is. That the <hi>depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
or <hi>ſeceſſion</hi> of any man or men, from
any <hi>particular Church,</hi> as to that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which is peculiar to ſuch a Church,
which he or they have had therewith, is
no where called <hi>Schiſme,</hi> nor is ſo in the

ſignification of the word is reſtrained by
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115353:110"/>

&amp; receive a <hi>little</hi> according to the <hi>cauſes</hi>

               <p>2. One <hi>Churches</hi> refuſing to hold that

               <p>3. The <hi>departure</hi> of any man or men,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note>
from the <hi>Society</hi> or <hi>Communion</hi> of any

               <p>Unto theſe I adde,<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> that if any one can
ſhew and evince that we have <hi>departed from,</hi>
and left the <hi>communion</hi> of any <hi>particular</hi>
Church of Chriſt, with which we <hi>ought</hi> to
walke according to the <hi>order</hi> above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,

<hi>aſſented</hi> unto, and publickly <hi>profeſſed</hi> the

In this ſenſe, we profeſſe ourſelves
<hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as <hi>profeſſing</hi>
and <hi>adhering</hi> to that Doctrine of <hi>Faith</hi> in
the Unity of it, which was here <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi>
and <hi>declared,</hi> as was before ſpoken. As to
the <hi>attempt</hi> of ſome, who accuſe us for <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi>
of <hi>fundamentalls,</hi> by our doctrine of
<hi>Election</hi> by the <hi>free grace</hi> of God, of <hi>effectuall
Redemption</hi> of the <hi>Elect only, converſion</hi> by the
<hi>irreſiſtible</hi> efficacy of Grace, and the aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
<hi>doctrines,</hi> which are commonly known,
we ſuppoſe the <hi>more ſober</hi> part of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries
will give them <hi>little thanks</hi> for
their pains therein: If for no <hi>other Reaſon,</hi>
yet at leaſt, becauſe they know the <hi>cauſe,</hi>
they have to <hi>mannage</hi> againſt us, is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereby. Indeed it ſeems ſtrange to
us, that we ſhould be charged with <hi>Schiſme</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:115353:113"/>
from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> for <hi>endeavouring</hi>
to reforme our ſelves, as to ſomething <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating</hi>
to the worſhip of God, by <hi>men evert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and denying ſo conſiderable a <hi>portion</hi>
of the Doctrine of that Church, which we
<hi>ſacredly</hi> retaine entire, as the <hi>moſt urgent</hi> of
our preſent <hi>Adverſaries</hi> doe. In this ſenſe I
ſay we ſtill confeſſe our ſelves members
of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> nor have we made
any <hi>ſeparation</hi> from it, but do daily labour
to improve, and <hi>carry on</hi> the <hi>light</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpell,</hi> which ſhines therein, and on the
account whereof, it is <hi>renowned</hi> in the
world.</p>
               <p>3. Though I know not how <hi>proper</hi> that
expreſſion of <hi>Children of the Church</hi> may be
under the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> nor can by any
meanes conſent unto it, to the urging of
any obedience to any <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi>
whatſoever on that account; no ſuch <hi>uſe</hi>
being made of that conſideration by the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> nor any parallell unto it inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
on by him; yet in a generall ſence, ſo
farre as our receiving our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and
<hi>new birth,</hi> through the grace of God by
the <hi>preaching of the Word,</hi> and the <hi>ſaving truths</hi>
thereof, here profeſſed, with the <hi>ſeale</hi> of it
in our <hi>baptiſme,</hi> may be ſignified by that
<hi>expreſſion,</hi> we owne our ſelves to have been,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115353:114"/>
and to be <hi>Children of the Church of England,</hi>
becauſe we have received all this by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of the Goſpell here in <hi>England,</hi>
as diſpenſed in the ſeverall <hi>Aſſemblyes</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
And are contented, that this <hi>conceſſion</hi>
be improved to the utmoſt.</p>
               <p>Here indeed are we <hi>left</hi> by them,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> who
renounce the <hi>Baptiſme</hi> they have received in
their <hi>infancy,</hi> &amp; <hi>repeat</hi> it again amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Yet I ſuppoſe, that He, who upon
that <hi>ſingle account</hi> will undertake to prove
them <hi>Schiſmaticall,</hi> may find himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled.
Nor is the caſe with them exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as it was with the <hi>Donatists.</hi> They doe
the ſame thing with them, but not on the
ſame Principles. The <hi>Donatists rebaptized</hi>
thoſe, who came to their ſocieties, becauſe
they profeſſed themſelves to <hi>believe,</hi> that
all Adminiſtration of Ordinances not in
their <hi>Aſſemblyes</hi> was <hi>null:</hi> and that they
were to be looked on as no ſuch thing.
Our <hi>Anabaptists</hi> doe the <hi>ſame thing,</hi> but on
this plea, that though <hi>baptiſme</hi> be, yet <hi>infant
baptiſme</hi> is not an <hi>Institution</hi> of Chriſt, and
ſo is <hi>null</hi> from the nature of the thing it
ſelfe, not the way of its <hi>Adminiſtration:</hi> but
this fals not within the <hi>verge</hi> of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>In theſe ſeverall <hi>conſiderations</hi> we were,<note place="margin">§. 9.</note>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:115353:114"/>
and doe <hi>continue</hi> members in the <hi>Church of
God</hi> in England; And as to our <hi>failing</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
who is it, that <hi>convinces</hi> us of ſinne?</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing <hi>inquired</hi> after is,<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> what
<hi>ſubjection</hi> we <hi>ſtood,</hi> or were <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> to have
<hi>ſtood</hi> in, to the <hi>Biſhops?</hi> Our <hi>ſubjection</hi> being
regulated by their <hi>power,</hi> the conſideration
of <hi>this,</hi> diſcovers the true ſtate of <hi>that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They had,<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> and exerciſed in this <hi>Nation,</hi>
a <hi>twofold Power;</hi> and conſequently the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi>
required of us, was twofold.</p>
               <p>1. A power <hi>delegated</hi> from the <hi>ſupream
Magistrate</hi> of the Nation, conferred on
them, and <hi>inveſted</hi> in them, by the <hi>Laws,
Cuſtomes,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages</hi> of this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi>
and exerciſed <hi>by</hi> them on that account.
This not only made them <hi>Barons</hi> of the
Realme, and <hi>members of Parliament,</hi> and
gave them many Dignities and Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but alſo was the ſole <hi>fountain,</hi> and
ſpring of that <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
by <hi>wayes</hi> and <hi>meanes,</hi> ſuch as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
will not <hi>plead</hi> to have been <hi>purely Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall,</hi>
and of the Inſtitution of Jeſus
Chriſt. In this reſpect we did not <hi>caſt</hi> off
our ſubjection to <hi>them;</hi> it being our <hi>duty to
ſubmit our ſelves to every Ordinance of man,</hi> for
the Lords ſake. Only when ever they <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
things unlawfull</hi> in themſelves, or <hi>unto</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:115353:115"/>
us, we alwaies <hi>retreated</hi> to the old ſafe
Rule, <hi>whether it be meet to obey you or God,
judge yee.</hi> On this foundation I ſay, was all
the <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> which they exerciſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong,
and over the <hi>People</hi> of this Nation,
built. They had not <hi>leave</hi> to exerciſe that,
which they were inveſted in, on another

thereby. The <hi>tenour</hi> whereby their

(God aſſiſting) be declared, when I
treat of the ſtate of the <hi>firſt Churches,</hi> and
the waies of their <hi>degeneracy;</hi> Let them, or
any for them, in the mean time evince the
<hi>Juriſdiction</hi> they exerciſed, in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
our <hi>ſubjection</hi> in the firſt kind was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
to derive its <hi>originall</hi> from the <hi>pure
Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt in the Goſpell, or to be
any ſuch <hi>thing</hi> as it was, in an imagined
ſeparation from the <hi>humane Laws,</hi> whereby
it was animated; and more will be <hi>aſſerted,</hi>
then I have had the happineſſe as yet to
ſee. Now I ſay, that the <hi>ſubjection</hi> to them
<hi>due,</hi> on this account, we did not <hi>caſt off;</hi> but
their whole <hi>Authority, Power,</hi> and <hi>Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
was removed, taken away, and <hi>anull'd,</hi>
by the <hi>people of the Land aſſembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this,<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> they <hi>reply,</hi> is the ſtate of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
in hand; the <hi>Parliament,</hi> as much as
in them lay, did ſo indeed as is <hi>confeſſed,</hi>
and by ſo doing made the <hi>Schiſme,</hi> which
you by <hi>adhering</hi> to them, and joyning
with <hi>them</hi> in their ſeverall places, have
made your ſelves alſo <hi>guilty</hi> of.</p>
               <p>But do theſe men know <hi>what</hi> they ſay,<note place="margin">§. 13.</note>
or will it ever trouble the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of a
man in his right <hi>wits,</hi> to be charged with
<hi>Schiſme</hi> on this account? the <hi>Parliament</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:115353:116"/>
made <hi>Alteration</hi> of nothing, but what they
found eſtabliſhed by the <hi>Laws</hi> of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pleading that they had <hi>power</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them, to <hi>alter, abrogate,</hi> and <hi>anull</hi>
Laws for the good of the <hi>people of the Land.</hi>
If their making <hi>Alterations</hi> in the <hi>Civill
Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> in the Politicall
<hi>Adminiſtrations</hi> of the Nation be <hi>Schiſme,</hi>
we have very little <hi>ſecurity,</hi> but that we
may be made <hi>new Schiſmaticks</hi> every third
year, whileſt the <hi>conſtitution of a Trienniall
Parliament</hi> doth continue. In the removall

not at all concerned. For the Laws en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing
it, doe not preſſe it as a thing <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
on any other <hi>account,</hi> but as that
which themſelves gave <hi>riſe</hi> and life unto.
But ſhould this be <hi>granted,</hi> that the Office

impleaded annexed by him thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
yet this, whileſt we abide at <hi>dioceſans,</hi>
with the ſeverall diviſions apportioned to

               <p>2. <hi>Biſhops</hi> had here a <hi>power</hi> as <hi>Miniſters</hi>

<hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt, they can
claime. Let them come forth, with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
that are not <hi>carnall,</hi> evidencing their

               <p>Though I was not then ſpeaking of the
Biſhops of England,<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> yet I am contented
with the application to them; there being
amongſt them men of <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>learning,</hi>
whom I exceedingly honour &amp; reverence:
Amongſt all the Biſhops, He of <hi>Oxford</hi> is I
ſuppoſe peculiarly inſtanced in, becauſe it
may be thought, that living in this place,
I may belong to his <hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> But in the
<hi>condition</hi> wherein I now am by the <hi>providence</hi>
of God, I can plead an exemption on the
ſame foot of account, as he can his <hi>Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:115353:117"/>
So that I am not much concerned
in his <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it, as to my own perſon.
If he have a particular <hi>flock</hi> at <hi>Oxon,</hi> which
he will attend according to <hi>what before I
required,</hi> he ſhall have no let or hindrance
from me; but being he is, as I heare he is, a
<hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Learned</hi> perſon, I ſhall be glad
of his <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> &amp; acquaintance. But to
ſuppoſe that the <hi>Dioceſſe</hi> of <hi>Oxon</hi> as legally
conſtituted and <hi>bounded,</hi> is his <hi>particular flock</hi>
or <hi>Church,</hi> that ſuch a Church is <hi>inſtituted</hi>
by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or hath been in <hi>Being</hi> ever ſince
the Apoſtles times, that in his <hi>preſidency</hi> in
this Church he is to ſet up <hi>Courts,</hi> and <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi>
a <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> in them, and therewith a

<hi>peculiar juriſdiction)</hi> although gathered into

of the ſame Ordinances; and all
this by the <hi>will</hi> and <hi>appointment</hi> of Jeſus
Chriſt, is to ſuppoſe what will not be
granted. I confeſſe, as before, there was
once ſuch an <hi>Order</hi> in this place, &amp; that it is
now removed by <hi>Lawes,</hi> on which <hi>foundation
alone</hi> it ſtood before: And this is that where
in I am not <hi>concerned.</hi> Whether we have
<hi>cauſeleſly</hi> &amp; <hi>inexcuſably</hi> departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115353:118"/>
I am ſure, unles the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> can be <hi>fixed,</hi>
our departure will not be proved. A <hi>law
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> I confeſſe, an <hi>Evangelicall</hi> I am yet in
the diſquiſition of. But I confeſſe it will be
to the prejudice of the <hi>cauſe</hi> in hand, if it
ſhall be thought, that the <hi>determination</hi>
of it depends on the controverſy about

expected that the <hi>Arguments</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

that <hi>Biſhops,</hi> as commonly eſteemed in
this Nation, are of the appointment of
Chriſt, it will thence follow, that we have
a <hi>Nationall Church</hi> of Chriſts appointment:
between which indeed there is no Relation
or connexion. Should I grant as I ſaid
<hi>dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, with Churches anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their ſupportment, particled into
ſeverall Congregations, with their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<hi>Officers,</hi> yet this would be remote
enough, from giving ſubſiſtence and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>
to a <hi>Nationall Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What then it is which is called the <hi>Church

                  <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> in reſpect whereto we are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:115353:118"/>
Now there are <hi>two wayes</hi> whereby we

Prieſts in their ſeverall places. A man with
<hi>halfe</hi> an eye may ſee that here are many
things to be proved.</p>
               <p>Thus their <hi>firſt Church</hi> is <hi>Nationall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> which
is diſtributed into ſeverall <hi>greater portions</hi>
termed <hi>Provinces,</hi> thoſe againe into others,
now called <hi>Dioceſſes,</hi> and thoſe againe
<hi>ſubdivided</hi> into <hi>Parochiall</hi> or <hi>particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi>
Now the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of this Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the due obſervance of the ſame

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115353:119"/>
commonly <hi>Canons)</hi> by way of diſtinction
unto the Rulers before mentioned in their
ſeverall <hi>capacities.</hi> And this is that, which
is the peculiar forme of this Church. That

the one <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereby it is <hi>animated.</hi>
That of the Church <hi>Catholick viſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing,</hi>
the Unity of the <hi>Faith,</hi> which they

That of a <hi>particular Church</hi> as ſuch, its <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,</hi>
and <hi>performance of the ſame Ordinances
of worſhip numerically,</hi> in the <hi>confeſſion</hi> of the

of Love for edification of the whole.
Of this <hi>Nationall,</hi> as it is called, in the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of one ſort of Officers</hi> unto another,
within a <hi>precinct</hi> limited <hi>Originally,</hi> wholy
on an account forraigne to any Church

<hi>Church of England,</hi> from its participation of
the nature of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, on the
account of its moſt <hi>noble</hi> members; nor yet
from its participation of the nature of
the <hi>inviſible</hi> Church in the world, on the
account of its profeſſion of the Truth;
in both which reſpects we profeſſe our
Unity with it; nor yet from its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of the nature of a particular
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115353:119"/>
Church, which it did not in its ſelfe, nor
as ſuch, but in ſome of its <hi>particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations;</hi>
but from a peculiar forme of its

               <p>I anſwer in a word, laying aſide ſo much
of the <hi>Iuriſdiction</hi> of it mentioned before,
and the ſeverall ways of its <hi>adminiſtration,</hi>
for which there is no colour or pretence
that it ſhould relate to any <hi>Goſpell inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
paſſe by alſo the conſideration of all
thoſe things which the men, enjoying
<hi>Authority</hi> in, or exerciſing the <hi>pretended</hi>

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115353:120"/>
and <hi>power</hi> to injoyne and eſtabliſh,
which we judge evill; let them prove that
ſuch a Nationall Church, as would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
with theſe things pared off, that is
in its beſt eſtate imaginable, was ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
by Chriſt, or the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in his <hi>name</hi>
in all the things of <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> to its
<hi>being</hi> &amp; <hi>exiſtence,</hi> and I will confeſſe my ſelf
to be what they pleaſe to ſay of me.</p>
               <p>That there was ſuch an Order in things
relating to the <hi>worſhip</hi> of God eſtabliſhed
by the Law of the Land,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> in and over the
people thereof, that the worſhip pleaded
for was confirmed by the <hi>ſame Law,</hi> that
the Rulers mentioned had power, being by
the Magiſtrate <hi>aſſembled</hi> to make Rules and
<hi>Canons</hi> to become binding to the <hi>good people</hi>
of the Common wealth, when confirmed
by the <hi>ſupreame A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>thority</hi> of the Nation, and
not elſe; that <hi>penaltys</hi> were appointed to
the <hi>diſturbers</hi> of this <hi>Order</hi> by the ſame <hi>Law,</hi>
I grant. But that any thing of all this,
as ſuch, that is, as a <hi>part of this whole,</hi> or the
<hi>whole it ſelfe,</hi> was inſtituted by the <hi>will</hi> and
<hi>appointment</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that is denyed.
Let not any one think, that becauſe we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the conſtitution pleaded about, to have
had the <hi>ſtamp</hi> of the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi>
that therefore we pulled it down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115353:120"/>
it by violence. It was ſet up before
we were borne, by them who had power
to make <hi>Laws</hi> to bind the People of this
Nation, and we found men in an orderly
<hi>legall</hi> poſſeſſion of that power, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erting
its ſelfe <hi>ſeverall</hi> wayes, maintained
and preſerved that conſtitution, which we
had no call to eradicate. Only whereas
they tooke upon them to act in the <hi>name
of Chriſt</hi> alſo, and to interpoſe their orders,
and <hi>Authority</hi> in the things of the worſhip
of God, we entreated them, that we might
paſſe our <hi>pilgrimage</hi> quietly in our <hi>native
Country</hi> (as <hi>Iſrael</hi> would have gone through
the <hi>Land of Edonie,</hi> without the diſturbance
of its inhabitants) and worſhip God
acording to the <hi>light</hi> which he had <hi>gratiouſly</hi>
imparted to us, but they would not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
But herein alſo was it our duty to
keep the word of Chriſts <hi>patience.</hi> Their
<hi>removall,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of this <hi>Nationall</hi>
Church, aroſe, and was carryed on, as hath
been declared, by other hands, on other
acounts.</p>
               <p>Now it is not to <hi>any purpoſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> to plead the
Authority of the Church, for many of the
<hi>inſtitutions</hi> mentioned: for neither hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Church Power,</hi> or can have, to <hi>inſtitute</hi>
and <hi>appoint</hi> the <hi>things,</hi> whereby it is made
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115353:121"/>
to be ſo; as theſe things are the very <hi>forme</hi>
of the Church, that we <hi>plead</hi> about; nor
hath any <hi>Church</hi> any Authority, but what
is <hi>anſwerable</hi> to its Nature: if it ſelfe be of
a <hi>civill prudentiall conſtitution,</hi> its Authority
alſo is <hi>Civill</hi> and no more. Denying their
Church in that <hi>forme</hi> of it, which makes it
<hi>ſuch,</hi> to be of the <hi>inſtitution</hi> of Chriſt; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be expected that we ſhould grant, that
it is, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> inveſted with any <hi>Authority</hi>
from Chriſt, ſo that the diſſolution of the
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of this <hi>Church,</hi> as it had its <hi>riſe</hi> on ſuch
an account, proceeded from an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>humane Conſtitution,</hi> whereon it was
<hi>built;</hi> and how that was done, was before
declared. Then let them prove,</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Ordinary Officers</hi> are before the
<hi>Church,</hi> and that in <hi>Eccleſia inſtituta,</hi> as well

               </p>
               <p>2. That Chriſt hath <hi>appointed</hi> any <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                  <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> with a <hi>plenitude</hi> of <hi>Ordinary</hi>

               <p>3. That he hath <hi>inſtituted</hi> any <hi>Nationall

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth depend?</p>
               <p>Briefely,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> when they have <hi>proved Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan,

pleaded for; a <hi>firſtneſſe</hi> of power
in the <hi>Nationall Officers</hi> of that <hi>Nationall

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of that Church; alſo that
every man, who is <hi>borne,</hi> and in his infancy
<hi>babtized</hi> in that Nation, is a <hi>member of that

ſhall have diſtinguiſhed clearly in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
their <hi>Adminiſtrations,</hi> and have told
us that they counted to be of <hi>Eccleſiaſticall
power,</hi> and what they grant to be a <hi>meere
emanation</hi> of the civill <hi>Government</hi> of the
Nation, we will then treat with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the buſineſſe of <hi>Schiſme.</hi> Untill
then, if they tell us, that we have forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the <hi>Church of England</hi> in the ſence plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for by them; I muſt anſwer, that
which is <hi>wanting</hi> cannot be <hi>numbred.</hi> It is no
crime to depart from nothing; we have
not <hi>left</hi> to be that, which we never were;
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115353:122"/>
which may ſuffice both us and them, as to
our ſeverall <hi>reſpective</hi> concernments of
<hi>conſcience</hi> and Power. It hath been from
the darkneſſe of men, and <hi>ignorance</hi> of the
Scriptures, that ſome have taken advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to ſet up a product of the <hi>prudence</hi>
of Nations, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt,
and on that account to require the <hi>Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi>
of it. When the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of God is
againe well fixed amongſt men, theſe ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
will fly away: in the mean time
we owe all theſe <hi>diſputes,</hi> with innumerable
other evills, to the Apoſtacy of the <hi>Roman
Combination,</hi> from which we are farre as
yet from being cleerly delivered.</p>
               <p>I have one thing more to adde upon
the whole matter,<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> and I ſhall proceed to
what is laſtly to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church of England</hi> as it is called,
(that is, the <hi>people thereof)</hi> ſeparated herſelfe
from the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> To free <hi>herſelfe</hi>
from the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> in ſo doing,
as <hi>ſhee</hi> (that is, the learned men of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
<hi>pleaded</hi> the errours and corruptions
of that Church, under this eſpeciall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of their being impoſed by <hi>Tyranny;</hi>
ſo alſo by profeſſing her <hi>deſigne</hi> to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but to reduce Religion, and the
<hi>worſhip</hi> of God, to its <hi>originall purity,</hi> from
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115353:123"/>
which it was fallen. And we all joyntly
juſtify both her and all other reformed
Churches in this plea.</p>
               <p>In her deſigne to reduce Religion to its
primitive purity, ſhee alwayes profeſſed,
that ſhee did not take her <hi>direction</hi> from the
<hi>Scripture</hi> only, but alſo from the <hi>Councells</hi>
and <hi>examples</hi> of the four or five firſt <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies,</hi>
to which ſhe laboured to conforme
her Reformation. Let the queſtion now
be, whether there be not <hi>corruptions</hi> in this
Church of England, ſuppoſing ſuch a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall
ſtate</hi> to be inſtituted. What I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you ſhall bind my <hi>Conſcience</hi> to <hi>acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce</hi>
in what is pleaded from the 4 or 5 firſt
<hi>Centuries</hi> conſiſting of men, that <hi>could,</hi> and
did <hi>erre;</hi> more then that did hers, which
was pleaded from the 9. or 10. Centuries
following? Have not I <hi>liberty</hi> to call for
<hi>Reformation</hi> according to the Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
or at leaſt to profeſſe that my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
cannot be bound to any other?
The ſumme is, the buſineſſe of <hi>Schiſme</hi>
from the <hi>Church of England,</hi> is as a thing
built <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>ſimply</hi> on <hi>Politicall conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
ſo <hi>interwoven</hi> with them, ſo <hi>influenced</hi>
from them, as not to be ſeparated. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
advice of <hi>Moecenas</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:115353:123"/>
mentioned in <hi>Diocaſſias,</hi> is the beſt <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
I know againſt it.</p>
               <p>Before we part with this <hi>Conſideration;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 27.</note>
I muſt needs prevent one miſtake, which
perhaps in the mind of ſome may <hi>ariſe</hi>
upon the <hi>preceding</hi> diſcourſe: for whereas
ſundry <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the worſhip of God
are rightly to be adminiſtred only in a
<hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> doe evidently relate
thereunto, the denying of a <hi>Nationall
Church</hi> ſtate ſeemes to deny that we had
<hi>either Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Ordinances</hi> here in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
The truth is, it ſeemes ſo to doe, but
it doth not; unleſſe you will ſay, that
unleſſe ſhee be a <hi>Nationall Church ſtate,</hi>
there is no other; which is too abſurd
for any one to imagine. It followes indeed,
that there were no <hi>Nationall Church Officers,</hi>
that there were no <hi>Ordinances numerically</hi> the
ſame to be adminiſtred in and to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at once, but that there was not <hi>another
Church</hi> ſtate in England, and on the <hi>account</hi>
thereof, Ordinances truly <hi>adminiſtred</hi> by
lawfull Miniſters it doth not follow. And
now if by this <hi>diſcourſe</hi> I only call this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
to a <hi>review,</hi> by them who are concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to aſſert this <hi>Nationall Church</hi> I am
ſatifyed. That the <hi>Church of England</hi> is a
<hi>true</hi> Church of Chriſt, they have hitherto
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:115353:124"/>
maintained againſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> on the
account of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught in it, &amp; the
ſucceſſive ordination of its officers,
through the Church of Rome its ſelfe,
from the primitive times. About the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
and nature of a <hi>nationall Church,</hi>
they have had with them no <hi>contention.</hi>
Therein the parties at variance were <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed</hi>
The ſame grounds and principles,
improved with a defence of the externall
<hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>Geremonies</hi> eſtabliſhed on the
Authority of the Church they mannaged
againſt the <hi>non-conformiſts,</hi> and <hi>ſeparatiſts</hi> at
home. But their chiefe ſtrength againſt
them, lay in Arguments more forcible,
which need not be repeated. The <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Church now <hi>impleaded,</hi> deſerves
as I ſaid the review: Hitherto it hath
been <hi>unfurniſhed</hi> of any conſiderable <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſative.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. There is another way of Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a <hi>nationall Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 28.</note> which is inſiſted on
by ſome of our <hi>bretheren</hi> of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
way. This is, that ſuch a <hi>thing</hi> ſhould <hi>ariſe</hi>
from the <hi>particular Congregations,</hi> that are in
the <hi>Nation</hi> united by ſundry <hi>Aſſociations</hi> and
<hi>ſubordinations</hi> of <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> in and by the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives</hi> of thoſe Churches. So that
though there cannot be an Aſſembly of all
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115353:124"/>
the members of thoſe Churches in one
place, for the performance of any worſhip
of God; nor is there any Ordinance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Chriſt to be ſo <hi>celebrated</hi> in any
<hi>Aſſembly</hi> of them, (which we ſuppoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the <hi>constitution of a particular
Church)</hi> yet there may be an <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of the
<hi>repreſentatives</hi> of them all by ſeverall <hi>eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
for ſome end and purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In this ſence,<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> a Church may
be called <hi>Nationall,</hi> when all the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Congregations</hi> of one <hi>Nation,</hi> living under

and <hi>worſhip,</hi> are governed by their <hi>greater</hi>

every man from being a member of
the <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that is, from a ſhare
in the <hi>profeſſion of the faith,</hi> which is owned

               <p>It is pleaded,<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> that there are <hi>propheſies</hi>
and <hi>promiſes</hi> of a <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> that

<hi>Pſ. 32. 10, 11, 12. Iſ: 2. 2. Iſ. 10. 18, 19,
24, 25.</hi> That it is <hi>foretold</hi> and <hi>promiſed</hi> that
many <hi>whole Nations</hi> ſhall be converted to
the faith of the Goſpell, and thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the people of God, who before were
<hi>no people,</hi> is granted; but that their <hi>way</hi> of
<hi>worſhip</hi> ſhall be by <hi>Nationall Churches</hi> gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by leſſer and greater <hi>Aſſemblys</hi> doth
not appeare. And when the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhall be
converted, they ſhall be a <hi>Nationall Church,</hi>
as <hi>England</hi> is: but their <hi>way of worſhip</hi> ſhall
be regulated according to the <hi>inſtitution</hi> of
Chriſt in the Goſpell. And therefore the
publiſhers of the life of Dr <hi>Gouge</hi> have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
his judgement found in a paper in
his ſtudy, that the Jewes on their <hi>calling
ſhall be gathered together into Churches, and
not be ſcattered, as now they are. A Nation</hi> may
be ſaid to be converted, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed

ſubjection to the Goſpell of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in it, as may give demonſtration to
the whole: But the way of <hi>worſhip</hi> for
thoſe ſo converted, is peculiarly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted.
It is ſaid moreover, that the <hi>ſeverall
congregations</hi> in one City, are called a
<hi>Church,</hi> as in <hi>Hieruſalem Act. 6. 1. Act. 12, 1,
3. Act. 15. 14, 22.</hi> ſo alſo may all the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; nor is that

and if more Churches then <hi>one</hi> were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of the nature of the <hi>generall viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church,</hi> not of that which is <hi>particular,</hi>
and the <hi>ſeate</hi> of <hi>Ordinances.</hi> So where <hi>Paul</hi> is

as made up into one <hi>body</hi> or Church, by a

thing that never was in the world, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
will be) is denyed and not yet by
any that I know proved; not that
I am offended at the name of the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> though I think all profeſſors as
ſuch, are rather to be called ſo, then all
the <hi>Congregations.</hi> That all profeſſors of
the truth of the Goſpell, throughout the
<hi>world,</hi> are the <hi>viſible Church</hi> of Chriſt, in the
ſence before explained, is granted. So may
on the ſame account all the profeſſors of
that truth in <hi>England,</hi> be called the <hi>Church
of England.</hi> But it is the inſtitution of <hi>leſſer</hi>
and <hi>greater Aſſemblies,</hi> compriſing the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives</hi>
of all the Churches in the
world, that muſt give Being and Union to
the <hi>viſible</hi> Church in the ſence pleaded for
throughout the world, or in this <hi>Nation,</hi> &amp;
that bounded to this relation by vertue of
the ſame <hi>inſtitution,</hi> that is to be proved.</p>
               <p>But of what there is,<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> or ſeemes to be
of <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> in this <hi>order</hi> and <hi>fabrick,</hi>
what of <hi>humane Prudent Creation,</hi> what in
the matter, or manner of it, I cannot
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115353:126"/>
aſſent unto, I ſhall not at preſent enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the conſideration; but ſhall only as to
my purpoſe in hand, take up ſome <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
which lye in <hi>common between</hi> the men of
this <hi>perſwaſion</hi> and my ſelfe, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
otherwiſe minded. Now of theſe are
the enſuing Aſſertions.</p>
               <p>1. No man can poſſibly be a member
of a <hi>Nationall</hi> Church in this ſenſe,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> but by
vertue of his being a member of ſome
<hi>particular Church</hi> in the Nation; which
concurrs to the making up of the <hi>Nationall
Church.</hi> As a man doth not <hi>legally</hi> belong to
any <hi>County</hi> in the <hi>Nation,</hi> unleſſe he belong
to ſome <hi>Hundred</hi> or <hi>Pariſh</hi> in that <hi>County;</hi> this
is <hi>evident</hi> from the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf,
Nor is it pleaded, that we are one <hi>Nationall
Church,</hi> becauſe the people of the <hi>Nation</hi>
are generally baptized, and doe profeſſe
the true faith, but becauſe the <hi>particular
Congregations</hi> in it are <hi>ruled,</hi> and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the whole, by <hi>leſſer</hi> and <hi>greater
Aſſemblies.</hi> I ſuppoſe it will not be on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
thoughts inſiſted on, <hi>that particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
agreeing ſolemnely in Doctrine and
worſhip under one civill Government,</hi> doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
a <hi>nationall</hi> Church; for if ſo, its
forme and unity as ſuch, muſt be given
it meerly by the <hi>civill Government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:115353:127"/>
2. No man can recede from this
Church,<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> or depart from it, but by depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from ſome <hi>particular Church</hi> therein.
At the ſame door that <hi>a man comes</hi> in, he
muſt goe out. If I ceaſe to be a member of
a <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> it is by the ceaſing or
aboliſhing of that, which gave me <hi>originall</hi>
right thereunto, which was my relation
to the <hi>particular Church,</hi> whereof I am.</p>
               <p>3. To make men members of any
<hi>particular Church</hi> or <hi>Churches,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 34.</note> their owne
<hi>conſent</hi> is required. All men muſt admit of
this, who allow it free for a man to chooſe
where he will fix his habitation.</p>
               <p>4. That as yet,<note place="margin">§. 35.</note> at leaſt ſince <hi>poſſibly</hi>
we could be <hi>perſonally</hi> concerned who are
<hi>now alive,</hi> no ſuch Church in this <hi>Nation</hi>
hath been <hi>formed.</hi> It is impoſſible, that a
man ſhould be guilty of <hi>offending</hi> againſt
that, which is not: We have not ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from a <hi>Nationall</hi> Church in the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi>
ſence, as never having ſeen any ſuch
thing; unleſſe they will ſay, we have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from what ſhould be.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>As to the ſtate of ſuch a Church as
this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſhall only adde to what hath been

that I am not pleading the right, <hi>liberty</hi> and

conſidering the true notion of <hi>Schiſme,</hi>
and the charge mannaged againſt us on

<hi>gathering</hi> of Churches, as ſimply conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
I ſay then</p>
               <p>1. Either we have been <hi>members</hi> by our

                  <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> according to the
mind of Chriſt, of ſome <hi>particular congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
in ſuch a <hi>Nationall church,</hi> &amp; that as <hi>de facto</hi>
part of <hi>ſuch a church</hi> or we have not? If we
have not been ſo, (as it is moſt certaine we
have not) then we have not as yet <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
any <hi>bond,</hi> or violated any <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed</hi>
any peace, or order of the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that whatever
of trouble or <hi>diviſion</hi> hath followed on
our <hi>way,</hi> and <hi>walking,</hi> is to be charged on
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115353:128"/>
them who have turned every ſtone, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
us our <hi>Liberty.</hi> And I humbly begge
of them, who acting on principles of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
according to the (commonly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<hi>Preſbyterian</hi> platforme, doe accuſe us
for ſeparation from the Church of <hi>England</hi>
that they would ſeriouſly conſider what
they intend thereby? Is it that we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from the <hi>Faith</hi> of the people of
God in England? they will not ſuſtaine
any ſuch crimination: Is it that we have
forſaken the Church of England as under
its <hi>Epiſcopall conſtitution?</hi> have they not
done the ſame? have they not rejected
their Nationall Officers, with all the
<hi>bonds, tyes</hi> and <hi>ligaments</hi> of the Union of
that pretended Church? have they not
renounced the way of worſhip, eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by the Law of the Land? doe they
not diſavow all obedience to them who
were their <hi>legall</hi> Superiours in that <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
doe they retaine either <hi>matter</hi> or
<hi>forme,</hi> or any thing, but that naked name
of that Church? And will they condemne
others in what they <hi>practiſe</hi> themſelves?
As for a <hi>Church of England,</hi> in their new
ſence, (which yet in ſome reſpects is not
new but old) for what is beyond a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
conſociation of <hi>particular Churches,</hi> we

may live within the precincts of a Pariſh, and yet
be no member of a Church. A man muſt therefore
in order of nature, be a member of the Church
viſible, and then living in a Pariſh, and making
profeſſion of Chriſtianity may claime admiſſion into

will be difficult and tenacious as to

yet upon the account of ſome <hi>defect,</hi> which

and <hi>purpoſe</hi> not living within thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts.
I ſhall boldly ſay, this <hi>Schiſme</hi> is
commanded by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, 1 Tim. 6. 5.
2 Tim. 3. 5. Hoſ. 4. 15.</hi> Is this <hi>yoke</hi> laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me by Chriſt, that to goe along with
the multitude where I live, that hate to be

the <hi>priviledges,</hi> that he hath <hi>purchaſed</hi>

               <p>I ſuppoſe nothing can be more <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:115353:133"/>
then once to <hi>imagine</hi> any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>However,<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> not to <hi>derive</hi> this buſineſſe any
farther, but to put it to its <hi>proper iſſue.</hi>
When it is proved, that this is the <hi>will</hi> and
<hi>appointment</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, that every <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever,</hi>
who liveth within ſuch a precinct
allotted by Civill <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> wherein

how prophane ſoever that part of them
be from whom the <hi>whole</hi> is denominated,
how <hi>corrupt</hi> ſoever in their <hi>worſhip,</hi> how <hi>dead</hi>
ſoever, as to the <hi>power of Godlineſse,</hi> muſt
abide with them and joyne with them in
the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> and <hi>worſhip,</hi> and that
indiſpenſably; this buſineſſe may come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
under debate. In the meane time,
I ſuppoſe the people of God are not in
any ſuch ſubjection. I ſpeake not this, as
laying down this for a principle, that it is
the duty of <hi>every man</hi> to ſeparate from that
<hi>Church,</hi> wherein evill and wicked men are
<hi>tollerated</hi> (though that opinion, muſt have
many other attendances, before it can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the leaſt <hi>affinity</hi> with that of the ſame
<hi>ſound,</hi> which was condmned in the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts)</hi>
but this only I ſay, that where any
<hi>Church</hi> is over borne by a multitude of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115353:133"/>
                  <hi>men</hi> wicked and prophane; ſo that it
cannot reforme it ſelfe, or will not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the minde of Chriſt, a <hi>Believer</hi> is
ſo farre at <hi>liberty,</hi> that he may deſert the
Communion of that <hi>ſociety,</hi> without the
leaſt guilt of <hi>Schiſme.</hi> But this ſtate of
things is now little pleaded for.</p>
               <p>It is uſually objected about the Church
of <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 47.</note> that there was in it many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and enormous miſcarriages, diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and breaches of Love: <hi>miſcarriages</hi>
through <hi>drink</hi> at their <hi>meetings;</hi> groſſe <hi>ſins</hi>
in the <hi>inceſtuous perſon</hi> tolerated; <hi>falſe doctrine</hi>
broached; the <hi>Reſurrection denyed;</hi> and yet
<hi>Paul</hi> adviſes no man to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from it,
but all to performe their duty in it.</p>
               <p>But how little our preſent <hi>plea</hi> &amp; <hi>defenſative</hi>
is concerned in this <hi>inſtance,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 48.</note> ſuppoſed to ly
againſt it, very <hi>few conſiderations</hi> will evince.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>Church of Corinth</hi> was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
a true <hi>Church,</hi> lately <hi>inſtituted</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>minde</hi> of Chriſt, and was not
fallen from that <hi>priviledge</hi> by any <hi>miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,</hi>
nor had ſuffered any thing <hi>deſtructive</hi>
to its <hi>being;</hi> which wholy differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>caſe</hi> propoſed in reſpect of many
<hi>particulars,</hi> and the inſtance produced. We
confeſſe the <hi>abuſes,</hi> and evills mentioned
had crept into the <hi>Church,</hi> and doe thence
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115353:134"/>
grant, that many abuſes may doe ſo into
any of the beſt of the <hi>Churches</hi> of God. Nor
did it <hi>ever</hi> enter into the <hi>heart</hi> of any man
to think, that ſo ſoon as any diſorders fall
out, or abuſes creep into it, it is inſtantly
the duty of any to fly out of it, like <hi>Pauls</hi>
Mariners out of the ſhip, when the ſtorme
grew hazardous. It being the duty of all
the <hi>members</hi> of ſuch a Church untainted
with the evills and corruptions of it, upon
many accounts to attempt and labour the
<hi>remedie</hi> of thoſe diſorders, and rejection of
theſe abuſes to the uttermoſt; which was
that, which <hi>Paul</hi> adviſed the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
all and ſome unto, in obedience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they were recovered. But yet this I
ſay, had the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> continued
in the condition before preſcribed, that
<hi>notorious, ſcandalous</hi> ſinnes had went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiſhed,
unreproved, <hi>drunkenneſſe</hi>
continued, and practiſed in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
men abiding by the denyall of the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> ſo overturning the whole
<hi>Goſpell,</hi> and the Church refuſing to do her
<hi>duty,</hi> and exerciſe her Authority to caſt all
thoſe <hi>diſorderly perſons</hi> upon their obſtinacy
out of her communion; It had been the
duty of every <hi>Saint</hi> of God in that
Church, to have <hi>withdrawn</hi> from it, to
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115353:134"/>
come out from among them, and not to
have been partaker of their ſinnes, unleſſe
they were willing to partake of their <hi>plague</hi>
alſo; which on ſuch an <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> would
certainly enſue.</p>

affirmes, that <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their worſhip,
when they were ſo corrupted, as in their
dayes, and ſeparated not from their <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
(as he calls them,) but only <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
ſometimes</hi> for feare of <hi>perſecution;</hi> a
<hi>miſtake</hi> unworthy ſo great and <hi>wiſe</hi> a <hi>perſon</hi>
as he was. The <hi>publick worſhip</hi> of thoſe
<hi>10 Tribes</hi> in the dayes of thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> was
<hi>Idolatrous,</hi> erected by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> confirmed
by a Law, by <hi>Omri,</hi> and continued by
<hi>Ahab.</hi> That the <hi>Prophets</hi> joyned with them
in it, is not to be <hi>imagined.</hi> But earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of deſire for the attaining of any <hi>end,</hi>
ſometimes leaves no <hi>roome</hi> for the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the <hi>Medium's,</hi> offering their
ſervice to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee the ſum of the whole <hi>matter</hi>
and what it is that we plead for our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
as to this <hi>crime</hi> of Schiſme,<note place="margin">§. 50.</note> allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Terme to paſſe in its large and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall
acceptation, receding for the ſake
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115353:135"/>
of the <hi>Truths farther ventilation</hi> from
the <hi>preciſe</hi> propriety of the word <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed</hi>
to it in the Scripture: The ſumme
is, we have broken <hi>no bond</hi> of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> no

that ever we were in, according to <hi>his
mind,</hi> which alone can give <hi>countenance</hi> to an
<hi>accuſation</hi> of this <hi>Nature.</hi> That on <hi>pure
grounds of conſcience</hi> we have withdrawn,
or doe withhold our ſelves from <hi>partaking</hi>
in <hi>ſome wayes,</hi> engaged into upon meer
grounds of <hi>Prudence</hi> we acknowledge.</p>
               <p>And thus from what hath been ſaid,<note place="margin">§. 51.</note> it
appeares in what a faire <hi>capacity</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
any <hi>principle</hi> or practice owned
by us, we are to <hi>live</hi> peaceably, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
all fruits of <hi>Love</hi> towards thoſe
who are otherwiſe minded.</p>
               <p>There is not the leaſt neceſſity on us,<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> may
we be permitted to ſerve God according
to our <hi>light,</hi> for the acquitting our ſelves
from the <hi>charge,</hi> which hath made ſuch a
noiſe in the world, to charge other men,
with their failings, <hi>great,</hi> or <hi>ſmall,</hi> in or
about the ways and <hi>worſhip</hi> of God. This
only is incumbent on us, that we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,
that we have broken no <hi>bond,</hi> no
<hi>obligation,</hi> or <hi>tye</hi> to communion, which
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115353:135"/>
lay upon us by the will &amp; appointment of
Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, and Maſter: what is
<hi>prudentially</hi> to be done in ſuch a <hi>Nation</hi> as
this, in ſuch a time as this, as to the <hi>worſhip</hi>
of God, we will <hi>treate</hi> with men at farther
leiſure, and when we are <hi>lawfully</hi> called
thereto.</p>
               <p>It may be ſome will yet ſay,<note place="margin">§. 53.</note> (becauſe
it hath been often ſaid) there is <hi>difference</hi>
between <hi>reforming of Churches</hi> already ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
and raiſed, and <hi>raiſing</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi>
out of meer <hi>materialls.</hi> The firſt may be
<hi>allowed,</hi> but the latter tends to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Confuſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have at <hi>preſent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 54.</note> not much to ſay to
this <hi>objection,</hi> becauſe as I conceive, it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes</hi>
not the <hi>buſineſſe</hi> we have in hand:
Nor would I have <hi>mentioned</hi> it at all; but
that its <hi>inſiſted</hi> on by ſome on every turne,
whether ſuited for the <hi>particular</hi> cauſe, for
which it is produced, or no. In briefe
then.</p>
               <p>1. I know no other <hi>reformation</hi> of any
Church, or any thing in a Church, but
the <hi>reducing</hi> of it to its <hi>primitive</hi> Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and the <hi>order</hi> allotted to it by Jeſus
Chriſt. If any plead for any other <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
of Churches, they are in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to blame.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:115353:136"/>
And when any <hi>ſociety,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 55.</note> or <hi>Combination</hi>
of men, (whatever hitherto it hath been
eſteemed) is not capable of ſuch a <hi>Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
and <hi>Renovation.</hi> I ſuppoſe I ſhall not
<hi>provoke</hi> any <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>ſober perſon,</hi> if I profeſſes
I cannot <hi>look on ſuch a ſociety,</hi> as a Church
of Chriſt, and thereupon <hi>adviſe</hi> thoſe
therein, who have a due <hi>right</hi> to the
<hi>priviledges purchaſed for them</hi> by Chriſt, as to
<hi>Goſpell</hi> Adminiſtrations, to take ſome

               </p>
               <p>2. Were I fully to handle the things
pointed to in this Objection, I muſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
Principles, which in this Diſcourſe
I have not been occaſioned to draw forth
at all, or to <hi>improve.</hi> Many things of great
<hi>weight</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> muſt come under <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi>
and conſideration, before a <hi>cleare</hi>
account can be given of the caſe ſtated in
this Objection; as</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>true</hi> nature of an <hi>inſtituted
Church</hi> under the Goſpell,<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> as to the <hi>matter,
forme,</hi> and all other <hi>neceſſary conſtitutive</hi>
cauſes, is to be <hi>inveſtigated</hi> and found
out.</p>
               <p>2. The <hi>nature,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 58.</note> and <hi>forme</hi> of ſuch a
Church is to be <hi>exemplifyed</hi> from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the <hi>ſtories</hi> of the firſt Churches,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:115353:136"/>
before ſenſibly <hi>infeſted</hi> with the poyſon of
that <hi>Apostacy</hi> which enſued.</p>
               <p>3. The <hi>extent</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> under <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 59.</note> as to the ruining of <hi>inſtituted Churches,</hi>
making them to be <hi>Babylon,</hi> and their
<hi>worſhip Fornication,</hi> is duely and carefully
to be examined.</p>
               <p>Hic labor, Hoc opus.</p>
               <p>Here lyes our diſorder and diviſion;
hence is our darkneſſe and pollution of
our <hi>garments,</hi> which is not an eaſy thing
to free our ſelves of; though we may
ariſe, yet we ſhall not ſpeedily ſhake our
ſelves out of the duſt.</p>
               <p>4. By what way and meanes God <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat
anew</hi> and <hi>kept alive</hi> his Elect,<note place="margin">§. 60.</note> in their
ſeverall Generations, when <hi>Antichristian</hi>
darkneſſe covered the <hi>Earth;</hi> and <hi>thick
darkneſſe</hi> the Nations, ſuppoſing an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
of inſtituted Ordinances,</hi> ſo farre as to
make a <hi>nullity</hi> in them, as to what was of
<hi>ſimple</hi> and pure <hi>Inſtitution;</hi> what way might
be uſed for the fixing the <hi>Tabernacle of God
againe with men,</hi> and the <hi>ſetting up</hi> of <hi>Church
worſhip</hi> according to his minde, and will.
And here the famous caſe of the <hi>united
Brethren</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> would come under
conſideration; who concluding the
whole <hi>Papacy</hi> to be purely <hi>Antichristian,</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:115353:137"/>
could not allow of the <hi>Ordination</hi> of their

               </p>
               <p>It is not <hi>impoſſible,</hi> that ſome may, from
what hath been <hi>ſpoken,</hi> begin to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
that they have been <hi>too hasty</hi> in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>other</hi> men. Indeed none are more <hi>ready</hi>
to <hi>charge</hi> highly, then thoſe who when
they have ſo done, are moſt <hi>unable</hi> to make
good their charge; <hi>ſi accuſaſſe ſufficiat, quis

ſenſe have enſued among <hi>brethren,</hi> by
their <hi>cauſeleſſe</hi> mutuall imputation of
<hi>Schiſme</hi> in things of <hi>inſtitution,</hi> is knowne.
And when men are in one <hi>fault,</hi> and are
charged with <hi>another,</hi> wherein they are not,
it is a <hi>ready</hi> way to <hi>confirme</hi> them in <hi>that,</hi>

worſhip,</hi> then ſome men are aware of:
not that it was ſo from the <hi>beginning,</hi>
whilſt Chriſtianity continued in its naked
<hi>ſimplicity:</hi> but it is come occaſionally
upon us by the <hi>cuſtomes, darkneſſe</hi> and
<hi>invincible prejudices,</hi> that have taken hold
on the minds of men by a ſecret <hi>diffuſion</hi> of
the poyſon of that <hi>grand Apoſtacy.</hi> It were
well then, that men would not be ſo <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
nor eaſily <hi>perſwaded,</hi> that they preſently
know how all things ought to be, becauſe
they know how they would have ſome
things to be, which ſuite their temper
and intereſt. Men may eaſily perhaps ſee,
or think they ſee, what they doe not like,
and crie out <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Separation,</hi> but if
they would a little <hi>conſider</hi> what <hi>ought to be</hi>
in this <hi>whole matter;</hi> according to the <hi>mind
of God,</hi> and what evidences they have of
the <hi>grounds</hi> and <hi>principles,</hi> whereon they
<hi>condemne</hi> others, it might make them yet
<hi>ſwift</hi> to <hi>heare,</hi> but <hi>ſlow</hi> to <hi>ſpeake,</hi> and take
off from the number of <hi>Teachers</hi> among
us; ſome are readie to think, that all that
joyne not with them are <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> and
they are ſo, becauſe they goe not with
them, and other reaſon they have none:
being unable to give any ſolid <hi>foundation:</hi>
of what they profeſſe; what the <hi>cauſe</hi> of
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:115353:138"/>
Unity among the people of God, hath
ſuffered from this ſort of <hi>men,</hi> is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily

               <p>2. In all differences about <hi>Religion</hi> to
<hi>drive</hi> them to their <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ſpring,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 66.</note> and
to conſider them as ſtated <hi>originally,</hi> will
eaſe us of <hi>much trouble</hi> and <hi>labour.</hi> Perhaps
<hi>many of them</hi> will not appeare ſo <hi>formidable,</hi>
as they are repreſented. He that ſees a
great <hi>River,</hi> is not inſtantly to <hi>conclude</hi>
that all the <hi>water</hi> in it comes from its firſt
<hi>riſe</hi> &amp; <hi>ſpring;</hi> the addition of many <hi>brookes
ſhowers</hi> and <hi>landfloods,</hi> have perhaps ſwelled
it to the condition wherein it is: every
difference in <hi>Religion</hi> is not to be thought
to be as big at its riſe, as it <hi>appeares</hi> to be
when it hath paſſed through many <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi>
and hath <hi>received</hi> additions and
<hi>aggravations</hi> from the <hi>diſputings</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
of men, on the one hand, and the
other, ingaged. What a <hi>flood of Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
doth this buſineſſe of Schiſme ſeem to
be, as <hi>rolling</hi> down tous through the <hi>wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>

the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> decrees of <hi>Popiſh Councells</hi>
with the contrivances of ſome, among
our ſelves, concerned to keep up the
<hi>ſwelled notion</hi> of it! Goe to its riſe, and you
will find it to be, <hi>though bad enough,</hi> yet quite
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115353:139"/>
                  <hi>another thing,</hi> then what by the <hi>pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

accrewing by the <hi>addition</hi> of ſo <hi>many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi>
it is now generally repreſented to
be. The great <hi>maxime, To the Law</hi> and to
the <hi>Teſtimonie,</hi> truly improved, would
quickly cure all our <hi>diſtempers:</hi> in the

our <hi>outward man</hi> may poſſibly be diſpoſed
of, according to the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> that others
have of what we doe, or are, our <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences</hi>

hath <hi>appointed.</hi> How ſome men may <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile</hi>
againſt us, before whom we muſt
<hi>ſtand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> according to their <hi>corrupt notion</hi>
of Schiſme, we know not: the Rule of
our Conſciences, in this, as in all other
things, is <hi>eternall</hi> and <hi>unchangable.</hi> Whilſt
I have an <hi>uncontrolable</hi> faithfull <hi>witneſſe,</hi> that
I tranſgreſſe no limits preſcribed to me
in the Word, that I doe not <hi>willingly break,</hi>
or diſſolve any <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Inſtitution
of Jeſus Chriſt, my minde as to this thing
is <hi>filled</hi> with perfect peace. Bleſſed be God,
that hath <hi>reſerved</hi> the ſole <hi>ſoveraingty</hi> of our
<hi>Conſciences</hi> in his hand, and not in the
leaſt <hi>parcelled</hi> it out to any of the ſons of
men, whoſe <hi>tender mercies</hi> being often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
cruelty it ſelfe, they would perhaps
deſtroy the <hi>ſoule</hi> alſo, when they doe ſo to
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115353:139"/>
the body, ſeeing they ſtay there, as our
Saviour witneſſeth, becauſe they can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<hi>no farther;</hi> Here then I profeſſe to <hi>reſt;</hi> in
this doth my <hi>Conſcience acquieſce:</hi> whilſt I
have any <hi>comfortable perſwaſion,</hi> on grounds
infallible, that <hi>I hold the Head,</hi> and that I
am by <hi>faith a member of the myſticall body of
Chriſt,</hi> whilſt I make profeſſion of all the
<hi>neceſſary ſaving Truths</hi> of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> whilſt
I <hi>disturbe not</hi> the peace of that <hi>particular</hi>
Church, whereof by my own <hi>conſent</hi> I am
a <hi>member,</hi> nor doe raiſe up, nor continue
in any <hi>cauſeles</hi> differences with them, or any
of them, with whom I walke in the <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip</hi>
and order of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> whilſt I
<hi>labour</hi> to <hi>exerciſe faith towards the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> and love towards all the <hi>Saints,</hi>
I doe keep the Unity, which is of the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi>
of Chriſt; and let men ſay, from
<hi>principles</hi> utterly <hi>forraigne</hi> to the Goſpell,
what they pleaſe, or can, to the contrary,
I am no <hi>Schiſmatick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Perhaps the <hi>diſcoverie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 67.</note> which hath
been made, how <hi>little</hi> we are many of us
concerned in that, which having <hi>mutually</hi>
charged it on one another, hath been
the <hi>greateſt ball</hi> of ſtrife, and moſt <hi>effectu</hi>-all
engine of difference, and diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us, may be a meanes to <hi>reconcile</hi>
                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:115353:140"/>
in Love them that truely feare <hi>God,</hi> though
engaged in <hi>ſeverall wayes</hi> as to ſome <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
I confeſſe I have not any great <hi>hope</hi> of
much ſucceſſe on this account; for let
<hi>principles</hi> and <hi>ways be made as evident,</hi> as if he
that wrote them carryed the Sunne in his
<hi>hand;</hi> yet whilſt men are foreſtalled by
<hi>prejudices,</hi> and have their <hi>affections,</hi> and
<hi>ſpirits</hi> engaged ſuitably <hi>thereunto,</hi> no great
<hi>alteration</hi> in their <hi>minde</hi> and <hi>wayes,</hi> on the
cleareſt conviction whatever, is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
All our hearts are in the hand of
God; and our expectations of what he
hath promiſed, are to be proportioned to
what he <hi>can effect,</hi> not to what of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes, we ſee to be uſed.</p>
               <p>4. To <hi>conclude;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 68.</note> what <hi>vaine janglings</hi> men
are endlesly engaged in; who will lay
their own <hi>falſe hypotheſes,</hi> and preconcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as a ground of farther procedure, is
alſo in part evident, by what hath been
<hi>delivered.</hi> Hence (for inſtance) is that
<hi>doubty diſpute</hi> in the world; whether a
<hi>Schiſmatick</hi> doth belong to the Church, or
noe? which for the moſt part is determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the <hi>Negative;</hi> when it is impoſſible
a <hi>man</hi> ſhould be ſo, but by vertue of his
being a <hi>Church Member.</hi> A Church is that
<hi>alienum ſolum,</hi> wherein that <hi>evill</hi> dwelleth.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115353:140"/>
The moſt of the enquiries that are made,
and diſputed on, whether <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi>
ſort of men belongs to the <hi>Church</hi> or no?
are of the <hi>ſame</hi> value and import. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> who is united
to <hi>Chriſt</hi> by the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> and none other: And
he belongs to the <hi>Church Generall</hi> viſible,
who makes profeſſion of the <hi>faith</hi> of the
Goſpell, and deſtroyes it not by any thing
of a <hi>juſt inconſiſtency</hi> with the beliefe of it:
And he belongs to a <hi>Particular Church,</hi> who
having been in a due order joyned <hi>thereunto,</hi>
hath neither <hi>voluntarily</hi> deſerted it, nor
been <hi>judicially</hi> ejected out of it. Thus one
may be a member of the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi>
who is no member of the <hi>generall viſible
Church,</hi> nor of a particular Church, as an
<hi>elect</hi> infant, ſanctifyed from the <hi>womb,</hi> dying
before baptiſme; and one may be a <hi>member
of the Church generall viſible,</hi> who is no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> nor of a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Church,</hi> as a man making profeſſion of
the <hi>true faith,</hi> yet not united to <hi>Chriſt by the
Spirit,</hi> nor joyned to any <hi>particular viſible
Church;</hi> or he may be alſo of the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> and not of a <hi>particular;</hi> as alſo of
a <hi>particular Church;</hi> and not of the <hi>Catholick.</hi>
And a man may, every true believer
walking <hi>orderly, ordinarily</hi> is a member of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115353:141"/>
the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> in every ſence inſiſted
on: of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> by a Union
with <hi>Chriſt the head;</hi> of the <hi>viſible Generall
Church,</hi> by his <hi>profeſſion of the Faith,</hi> and of
a <hi>particular Congregation,</hi> by his voluntary
<hi>aſſotiating</hi> himſelfe therewith, according to
