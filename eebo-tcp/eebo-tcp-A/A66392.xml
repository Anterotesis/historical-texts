            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>PSALM XXViii. 7.</bibl> The LORD is my Strength and my
Shield; my Heart Trusted in Him, and I
am helped: therefore my Heart greatly
Rejoiceth, and with my Song will I Praise
Him.</q>
            </head>
            <p>THO' it be difficult to say what the particular
<hi>Occasion</hi> was which moved the <hi>Royal Psalmist</hi>
to Compose this <hi>Psalm;</hi> yet there is more than
enough, in the very <hi>Subject</hi> of it, to shew, how suitable
it is to that Great <hi>Deliverance</hi> which we are now
Assembled to Offer up our <hi>Thanksgivings unto God for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>First,</hi> We consider the <hi>Author</hi> of it; the <hi>Inscription</hi>
will tell us that it is a <hi>Psalm of David.</hi> And if we look
to the <hi>Character</hi> which he attributes to Himself in the
<hi>Words</hi> following the <hi>Text;</hi> We shall find, that when
He Composed it, he was <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel:</hi> And designed
it as an <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> to <hi>God</hi> for some <hi>signal Favour</hi>
which he had received from Him, <hi>after</hi> his <hi>Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to that <hi>High Dignity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Secondly,</hi> We enquire into the <hi>Subject</hi> of it; It is
evident from the whole <hi>Series</hi> of the <hi>Psalm,</hi> that it was
intended for a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to God, for some <hi>Eminent
Deliverance</hi> which He had Vouchsafed to him. For
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40131:3"/>
this he <hi>Praises God</hi> in the <hi>Verse</hi> before the <hi>Text:
Blessed be the</hi> LORD, <hi>because he hath heard the Voice
of my supplications.</hi> And in the <hi>Words</hi> of it, declares
the <hi>Joyful Sense</hi> he had of his Own <hi>Preservation: The</hi>
LORD <hi>is my Strength and my Shield; my Heart
trusted in Him and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly
rejoiceth, and with my Song will I praise Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not yet all: For, <hi>Thirdly;</hi> If we look to
the <hi>Circumstances</hi> of that <hi>Deliverance,</hi> we shall find it
to be still more <hi>Agreeable,</hi> to the <hi>Occasion</hi> of our <hi>Own
Thanksgiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For (1st.) The <hi>danger</hi> to which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> was
exposed, was not only a <hi>Design</hi> against his <hi>Person,</hi> but
such as extended to his very <hi>Life.</hi> He had <hi>Cruel</hi>
and <hi>Merciless Men</hi> to deal with; and had not <hi>God</hi>
seasonably interposed his hand, he had fallen a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
to their <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the first <hi>Verse</hi> of this <hi>Psalm</hi> tells us; <hi>Unto Thee
will I cry</hi> O LORD <hi>my Rock, be not Silent to Me;
lest if Thou be silent, I become like Them that</hi> Go down
into the <hi>Pit.</hi> And in the <hi>Psalm</hi> immediately forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and composed, not only about the <hi>same time;</hi>
but, as is reasonably conjectured, upon the <hi>same Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi>
too, with this before Us; He represents his
Adversaries as so many <hi>Savage Beasts,</hi> that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to <hi>Tear</hi> him in <hi>Peices,</hi> and to <hi>Glut</hi> themselves
with his <hi>Blood:</hi> Verse 2. <hi>When mine Enemies, and my
Foes, came upon Me to Eat up my Flesh, they Stumbled,
and Fell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:40131:3"/>
(<hi>2dly.</hi>) The Persons who had <hi>Conspired</hi> against
Him, were not only a sort of <hi>Merciless,</hi> and <hi>Bloody</hi>
Men; but they were as <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>treacherous,</hi> as they
were <hi>Barbarous</hi> and <hi>Cruel.</hi> They <hi>spoke</hi> him <hi>fair,</hi> at
the same time that they had resolved to <hi>Stab</hi> him to
the <hi>Heart.</hi> They had long endeavour'd by <hi>Calumny</hi>
and <hi>Mis-representation,</hi> to <hi>Alienate</hi> the <hi>Affections</hi> of his
<hi>People</hi> from him: And when they saw that this would
not Do; then they resolved, at Once, to <hi>make</hi> an <hi>End</hi>
of Him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And for this we have, again, the</hi> Psalmist<hi>'s own</hi>
Words, <hi>in</hi> both <hi>these</hi> Psalms; <hi>who therefore upon this
very account</hi> Prays <hi>to</hi> God <hi>against them:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm xxviii. 3.</note> Draw me
not away with the Wicked, and with the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
who speak Peace to their Neighbours, but Mischief
is in their Hearts.<note place="margin">Psalm xxvii. 12.</note> Deliver me not over unto the Will of
mine Enemies; for False Witnesses are risen up against Me,
and such as Breath out Cruelty.</p>
            <p>But (<hi>3dly.</hi>) Tho' the <hi>Design</hi> of these <hi>Barbarous
Men,</hi> was chiefly against the <hi>Person</hi> of King <hi>David;</hi>
yet it did not stop there. No; They resolved to <hi>extend</hi>
their <hi>Malice</hi> to All that Adhered to Him: And not to
leave, till they had compleated their <hi>Vengeance,</hi> in the
utter Ruine both of the <hi>One,</hi> and of the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was this gave Occasion to that <hi>Conjunction</hi> we
meet with both of <hi>His</hi> and <hi>Their Deliverance,</hi> ver. 8.
<hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>is</hi> Their <hi>Strength; and he is the saving
Strength of his Anointed.</hi> And drew from him that
<hi>Prayer</hi> with which he concludes this <hi>Psalm;</hi> ver. 9.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40131:4"/>
               <hi>Save thy People, and Bless thine Inheritance; Feed them
also, and Lift them up for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as such was their <hi>Design</hi> against <hi>David,</hi> and
his <hi>Followers;</hi> so if we enquire (<hi>4thly.</hi>) What may
have been the Cause of so <hi>inveterate</hi> a <hi>Malice</hi> against
<hi>Both,</hi> we shall be Able to give no other Account of
it than this; That <hi>God</hi> had wonderfully Raised up
the <hi>One,</hi> to the <hi>Throne</hi> of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the <hi>Other</hi> thought
themselves Obliged in <hi>Conscience</hi> to <hi>Submit</hi> to him, and
to <hi>Support</hi> his <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what the <hi>Psalmist</hi> again declares to us, in
the <hi>4th.</hi> and <hi>5th.</hi> Verses of this <hi>Psalm:</hi> Where he (for
this very Reason) either <hi>Fore tells,</hi> or <hi>Prays</hi> for, their
<hi>Disappointment: Give Them according to their Deeds, and
according to the Wickedness of their Endeavours; Give
Them after the Work of their Hands; Render to Them
their desert:—Because they regard not the Works of
the LORD, nor the Operation of his Hands:</hi> That is
to say, Those Evident Marks of <hi>God's singular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
which were so plainly to be seen, in his
<hi>raising</hi> Him up to be <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Words</hi> before Us, there are these four things
to be Consider'd:</p>
            <p>I. The <hi>Deliverance</hi> it self for which <hi>David,</hi> in this
place, <hi>Blesses God; I am Helped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Author</hi> of his <hi>Deliverance;</hi> It was the
LORD.</p>
            <p>III. The <hi>Motive</hi> which induced <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Deliver
Him: The</hi> LORD <hi>was his Strengh, and his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40131:4"/>
Sheild; His Heart Trusted in Him,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>He was Helped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV. And Lastly. The</hi> Return <hi>which the</hi> Royal
Psalmist <hi>made to</hi> God <hi>for his</hi> Deliverance: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<hi>says he,</hi> my Heart greatly Rejoiceth, and with
my Song will I praise Him.</p>
            <p>These are the several <hi>Parts</hi> which my <hi>Subject</hi> leads
me to Consider: And I shall do it, all along, first
(but very briefly) as they relate to King <hi>David,</hi> and
his <hi>People;</hi> and then, more fully, as they may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to our Own <hi>Royal Sovereign,</hi> and to that Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<hi>Deliverance, God</hi> has been pleased to afford us,
out of the <hi>Hands of our Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, First: Let us Consider the <hi>Deliverance</hi> it self,
which is to be the <hi>Subject</hi> of our <hi>present Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving;
I am Helped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the <hi>particular Blessing</hi> was to which <hi>David</hi>
here refers, we cannot tell: But as the whole <hi>Tenor</hi>
of this <hi>Psalm</hi> assures us, that it was some very <hi>signal
Danger</hi> from which <hi>God</hi> had Rescu'd <hi>Him;</hi> So, I have
before Observ'd, that the Occasion of it was Owing
to that <hi>Implacable Malice</hi> which some few <hi>Wicked Men</hi>
had Conceived against him, for his being Made <hi>King</hi>
of <hi>Israel;</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>visible Marks of God's
Hand,</hi> which appear'd in the whole <hi>Progress</hi> of that
Affair.</p>
            <p>It is, indeed, an Astonishing thing to Consider, that
after <hi>so many,</hi> and such <hi>plain Assurances</hi> as <hi>God</hi> had
given of his <hi>Pleasure,</hi> in this particular; yet still such
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40131:5"/>
numbers should continue not only, not to <hi>Regard his
Work,</hi> but even to bid <hi>Defiance</hi> to his <hi>Providence;</hi> And
to set themselves up against <hi>One,</hi> whom they could
not but see, <hi>He was</hi> resolved <hi>to Exalt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Samuel</hi> was a <hi>true Prophet,</hi> and appointed
by <hi>God</hi> to deliver his Will to that <hi>People;</hi> none among
them ever doubted.<note place="margin">1 Sam. <hi>viii,</hi> &amp;c.</note> He was the <hi>Person</hi> whom God
employed to introduce the <hi>Kingly Government</hi> among
them:<note place="margin">1 Sam. <hi>x.</hi> 12.</note> And it was upon his Credit, that <hi>Saul</hi> himself
was received by them for their <hi>King.</hi> And yet it
was this same <hi>Samuel</hi> that publish'd <hi>God</hi>'s Decree for
taking the <hi>Crown</hi> from <hi>Saul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. <hi>xv.</hi> 10. &amp;c.</note> and that so <hi>Openly,</hi> and
in such a <hi>Solemn manner,</hi> that it was not possible for
any among them to have been ignorant of it.</p>
            <p>Nay, but this was not All: <hi>Samuel</hi> not only made
known to them the <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>God</hi> concerning <hi>Saul;</hi> but
shew'd them the very <hi>Person</hi> whom God had <hi>chosen</hi>
for them in his stead.<note place="margin">1 Sam. <hi>xvi.</hi> 13.</note> He <hi>Anointed</hi> him, for this very
End, in <hi>Bethlehem;</hi> and commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>look</hi>
upon him, and <hi>receive</hi> him as their <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was so Notorious,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xx 31. xxiv. 20. <hi>lb.</hi> xxiii. 17.</note> that even <hi>Saul</hi> himself knew
of it: And <hi>Jonathan, Saul</hi>'s Son, and <hi>Heir Apparent</hi>
to the <hi>Crown,</hi> not only knew the same thing, but
<hi>Consented</hi> to it; and used his utmost <hi>endeavour</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>And now, when all this was so plain, as I have here
represented it to you, and as you all know that it was;
Who could have imagined, that there should ever have
Risen any doubt, whether the <hi>Jews</hi> were to stick to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40131:5"/>
the House of <hi>Saul;</hi> Or to lay that aside, and without
any more ado, submit to <hi>David,</hi> as their King? Yet
so we see it proved: For <hi>Abner, Saul</hi>'s General,<note place="margin">2 Sam. <hi>ii.</hi> 8, &amp;c.</note> no
sooner saw that his Master was <hi>slain,</hi> but he took
<hi>Ish-bosheth</hi> his <hi>Son,</hi> and made him <hi>King</hi> in his stead;
and eleven of the twelve <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel, Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi>
his <hi>Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be too long a Story to recount to you,
what unhappy <hi>Divisions</hi> this threw that <hi>People</hi> into;
and through what a Multitude of <hi>Dangers, God,</hi> at last,
brought his <hi>Anointed</hi> to the full Possession of that <hi>Power</hi>
which he had allotted to Him. I shall only Observe,
that so <hi>Generous,</hi> as well as <hi>Innocent,</hi> was the Conduct
of the <hi>Holy David,</hi> in the whole Course of this Affair;
as shew'd him to have <hi>deserved</hi> the <hi>Crown,</hi> tho' <hi>God</hi> had
not bestow'd it, in so singular a Manner, upon Him.
Tho' <hi>Saul</hi> several times endeavour'd,<note place="margin">1 Sam. <hi>xviii.</hi> 10, 25. <hi>xix.</hi> 11, &amp;c.</note> by the foulest
means, to destroy him; and God, (as if it had been
on purpose that he might make him a Retaliation)
twice put <hi>Saul</hi> himself into his hands;<note place="margin">1 Sam. <hi>xxiv. xxvi.</hi>
               </note> yet this brave
<hi>Prince</hi> not only scorn'd to take the Advantage of him,
but would not Consent that Any of his <hi>Party</hi> should
touch him. And when, (tired out with the <hi>Confusions</hi>
they had lain under, and convinced of the <hi>Will of God,</hi>
to set <hi>David</hi> upon the <hi>Throne</hi>)<note place="margin">2 Sam. <hi>iv.</hi> 6.</note> Two of the Chief <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers</hi>
of his <hi>Army</hi> treacherously <hi>slew Ish-bosheth</hi> their
<hi>Master,</hi> and brought his <hi>Head</hi> to <hi>King David;</hi> that
Excellent Man, did not only not shew any <hi>favour</hi> to
<hi>them;</hi> but as he had before done to the <hi>Amalekite,</hi> who
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40131:6"/>
slew <hi>Saul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Sam. <hi>i.</hi> 15.</note> (tho' at his Own desire, and meerly to keep
his <hi>Enemies</hi> from doing of it,) He punish'd them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their desert: He cut off their <hi>hands</hi> and their
<hi>feet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. <hi>iv.</hi> 12.</note> and <hi>hang'd</hi> them up in <hi>Hebron;</hi> and gave an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Burial to the <hi>Head</hi> of that unfortunate <hi>Prince,</hi>
whom they had so <hi>basely</hi> and <hi>barbarously murder'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' God had therefore <hi>in so Eminent a manner
set David</hi> upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> himself had
appear'd, in all respects, so <hi>Worthy</hi> of that <hi>Dignity:</hi> tho'
never any <hi>Prince</hi> more generously <hi>exposed</hi> himself for
the <hi>Publick Safety,</hi> or came off with Greater <hi>Honour,</hi>
or put things into a better posture, than He did that
<hi>Country;</hi> yet was not all this sufficient to <hi>quiet</hi> the
<hi>Minds,</hi> and to <hi>reconcile</hi> the <hi>Affections</hi> of some <hi>Perverse
Tempers</hi> to Him: But they were still ready, upon every
Occasion, to <hi>Assault</hi> his <hi>Person;</hi> and to do, what in them
lay, to <hi>subvert</hi> his <hi>Authority.</hi> And which may be a
sufficient <hi>demonstration</hi> to us, that some Mens <hi>Resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
are not only without <hi>Bounds,</hi> but beyond <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi>
too: And that we ought not to wonder if no
<hi>Rational Considerations</hi> can take place with those, whose
<hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Prejudices</hi> are so <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>infatuating</hi>
that we see a <hi>Prophet</hi> could not; And it may al, most
be question'd, whether an <hi>Angel</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi>
would have been able to <hi>Perswade</hi> them.</p>
            <p>Such was the Case of the <hi>Jews</hi> heretofore; and I
would to God, I had no cause to say, that the same
is our Case at this very Day. But what then means
our <hi>Solemn Assembling</hi> at this time? Why are we here
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40131:6"/>
met together to <hi>Bless</hi> God for the <hi>Preservation</hi> of our
<hi>Royal Sovereign,</hi> if neither his <hi>Person</hi> was in <hi>danger,</hi> nor
his <hi>Authority invaded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To recount the several Steps by which it pleased God
to bring our <hi>David</hi> to his <hi>Throne;</hi> and shew you what just
Reason an <hi>injured</hi> People had to look to themselves,
and not suffer their <hi>Liberties</hi> to be <hi>subverted,</hi> and their
<hi>Religion destroy'd,</hi> without taking any due Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
either; would divert me too far from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
before me, and to which I desire now particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to Apply my self. I shall therefore only say thus
much as to this Matter; that if <hi>ever</hi> it may be <hi>lawful</hi>
for any <hi>People</hi> to provide for their <hi>Own Safety:</hi> If the
<hi>Constitution</hi> of a <hi>Limited Monarchy,</hi> be not a <hi>Meer No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
that has neither <hi>Meaning,</hi> nor <hi>Priviledge</hi> in it: If a
<hi>Nation</hi> Govern'd by <hi>Laws</hi> of its <hi>Own Approving;</hi> and
that never engaged to <hi>Obey</hi> any <hi>Sovereign,</hi> but what
mutually <hi>Obliged Himself</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> according to Those
<hi>Laws;</hi> has as <hi>just</hi> a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>Legal Government</hi> of
the <hi>Prince,</hi> as the <hi>Prince</hi> has to the <hi>Legal Obedience</hi> of
such a <hi>People:</hi> In short, If it be Absurd to say, that a
whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> may have a <hi>right</hi> to its <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,</hi>
and yet have <hi>no right</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> them, tho' they
should never so <hi>Apparently,</hi> or in such <hi>considerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,</hi>
be <hi>Broken</hi> in upon; tho' such things should be
enterprized, as all Men must see were <hi>design'd,</hi> and if not
prevented, must <hi>End</hi> in a total <hi>Dissolution</hi> of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution:</hi>
Then had <hi>This Kingdom</hi> also Reason to stand
up in Defence of its <hi>Laws,</hi> and its <hi>Religion,</hi> establish'd
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40131:7"/>
by Those <hi>Laws:</hi> And to lay hold on the Happy Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of the <hi>Desertion</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> who was resolved
rather not to <hi>Rule</hi> at all, than not to <hi>Rule</hi> in his <hi>Own way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether this were our Case, as <hi>to Matter of Fact,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our <hi>Constitution</hi> was really in danger of being <hi>subver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
and our <hi>Religion, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> were <hi>invaded;</hi>
this must be left to every Ones own <hi>Conscience</hi> to judge
of. But if they were, and if our <hi>Monarchy</hi> be in the very
<hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of it a <hi>limited Monarchy;</hi> and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd
not upon the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> of a few <hi>Visionary Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians,</hi>
but upon the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of its Own
<hi>Making,</hi> or <hi>Allowing:</hi> Then I must Solemnly profess that
either I am uncapable of judging what <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
is; or it must follow, that an <hi>absolute Monarch,</hi> a
<hi>Prince</hi> not <hi>bounded</hi> by <hi>Law,</hi> but <hi>Governing</hi> only by the
<hi>Arbitrary Motions</hi> of his <hi>Own Will,</hi> is no <hi>King</hi> of Our <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging:</hi>
Our <hi>Constitution</hi> knows no <hi>such Monarch,</hi>
nor did we ever Oblige our selves to <hi>Obey</hi> such a <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now having thus truly shewn you how our
<hi>Case</hi> stood when it pleased <hi>God</hi> to send our <hi>Royal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer</hi>
to Us, I shall need say very little to convince you,
that he did not come without a <hi>Particular Providence</hi>
attending him in the whole Course of our <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
And tho' <hi>Success</hi> when it stands without any <hi>other Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi>
much more if it be <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi>
is but a very bad <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Divine Approbation;</hi>
because <hi>God</hi> may <hi>Permit</hi> what He does not <hi>Allow</hi> of:
Yet where a whole <hi>Kingdom</hi> is manifestly <hi>injured,
Oaths</hi> are <hi>broken, Laws despised:</hi> Where the <hi>Religion</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:40131:7"/>
of a <hi>Nation</hi> is endeavoured to be <hi>subverted;</hi> and a <hi>free
People</hi> to be <hi>subjected</hi> to the <hi>intolerable Yoak</hi> of an <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Power,</hi> and an <hi>Idolatrous Worship;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>appears</hi> on their <hi>behalf,</hi> in such extraordinary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of his <hi>Providence,</hi> as scarce any Age can paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel:
It must be <hi>Obstinacy</hi> and <hi>Perverseness</hi> not to <hi>see</hi> that
his <hi>Arm</hi> has brought <hi>Salvation</hi> unto them; or seeing it,
not to be <hi>persuaded,</hi> with all <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> to <hi>Accept</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>For not to say any thing of those many <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi>
we have heretofore assembled to <hi>bless God</hi> for:
How great was the <hi>Mercy</hi> that <hi>Saved</hi> us from our
<hi>present danger?</hi> How evident was the <hi>hand</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> in
every <hi>Circumstance</hi> of it?</p>
            <p>That Men, neither the most <hi>Religious,</hi> nor <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate</hi>
of Any in the World; <hi>Enemies</hi> to our <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and (if it were possible) somewhat worse than
<hi>Enemies</hi> to our present <hi>Government;</hi> should yet be so
strook with the <hi>Regret</hi> of an <hi>Enterprize,</hi> which alone
could give them any just <hi>Hopes</hi> of succeeding in their
<hi>designs</hi> against us, as to become Themselves the
<hi>Discoverers</hi> of their Own <hi>Wicked Undertakings;</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
very <hi>Strange:</hi> And what can hardly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
for, without <hi>Acknowledging</hi> some <hi>Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Impulse</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>That having <hi>discovered</hi> it; those who <hi>suffer'd</hi> for it;
and whose <hi>Concern</hi> for their <hi>Own Reputation,</hi> if not for
the <hi>Common Cause,</hi> one would think, should have
prompted them to leave the <hi>Credit</hi> of such an <hi>Attempt</hi>
as much in doubt, as was possible; should yet joyn
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40131:8"/>
their own <hi>Testimony,</hi> to the <hi>Witness</hi> that had before
been given of the <hi>Truth</hi> of it; this is yet more <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful:</hi>
And what neither the <hi>Principles,</hi> nor <hi>Politicks</hi> of
the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> usually Allow their <hi>Proselytes</hi> to do.</p>
            <p>That to Strengthen both the <hi>Witness</hi> of <hi>Some,</hi> and
the <hi>Confessions</hi> of <hi>Others,</hi> as to this matter; So many
foreign <hi>Proofs</hi> should be sent us from <hi>all Parts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and shew that to have been publish'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
almost to <hi>all Europe,</hi> which ought, if possible,
to have been concealed even from those who were to
be <hi>Actors</hi> in it; this must be the Effect of a more
than Ordinary <hi>Infatuation:</hi> And cannot be Reconciled
to the <hi>Usual Caution,</hi> and <hi>Closeness</hi> of Those, who
were the Great <hi>Contrivers,</hi> and <hi>Abettors</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>In Short; That when such a <hi>Time</hi> was taken to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade</hi>
us from Abroad, as (had our <hi>Own Measures</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded)
we must have been left utterly destitute of any
possibility either of <hi>preventing,</hi> or <hi>Opposing</hi> it at Home;
He who Governs the <hi>Wind</hi> and the <hi>Sea,</hi> should so Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Matters, that it was not possible for us to send a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
those <hi>Ships,</hi> on which our <hi>Safety</hi> was to <hi>depend:</hi>
This is, above all the Rest, an evident instance of <hi>God's
favour</hi> to us; and ought to be as <hi>Wonderful</hi> in our <hi>Eyes,</hi>
as it has been <hi>Astonishing</hi> in those of our <hi>Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So plainly was <hi>God</hi> pleased to shew Himself on our
side, in Every Circumstance of this <hi>deliverance.</hi> And
that we may the better know what Returns we ought
to make for it, give me leave to offer you, a very
few <hi>Observations,</hi> with Reference thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40131:8"/>
And, 1st. If we consider it only in that part of
the Design which was the first to have been put in
<hi>Execution;</hi> God has prevented the <hi>Murder</hi> of <hi>Our King:</hi>
Of that <hi>King</hi> whom <hi>He</hi> had chosen to be the <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of Our <hi>Preservation;</hi> and in whose Safety our
very <hi>Enemies</hi> themselves account our <hi>Welfare</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.
And God forbid! We should have a less Esteem
of our <hi>Royal Sovereign,</hi> than those who the most
Hate him, shew us that they Have.</p>
            <p>2dly: This <hi>Murder</hi> was to have been follow'd
with a <hi>Foreign Invasion:</hi> An <hi>Invasion</hi> from that <hi>Prince</hi>
who has already fill'd most of the Other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
with <hi>Ruin</hi> and <hi>Desolation.</hi> And, particularly, has
shewn Himself so Irreconcilable an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the
<hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> as to be resolved (if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
to root out the very memory of it from off the
Earth.</p>
            <p>And here then let us consider, what a <hi>Confusion</hi> and
<hi>Desolation</hi> this must have put our <hi>unfortunate Country</hi>
into? When we should have seen, Our <hi>Houses</hi> in
<hi>Flames</hi> about our <hi>Ears;</hi> Our <hi>Land destroy'd;</hi> Our
<hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations slaughter'd</hi> before <hi>our Eyes:</hi> The
<hi>Best</hi> and <hi>Greatest</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> those from whose
<hi>Courage</hi> or <hi>Conduct,</hi> from whose <hi>Counsel</hi> or <hi>Interest,</hi>
we might have Especially hoped for Help, secretly
<hi>cut off,</hi> in the very beginning of Our <hi>disorders.</hi> In
short, when our <hi>Land</hi> being become a <hi>Seat</hi> of <hi>War;</hi>
we should have <hi>beheld,</hi> and <hi>suffer'd</hi> All those <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and <hi>Calamities,</hi> which we tremble to hear of,
tho' at the Greatest distance from Us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:40131:9"/>
Oh! How happy would Those have been, who
should have had the <hi>Priviledge</hi> of being <hi>first destroyed?</hi>
Rather than to have outlived the <hi>fortunes</hi> of their
<hi>Country,</hi> their <hi>Own Peace,</hi> and their <hi>Churches Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
But, Blessed be God! Who has graciously <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd</hi>
us out of their <hi>Hands!</hi> And thereby given us a
new earnest of his <hi>favour</hi> to us: And manifested to
the World, that in Vain are all the <hi>Counsels</hi> of <hi>men</hi> to
<hi>destroy</hi> Those, whom He has resolved to <hi>Help</hi> and
<hi>Support.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have I shewn you, not only What Our
<hi>Deliverance</hi> is; but withal, which was my</p>
            <p>IId. Point; To <hi>Whom</hi> we are to <hi>Ascribe</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>For tho' God be, indeed, the <hi>Sovereign dispenser</hi> of
all Our <hi>Fortunes;</hi> and, as such, must be recurr'd to as
the <hi>final Author</hi> of whatsoever <hi>Good</hi> we enjoy: Yet
in some <hi>Cases</hi> He is Pleased in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to <hi>discover</hi> his <hi>hand</hi> in the <hi>Blessings</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from Him; and therefore ought in a <hi>singular
manner</hi> to be look'd unto, as the <hi>Donor</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>So He did in <hi>Davids deliverance;</hi> and so he did in
Our late <hi>Preservation.</hi> It was neither our <hi>Hand,</hi> nor our
<hi>Counsel</hi> that <hi>saved</hi> us: Neither the <hi>Strength</hi> of our <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi>
nor the <hi>Cunning</hi> of our <hi>Contrivance,</hi> that <hi>disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>
the <hi>designs</hi> of our <hi>Enemies</hi> against Us. But it
was the <hi>Arm</hi> of the LORD that <hi>defended</hi> us: <hi>He
was our Strength and our Shield;</hi> and therefore <hi>we were
Helped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:40131:9"/>
Which being so let us go on,</p>
            <p>IIIdly, To consider, What it was that induced
<hi>God</hi> to <hi>deliver David</hi> heretofore; and for which
we may justly presume He was pleased, in so
wonderful a manner, to <hi>Preserve</hi> Us now:
<hi>My heart Trusted in Him,</hi> says he, <hi>and I am
Helped.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more frequently taken notice of
by the <hi>Royal Psalmist,</hi> throughout this whole <hi>Book,</hi>
than this One thing; that He was therefore <hi>so Often,</hi>
and in <hi>so signal a manner, protected</hi> by <hi>God,</hi> because
he <hi>put his trust in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is upon this ground that He sometimes</hi> prays
<hi>to</hi> God <hi>for Help: Psal. vii. 1.</hi> O Lord my God! in
Thee do I put my trust; Save me from all Them that
Persecute Me, and Deliver Me. <hi>And again, Psal. xv. 2.</hi>
O my God! I trust in Thee, let me not be ashamed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
let mine Enemies triumph over Me.</p>
            <p>And when <hi>God</hi> heard his <hi>Prayer,</hi> and <hi>preserved</hi>
him from his <hi>Enemies;</hi> it is to this that He ascribes
his doing of it: <hi>I have trusted in the LORD, therefore
I shall not slide,</hi> Psal. xxvi. 1. And again, Psal. xxi. 7.
<hi>The King trusteth in the LORD; and thro' the mercy of
the most High, He shall not be moved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this that He recommends to all Others, as
the best means they could use to secure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the <hi>favour</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Protection</hi> of his
<hi>Good Providence. Trust in the</hi> LORD, says he, <hi>and
do Good; So shalt Thou dwell in the Land.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. xxxvij. v. 3.</note> 
               <hi>They that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40131:10"/>
trust in the LORD shall be even as Mount Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. cxxv. 1.</note> 
               <hi>which
may not be removed, but standeth fast for Ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, lastly, not to mention any more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars;
It is this that makes him speak so often of <hi>God,</hi>
as the particular <hi>Defender</hi> of such <hi>Persons: The LORD,</hi>
says he, <hi>Redeemeth the Souls of His servants; and none
of them that trust in Him shall be destitute.</hi> Psal. xxxiv.
22. And again, Psal. xviii. 30. <hi>He is a Buckler to all
Those that Trust in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this being the benefit of such a <hi>trust,</hi> even
with respect to our <hi>present Welfare;</hi> it cannot but
be a Matter of great consequence to us to know,
wherein the <hi>Nature</hi> of this <hi>Trust</hi> do's consist; and
how we may intitule Our selves to the <hi>Benefits</hi> of
it?</p>
            <p>And here, <hi>1st.</hi> I must observe, that we ought
not so far to mistake either our <hi>duty,</hi> or our <hi>Interest,</hi>
as to imagine that because we are commanded to
<hi>Trust in God,</hi> therefore we must take no farther <hi>Care
of,</hi> nor make any suitable <hi>Provision</hi> for the <hi>success</hi> of
our <hi>Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This would be not so much to <hi>Trust</hi> in God, as to
<hi>Presume</hi> upon <hi>Him:</hi> To expect that He should <hi>work
Miracles</hi> for Our Sakes; And <hi>do All</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> those,
who will <hi>do Nothing</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> themselves. On the
contrary we see how even <hi>David</hi> Himself, amidst
all his <hi>trust</hi> in <hi>God's Help,</hi> yet still took care to make
the best <hi>Provision</hi> He could for his <hi>Own Safety.</hi> And
when the <hi>Israelites</hi> before, were sent by his Own
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40131:10"/>
               <hi>peculiar Commission,</hi> to <hi>kill</hi> and <hi>take possession;</hi> and were
<hi>assured of Victory,</hi> before they went into the <hi>Field:</hi>
Yet still they were required to <hi>act</hi> with as much
<hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Cunning;</hi> to <hi>contrive</hi> as <hi>wisely,</hi> and to <hi>fight</hi>
as <hi>resolutely,</hi> as if the whole <hi>Success</hi> of their <hi>Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes</hi>
were to have depended upon their Own <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi>
and <hi>Conduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so must We do Now: <hi>God</hi> has, 'tis true, in
a wonderful manner, <hi>deliver'd</hi> our <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd</hi>
the <hi>designs</hi> of our <hi>Enemies</hi> against Us. He has
shewn us what <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> we have to <hi>do with;</hi> and
from whence our <hi>danger</hi> is likely to <hi>Arise.</hi> And it
must be, in great measure, our Own fault, if we
do not <hi>prevent</hi> it. But yet, if because God has done
thus much for Us, we shall from henceforth grow
<hi>Careless</hi> and <hi>Secure:</hi> If while our <hi>Enemies</hi> threaten
us from abroad, and we are beset with a <hi>discontented,
designing party</hi> at Home; we shall neither be careful
to <hi>discover</hi> what their <hi>Strength</hi> is, nor to consider
How to <hi>fortifie</hi> our selves against <hi>Them:</hi> We must
blame no body, but our selves, if we shall at last
<hi>fall</hi> into <hi>their Snares,</hi> and <hi>sink</hi> under those <hi>Attempts,</hi>
we have now so narrowly escaped.</p>
            <p>But <hi>2dly.</hi> Tho' we <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to Use our best
<hi>endeavours</hi> to provide for our <hi>Own Security;</hi> yet we
must not place our <hi>dependance</hi> upon them: but when
we have done all that we can, must still <hi>look</hi> up to
<hi>God,</hi> for <hi>Deliverance</hi> and <hi>Success.</hi> And this is truly
to <hi>Trust in him;</hi> and will furnish us with a clear
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40131:11"/>
Notion of the <hi>Nature</hi> of that great <hi>duty</hi> which is
required of Us on all these Occasions.</p>
            <p>To provide for our <hi>Own safety,</hi> and to take those
Measures that seem the most likely to promote the
<hi>publick Welfare;</hi> this is not only very <hi>Lawful,</hi> but is
<hi>Reasonable</hi> and <hi>Necessary.</hi> Nor shall we ever be <hi>secure,</hi>
without doing of it. But yet, when all is done,
'tis neither our <hi>Arms,</hi> nor our <hi>Counsels;</hi> neither our
<hi>Strength,</hi> nor our <hi>Policy,</hi> that we must <hi>depend</hi> upon:
But we must still Recur to <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Help;</hi> And put
our whole <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Confidence</hi> in <hi>his Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>David</hi> did; and it was this that Crown'd his
<hi>Enterprises</hi> with <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Victory. I will not trust in
my Bow,</hi> says he; <hi>neither shall my Sword Save Me.
Thro' thee will we push down our Enemies; thro' thy name
will we tread them under, that rise up against us.</hi> Psal.
xliv. 5, 6. And in Another <hi>Psalm,</hi> He makes this
<hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Pious Remark,</hi> upon the different <hi>Conduct</hi> of
his <hi>Enemies,</hi> as to this matter; and How it <hi>succeeded</hi>
with Them accordingly: Psal. xx. 7, 8. <hi>Some trust
in Chariots, and some in Horses; but we will Remember
the Name of the LORD our God. They are brought down
and fallen; but we are Risen and stand upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For men to look only to the <hi>number</hi> of their <hi>forces;</hi>
the <hi>Exactness</hi> of their <hi>discipline;</hi> and the <hi>Cunning of</hi>
their <hi>Management;</hi> and then boast of their <hi>Enterprises</hi>
as <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>Infallible;</hi> and exalt Themselves in
their own <hi>Imaginations,</hi> as if no <hi>Disappointment</hi> could
happen to them: This is not only to shew too great
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40131:11"/>
a <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>God's Providence,</hi> but too little a <hi>refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
upon the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> and those nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<hi>Accidents</hi> to which the <hi>Greatest</hi> and <hi>Wisest Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings</hi>
are <hi>exposed.</hi> And I am pretty Confident,
our <hi>Enemies</hi> themselves begin, by this time, to be
sensible of their <hi>Own Folly</hi> in this Particular: And
to Perceive how vain a thing it is to lay <hi>great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,</hi>
and <hi>build</hi> up <hi>mighty expectations</hi> upon them;
and not consider all the while, that there is a <hi>God</hi>
who <hi>Ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men,</hi> and whose <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,</hi>
when we have done All we can,<note place="margin">Dan. iv. 32 Prov. xix. 21.</note> 
               <hi>shall Stand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But above all, <hi>3dly:</hi> As we must not <hi>trust</hi> in our
<hi>Own Strength</hi> or <hi>Policy</hi> for <hi>Success,</hi> and <hi>Security:</hi> So
must we take heed not to engage in any <hi>Wicked
Courses,</hi> either to <hi>promote</hi> our <hi>Interests,</hi> or to <hi>prevent</hi>
our <hi>Danger.</hi> For this will be plainly to <hi>Forsake God;</hi>
and to <hi>trust</hi> in our <hi>Own devices,</hi> even in <hi>Defiance</hi> of
his <hi>Ability</hi> to <hi>Controul,</hi> and <hi>Disappoint</hi> Us.</p>
            <p>There is a certain <hi>justice</hi> to be observed even against
an <hi>Enemy:</hi> and <hi>War</hi> its self has its <hi>Laws,</hi> from which
the more upright <hi>Heathens</hi> thought it, not only <hi>Evil,</hi>
but <hi>Scandalous</hi> to depart. And much more ought we
<hi>Christians</hi> to do likewise. And tho' to a <hi>Weak mind,</hi>
and a <hi>Bruitish policy;</hi> it may appear a very Wise me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of proceeding, to endeavour, by <hi>secret treachery,</hi>
to cut off a dangerous <hi>Enemy;</hi> and do that by a <hi>suddain
Stab,</hi> or a <hi>deadly draught,</hi> which cannot without
much hazard be accomplish'd in a <hi>fair Engagement:</hi>
Yet there is a <hi>God</hi> above, who as He <hi>abhors</hi> himself,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40131:12"/>
and has <hi>taught</hi> us to <hi>detest</hi> such <hi>barbarous undertakings;</hi>
So do's He for the most part bring them to nought:
And leave the <hi>projectors</hi> only to the <hi>Regret</hi> of having
been <hi>disappointed</hi> in their <hi>designs;</hi> and to the <hi>Hatred</hi>
and <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> for having ever <hi>engaged</hi> in
Them.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>God</hi> did Do in the Case of <hi>David,</hi> whom
<hi>Saul</hi> so often <hi>endeavour'd,</hi> and <hi>hoped</hi> to have <hi>destroy'd:</hi>
And thus has he done for <hi>Our Royal Sovereign.</hi> He
has deliver'd Him from the <hi>Secret practices,</hi> as well
as from the <hi>Open Violence</hi> of his <hi>Enemies.</hi> And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
him to be, as he is this day, a <hi>living Monument</hi>
of his <hi>Own Mercy;</hi> And of the <hi>Un-Christian, Un-manly</hi>
designs of those, who are <hi>Great</hi> only in <hi>Treachery</hi> and
<hi>Deceit:</hi> In endeavouring basely to <hi>destroy Those,</hi> whom
they never yet durst meet in the <hi>Field</hi> of <hi>Honour;</hi>
nay, to whom they would Rather tamely yield up,
if they had it, the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> than let the
<hi>Sword</hi> decide it between them, to Whom it should
belong.</p>
            <p>And let them rejoice, if they please, in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
proceedings.</hi> Let them raise <hi>Armies,</hi> and <hi>train</hi>
up <hi>forces,</hi> not to <hi>fight,</hi> but to countenance the <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery</hi>
of their <hi>Proceedings.</hi> Let them <hi>buy Victory;</hi> and
<hi>Corrupt</hi> those, whom they would be thought to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage:</hi>
And fancy, after all, that they are <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable;</hi>
because they are able to <hi>Command Panegyric's,</hi>
and to <hi>Reward</hi> the <hi>mercenary Authors</hi> of them. But
<hi>Posterity</hi> will know the <hi>baseness</hi> of their <hi>proceedings;</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40131:12"/>
and <hi>God,</hi> in a little time, will judge them for Them.
In the mean While it will be our parts to <hi>provide,</hi>
the best we can, against their <hi>Wickedness:</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
so done let us not doubt, but that <hi>God</hi> will <hi>turn</hi>
their <hi>devices</hi> to their <hi>Own Confusion;</hi> and not suffer us
to fall by them, whilst we <hi>continue</hi> to <hi>put our Trust</hi> in
<hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, it remains only that I conclude all with
the IVth and last <hi>Point,</hi> which I proposed to
speak to, Viz. The <hi>Return</hi> which the <hi>Royal
Psalmist</hi> made to <hi>God</hi> for his <hi>deliverance: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
my heart greatly Rejoiceth, and in my Song
will I praise him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which <hi>Words</hi> we have these (2) Things repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to Us:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The <hi>Inward Sense</hi> which <hi>David</hi> had of <hi>God's
Mercy</hi> to him: His <hi>Heart greatly Rejoiced.</hi> And,
<hi>2dly.</hi> His <hi>Outward Expression</hi> of it; <hi>In my Song will
I praise Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Two</hi> together made up the <hi>Return</hi> of that
<hi>Holy Man;</hi> and <hi>Both</hi> of them must concur in Our
<hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> if ever we mean to Render it <hi>Pleasing</hi>
and <hi>Acceptable</hi> to <hi>God Almighty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> We must entertain a <hi>Worthy,</hi> and <hi>Grateful
Sense</hi> of our <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this, one would think, Every One should
do, who is Capable of Understanding <hi>what</hi> it <hi>was;</hi>
and from what a <hi>deluge</hi> of <hi>Miseries,</hi> we have reason
to believe, we are <hi>Freed</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:40131:13"/>
Were the <hi>mischief,</hi> design'd against us, to have
reach'd no farther than to the <hi>death</hi> of the <hi>King;</hi> yet
sure we cannot have so soon forgot, <hi>How much</hi> we
<hi>Owe</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> as not to account our selves, in an
Eminent manner, concern'd for his <hi>Preservation.</hi> He
who in the time of our <hi>Greatest Danger</hi> ventured His
<hi>Own Life</hi> and <hi>Fortunes,</hi> to <hi>secure Ours;</hi> and when
our <hi>Enemies</hi> seem'd to be in their full <hi>Career,</hi> tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling
both our <hi>Laws,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> under their <hi>feet;
Stept forth</hi> into the <hi>Gap,</hi> and bravely <hi>withstood</hi> the
<hi>Torrent,</hi> which would otherwise have born down
all before it: As he must needs deserve our most
<hi>Grateful Acknowledgment</hi> for so <hi>seasonable</hi> an <hi>Interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
So shall He, I hope, be always consider'd by
Us, as the <hi>Repairer</hi> of our <hi>Breaches;</hi> the <hi>Supporter</hi> of
our <hi>State;</hi> the <hi>Defender</hi> of our <hi>Liberties;</hi> and the
<hi>Preserver</hi> of the true <hi>Religion</hi> among us: And in
whose <hi>Safety,</hi> we therefore <hi>ought,</hi> as we <hi>do,</hi> most
heartily to <hi>Rejoice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all: The very <hi>danger</hi> he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to, was meerly for <hi>our sakes;</hi> and upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of that <hi>Protection</hi> which he continues to afford
us, against the <hi>fury</hi> of Our <hi>Enemies.</hi> Nor would
they ever have thought of <hi>Destroying</hi> him, had He
not been so <hi>Zealous</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> Us.</p>
            <p>The truth is, if we will consider the <hi>design</hi> of
our <hi>Enemies</hi> aright; we must look upon our <hi>solemn
Rejoicing</hi> at this time, to be not so much upon the
account of Our <hi>Royal Sovereigns Preservation,</hi> as of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40131:13"/>
Our <hi>Common Deliverance.</hi> Our <hi>Country;</hi> Our <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies;</hi>
Our <hi>Estates;</hi> nay our very <hi>Lives</hi> Themselves:
The <hi>Constitution</hi> of our <hi>Monarchy;</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> by which
we are <hi>Govern'd;</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> in which we <hi>serve
God now,</hi> and thro' which we expect to be <hi>Saved</hi>
hereafter; <hi>All these</hi> were <hi>Struck</hi> at: And, had their
<hi>Attempt</hi> succeeded, must All have fallen together
with the great <hi>Defender</hi> of them. Nor can any One
excuse himself from a <hi>grateful Resentment</hi> of this <hi>Happy
Deliverance,</hi> without declaring himself thereby a
<hi>publick Enemy:</hi> An Enemy, not only to his <hi>Prince</hi>'s
<hi>Safety;</hi> but to the <hi>Peace,</hi> the <hi>Welfare,</hi> nay to the
very <hi>Establishment</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which we <hi>live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were appointed as <hi>Sheep</hi> for the <hi>Slaughter;</hi>
Our <hi>Land</hi> to have been made an <hi>Akeldama,</hi> a <hi>Field
of Blood:</hi> The <hi>Fury</hi> of <hi>War,</hi> always very <hi>dismal,</hi>
and no where more, than where the <hi>French Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
has the Fortune to <hi>prevail;</hi> was to have been
doubled upon Us. Whilst we should have been
exposed not only to the <hi>Rage</hi> of those Abroad, (and
who by the <hi>Treatment</hi> they have given their <hi>own
Countrymen,</hi> have sufficiently shewn, what all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
of a <hi>different Religion,</hi> must <hi>expect</hi> from
<hi>them;</hi>) but to the particular <hi>Resentments</hi> of our
<hi>own Domestick Enemies.</hi> Or to speak all in one
Word; we should have been laid open to all the
<hi>Cruelty</hi> that a <hi>false Zeal,</hi> and a <hi>persecuting Church</hi>
could <hi>inspire</hi> into the Minds of Men; who would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40131:14"/>
have set no <hi>Bounds</hi> to their <hi>Rage;</hi> as they know no
<hi>Measure</hi> of their <hi>Hatred,</hi> and <hi>Malice,</hi> against us.</p>
            <p>Oh! the <hi>Horrour</hi> and <hi>Confusion,</hi> the <hi>Shreiks</hi> and
the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> that would have been <hi>seen,</hi> and
<hi>heard</hi> in all our <hi>Streets!</hi> How often should we in
vain have wish'd to die, rather than live to <hi>behold</hi>
and <hi>suffer</hi> such <hi>Evils,</hi> as would, before this Time,
have come upon us? As the <hi>Horrour</hi> of a <hi>Shipwreck</hi>
at <hi>Sea,</hi> or of an <hi>Earthquake</hi> at <hi>Land;</hi> As a <hi>City</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by <hi>Storm;</hi> As if the <hi>Day</hi> of <hi>Judgment</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon the <hi>Earth;</hi> such would the Case of this
<hi>Miserable Country</hi> have been.</p>
            <p>But, Blessed be God! who has not given us over for
a <hi>Prey</hi> unto <hi>their Teeth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. cxxiv 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Our Soul is escaped, even as

and <hi>we are delivered.</hi> Nay, we are not only
<hi>saved</hi> from our <hi>present Danger,</hi> but are, I hope, in
some Measure awakened to <hi>provide</hi> for our <hi>future
Safety:</hi> And effectually convinced what <hi>Canaanites</hi>
we have among Us; and how much it will concern
us to <hi>Beware</hi> of <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, I would to God; they did not give Us,
every Day, more and more Reason so to do. For
even since the <hi>Discovery</hi> of this <hi>Horrid, Barbarous,
Base Design;</hi> Where is almost the Man, that has
given us any good Assurance of his <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of it?
That he is <hi>asham'd</hi> of the <hi>Undertaking;</hi> that he <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
those</hi> who were <hi>engag'd</hi> in it: Or is indeed
<hi>concern'd</hi> for any thing of it, unless it be for this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40131:14"/>
one thing, that they <hi>succeeded</hi> no <hi>better</hi> in
the <hi>Execution</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But such is the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Prejudice;</hi>
and so <hi>Unaccountable</hi> are the <hi>Working</hi> of some Mens
<hi>Consciences!</hi> For sure, Otherwise, one would
think it should be somewhat more than <hi>Infatuation,</hi>
to imagine, that to call in a <hi>French Power</hi> is a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Method</hi> to secure <hi>English Liberties:</hi> Or that <hi>those</hi>
who have been so Zealous to <hi>roct</hi> out the <hi>Protestant
Interest</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> will yet be so <hi>good natured,</hi> as to
establish it <hi>Abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope there is no one will so far mistake my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
in insisting upon these Matters; as to think
that I desire hereby to raise up any <hi>Storm,</hi> against the
<hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>conscientious</hi> Part of those who differ from
Us, in Point either of <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Government.</hi> On
the contrary, I freely profess, that I <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,</hi>
a <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>upright Christian,</hi> let his <hi>Opinion</hi> be
never so <hi>contrary</hi> to what I take to be the <hi>right:</hi>
And for the whole World I would not, willingly,
be the Occasion of the <hi>least Evil,</hi> to <hi>such</hi> a <hi>one.
Persecution</hi> for <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Opinion,</hi> is what, I thank
God, I have ever <hi>Abhorr'd:</hi> And I hope I shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be so far <hi>transported</hi> in my <hi>Zeal</hi> for any <hi>Cause</hi> or
<hi>Party,</hi> as to give the least Encouragement to it.</p>
            <p>But then I must beg Leave to observe withal,<note place="margin">Jam. iij. 17. Colos. iij. 12. 1 Cor. xiij. 5, 6.</note> that
<hi>true Religion,</hi> is first <hi>pure,</hi> then <hi>peaceable;</hi> it is <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
and <hi>charitable; it thinketh no evil,</hi> nor <hi>wisheth</hi>
any; it <hi>rejoyces</hi> not in <hi>Iniquity;</hi> but desires the <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:40131:15"/>
and <hi>Happiness</hi> of those, who are at the greatest
<hi>Distance</hi> from its <hi>own Perswasion.</hi> And if instead of
maintaining such a <hi>Character,</hi> Men will be <hi>peevish</hi>
and <hi>morose; turbulent</hi> and <hi>unquiet:</hi> If they will not
only shew an implacable <hi>Hatred</hi> towards all such as
differ from them, but will, upon every Occasion,
publickly <hi>censure</hi> and <hi>revile</hi> them too: If they will
<hi>rejoyce</hi> in their <hi>Harm,</hi> and be <hi>concern'd</hi> at their <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare;</hi>
and resolve at any Rate to <hi>procure</hi> their <hi>Ruin,</hi>
though they were sure to <hi>perish</hi> together <hi>with them:</hi>
In short, if such be their <hi>Conscience,</hi> that they can
without Remorse consent to have a <hi>King murder'd;</hi>
their <hi>Country invaded;</hi> their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi>
given up into the Hands of those who are the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd
Enemies</hi> of <hi>both:</hi> I cannot but think, that
then it is high time for us to <hi>look</hi> to <hi>our selves,</hi> and
to <hi>have a Care</hi> of <hi>such Zealots;</hi> and to consider, the
rather, how to <hi>prevent</hi> our <hi>Ruin,</hi> for that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> with some Men, to do
all they can to <hi>destroy</hi> us.</p>
            <p>And now if, from what has been said, it appears,
that our <hi>Hearts</hi> ought <hi>greatly to rejoyce</hi> at this <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;</hi>
then I am sure I shall need Add very little to
perswade you, <hi>2dly.</hi> To let your <hi>Tongues</hi> declare
the <hi>Sense</hi> of them. For the <hi>Expressions</hi> of the <hi>Mouth,</hi>
naturally follow the <hi>Disposition</hi> of the <hi>Mind:</hi> And
when the one is full of a <hi>grateful Resentment</hi> of <hi>God's
Mercies;</hi> the other will break out, into <hi>Songs</hi> of
<hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:40131:15"/>
Now this we have, in some Measure already
done; and shall again go on, with the <hi>Church,</hi> to
do. But we must not let our <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> stop
here; nor think that the <hi>Acknowledment</hi> of <hi>one</hi> such
<hi>solemn Meeting,</hi> is a <hi>sufficient Return</hi> for so <hi>great</hi> a
<hi>Preservation.</hi> Rather, we should teach our very
<hi>Children</hi> to speak of this Mercy; and deliver the
<hi>Memory</hi> of it down to <hi>succeeding Generations.</hi> That
the <hi>Ages</hi> yet to come may know what a <hi>Deliverance</hi>
we have <hi>received;</hi> as well as enjoy the <hi>Benefits</hi> of
it. And by more and more Instances be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
how impossible it is to reconcile a <hi>Popish
Power,</hi> to the <hi>Interest</hi> of a <hi>Protestant Church</hi> and
<hi>Kingdom:</hi> And that they ought rather, to <hi>expose</hi>
themselves to any <hi>Hazards,</hi> and to <hi>undergo</hi> any <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens;</hi>
than be brought again under the <hi>Yoak</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus</hi> then let us rejoyce in the <hi>Blessing</hi> we have
<hi>received,</hi> and <hi>thus</hi> let us <hi>speak</hi> of it in all our <hi>Gates.</hi>
And may that <hi>God</hi> who <hi>regardeth</hi> the <hi>Heart,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the <hi>secret Thoughts</hi> of every one of us; <hi>approve</hi>
our <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and <hi>accept</hi> of our <hi>Thanksgivings!</hi> And
ever more preserve us, from the <hi>Treachery,</hi> and
<hi>Violence</hi> of <hi>All</hi> our <hi>Enemies;</hi> but, especially from
the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of the GREAT OPPRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOR.</p>
            <p>May he incline those to <hi>consider</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> him,
who are yet to be convinced of the <hi>Justice of our
Cause,</hi> and the <hi>Happiness</hi> of our <hi>Deliverance:</hi> Nay,
who perhaps break in upon the <hi>Solemnity</hi> of this
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40131:16"/>
               <hi>Day,</hi> with <hi>Murmurings</hi> and <hi>Repinings</hi> against <hi>God</hi>
for <hi>preserving</hi> us.</p>
            <p>And as for those who are true and <hi>steddy</hi> to the
<hi>publick Interest</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> may
he every Day render them more <hi>useful,</hi> and <hi>service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
to both! May they be <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vigorous;
firm</hi> and <hi>resolute!</hi> Neither <hi>afraid</hi> to <hi>own a good Cause,</hi>
though reviled by those who <hi>wish ill</hi> to it; nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to <hi>venture themselves,</hi> and <hi>all</hi> they <hi>have,</hi> for
the <hi>Support</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>May they to the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of their <hi>Lips,</hi> add the
<hi>Piety</hi> of their <hi>Lives:</hi> And by a <hi>general Reformation</hi>
of <hi>Manners,</hi> and <hi>Union</hi> of <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi>
among Us, remove the only <hi>Obstacles</hi> that seem
any Way likely to prevent our <hi>Common Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And having thus disposed our selves for <hi>his
Blessing;</hi> May that <hi>God</hi> who has sent this great
<hi>Salvation</hi> to us, multiply more and more his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
upon us! May he <hi>direct</hi> our <hi>Counsels; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
our <hi>Resolutions;</hi> and <hi>give Success</hi> to our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings!</hi>
But especially; may he preserve our
<hi>Royal Sovereign</hi> from all the treacherous <hi>Designs</hi>
of his <hi>Enemies</hi> against him; and from the <hi>Hands</hi>
of those who <hi>delight</hi> in <hi>Blood!</hi> May his <hi>Arms</hi> be
<hi>prosperous;</hi> and his <hi>Reign happy!</hi> May he <hi>finish</hi> all
his <hi>Enterprizes</hi> with <hi>Honour,</hi> And <hi>Victory:</hi> And may
we consider more and more, how much our <hi>Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
depends</hi> upon <hi>his Welfare;</hi> and with what <hi>Zeal</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40131:16"/>
we ought to <hi>Unite</hi> together against <hi>all</hi> such, as
by <hi>seeking</hi> his <hi>Destruction,</hi> shall give us the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,</hi>
and most <hi>fatal Demonstration</hi> that can be
given, of their <hi>Desire</hi> to promote our <hi>common
Ruin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall conclude all, with the <hi>Words</hi> of our <hi>Royal
Psalmist,</hi> when God had given him <hi>Rest</hi> from all
his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and had <hi>delivered him</hi> from the <hi>Hand</hi>
of <hi>Saul, Psal.</hi> xviii. 46. <hi>The LORD liveth, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be our Rock; and let the God of our Salvation be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.
He has deliver'd us from our Enemies; he has
lifted us up above those that rose up against Us; he has
deliver'd us from the VIOLENT MAN: Therefore, will
we give thanks unto thee O LORD among the Heathen,
and sing Praise unto thy Name:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Salvation and Glory, and Honour and Praise,
and Thanksgiving; be unto the LORD
our God, for Ever and Ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
