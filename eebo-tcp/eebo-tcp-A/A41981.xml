            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>OH ye choſen of God, and gathered of him out of the world into the Covenant of Life, and endleſs Peace! This is the day wherein God hath brought, and is bringing the Faith of his children to Tryal: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now let us lift up our heads in God, and ſtand in his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, that by him we may be preſerved in faithful Obedience unto the end, that every one may have cauſe, in themſelves, to ſay, <hi>This is the good and bleſſed day of God;</hi> and that all our trials we meet with here, may be a Cauſe to drive us nearer and nearer unto the Lord, from whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Life, Comfort, and daily Refreſhings, who is a preſent Helper in time of great Need, and as a Rock to flee unto for relief, ſuccour and ſhelter: Yea, he is the fountain and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Life, and in him is our Hope, for preſervation and deliverance from and out of the hands of our Enemies; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41608:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
bleſſed are thoſe that put their truſt and confidence in him, ye ſhall have cauſe of great Comfort in the midſt of Afflictions, remaining in each particular: Wherefore now ariſe, and ſhake off all fear, diſtruſt, and unbelief, and look up unto the Lord, who hath begun the good work in our hearts; and although he ſuffers many to be tried, and deeply afflicted on every hand, yet hath he regard unto the upright in heart, and is not ſlack in his promiſes that he made unto us in the days that we cried, and earneſtly brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed to feel of that Life, and to be made heirs or parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that durable ſubſtance that never will fade away; for largely have we taſted, and abundantly felt of the great love of God unto our immortal Souls; in the feeling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we have been made oftentimes to ſay, Surely, good is the Lord, and greatly to be feared, and had in eſteem for his manifold mercies that have been extended unto us; ſo that we can read back again, and take a full view of what God hath done for us ſince the day we knew him; for he hath rebuked the raging Sea, and cauſed the ſwelling waters thereof, with the Billows that have mounted very high, to ſink and to fall; and he hath made our way plain, and the path ſmooth in which he hath ſet our feet to walk; ſo this is that which remains as the Duty of every particular to do, even to wait upon the Lord, and to walk before him in the beauty of holineſs, in the Land of the Living. O verily Friends, the very conſideration of what God hath done, and is doing, and will do for the upright in heart, hath been as a great weight upon me for the ſpace of ſeveral days, which hath often times filled me with ſpiritual comfort, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward refreſhings; and this hath oftentimes been the cry, or the voice that hath ſounded through me, ſaying, Lord, thou art our ſtrength, and we have none but thee to put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence or truſt in, in all ſtates and conditions whatſoever, that we are brought into, for the tryal of our Faith, and the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41608:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
exerciſe of our Patience: For this is a certain Truth, and will ſtand for a Truth for ever, that God will never fail them that wholly depend upon him, although deeply tried, yet he will preſerve all, who look with the eye of Faith unto him, even as he preſerved and delivered his Servants and People in the days of old; yea, when the flood came <hi>Noah</hi> entered into the Ark, and the reſt that were with him, and they were preſerved from the Deluge of water that drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wicked world, who deſpiſed the ſervants of the Lord, and derided him for doing the thing that he was commanded of God to do. Yea, him that brought <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and delivered <hi>Mordecai, Heſter,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> out of his many troubles, <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> he upheld in the midſt of the flames, and brought forth <hi>Daniel</hi> out of the Lyons Den; who alſo preſerved <hi>Paul</hi> in his dangerous Voyages at Sea; who alſo made known unto <hi>John,</hi> when he was become as an Exile in the Iſle called <hi>Patmos,</hi> for the Word of God, and for the Teſtimony of Chriſt Jeſus, the things that ſhould come to paſs in the laſt days: he is ſtill the ſame that ever he was, and never changes, therefore are we alive at this day; for ye know right-well, that many in the dayes that are paſt, ſought to work our overthrough, and to bring ruine and deſolation upon us, yet never could do it, becauſe God was on our ſide; but they themſelves by ſo doing, were overthrown, ruinated and made deſolate, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not God, his Truth and People, but ſet themſelves in the bitterneſs of their ſpirits, againſt him and his people; and although the wicked do, and may flouriſh for a time, as the green Bay-tree, yet they ſhall wither and pine away, and their memorial ſhall rot and periſh for ever; and no more ſhall they do unto the leaſt that put their truſt in the Lord, then ſhall make for their good, for the furtherance of his Work unto which he hath called us, and for the glory
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41608:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his Name for ever: and although the proud are called happy, and thoſe that work wickedneſs are ſet up, and them that tempt the Lord, and oppreſs you his People, are yet unrewarded for the evil of their doing, which they ſhall be ſure to have when they have done their work; Yet let us wait upon the Lord, in the meaſure of his life, communicated unto us in the everlaſting riches of his love; alwayes watching unto Prayer, pouring forth our Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that by him we may be preſerved, and kept unto the end of theſe trying dayes: for although the Devil is let looſe, and rages exceedingly, becauſe the followers of the Lamb will not give their Power, or be ſubjected unto him, Oh! of this be ye aſſured, the Lamb and his followers ſhall have the Victory, and God who hears the cry of the poor, and the ſighs of the needy, who make their redreſs unto him, yea, he that takes an account of the injuries and wrongs done unto his People, whereby their hearts are made ſad, and they weep in ſecret before him, having none elſe to cry unto, Yea, he I ſay will bind Satan hand and foot, and chain <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathon</hi> at his pleaſure: So be not diſcouraged, nor in the leaſt diſmayed, becauſe of the hard ſentences of unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, pronounced upon thoſe whom God hath acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their innocency will clear for ever: and if many of us ſhould ſeal our Teſtimonies, by laying down our lives, in this our native Land, in Priſon, upon the Seas, or in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the holy bleſſed Teſtimony, by Gods Eternal Spirit given unto us, to bear forth amongſt this peeviſh and perverſe Generation of People, O it will gain more to the Lord, then if we ſhould live the dayes of <hi>Methuſelah</hi> to bear forth our Teſtimony in words. Therefore all my dear Friends, unto the Word of Gods Power, that lives and will abide and indure the hotteſt tryal, with patience and content, that ever may or ſhall come, do I commit my ſelf, you, and all that love his appearance, who cannot deny the many refreſhings that we

So live in the light, and dwell in the Power that was before wicked men, and unjuſt Laws, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes or Decrees, and will remain when they and the Actors by them ſhall come to nought.</p>
                  <p>And thus having ſignified the love in my heart that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, who retain your integrity, and keep your firſt love; teſtifying unto you, that a day of pain, ſorrow and anguiſh, ſhall come upon the Deceitful and Hypocrites, and Sinners in <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall be afraid, I take my leave of you, being now ſomething eaſed, having let forth the ſtreams of my love unto you, who truly love, fear, obey and ſerve the living God, in whom, my Brethren, my Siſters, and near related Friends, whether at Liberty or in Bonds, for the unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Truth, I wiſh comfort and conſolation, and bid you all Farewel.</p>
