         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orship full Sir, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember, and with no small comfort report your great goodnes, and vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fauour toward me, but a straunger vntoo you, and a cold seely suter in the Court: I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not but be ashamed of my selfe, that habilitie doth not affourde my hand somuch too requite, as my hart willeth my toung too vtter, how deepe indetted I am vntoo you. But you did it of a good deede, not for a good meed: and at the request of a Godly-man, in sute of an honest cause.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, consideryng that your due; and full reward is layed vp vntil an other day, in an other place, by an other man, of all fulnes, and habilitie, Christ Jesus, the high steward, and pay-master of all, I am to request your worship till that time come, whiche I trust shall not be long, too accept my good hart, whiche in all honest possible dutie is and shalbe yours bounden too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde.
<pb facs="tcp:17474:3"/>
A small regard for such a de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sert, I confesse, yet as kinde and dutifull a myte as the greatest valure of a farther summe. And sith that the most precious iewell in this world whiche Man can shew or geue too Man is vnfayned Loue, then truly the Loue that creepeth when it can not goe is aswell too be accounted of, and esteemed as Loue, nay perhaps the rather, then when it caryeth a higher looke, and a loftyer countenaunce. For, to say the truth Benefites whiche are liberall for the gift, and gratefull for the repay, are in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect sayd too be great or litle, as the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the hart is great or litle.</p>
            <p>This consideration therefore, as also your zeale in Religion, your loue of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, your place vnder the Prince, and the occasion ministred by these worthy, yet but worldly, Triumphes for the Princely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaynment of most Noble Casimirus, that famous souldier of Christ his Churche, moue mee too offer vntoo you, and in you, too all Godly harted Courtiers what soeuer <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> Triumphant: whose superexcellent workes ouerreach all hand, hart, and thought. What his entertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shalbe I leaue vntoo him-selfe who
<pb facs="tcp:17474:3"/>
must geue the grace too entertaine hym. What he hath deserued at our handes, he presenteth him-selfe in this litle Booke too declare. What enemies, whose enemyes, of what power they be whom he hath vtterly subdued, and in whose cause, or too what end, and for whose benefite he ventered the pykes so farre too shead his precious hart bloud, albeit wee haue often heard, and therefore should well know, yet sith wee as often forget, and therefore are still too learne, hee commeth now intoo the Court too shew, beyng the supreme defender, and most mightie Champion of the Churche, with greater maiestie, and cause of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, than any Monarch or Potentate whatsoeuer. But how shall hee be recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? What Royall preparation shallbe made for his ioyfull wellcome. Runne a good race for sooth, not with armed horse, but with a prepared hart: and whether? <hi>Non ad Pacis Aram, sed ad Pacis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choram, &amp; Authorem,</hi> that is, not too the altar of Peace, (as they dyd) but too the Author, and Anker of perfect Peace, Christ Jesus, him-selfe: and let vs fight a good fight, not with a reached out arme but with the strong hand of Fayth: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence
<pb facs="tcp:17474:4"/>
shall wee purchase more glory in his sight, and be farther in his remembraunce, when wee come intoo his kingdome, than if wee had atchiued ten thousand feates of armes.</p>
            <p>But so it falleth out, that wee rather regarde this outward shewe and glorious world, than the spirituall, and inuisible cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature: and all of vs, especially Courtyers (with all modestie be it spoken, without all offence, and affection) rather hunt or hauke after the fauour of the Prince, than after the loue of God: thereby like foolish builders plantyng our Tabernacles on the sand, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glectyng too follow our buildynges on the stedfast rocke. Herein as I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly auoyde all teastie, and froward misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors, so am I openly, and faythfully too protest that all Obedience, Honor, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and Majestie, is secondly too be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen too our PRINCE, (whom <hi>GOD</hi> preserue) but especially too Jesus Christ our full redeemer. Hereof this litle Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atise made by that excellent instrument of <hi>GODS</hi> Churche in England <hi>M.

For, albeit they be sometime Conquerors, yet the victorie tarieth not with them long, but are them selues also at other tymes put too the foyle. Moreouer, such is the Nature of those things which are wonne, that they can be recouered agayne by the enemie, at one time or other. Finally, if there be any daunger in the battaile, it is all layed vpon the souldiers necke: if there come any profit by the victorie, it is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, but if perhaps any portion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

be alloted to the many (which is very rare) though it come hardly, and with grudgyng, yet it may be written, and scored vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wales for very good lucke. But the most happy, and blessed <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> encountryng himselfe alone with them who were much stronger then wée, so ioyned incredible mercy, and loue with his force and power, in subduyng our enemies, that of the victory hee cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged nothyng as due too him, but his sweating trauaile, and vnspekeable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes: the pyllage, spoyle, bootie, and all the cemmoditie whatsoeuer, he would haue wholy, and alone, and fréely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to vs. Wherfore, when we haue throughly pondered in mynde, and hart,<note place="margin">All the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long aswell too vs as too hym.</note> all those thynges which <hi>CHRIST</hi> hath brought to passe, in this most happy bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, which truly are aboue all measure wonderfull, let euery one forthwith thus persuade himselfe, that the excellencie of this prowes, and glory of this victory is not somuch proper too him, as common too vs with him. Finally let vs all thinke thus, that whatsoeuer was priuately co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed by him, is a publique benefite for vs all: and let vs not somuch looke vntoo

the glory and magnificence of his déeds, as learne the vse of them: for, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer consisteth the prayse of <hi>CHRIST</hi> in the other our saluation.</p>
            <p>And yet too say the truth, <hi>CHRIST</hi> is in nothing more duly or rightly pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, than in the vse of his benefites, when as wee apply them too our selues, for our speciall comfort, with thankesgeuyng: neither am I able to say, whether he more desire to help thée, and do thée good, than for his goodnesse to be praysed: of this I am sure, that thou hast more néede of his helpe, than he of thy prayse.</p>
            <p>You shal finde many which count the<note place="margin">Meditation of the crosse of Christ.</note> highest, and chiefest point in Religion too be the often meditation, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of <hi>CHRIST</hi> crucified for vs, hanging on the crosse, especially if ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they with teares lament hys paynes, which he suffered, or with dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station curse the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that made him suffer. This their deuoute, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection is not to be misliked, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salowed, whiche without doubt is very godly.

<pb facs="tcp:17474:25"/>
heéde that weé rest not here onely, as in the chief ground of Religion: but rather take it as a steppe, or degreé too a farther matter, more properly belongyng to our saluation. For, the Crosse of <hi>CHRIST</hi> was not therefore erected that thou shouldest be onely a beholder thereof, but rather a follower: not too geue theé a shew, but a remedie, and a dayly help for thy necessitie. Thou beholdest <hi>Christ</hi> nayled too the crosse: why doest thou not rather call too mynde the cause, why this most milde <hi>LAMBE</hi> of <hi>GOD,</hi> did geue himselfe too so great tormentes? why he rose agayne? why he ascended vp intoo Heauen, there reigning triumphantly at the right hand of his father? whiche when thou shalt finde, and well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that they haue bene all done for thy sake, it shallbe thy dutie on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side too accustome thy selfe to the wise v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage thereof, applying the same too thine owne priuate comfort, and commoditie.</p>
            <p>But thou wilt demaunde, How shall<note place="margin">How wee must take profite by the Passion and victorie of Christ.</note> I doe this.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17474:25"/>
that <hi>JESUS CHRIST</hi> the sonne of <hi>GOD</hi> was crucified on the Crosse for thy sake. Herein, first, thou beholdest the exceéding loue, and mercy of <hi>GOD</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward theé: secondly thou vnderstandest what a horrible thing SINNE is in his sight, whereof their could be no satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made, but onely by the woundes, and bloud of his onely begotten sonne. Of whiche two, the former ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame theé with the loue of <hi>GOD,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too keépe theé in his feare, and bridle theé from custome of Sinn. But if thou chaunce too fall intoo SINNE, (as the infirmitie of mans flesh is very slyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery) wherin either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Law</hi> accuseth theé, or the horror of DEATH casteth theé downe, or the examples of Scripture doe make theé tremble, or thy senses, and Cogitations of thy mynde disquiet, and trouble theé, or if SATHAN styrre all occasions of terrors agaynst theé, as he is alway at hand too vexe such as labor earnestly in holynes and Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: Here thou hast not onely perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grace, and pardon purchased for theé, but thou mayest also boldly, &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously triumph, and crow ouer Death, the
<pb facs="tcp:17474:26"/>
Law, SATHAN, and thyne owne giltie CONSCIENCE. For, by what power, and right these Euils are ouercome in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> by the same thou mayest thinke they are ouercome in theé. But, when thou hast pondered all other thinges in thy mynde, as deéply as may be, yet of all the vses, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which wée gather, and enioy by the mysterie of <hi>CHRIST</hi> his Passion, and Triumph of victory, this is the most am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and most excellent, namely, if thou so apply too thy selfe all the deédes, vertue, and glory of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as though thou being wholy clothed with his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes didst now as <hi>LORD</hi> of Heauen and Earth raigne, and triumph aboue with him, and in him for euer: and as he on the other side, hauing chaunged persons with thée (for hee beareth the publique<note place="margin">Christ a pu blique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> person of vs all) tooke vpon himselfe the burthen of thy sinne, the wrath of <hi>GOD,</hi> and the whole heape of miserie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ariseth immediatly great libertie of mynde, freédome of conscience, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and boldnes of hart, likewise a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain maiestie of spirite, not onely despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing earthly thinges, and thinges vnder

the earth, but also lifting it selfe higher then Heauen. Finally there proceédeth herehence euerlasting comfort, and ioy in <hi>GODS HOLY SPIRITE,</hi> which the holy <hi>Prophetes</hi> prophesied that <hi>he should<note place="margin">Esay 35.</note> light and come vpon them, who were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and conuerted to SYON.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which Giftes seing they be proper, and peculiar too <hi>Christians,</hi> and of such valor that nothing can happen to Man more honorable, no not too the <hi>ANGELS</hi> of <hi>GOD:</hi> I can not but much marueile how it should come to passe, that they are so seldome seéne, nay almost not at all, in the life and manners of <hi>Christians.</hi> For, whereas you seé some drowned in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many as yet captiue vnder the old seruitude, &amp; bondage of the <hi>Law:</hi> &amp; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of other settyng their whole hartes vpon their aboundance of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mucke: what one almost ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>st thou geue meé, who either inwardly inspireth, or outwardly expresseth this excellencie of a <hi>Christian</hi> hart, &amp; spirituall stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> whiche before I spake of.

somewhat too touch them by the way.</p>
            <p>The Cause therefore that wée are so<note place="margin">Why wee are so stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the world, and faynt in Christ.</note> stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g in the world, and so faint harted in <hi>CHRIST</hi> lyeth not in any defect of the thinges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, (which as they are by Nature most ample, &amp; aboundant, so are they most certain, and permanent) but in the naturall corruption, and imbecillitie of our flesh: so that the weake eye of our <hi>Fayth,</hi> if it be not lightened from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with the soueraigne light of Christ, is dazeled with the brightnes of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thinges themselues, no otherwise tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as our bodely eyes are dimmed at the beholding of the shining Sunne.</p>
            <p>Beside this naturall dulnesse, and imbecillitie, there is another cause, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the force and power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who neuer ceaseth to assault vs. And partely our owne slothfull idlenes is too too blame, when wée doe not foster, and nourish whatsoeuer sparcle of <hi>Fayth</hi> or good motion appeareth in vs, but, beyng tickled with the good successe of thinges present, or hauing our selues fastened vpon other matters, or entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with cares of this world, withdraw our selues from cherishing that good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17474:27"/>
and neglect the riches of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Kyngdome. And what marueill is it than if <hi>CHRIST</hi> doe not open and shew himselfe vntoo vs, who so disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully neglect or reiect his Kingdome. or what cause haue wée too complaine, if he imparte not his blessinges vntoo vs, who make more accompt of this worldly <hi>Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>GOD</hi> loueth them who séeke it, &amp; those that are carefull too obtaine it. They who are frée Schollers, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of this world haue at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure their customes, and commodities which they enioy: but this our <hi>Kyng</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not his riches but to such as haue néede of them, and vtterly despising this wicked world follow the <hi>LAMBE,</hi> with a cheareful courage whether soeuer he go.</p>
            <p>Neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I well let passe too speake of those who haue Cure of soules, and charge too minister the word of <hi>GOD</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too

And aibeit I can geue here no generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept which the Ministers of <hi>God</hi> might vse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually in instructyng such a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude especially of so diuerse mindes, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions, &amp; opinions (for, some liue so, that you shal rot well know or perceaue whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they more neglect the <hi>Law,</hi> or the <hi>Gospell:</hi> whether they reuerence &amp; feare <hi>GOD</hi> lesse or Man: whether they be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistes or Infidels.

be more slow, or sparing in dispensing or distributing this his benefite, than he was in bestowyng. If it pleased the <hi>LORD GOD</hi> too shewe forth the excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng riches of his Grace, too raunsome vs miserable captiues from the bondage of the <hi>Law:</hi> too embrace vs in his armes: too call vs too the common possession of Heauen, and all other his blessinges: if being called it pleased him too iustifie vs: if beyng iustified too glorifie vs, of his owne frée loue and mercy: certes, for vs not too acknowlege that which is offered is a point of great ignoraunce, not too take it it were miserie, but to detaine, or grudge others that, which ought to be most publique and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious vnkindnes, or playne theft, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a Shepheard.</p>
            <p>I deny not that the terrors, &amp; threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges<note place="margin">The Law.</note> of the LAW haue their place, especially in these corrupt, and wicked dayes: but as they haue their place, so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they haue their boundes, and limites how farre they shall reach. For, great héede and care is too be taken of some (I touch not all) least, whilest that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely Nation of <hi>CHRIST</hi> is kept under
<pb facs="tcp:17474:29"/>
the continuall discipline of the LAW, it come too passe, in the meane time, that it neuer learne too rise and aspire agayne too the end of the Law, which is <hi>Christ,</hi> to the fulnes of perfect Libertie, and too the excéeding ioy which the <hi>Gospel</hi> brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth. Although perhaps not their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der somuch, as the corruption of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is here to be reproued: whose life and manners dayly waxing worse and worse are cause why they follow not some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kynde of Method, and order in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing them. Notwithstanding whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ought to be cause sufficient to withdraw thée foode of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and continually too beate downe the hearers with the threates and curse of the Law, I leaue it frée for euery man to iudge.</p>
            <p>But in my opinion, they who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted<note place="margin">The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> too the Ministerie &amp; functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the word of <hi>GOD</hi> ought to hold, &amp; folow that way of teaching, whereby <hi>CHRIST</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

too know, and acknowledge their good giftes, and blessinges, and may rather of their owne accorde be allured too godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, through the singular commodities whiche they haue receiued of the <hi>LORD,</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with austeritie, will they nill they, too be terrified, &amp; so compelled. That which is well and orderly done, is then sayd so too be done, &amp; so likely too remaine, when it procéedeth of good will rather than of constraint. For, whatsoeuer is of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion, that can not be of long Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunce. Neither surely can it be, but where <hi>CHRIST</hi> is rightly receiued, and printed in the myndes of the hearers, there also should acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany him all kynde of vertues, new affections, and a cleane hart, and renewed spirite: so that in my iudgement there can be no way founde more effectuall too discipline, and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life, than for euery man to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his hart and mynde with <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> and rightly too receiue him. Contrariwise, where he is not, and hath not his aboad, rippe vp all the common places of Uice and Uertue, and lay on lode with infinite labor, as long as hart can hold, it is all in vayne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:17474:30"/>I know there be some which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the souereigne grace of the <hi>GOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PELL,</hi> too the fulfilling of their flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and carnall lust: euen as the Sunne shineth vpon many perhaps vnwoorthy thereof: neither was <hi>God</hi> himselfe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunt long before he gaue, &amp; bestowed the benefite, what would happen. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, as the infinite number of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked did not staye his great mercy, and goodnesse: so now his singular Benefite beyng already geuen, and receaued, I thinke it not conuenient, that for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse of some, they for whom <hi>CHRIST JESUS</hi> shed his hart bloud should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of their due, and onely comfort.

            <p>But when wée haue founde out, and rekened vp all the causes, and occasions why the strength, and force of the <hi>GOS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PELL</hi> is so fruitlesse in the hartes of <hi>Christians,</hi> this is the most principall of all, (whereunto as too the chief all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue their full recourse,) for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
