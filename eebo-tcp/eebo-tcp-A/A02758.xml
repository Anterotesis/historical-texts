            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſaid of <hi>Diogenes</hi> that <hi>Cynicke</hi> Philoſopher, that being well ſtricken in yeeres, hee ſhould now betake himſelfe to his reſt and eaſe: hee replied, that it did not become one that was running a race, to intermit or ſlacke his pace, the neerer eſpecially he drew to the end thereof. The like may I in ſome ſort ſay of my ſelfe, who have for theſe many yeeres paſt, not hid my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a napkin, keeping within mine owne breaſt that knowledge I had both in the Vniverſity, and by many yeeres experience acquired in the profeſſion of Phyſicke: but have, not onely by my practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call imployment endevoured to bee profitable to this preſent age and place wherein I live; but alſo to propagate ſome directions to poſterity, for leading a more comfortable life both in ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and in health. Of late yeeres therefore as my other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did permit, I ſet upon this taske which I now preſent unto the view of the world. But becauſe whoſoever in this laſt and literate age of the world ſteppeth forth upon this publicke ſtage expoſeth himſelfe to the ſharpe cenſures of as many different hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, as were that Lyricke Poets gueſts; it hath beene therefore a common cuſtome for ſuch as undertake ſuch taskes, to make choice of ſome noble and vertuous Patron to protect them from the virulent and venomous tongues and obtrectations of envious and
<pb facs="tcp:20476:3"/>
malevolent perſons. And therefore caſting mine eyes about this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſpheare, and thinking on many, my thoughts could reſt no where, untill ſuch time as I pitched upon your Honourable Perſon. Motives to induce mee hereunto I found divers; Firſt, your eminent place in the publike, being inſtalled in the ſtate chaire of higher Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ordinary Gentry. And here have I a large field afforded mee to expatiate into, to wit, the honour of this noble family, and in what eſteene it hath beene during the reigne of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but eſpecially during the reigne of King <hi>Iames,</hi> of famous memory, in what eſteeme hee had it, and to what eminencie hee hath advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſame, is yet recent in the mindes of moſt men now living; and how his Majeſty now reigning, hath nothing diminiſhed, but rather increaſed theſe former favours and honours, without my relation is well enough knowne, both in court and countrie. It were eaſie for mee alſo to diſcourſe of the many honourable houſes wherewith this noble family hath matched, having been by marrriage allied to many great houſes of this kingdome. But becauſe I know your Honour is not delighed with ſuch panegyricks of your owne praiſes, I will paſſe over theſe and many other things might be ſaid: beſides that all theſe outward ornaments and prerogatives, how great and glorious ſover, yet are nor permanent, but periſh; and the wiſe-man, who both by reaſon of the extent of his wiſedome and underſtanding, together with the abundance of wealth, had atteined to as high a pitch of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as the earth could afford him, yet makes this ſtill the burthen of his ſong, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is but vanity.</hi> And this ſame wiſe man in this ſame palinody, or recantation ſermon, as I may call it, concludes with this ſentence, worthy to be ingraven in letters of gold, <hi>To feare God, and keepe his Commandements, this is the whole duty of a mans life.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe outward ornaments, howſoever I deny not to be great bleſſings, yet compared with true piety (which was that which chiefely graced great ones recorded in holy writ) they are nothing but the ſhell, that being the kernell. And this is that which hath ſo much ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and beautified your Honour, as likewiſe the love to your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie which are ſo well knowne over the country, that it need not to be proclaimed by my pen. And this ſeemeth, as it were, with your other large inheritances, to be hereditarily derived from your noble parents, both father and mother of happy memory, whoſe worth and virtues, eſpecially true piety (being eſpecially now againe revived in your owne perſon) are yet ſo freſh in the mindes of many yet alive, that ſuperfluous were it forme to ſpend time thereon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20476:3"/>Another motive moving me to make choice of your Honour, was the love and favour I have ever found both from your ſelfe and whole family ever ſince my firſt comming into this countrie: the which, as it hath beene alwaies extended to ſcholers, ſo to my ſelfe in particular, having beene divers times imployed for the recoverie of the health of your Honours laſt noble Ladie of happy memorie, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to theſe hopefull Gentlemen your Sonnes, and to that noble Gentlewoman, Miſtreſſe <hi>Manners,</hi> in whom may yet conſpicuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſeene thoſe vertuous ornaments which did ſo much adorne that noble Ladie now reſting in peace and happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Againe, another motive inducing mee heereunto, was, that of late yeeres, a worthy religious and learned Divine, your neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, had ſome few yeeres agoe dedicated unto your Honour a booke,<note place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.

And although the greateſt part of your glaſſe be now runne, yet may it prove profitable for younger people, and in particular, for theſe young Gentlemen, in whom you are your ſelfe againe renewed, but eſpecially in that hopefull Gentleman, your eldeſt Sonne, who, as hee beares the name of your ſelfe, and immediate predeceſſour, and is like to inherite large and ample poſſeſſions, ſo is my hope and confidence, that hee ſhall really inherite all thoſe noble vertues, Pietie eſpecially, whereof either your ſelfe, or noble Predeceſſours were ever poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>This might yet againe prove no ſmall motive and inducement for me to preſent theſe dieteticall Precepts unto your ſelfe, in that you have by your owne practice and example leſt ſuch a worthy Paterne and precedent to poſteritic of temperance and ſobrietie, not in diet onely, but in your other actions alſo. And therefore it is no leſſe true than triviall; <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ivimus exemplis, non regulis,</hi> men are commonly more moved by practice than by precept.

            <p>Accept therefore, Right Honourable, this my rude labour, and take theſe my paines in good part, as a gratefull acknowledgement of that reſpect and dutifull obſervance I owe unto your honourable

perſon, and noble family; and although conſcious to my ſelfe, both of the weakneſſe of my parts, and the hard cenſures I am like to undergoe (from the which, notwithſtanding, my betters have not beene freed) yet I ſhall more willingly undergoe this burthen under the protection of ſo noble, judicious, wiſe, and pious a Patron.

But becauſe many things concerning this ſame particular point, are handled in this ſubſequent diſcourſe, therefore, to avoid tediouſneſſe, with hearty wiſhes to Almighty God for your Honour, the continuance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny happy daies for the good both of Church and Commonwealth, and countrie wherein you live, with the increaſe of choiceſt bleſſings upon your ſelfe and noble family, I reſt</p>

               <hi>Hippocrates, vita brevis, ars longa:</hi> the life of man is but ſhort, and Arts and Sciences are long and hard to be attained unto: I thought it alwaies the part of a wiſe man to apply his ſtudy to that which might prove moſt profitable, either for his owne private, or yet for the publike. And if ever this was uſefull, this age wherein we now live requireth this care and circumſpection.

Some few yeeres agoe, I ſtepped forth alſo my ſelfe upon the ſtage to act ſome part of mine owne profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. There I detected and laid open ſome errours and impoſtures practiſed by ſome ignorant practitioners of phyſicke in that <note n="*" place="margin">Semioticall part of phyſicke handleth the ſignes of diſeaſes, as well diagnoſticke as prognoſticke.</note>

                  <p>Diet of the Diſeaſed hath been much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by Phyſitians.</p>
               </note> 
               <hi>Therapeuticke</hi> part of phyſicke, which handleth the diet of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, which of all other parts of phyſicke hath moſt ſlightly and ſlenderly beene paſt over; and that as well by the antient, as by our moderne and late Writers. And ſince the diet of ſound and healthfull people hath beene handled by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude both of antient and late Writers, both in forraine countries, and here at home amongſt our ſelves; it is a wonder that the diet of the diſeaſed, who of all others have moſt neede, hath hitherto ſo farre beene neglected! Having therefore a long time waited for my elders and better skilled in this buſineſſe, and perceiving that no man opened his mouth in the behalfe of the diſeaſed, I tooke upon mee to ſay ſomething, rather than to be altogether ſilent. And ſo much the more was I animated and incouraged to ſet upon this ſubject, in that I ſaw it ſo generally neglected, or at leaſt, moſt groſſely abuſed, which notwithſtanding, was ſo carefully among the antients obſerved, as ſhall hereafter in the ſequell of this diſcourſe more plainly appeare.</p>
            <p>And daily experience doth plainely prove, that a ſmall error committed,<note place="margin">A ſmall errour in diet much preiudiceth the patient.</note> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20476:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the due quantity, in the quality, in the time, or any other ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, proveth not a little prejudiciall to the patient. And I my ſelfe have in my daily practice obſerved this to be true, that aliments of the beſt nature and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, yet taken but at an unſeaſonable time, as toward the time of the exacerbation of the <hi>Fever,</hi> called the <hi>Paroxyſme,</hi> and by the vulgar the fit; hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made the patient confeſſe, that <hi>ſweet meate had ſowre ſauce.</hi> And from hence may be evinced,<note place="margin">Erroneous practice of the vulgar, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in feeding the ſicke too much.</note> the erroneous practice of many, of women eſpecially, who think the ſicke hath never food enough; and for this purpoſe they never ceaſe to urge them to eat, morning and evening, night and day, all is one, their too too officious love and kindneſſe, having neither rime nor reaſon, as wee ſay, produceth often this contrary effect, that, according to the vulgar ſaving, <hi>They kill their friend with kindneſſe.</hi>

               </note> That famous Father of Phyſitians was of a farre other minde, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that uncleane bodies, the more they were nouriſhed, the more they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: And the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was ſo punctuall in preſcribing the exact pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and ſeverall circumſtances of the diet in acute diſeaſes of his daies, that from thence appeareth the exact care was had in thoſe daies of the diet of the diſeaſed, as may by divers places of his writings, appeare. The like care had that noble <note n="d" place="margin">Lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Celſus</hi> among the <hi>Latines,</hi> and not unjuſtly called the <hi>Latine Hippocrates,</hi> who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth the great care he hd even in this particular point. And this extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry care of theirs was the cauſe they had a certaine kind of Phyſitians among them, whoſe proper office and imploiment was,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Clinici,</hi> or bed-Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, who attended on the ſicke.</note> to aſsiſt the ſicke, obſerving all that paſſed about them, having an eſpeciall care that the diet preſcribed by the chiefe Phyſitian, were carefully obſerved, all being afterwards related to him when he came to viſit the ſicke; and theſe inferiour aſsiſtant Phyſitians were for this cauſe called <hi>Clinici,</hi> from their office of attending by the ſickes bed; as in the ſecond booke of this diſcourſe ſhall more plainely appeare. By the variety of things to be conſidered, even in the diet of the diſeaſed (which now notwithſtanding is accounted a thing of ſmall or no eſteeme) may appeare the great care and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection ought to be had in the choice of a Phyſitian with whom thou maiſt ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be truſt thy moſt pretious and coſtly jewell, thy life, I meane. And therefore kinde Reader, give me leave a little, to ſay ſomething concerning ſome errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ignorant practitioners, before I proceed further, they being ſo dangerous members in a wel-governed commonwealth.

Now, an <hi>Empericke</hi> is nothing elſe but ſuch a perſon as undertaketh the practice of this profeſsion by meanes of ſome receits, or traditionary medicines, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, perhaps, ſometimes not without a ſucceſſefull event adhibited; and at the firſt with good advice and counſell preſcribed for the ſolace of the ſicke: yet now being uſed by ſuch perſons, who are altogether ſtrangers to good education in the liberall Arts &amp; Sciences, and eſpecially unfurniſhed of that skil and ſufficiency required in the practice of this ſo ſacred and ſublime profeſsion of Phyſicke; in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of wholeſome and laudable medicines, be come now not only dangerous, but often deſperate and often the bane of ſuch as uſe them, howſoever not alwaies for the time ſo ſenſibly perceived.

Vnto this Gentleman then (my preſence being at that time ſollicited for a neighbour Gentlewoman in the ſame towne, not farre from <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>) was I intreated to repaire, where upon my firſt comming, I acquainted his wife and friends there preſent, with the danger, which threatned no leſſe than death to the patient, whom a neighbouring Parſon-Phyſitian had a long time before had under his cure. Now, a few daies before my comming, this fugitive <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> had ſoothed up both this Gentleman and his friends with a vaine hope of a ſuppoſed true cure, by meanes of ſome conſolidating balſames, which this cogging and coozening Quacke-ſalver aſſured him and his friends would undoubtedly cure his infirmity. The bargaine was tenne pounds, five in hand (for monie muſt firſt be fingered) to buy ſuch balſames at <hi>London,</hi> and the reſt at his returne. And although here a meane and ordinary underſtanding, might, as wee uſe to ſay, <hi>ſmell out a Ratt;</hi> yet ſuch was the confidence, deſire, and hope of health, that if I had not with much adoe diſſwaded him from this courſe, whereunto he was likewiſe perſwaded by an Apothecary of his acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, with his life, hee had loſt his mony alſo. My prediction of his death within a few daies revolution proved too true, as I learned ſhortly after by relation from a worthy vertuous Lady in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> my patient, and mother to this Gentlemans wife. I inſtance in this particular, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare how farre people are often deluded, and even, as it were, bewitched with theſe maskes and vizards, ſhewes and ſhadowes without any ſubſtance, and where there is no leſſe danger than of life it ſelfe. But wee need not now goe farre, either into <hi>Germany</hi> or <hi>France</hi> to fetch <hi>Emperickes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Emperickes abound with us here at home.</note> they being here every where obvious and at our elbowes; and ſcarce any towne or corporation of any note or fame, but there are one, if not more of this ſort of counterfeit Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians: and how many of theſe ſuppoſed Phyſitians of both ſexes lie skouting in corners of the famous Citie of <hi>London,</hi> the Colledge there can tell. Amongſt theſe lawleſſe intruders there is one ſort that is growne to a ſaucie and arrogant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20476:10"/>
impudencie beyond many others, Surgeons I meane; who from curing of green wounds, outward vlcers and ſores, curing of the Pox by ſweating or ſaliva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Surgeons commonly too ſaucy and bold in practiſing phyſicke.</note> by Mercuriat inunctions, and ſome ſuch other miniſteriall offices, which Phyſitians (Surgery being but a miniſteriall part of phyſicke) for the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of their function, have reſigned to certaine perſons to practiſe. But it is now ſo come to paſſe, that in many places, the ſervant hath rebelled againſt the Maſter, and affirmed all unto himſelfe: as is reported, that ſometimes thoſe ſlaves of <hi>Egypt,</hi> called <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> rebelled againſt the <hi>Sultan</hi> their Soveraigne, and aſſumed unto themſelves the Diadem Royall.</p>
            <p>And whereas the learned Phyſitian, in regard of the extraordinary care and diligence required both in his private ſtudy, and aſsiduall paines about his ſicke patients,<note place="margin">Surgeons are onely deputed for the cure of externall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> be truſted the Surgeon with this externall part of phyſicke, reſerving unto himſelfe the curing of internall diſeaſes, being of greateſt moment and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, and withall reſerving unto himſelfe a right of direction and counſell in theſe externall cures: it is now, notwithſtanding, ſo come to paſſe, that any ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant apprentize in this profeſsion, if he hath but once beſmeared ſome <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan</hi> patient with his Mercuriat ointment, thinkes himſelfe ſuddenly matamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed into ſome famous Phyſitian. And if hee hath made a voiage into the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> or ſome other remote region (where, for want of better counſell, thoſe of the company are often caſt upon ſuch ordinary advice; their ordinary infirmities notwithſtanding, for the moſt part being the <hi>Scorbut</hi> and <hi>Calenture</hi>) he thinkes at his returne he may be allowed to kill his country-men: and not with this conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, will not faile to bring up others in the ſame ignorant impudency. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the learned Phyſitian, if hee would wait upon ſuch imployments, were as fit, if not fitter than ſome of themſelves to goe about ſuch buſineſſe; yet, for the care he hath of the other, being the more weighty, and where moſt diligence is required, is willing to relinquiſh this manuall operation: yet is the impudent audacity of many of our Surgeons ſuch, that although they come farre ſhort of many points of their owne profeſsion; yet are they not aſhamed to aſſume unto themſelves the profeſsion and practice of both theſe parts. <hi>De jure,</hi> now let the learned judge. Of the better and more ingenious ſort of Barber-Surgeons of the famous Citty of <hi>London,</hi> and ſome other places of this Kingdome I ſpeake not, who are ſo farre from this unlawfull and lawleſſe practice; that they are both rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and willing to admit of the counſell of the learned Phyſitian, as well for diet, as for other directions tending to the recovery of their patients, even in points of their owne particular profeſsion, wherein they might yet ſeeme to challenge to themſelves ſome better right: ſo farre are they from incroaching upon the Phyſitians freehold, as knowing themſelves unfit &amp; unfurniſhed for ſo great and waighty an imploiment. And this is likewiſe the cuſtome in that famous Citty in <hi>Paris,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Laudable cuſtome of thoſe places where the Surgeon taketh no great cure of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery upon him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advice and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</note> and many other places of that Kingdome, that a Surgeon (I meane of the beſt note, not a bold impudent audacious fellow, daring do any thing) ſeldome or never undertaketh any cure of importance, without the counſell and aſsiſtance of one or more learned and skilfull Phyſitians. But in defence of <hi>Empericks</hi> and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant practitioners, there is a ſeeming ſtrong objection made by the vulgar, alwaies ready to deceive themſelves, and applaud their owne ignorance; to wit, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten good hap, and a proſperous and ſucceſſefull event doth ſecond and accompany the actions and attempts of the Empericke and ignorant Phyſitian; and therefore (ſay they) why may wee not make uſe of ſuch perſons? As I doe not deny that which cannot be concealed from a very ordinary underſtanding; ſo doe I againe deny that this argument taken from iſſue or event, was ever taken in paiment for currant coine, by the judicious and more refined underſtanding. And although I have already <note n="g" place="margin">Anatomy of urines <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> elſewhere made appeare the invalidity of this threed-bare argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet ſhall it not be impertinent to ſpeake a word or two in this place:</p>
            <p>The Wiſe <note n="h" place="margin">Eccleſiaſt 9.2.</note> 
               <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The like event befalleth the good and the bad; all things come alike</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to all there is one event: to the wicked and to the good, and to the cleane, and to the uncleane; to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not: as is the good, ſo is the ſinner, and hee that ſweareth, as hee that feareth an oath.</hi> Even

ſo doe we not deny, that the learned and judicious Phyſitian and the ignorant <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericke</hi> have often alike ſucceſſe; for under the learned Phyſitian, the patient often recovereth his former health; and the like befalleth the <hi>Empericke</hi> alſo.

I anſwer, that all diſeaſes are either curable or incurable. If the diſeaſe be curable, and a skilfull, able and honeſt Phyſitian be called; by the good meanes hee uſeth the bleſsing of the Almighty accompanying his indevours, hee for the moſt part recovereth his patient. I ſay, for the moſt part, for that ſometimes ſome unexpected accident, as likewiſe the moroſity of the patient, neglect of the aſsiſtants in performing their parts, may often occur,<note place="margin">Difference betwixt the Empirick and the learned Artiſt.</note> and ſo hinder the good ſucceſſe of the Phyſitians paines and beſt indevours, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the diſeaſe were not of it ſelfe incurable. And ſometimes againe, ſome diſeaſe, howſoever in it ſelfe curable, yet may ſometimes be accompanied with ſuch terrible and dangerous accidents and ſignes, as doe uſually accompany ſuch as are ſhortly to be arreſted by ſergeant death; and yet after the Phyſitians prognoſticke, the patient may vnexpectedly recouer, as ſometimes hath beene ſeene. Now, if our <hi>Empericke,</hi> or ignorant Phyſitian bee called to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the two, the patients ſtrength perſiſting, and no rub nor let com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in his way, the coaſt being cleare, his remedies, perhaps, not ſo pertinent, and appropriat for the patient, yet may this ſicke party recover under his hand, yea, and if he ſhould be yet called to the latter of the two, by the skilfull Phyſitian now given over to a deſperate Prognoſticke, and ſhall boldly undertake the cure of ſuch a perſon, promiſing faire and boldly (as is the common cuſtome of ſuch people) although he adminiſter nothing to the purpoſe, yea rather, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that which is quite contrary to the right cure (as commeth moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to paſſe,<note place="margin">An Empiricke or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Phyſitian may ſometimes caſually and by chance hit upon ſom cure where a more ſufficient and learned Phyſitian may before have paſt his prognoſticke to be paſt his recovery.</note> howſoever ſeldome by watchfull eyes obſerved) and this Patient now unexpectedly (ſtrength and vigor of body, perhaps blowing away all the former feares of evill accidents) contrary to the learned Phyſitians prognoſtick recover; will not the vulgar here admire, magnifie and extoll the caſuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this new <hi>Doctor duns,</hi> ſetting him no lower than on the top of the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of fames Temple. The other againe, how skilfull ſoever in his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and able artiſt, yet ſhall be traduced by virulent and malignant tongues, and often eſteemed a Phyſitian of no account. And yet for all this, neither was the former the honeſter man, but ſtill an ignorant aſſe and a duns. <hi>Sifueris pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem, remanebis aſinus idem.</hi> Neither yet is the other the more ignorant or unſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, nor will bee otherwiſe accounted of among the learned and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſort.

And if but an ordinary artiſt ſhould with a watchfull eye diligently and narrowly obſerve the ordinary proceeding of ſuch an <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> he ſhould obſerve him often, where dangers are not ſo eaſily eſpied, and to none but a judicious underſtanding obvious, to ſooth up his deluded patient with the ſaying of old <hi>Agag,</hi>

Now the cauſes of theſe varieties are, the particular conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the partie Diſeaſed, the age, time of the yeare, the countrey wherein one liveth, the preſent temper of the time, ſtrength of the ſicke, cuſtome, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exerciſe, the diſeaſe it ſelfe, the cauſe, the part affected, the ſymptomes, like diſeaſes, the manner, motion, repletion, the ſtructure of the parts, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pulſe, the manners or condition of the ſicke, things helping or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, without the diſtinct knowledge of which conditions we can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any true experiment, concerning which we ſhall hereafter have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſcourſe more copiuoſly. And a medicine may at one particular time fit ſome one, and not another, although ceized with the ſame diſeaſe, and ſo in all theſe particular circumſtances might be eaſily proved, all occaſioned by reaſon of the variety of ſuch conſiderable circumſtances. And therefore the very ſame medicine which once might have produced a good and laudable effect, may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at an other time, even in one and the ſame individuall body, at ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time faile of this effect, the ſtate of the body upon divers occaſions, altering, and divers circumſtances often inducing the skilfull Phyſitian to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſome other more appropriate remedy, or elſe to adde or detract from his former preſcription, according as in his diſcretion he ſeeth indicated by theſe aforementioned circumſtances in ſuch a caſe required. And from hence is alſo detected and evinced the error of ſome; who having at ſometimes uſed the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of ſome underſtanding Phyſitian for ſome preventing Phyſicke, this ſame Phyſitian afterwards either abſent or perhaps dead, and it may be neither, yet often either by ignorance, a ſordid tenacity, or both, procure the ſame medicines againe by the Apothecary to be prepared according to the former preſcription, without either addition or detraction of the former ingredients, little conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the alteration of the body, which might according to new occurrents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand new counſell. But to returne to our Women againe, ſome of this ſex thinking to mend the matter well, anſwere thus for themſelves, that if they do no good, yet at leaſt they doe no harme. I anſwere, that even in not doing good, or adminiſtring that which in probability with Gods bleſsing was like to have done good, they doe evill: for in that they are unfurniſhed of that ſufficiency of adminiſtring ſuch fit and generous remedies as are likely to eradicate and root out the diſeaſe, they commonly trifle away the time, and loſe that golden time and opportunity in doing good in dangerous and acute diſeaſes, which once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loſt can never againe be recalled and recovered.</p>

And this being a taske which often poſeth the moſt skilfull Artiſt in his profeſsion, what then ſhould we expect from ſuch a ſhe-Phyſitian? And ſince ſhe neglected more noble and generous remedies, when there was anything to bee done in dangerous and acute diſeaſes, if nature were not of it ſelfe able to grapple with the diſeaſe, and expell the enemie out of his ſtrong hold, the patient was forced to ſuccumbe under the burden, and in all probability pay his fatall debt before he otherwiſe needed, if he had made choice of a judicious and underſtanding phyſitian.

againſt woman-kind, as ſome make it their recreation and delight too, to ſhew their wits (as they ſuppoſe) in inveighing againſt women: nay farre be it from me, being in a double relation beholden to this ſexe; my purpoſe onely is here to reprove their errors, whereof all are not guilty, and for this cauſe come not under this cenſure, and to ſuch I have nothing to ſay. And even touching this inſtability and inclination to extremes, I am ſo farre from laying thereby any aſperſion upon this noble ſexe, that with mine Author I account it for their high praiſe and commendation. <hi>For theſe extreme affections proceed from a ſubtill, nimble and able wit and underſtanding, ſet and faſtened in a ſoft, tender and well refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned body. And as we eſteeme that water to be good which is ſpeedily warme, and againe in as ſhort a time cold; even ſo wee may account the complexion of ſuch perſons as are ſubiect to ſudden changes and alterations, and ſuddenly paſſe from one extreme to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is moſt ſimple and pure; for the contray proceedeth from a lumpiſh ponderoſity and thickneſſe of the matter, which procureth this contumacious immobility. Women there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it ſeemeth, are compoſed of this pure, refined, ſoft ſubſtance, which is the cauſe that they are often ſo quicke and apprehenſive, that therein, as alſo in their ſuperlative affection, they commonly ſurpaſſe men.</hi> And hence have we this common Phraſe, that <hi>if a woman looke but on her apron-ſtrings, ſhe will finde out a ſhift.</hi> And for this ſame cauſe it is held, that a womans firſt anſwere is commonly the beſt, and that if ſhe ſtudy longer, it will ſtill be the worſe. But leſt I ſhould make wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men too proud, I wiſh them to conſider that the moſt ſubtill and refined wits are not alwayes moſt uſefull in a ſtate or common-wealth, as is reported of <note n="r" place="margin">Plutarch. <hi>in eius vna</hi> Hiſtory of womens contradiction and controlling the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians preſcriptions far out of purpoſe.</note>

My counſell being craved, I told both her husband and her ſelfe, I doubted Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would prove her beſt and ſpeedieſt remedy, on the which, notwithſtanding at that time, for certaine reaſons I would not adventure, onely for the preſent with preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of appropriate diet appointed with all ſome ſuch things as might then ſafely by her be admitted. But her accidents ſtill rather increaſing than decreaſing, and ſleepe now forſaking her, I reiterated my former advice concerning Phlebotomy, which neglected might endanger her life. This being heard by ſome of her neighbours and friends, with great earneſtneſſe diſſwaded her from this courſe. But the young woman her ſelfe, her husband, father and mother, were willing to follow my directions: which being accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly put in execution, ſhe was immediately freed from all her former accidents, as, bleſſed be God, ſhe hath beene ever ſince that time.</hi> And whereas it was by ſome of her neighbours and friends feared, that this might prove a meanes to dry up her milke, it proved farre otherwiſe, being afterwards better furniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with than before: and good reaſon; her great diſtempering heat, together with the want of reſt, and appetite to her ordinary ſuſtenance, muſt needes dry the ſpring of this ſo laudable and neceſſary a nouriſhment; whereas this ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Phlebotomy, by removing theſe rubs, did, accidentally, increaſe the ſame. I inſtance in this one particular and recent example among many, to make it appeare what wrong and injury is often offered both to the Patient and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian by this pragmaticall controlling of ſome of this ſexe; who being now warned, I hope, will grow wiſer, and let the Phyſitian uſe his diſcretion in

ordering and curing his patients; as hee medleth not with the buſineſſes of their callings, leaving them to their owne liberty. My purpoſe is not here to ſpeake againſt the charity of ſome noble perſonages of this ſex, ready both with their paines and purſes, to ſupply the wants of the poore and needy, unfurniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both of ſuch meanes and money; provided alwaies, they doe not exceed the limits in venturing upon things farre ſurpaſsing their reach: and although they are endowed with ſome priviledges and prerogatives above vulgar worth: yet I wiſh them ſtill to conſider their ſex, and that they are farre from that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in this phyſicall profeſsion, as to be admitted to ſit upon life and death. And now by the way, before I finiſh this point, concerning Women-phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I cannot paſſe by the great charity, and bountifull libreality of a Noble and vertuous Lady, living lately in this towne of <hi>Northampton</hi>

And to poore women in labor ſhe neither ſpared her paines nor her purſe; and would not diſdaine in that neceſsity freely and of her owne accord to viſit the meaneſt and pooreſt cottages.

All theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offenders, howſoever they bee dangerous and pernicious peſts in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; yet are they often eaſily eſpyed, and taken notice of, eſpecially by a meane and ordinary judicious underſtanding, howſoever the ſimpler ſort be often taken in their ſnares: but theſe other of whom we are now to ſpeake, doe often deceive ſome more refined underſtandings. And this commeth to paſſe by reaſon of a certaine vizard or ſhew of ſome learning; and yet not able by maturity and ability of underſtandings to performe by practicall operation, that whereof in ſhew they make profeſsion. And therefore ſuch novices as have perhaps attained to ſome few ſcraps of <hi>Latine</hi> in the Grammer-ſchoole; and perhaps proceeded yet further, to reſide ſome ſpace at the Vniverſity; and afterwards by reading ſome Phyſicke bookes, take themſelves to bee ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furniſhed for the performance of ſo great a taske, without either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or manuduction of able maſters skilled in that profeſsion, come here to bee reproved. And howſoever an otherwiſe able and induſtrious ſcholler may have attained to the higheſt degree the Vniverſity could afford him, in an other faculty, yet from hence to evince a ſufficiency in the faculty of Phyſicke were ſuch a <hi>non ſequitur,</hi> as might juſtly be hiſſed out of the ſchooles. But my purpoſe is chiefely to ſpeake in this place of a ſort of people,<note place="margin">The difficulty of the practice of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion might iuſtly deterre ſuch as are engaged in another great calling from the practice thereof.</note> who by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelves into two profeſsions defraud both of their due attendance. My meaning is of ſuch Miniſters, who beſide that waightie calling to the cure of ſoules wherewith they are betruſted, not without the neglect thereof, doe wrongfully and injuriouſly, both contrary to the Law of God and man, intrude upon another weighty profeſsion, This their lawleſſe and unlimited expatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20476:14"/>
and pragmaticall intruſion, doth juſtly challenge a vindication from ſo great a wrong and injury offered to this Art, and the profeſſors of the ſame. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this injury hath heretofore, both out of the pulpit, and by the pen of the learned been ſpoken againſt; and my ſelfe alſo gave a touch thereof in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to my former Tractat; yet hath all this as yet produced no reformation. And therefore courteous Reader, with thy good leave and patience, let mee a little expatiat into this field, to ſhew the offenders, the heinouſneſſe of their fault; and let no man mervaile if I be a little large on this point, this kind of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners now ſo abounding in every corner of this kingdome. And that I wrong them not to enter the liſts with advantagious weapons, I ſhall make choice of ſuch as they cannot juſtly except againſt: and therefore all my proofes ſhall bee taken out of the oracles and aphoriſmes of the old and new Teſtament; out of the antient councells and conſtitutions of the canon-law; adding thereunto a word or two out of the municipall lawes and conſtitutions of this kingdome. It would ſeeme that the difficulty of the practiſing of this profeſsion of Phyſicke, the multiplicity of knowledge thereunto required, together with the aſsidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and diligence in the practice thereof, required the Phyſitians preſence with his patient, his neceſſary attendance being often even then required for the cure of the body, when maſter Parſon ſhould bee curing and converting ſoules in the Church aſſembly. And it would ſeeme that an honeſt, conſcionable Divine, in regard of the waight of his owne calling, might finde worke enough without any ſuch expatiation and intruſion upon another calling, requiring ſo much paines,<note place="margin">The Phyſitians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence (if it can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be obtained) with his patient were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite.</note> diligence and aſsiduity in the practice thereof. Beſides, that this is no ſmall encouragement for ignorant and idle droanes to tread in the ſame pathes. Now that amongſt the antient people of the <hi>Iewes</hi> theſe two profeſsions were not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by one, but had ſeverall and diſtinct profeſſors, I thinke no man of a meane underſtanding will deny, and therefore may ſave a labor in proving it. And that <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 40.13, &amp;c. Levit. 8.1, 2, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> were commanded to wait and attend upon the ſervice of the Tabernacle firſt, and afterwards of the Temple, I read in the old Teſtament; but concerning the practice of Phyſicke not one word. The <hi>Prophets</hi> are all comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to proclaime their Maſters meſſage to that ſtubborne and ſtiffe-necked peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which was the whole ſubject of their Sermon. And as concerning their extraordinary and miraculous gift of healing; as likewiſe of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> practiſe, I thinke no man will mainteine that Practice to be any proofe to mainteine this lawleſſe intruſion. In the new Teſtament the holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were commanded to preach the Goſpell to all nations, baptizing them, &amp;c. And they are alſo commanded, I confeſſe, to heale their infirmities: the firſt of which was by unavoidable dependancy for ever annexed to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall function, the latter being temporary, and tyed onely to thoſe times of the infancy of the Church: howſoever our <hi>Romaniſts</hi> would ſtill ſeeme to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine an apiſh imitation of Apoſtolicall antiquity in their anointing oyle, the abſurdity whereof, together with their different practice, quite contrary to their pretext, from a very meane and ordinary underſtanding can hardly bee concealed, and therefore, as not perteining to our purpoſe, and being likewiſe largely, by our learned Divines confuted, I here leave. The holy <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> giveth a ſtrict charge to his ſcholler <hi>Timothy</hi> to waite on his miniſteriall function, after he had ſet downe as well the duty required of ſuch as enter into that profeſsion, as the excellency and eminency of the calling it ſelfe. <note n="*" place="margin">Tim. 4.13, 14, 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to Doctrine. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with laying on of the hands of the Presbytery. Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelfe wholly to them, that thy profiting may appeare unto all. Take heed unto thy ſelfe, and unto the doctrine, continue in them: for in ſo doing thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelfe and them that heare thee.</hi> Againe the ſame <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and in the ſame Epiſtle. <note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 3.21.</note>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20476:15"/>
with the affaires of this life; but wholly attend upon his miniſtery. And what was <hi>Timothy?</hi> That he was a Biſhop cannot be denied: and ſome would have him a Biſhop with authority over others; as may be ſeene in a <note n="*" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Downame</hi> B. of Derry in a Sermon preached at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of the B. of Bath and Wells.</note> late Writer; where this is none of his meaneſt arguments for the defence of the Hierarchie; which controverſie, I have not here any purpoſe to meddle with. But let the caſe ſtand as it will, of this I am ſure, the beſt Divines doe not doubt, but that theſe aforenamed places doe concerne every Miniſter of the Word. And if it were proved he were a Prelate, (as ſome would have him) the argument is then the ſtronger on our ſide: for if Biſhops themſelves bee thus tied to ſuch attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, how ſhall other miniſters, whether Parſons or Vicars, bee freed from this commandement? But heare yet againe the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> confirme his former charge. <note n="a" place="margin">2 Timoth. 3.1.2.</note> 
               <hi>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing and his kingdome, preach the Word; bee inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> The words are plaine enough, and need no comment to cleere the meaning of this place. <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 12.14.</note> Our bleſſed Lord and Saviour, although intreated, yet would not meddle with dividing of inheritances; ſo far was he from countenancing this incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon other mens callings.

A man muſt therefore carefully keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compaſſe of his calling, and not raſhly ruſh upon another mans profeſsion.

               <hi>office of Deacons.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins.</hi> Now that preaching of the Word with the dependances of the ſame, and the practicing of Phyſicke are in the Word of God diſtinct and ſeverall callings, may eaſily, by that which hath beene ſaid already, appeare. And in the ſecond place, that the practice of the one hindreth the performance of the other as it ought; thoſe that well weigh the weight of both callings, their ſeverall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, large extents paines and labor to be imploied about either of them, muſt needs confeſſe, that whoſoever will conſcionably performe his miniſteriall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as he ought and is fitting, ſhall therein find imployment enough without medling with other matters: neither ought that man to be truſted with the cure
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20476:15"/>
of the body, who maketh ſo ſmall account thereof, that he maketh it not worth the buſying of himſelfe wholly about it. Now in the third place, that the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of both profeſsions by one man is prejudiciall to the common good, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from hence appeare; in that it confoundeth two ſo waighty diſtinct callings, ingroſsing both into one mans hand, whereby he is hindred to performe the duties of either as he ought: each of them, ſometimes, demanding his perſonall preſence at one and the ſametime, which without hurt to the publike and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to many private perſons, cannot be omitted. And againe, in depriving him who is ſet apart for the profeſsion of Phyſicke, and whoſe proper calling it is, of his due reward, doe they not, as much as in them lieth, deprive the publike of ſo great a good? And therefore this in famous bigamy cannot chooſe but be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious both to the ſoule and body. The eminency of their place and calling, as being ſet, not <note n="m" place="margin">Math. 3.15.</note> under a buſhell, but on a candleſticke to give light to the whole houſe, doth not a little aggrauate their offence, as likewiſe that the injury is not done to a few, but to a many. <note n="n" place="margin">Iſay 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe, the good and laudable deſire the ſage Senators had of preventing this confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> in calling in a commonwealth, may from hence appeare; that in another ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſame Kings reigne they ordeine <note n="y" place="margin">30.14, 8, 42.</note> 
               <hi>that no Surgeon take vpon him to play the Barber, nor againe any Barber to play the Surgeon, no, not ſo much as to let blood.</hi> And yet let the unpartiall Reader judge, whether it be not an eaſier matter, and of leſſe danger for a Surgeon to ſhave a beard, or a Barber to let blood, cure a greene wound, &amp;c. than for a Miniſter (ſet apart for Gods ſervice) erring out of his owne orbe of divinitie, to wait upon the neceſſities of the ſicke, and to compaſſe Sea and land; not to make a proſelite, but to purchaſe a patient. <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 16.7.</note> 
               <hi>You take too much upon you, ſonnes of Levi.</hi> The premiſſes duely conſidered, I cannot be ſo uncharitable as to thinke that the reverend Fathers of the Church give licence and allowance to ſuch lawleſſe intruders: howbeit I wiſh they were more narrowly looked into.

            <p>But that this practice hath ſome pretext for it, at leaſt in ſeeming ſhew, and that it hath ſome appearance to have been practiſed by the Prieſts under the Leviticall law, ſome Clergie-men (although to ſmall purpoſe) have pleaded as a part of their apologie; and therefore I will remove this vizard. It is true indeed, there is a <note n="z" place="margin">Levit. 13.14.</note> charge given to the prieſt concerning the cleanſing of the Lepers; but maketh nothing at all for their purpoſe. In the firſt place therefore, we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to obſerve the ſcope and intention of this place of Scripture, the which is alſo
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20476:16"/>
in all others carefully to be obſerved. Divers doe hold, that here <hi>Moſes</hi> by Gods appointment, recommendeth to his holy and ſelect people, cleanneſſe from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of pollution; as may appeare as well by the purification of women preceding, as alſo of other fluxes common to both ſexes, following immediatly after the cleanſing of the Lepers <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Calvin</hi> in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon this place.</note> 
               <hi>To the outward ceremonie whereof</hi> (ſaith Calvin) <hi>howbeit wee be not tied, yet are we Chriſtians, taught by the ſame not to ſuffer any corruptions to dwell amongst us whereby Gods pure worſhip and ſervice may be defiled.</hi> It may then plainly appeare, that the intention of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not here to give the Prieſts any authority or allowance to meddle with phyſicke; the which may yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the words of the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">Idem ibid.</note> Author following: <hi>In that God appointed Prieſts, and that of the higheſt ranke, it is an argument that here Gods ſpirituall worſhip is more aimed at, than the health of the body.</hi> And this hee ſetteth downe yet more plainely in theſe words following: <hi>The Lord betruſted not here every Levite, but the Sonnes of</hi> Aaron <hi>only, who were of prime note and credit; to this end, that the authority of the action might be the greater. Therefore the Popiſh Prieſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not without great er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or rather impudency, have drawne this juriſdiction unto themſelves. That which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth is yet a more groſſe mockage. The officiall, being the Biſhops deputie, as lawfull judge, calleth before him Phyſitians and Surgeons, by whoſe anſwers being inſtructed, hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth ſentence of whereof that he acknowledgeth himſelfe altogether ignorant.</hi> But to come to our purpoſe againe, if wee ſhould grant that here were ſome phyſicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections addreſſed unto Prieſts; yet would not this warrant every Parſon and Vicar to practiſe phyſicke at his pleaſure: for here the command is addreſſed to the chiefe Prieſts, the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> onely, and not to the reſt: whence all they would evince (if the precept were perpetuall, and they could prove their ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion linially deſcended from <hi>Aaron,</hi> better than thoſe mentioned in <hi>Ezra</hi> for want of this put from the Prieſthood) would perhaps be this, that the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe might practiſe phyſicke. Beſides, the text ſaith, the Prieſt was onely to pronounce, whether it were that loathſome diſeaſe of Leproſie or no; the marks and ſignes whereof the Lord himſelfe there ſetteth downe: but that the Prieſt cured it, or was yet warranted ſo to doe, or inabled with any skill to effect ſuch a cure, remaineth yet to prove. Again, if this place gave any warrant or leave to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, yet were it onely in this lothſome diſeaſe of Leproſie; from the which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinde, our God of his ſingular goodneſſe hath freed theſe our cold climats. Againe, when mention is made of once or twice ſeven daies for the triall of the cleanneſſe of the partie, it cannot be denied, that here was an immediate provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governing this whole action, not to be by any man drawne into imitation, no more than was that of the <note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 5.11, 12.</note> Adultreſſe woman. The mentioning of ſeven daies reiterated, doth ſtill make the caſe more manifeſt. Now, in the ordinary and common motion of diſeaſes, wee finde ſo great variety and difference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeverall cauſes and conſtitutions of bodies, together with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumſtances; that very few doe wee find among many, howſoever ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the ſame ſickneſſe, agree in all points. And hence alſo commeth it to paſſe, that wee cannot alwaies precizely determine of the good or bad iſſue of the diſeaſe, neither in one, two, or three weekes, as the undoubted oracle of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty determined of this diſeaſe, including it within the precincts of this ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenarie once or twice reiterated. The ſeverall <note n="b" place="margin">Acutorum morborum non omnino ſunt certa praedictiones vitae aut mertis. <hi>Aph. 19. lib. 2.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>criſes</hi> of acute diſeaſes, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many times a doubtfull prediction, doe plainly prove the truth of this aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if they will yet ſtand ſtiffely upon the point, pleading their privilege, we will rather yeeld to them the cure of the Lepers than contend: provided they will reſt therewith contented: howbeit they ſhall never be able from this place to prove, that the Prieſts did cure this diſeaſe: and yet farre leſſe, that any authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is here conferred upon them to cure either this or any other diſeaſe. But when the old will not ſerve, ſome of them flie to the new Teſtament, thinking there to finde ſome ſhelter, and to confirme this their opinion. S. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſay they, was both an Evangeliſt and a Phyſitian. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Miniſters may be both Phyſitians for the ſoule and the body. In the firſt place, the antecedent is not yet proved for an uncontrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led truth: and although there were yet no controverſie concerning the ſame, yet
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20476:17"/>
the conſequence might be denied.<note place="margin">Whether S. <hi>Luk.</hi> were both an Evangeliſt and a Phyſitian.</note> In the firſt place then, it is by ſome queſtioned, whether <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt were a Phyſitian or no? Some, I confeſſe, are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion they were all one, and others againe deny it. Some of our antient writers doe affirme it; and hence commeth it to paſſe, that as in Popery, other profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had purchaſed to themſelves ſeverall Saints; ſo did the Phyſitians like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lay hold on S. <hi>Luke,</hi> whoſe day is by them in the Popiſh church very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely obſerved holy. <note n="c" place="margin">In his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentaries upon this place.</note>

And againe, the ſame <note n="e" place="margin">2 Timoth. 4.11.</note> Apoſtle mentioning him in another place, onely mentioneth him without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Evangeliſt. That which ſome alleage out of <note n="f" place="margin">Philem. 24</note> another place, that hee was <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow-helper, is not of ſufficient waight to prove it: for many were <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow-helpers that were no Evangeliſts; as <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 16.3.</note> 
               <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> tent-makers, were his fellow-helpers. But for avoiding tediouſneſſe I will omit the enumeration of more authorities, theſe being ſufficient to prove the point to be controverted. Againe, ſuppoſe that were yet true, what if I ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine that as in former times hee had beene a Phyſitian, but afterwad for a more waighty employment had forſaken it, (which is very probable) what place of Scripture could they produce to the contrary? Howſoever, ſure I am, he was never ſuch an intruding urine-monging, buſy-body, as theſe of whom wee heere ſpeake.</p>
            <p>But leſt I ſhall be thought to dwell too long upon this point, I wiſh both them and all other offenders in this kind to take warning by that which hath been ſaid already. And let no man mervaile that I have ſomwhat at large handled this point, the offenders having ſo long now ſteeled their foreheads againſt all admonitions; this feſtered diſeaſe breaking ſtill forth afreſh in many parts of this kingdome. I would likewiſe wiſh thoſe who ſhall have occaſion to uſe a Phyſitian at any time, well to weigh the premiſſes, carefully conſidering with whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt their bodies in their greateſt need. But in any caſe I wiſh none had a hand in the diſtracting a Clergy-man from his calling, which may appeare by ſome thing lately ſaid,<note place="margin">Learned and able Phyſitians are not ſo frequent nor in that number as ignorant, and why?</note> how much the antient fathers of the Church did diſtaſte. It is true indeed that learned and able Phyſitians are not ſo frequent, nor in that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as ignorant Empiricks and ſuch other as we haue lately mentioned: And that both by reaſon learning hath not its due reward; and above any other profeſsion the vulgar ſort being leaſt able to judge of the depth of this of Phyſick (howſoever with <hi>Salomons</hi> foole they thinke their skill here tranſcendnet) preferring for the moſt part any ignorant Mountebanke, Quacke-ſalving Empiricke, a medling Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, a woman-phyſitian, before the moſt skilfull and experienced Phyſitian in his profeſsion. And theſe idle droanes, who never were initiated into theſe medicinall myſteries, ſpending the honey whereon the induſtrious and diligent Bee ſhould feed, make them leſſe to abound. And yet thoſe who will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto them, eſpecially in any City or great towne of note, may finde ſome to whom in time of need they may have recourſe. But as it is the common cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the world, that of things of moſt ſublime condition they make often choice of the worſt; ſo it proveth too true, as in former times, ſo in this laſt age of the world, that <hi>Mund us vult decipi: It ſeemeth that the world deſireth to bee deceived,</hi> and loveth darkneſſe rather than light. Now notwithſtanding the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime nature and bottomleſſe depth of this noble profeſsion, there is none of the other two, Divinity and Law I meane, where there is that lawleſſe liberty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion left ſo free as in this: and yet I dare bee bold to ſay and avouch, that the paines of neither of theſe two callings (I ſpeake it not to vilipend or any waies extenuat the paines of either of thoſe two noble profeſsions) can be parallelled or equalled with the paines of the diligent and painefull Phyſitian;<note place="margin">The Phyſitians paines far exceed the paines of other profeſſions.</note> and yet either of them exceed the Phyſitian in the recompence for his paines. And this will yet more plainely appeare, if we ſhall parallell and compare theſe three profeſsions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20476:17"/>
together. I will beginne then with their paines taken before they attaine to any reward of learning. The able and learned Divine (I meane not a duns, a droane, or Empiricke divine, as I may ſo call him) hath firſt been trained up in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſchooles of good learning both grammaticall and Philoſophicall, and hath, according to ſtanding and ſeniority, taken ſuch degrees in the Vniverſity, as have been by our forefathers thought fit, to grace and adorne learning, and encourage ſchollers to the purſuite of ſome eminent excellency in the ſame. And after this, they attaine to ſome place of the Church, ſome of greater, and ſome of leſſer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. And ſome againe riſe to higher preferment, according to worth, meanes, friends and favour. The worthy, honeſt, carefull and conſcionable Divines (for of ſuch I ſpeake) are laborious and painefull in their callings, preaching in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; adminiſtering the Sacraments, and viſiting the ſicke, &amp;c. And with thoſe moſt laborious I parallell the Phyſitians paines, and not with many other idle ones, there being no need of any compariſon with ſuch perſons.<note place="margin">The Divines prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</note> Now this is a prerogative common to all Divines, that although many of them come farre ſhort of that allowance which the eminency of their callings, the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their parts, and great paines doe deſerve, yet are they ſure of their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance during life, and during that time and terme he knoweth there is no body can come betwixt him and home. And this to be reaſonable and equitable no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, I thinke, will deny. The Lawyer is likewiſe trained up in the ſchooles of good learning, both grammaticall, and ſometimes Philoſophicall (at leaſt moſt part of them have ſpent ſome time at the Vniverſity) and what time is wanting there, it is againe ſupplied by continuance and ſtudying in ſome Innes of Court: and after a convenient time they are admitted to the barre to practiſe their profeſsion, and are according to cuſtome, paied for their counſell. Many alſo in proceſſe of time, as the Divines in the Church, ſo are they likewiſe, ſome I meane, preferred to high and eminent places of the common-wealth, both of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature and others. As for the matter of the ſtudies whereabout both are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant, the one is employed in the large ſtudy of Divinity, which concerneth the ſoule: The other in the caſes of the common-law of this land, which I confeſſe is a painfull and laborious ſtudy, and many caſes with variety of circumſtances therin to be conſidered, and thoſe who are emploied are requited for their paines, as both equity and reaſon doe require that a man ſhould live by his labours.<note place="margin">Phyſitians ſtudy of a far larger extent then either of the Divine or the Lawyer.</note> Now as concerning the Phyſitian, he is not behind either of the other two in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary time of his ſtudy, and that both in the ordinary grammar-ſchooles, and the Vniverſity. And as concerning the nature and quality of the particular ſtudy of this profeſsion, it is as hard and intricate (if not more) as any of the former two: and beſides, it is of a farre larger extent. For in the firſt place, ſchollers well know the Theory of Phyſicke to be a great and large field of knowledge, our Authors many and various, and of ſeverall ſorts, the Authors of ſeverall nations, and written in ſeverall ages and at ſeverall times: <hi>Greeke, Latine, Arabian,</hi> and divers others, both antient and moderne, of all which, the learned Phyſitian (for of ſuch, and not of ignorant and unlearned Empirickes I here ſpeake) maketh uſe. And the Phyſitian doth yet herein goe beyond the other two, in that hee is,<note place="margin">Large extent of the Phyſitians ſtudy.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his ordinary Theory, to bee acquainted with the whole ſtructure and frame of the body of man, as being the ſubject whereabout he is converſant. Beſides, he ſearcheth into the ſecret and abſtruſeſt cloſet and cabinet of nature, inquiring into the natures and qualities both of ſimples and compounds in the univerſall world: all things ſublunary comming within the compaſſe of his profeſsion: yea, the Heavens themſelves come within the precincts of his knowledge, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not in that ſuperſtitious manner as ſome doe, and would tye us thereunto. But he conſidereth exactly the aire, with the alterations thereof, and neglecteth not the other Elements, with all the creatures conteined therein, either for the uſe of food or Phyſicke. Now come to the Phyſitians practicall imployment, and what profeſsion can compare with the Phyſitians paines? The ſeverall and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtitutions of mens bodies, ſo diametrally differing one from another,<note place="margin">Phyſitians practicall paines do far exceed other profeſſions.</note> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the various accidents, like ſudden ſtormes ariſing in the aire, make
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20476:18"/>
the Phyſitians paines often extraordinary. What ſhall I ſay of the <hi>Idioſyncraſicall</hi> (as I may ſo call it) or individuall ſeverall propriety of divers patients, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often as farre, as one face from another in feature? And what a world of worke doth this breed to an honeſt and induſtrious Phyſitian; while as he is not only forced to preſcribe fit and apt remedies againſt the diſeaſe, of what ſort ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (which were worke enough) but muſt with all accommodate himſelfe to give content to ſo many ſeverall palats, perhaps, as he hath patients, as the <note n="h" place="margin">Poſcentes vario mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum diverſa palato, <hi>Horat.</hi>
               </note> Poet ſaid of his gueſts? Some cannot endure to take pills, ſome abhorre potions, ſome muſt have powders, ſome electuaries, and upon ſome wee can ſcarce faſten any Phyſicke at all,<note place="margin">Phyſitians have much adoe to pleaſe their patients palats.</note> when often it ſtandeth them on no leſſe danger than their life. Some againe can abide no ſweet thing: and to ſome againe nothing but ſugar and ſweet things will downe their ſilken throats, &amp;c: ſo that many times by reaſon of this nicety, we cannot exhibit ſuch fit and generous remedies as are fit to oppugne the malignity and contumacy of their diſeaſe. And thus they verifie the Prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall ſaying: <hi>The cat would faine fiſh eate, but is loath her feet to wet.</hi> And many lazy Chriſtians would faine goe to Heaven, if they might bee carried thither in their feather-bed, or walke the broade way of their luſts and ſinfull pleaſures. And yet, if things ſucceed not to their owne or friends expectation, how carefull and diligent ſoever the Phyſitian prove in his endeavour, the Phyſitian oftentimes muſt beare the blame. Beſides all this, the patients peeviſhneſſe, frowardneſſe and teſty diſcontents,<note place="margin">And many troubles they muſt undergoe.</note> and often without a cauſe finding fault where none is, breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtill a new trouble to the Phyſitian: that I ſay nothing of his extraordinary trouble many times, and paines required at unſeaſonable ſeaſons. Beſides, his beſt endeavours are often croſſed, or at leaſt ſuſpended by womens, and other igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons unſeaſonable whiſperings, and idle ſuggeſtions, often to the irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable damage and hurt of the ſicke patient, and great griefe of the Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Phyſitians beſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons often miſ-coſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully traduced.</note>And many times, when hee hath done his utmoſt indevour to prolong the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents life, like a brave Captaine, that never ſurrendereth his fort ſo long as there is any proviſion of munition and other neceſſaries left within; yet at length, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall period of his life being come, and the oile of the lampe failing, the Phyſitian is many times, eſpecially by the vulgar and moſt ignorant, traduced or blamed; either for ſome neglect, or elſe all his actions conſtrued in the worſt ſenſe; and how generous a remedy ſoever, whether phlebotomy or purgation, &amp;c. how diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly ſoever applied, yet is often accounted the cauſe or occaſion of the patients death.

And as for the Lawyer,<note place="margin">And likewiſe the Lawyer.</note> although he hath this common with the Phyſitian, that his imploiment is not confined to one place, as is the Divines, yet is he not liable to various and divers inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences whereunto the Phyſitian is ſubject. Hee hath his ſet times at termes and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits; and at other times when hee travells in the Countrie to give counſell or keepe courts, hee is never tied to night attendance, but hath a ſeaſonable time al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies allowed him for the diſpatch of his buſineſſe: and as for other particular incombrances, they are freed from them. Now, if wee compare the recompence of theſe three ſeverall labourers, we ſhall find that the Phyſitian,<note place="margin">Phyſitians paines of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten worſe required than of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</note> 
               <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> hath ſtill the leaſt ſhare. I am not ignorant of the great difference betwixt that remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and recompence due to ordinary arts and bodily labour: and that which is due to the labour of the minde: the firſt by ordinary confeſsion, acknowledged that it may be recompenced, but the later by judicious underſtandings was ever eſteemed of an higher nature than could be recompenced by things of an inferiour condition. It hath notwithſtanding, by the poſitive lawes and cuſtomes of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beene agreed upon, that ſome tokens of thankefull remembrance have beene conſtituted and ordeined for the labours of the learned, according to the ſeverall and divers cuſtomes and countries. In this, as likewiſe all other well-gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nations, as the Divines paines are certaine, ſo is his maintenance in like ſort certaine, as it is very equitable and fit it ſhould be: the other two, as their paines are uncertaine, ſo is their pay. But the Lawyer in this hath the pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above the Phyſitian, that he hath the law in his owne hand, whereby ſuch as are not admitted into their ſocietie are kept backe from their barre, and by that meanes reape no benefit of their practice. Beſides this, they have ſtill a gap open, whereby they are in poſsibility to riſe to places of higher dignity and eminencie in the common-wealth: and this is with them likewiſe common to the Clergie: and yet for all this, the Lawyers pay doth often much exceed the Phyſitians. The Divine hath likewiſe in his owne hand the ſole power of admitting thoſe of his owne profeſsion: and if he admit of unworthy perſons, it is his owne fault. As for the Phyſitian, the Vniverſitie indeede doth conferre upon them their titles of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, thoſe I meane of their owne faculty: and ſome places have yet a cuſtome of re-examination, for avoiding of fraud and deceit, before their admiſsion to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe: the which is likewiſe uſed by the colledge of Phyſitians of the honourable City of <hi>London.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phyſitians hardiier dealt with than other profeſſions.</note> But the Phyſitian here is hardlier dealt with than either of the former two: for the Clergie have herein ſhared with the Phyſitian, and reteined not only power of admitting ſome Phyſitians to practiſe, but many of them have themſelves, without any admiſsion intruded upon their practice, as hath been ſaid alreadie. Now, when the Phyſitian hath taken all his paines (beſides the other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages) to attaine to ſome exellencie in his profeſsion (being in it ſelfe ſo penible and laborious) with infinite paines, both of body and minde, and coſt and charges; yet ſtill with a hope of recovering his former loſſes,<note place="margin">Phyſitians have many ſnarers with them, which iniuriouſly rob them of their right.</note> with ſome competent recompence for his paines paſt; behold <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But againe, many times the Phyſitian meets with many avarici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ignorant, ſordid baſe people, who had almoſt as willingly part from their heart

And I cannot but bewaile the blockiſh ſtupidity of many of our ignorant country people. Now, notwithſtanding all the premiſſes, both the Divine and the Lawyer have ſtill a doore open for future preferment, whereof there is no hope left the Phyſitian. But becauſe I have begun to touch upon this ſtring of ingratitude of ſome perſons (yet wiſhing none to take this in ill part, my meaning being onely to taxe the faulty) to ſhew that this is not mine owne private opinion alone, neither doth concerne this Kingdome onely, I will ſet downe the words of a famous <hi>French</hi> Phyſitian tranſlated out of the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, where there is an intire chapter concerning this ſame ſubject. <note n="k" place="margin">

               <hi>Ingratitude, or unthankfulneſſe, is a very great vice, and odious both to God and man: yea, ſo great a fault is this, that whoſo calleth a man unthankefull, he need give him no worſe title, as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all. Now, this fault is growne ſo common among people towards their Phyſitians, that I am much amazed, that any man of generous ſpirit will take upon him this profeſſion, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall ſo much ſubject to calumnie and ſlander, couſin germane to ingratitude. But we meet ſometimes with people of reaſon and underſtanding, both honeſt and able to judge of the Phyſitians ſufficiency, which maketh us more able to beare our burthen, and proceed in our profeſſion, notwithſtanding, wee meet with a many unthankefull people. For ſometimes wee meet with ſome ſo courtous and ingenious patients, that will both publikely and privatly profeſſe, that next under God, they hold their life of their Phyſitian; and having according to their ability and meanes thankefully acknowledged his induſtrious care and paines, confeſſe, notwithſtanding, freely, that to requite him with a due deſerved recompence for his paines, their whole ſubſtance would not ſuffice, as it is true in very deed. For they owe their very life unto the Phyſitian: and their life is of farre greater value. But the chiefe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence they owe the Phyſitian, is the good will they ſtill beare him, being ready to pleaſure him to power, and ſtill acknowledging their obligation to him for preſerving their life. And this is all one, as if any man had taken a ſword out of any mans hand, that was ready to kill thee, or a halter out of his hand that was ready to hang thee; wouldſt thou not acknowledge ſuch a man for the ſaver of thy life? Wouldſt thou think all thy ſubſtance ſufficient to requite ſuch a perſon? Is this then reaſon, to ſay, I have paid my Phyſitian well, yea, it may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid him (a fault ſeldome committed) having allowed him ſo much for his daily attendance, and now I am out of his debt. If he hath taken paines with me, I have as well recompenced him for his paines. Alas, I pity thy ſimplicity and ſottiſh ignorance! that which is given the Phyſitian, is nothing elſe but a ſmall token of a thankefull acknowledgement of that helpe and ſuccour thou haſt found and received of him: for to requite his labour and paines, eſpecially, if he hath ſaved thy life (as by the helpe of the Almighty God, hee may doe, and often doth) it is not at all in thy power, unleſſe thou ſhouldst expoſe the hazard of thy life for him, although he hath not hazarded his life for thine, which, nevertheleſſe, ſometimes hee doth: and thus thou ſtill remaineſt indebted to him, and muſt of neceſſity ſo confeſſe.</hi> And againe, a little after. <hi>God delivereth from death, and reſtoreth us to life by the meanes which the Phyſitian uſeth for our helpe and ſuccour. And is not this a worke rather divine than hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and which no man can ſufficiently requite and recompence? And therefore well was it ſaid by the Wiſe man: Honour a Phyſitian with the honor due unto him, for the uſe which thou may have of him: for the Lord hath created him. For of the moſt high co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth healing, and he ſhall receive honour of the King. The skill of the Phyſitian ſhall lift up his head, and in the ſight of great men, he ſhall be in admiration. Behold then, this is the chiefe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of thankefulneſſe due unto him, honour and good will, as a perpetuall bond whereby thou art obliged unto him: and not to be thus perſwaded with thy ſelfe, that thou haſt ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently requited his paines with a ſmall ſumme of monie. But there are ſome yet of a farre more perverſe and wicked diſpoſition than theſe, who, after they have beene by the honeſt and induſtrious care of their Phyſitian ſuccoured in the time of their greateſt need, yet can they not indure to have it ſaid they are beholden to him; and are not farre from hating him, who
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20476:19"/>
hath beene a meanes of ſaving their lives. O extreme ingratitude! But this is not the day, nor yeſterday: for</hi> Hippocrates <hi>bringeth in</hi> Democritus <hi>in his Epiſtles, ſpeaking after this manner: I thinke,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>O</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>that in our profeſſion, many things are ſubject to calumny, ſlander and ingratitude. For the ſicke, if they eſcape, aſcribe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the Gods, their fortune or good complexion, robbing the Phyſitian of all the honour and credit due unto him, whom in ſtead of loving, they often afterwards, hate; as being ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry they ſhould be eſteemed to have beene beholden to him, &amp;c. And this agreeth as well as may be with the times where in we now live. For ſicke people for the moſt part, aſcribe their recovery to ſome</hi>

               <hi>he or ſhe Saint, to whom they had made ſome vow, and many times are backward enough to pay their vowes, according to the Italian Proverb:</hi> * <hi>and thus they deale many times with their Phyſitians, during their ſickneſſe, promiſing them golden moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, pearles and precious ſtones, or ſome yeerely penſion at leaſt: but being once recovered they are of a farre other mind, pretending many things which furthered their recovery, and in concluſion, aſcribing the ſmalleſt ſhare of the honour and credit of the recovery to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians care and induſtrious diligence. And as for all his former faire promiſes, being now recovered, he begins to thinke with himſelfe what his diſeaſe hath coſt him, and what loſſe he hath thereby ſuſteined. And thus forgetting his bond and obligation due to his Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, upon whom hee even ſometimes laieth the fault of being a cauſe of ſome part of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, eſteeming it but ſuperfluous and needleſſe, and beareth him a grudge for keeping him ſo long a bed; thinking, that he might in a farre ſhorter time, and with leſſe charges have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him. So that by ſuch a churles account, the Phyſitian ſhould be ingaged to him: and it is very like, if he might find judges of his minde, and armed with authority, he would bring his action againſt him, and make him pay for his coſt and charges hee had beene at during his ſickneſſe: And now, behold, is not this a very thankefull acknowledgement of ſo great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit? Is there ſo great ingratitude any where to be found? I thinke not, unleſſe in ſuch a caſe, where ſome in deſpaire had hanged himſelfe, and ſome friend of his having cut the cord, and ſaved his life; this party afterwards would arreſt him for his rope: or of ſome other who having fallen into a deepe water, in danger to be drowned, he that drew him out, had in drawing him forth, torne ſome piece of his garment, and this party ſhould afterwards ſue this ſaver of his life for reparation of his damage. And thus our debters become our credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to crave of us that which they owe us, and will not ſo much as have a good conceit of us for all our care in curing them; and will rather after aſcribe the credit of the cure to any ignorant perſon, than to the care and skill of the diligent and induſtrious Phyſitian. And this commeth to paſſe for one of theſe two reaſons: either becauſe they are beſotted for want of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall parts, that they are not able to underſtand the nature and depth of ſuch a buſineſſe: or elſe they be ſuch as have wit and underſtanding enough, but would ſeeme to take no notice thereof, becauſe they are loth to confeſſe it, and thankefully, as they ought, to acknowledge the ſame, and this is the worſe of the twaine. Howſoever, it cannot be denied, but this is great ingratitude, and odious both to God and man.</hi> Thus farre this Author, I ſhall not need to make any comment upon this text, although both my ſelfe and moſt, if not all others of this ſame profeſsion could inſtance in too many examples of this kind. Nay, is it not a ſtrange thing, that many times, when as a Phyſitian hath next under God, recovered a patient out of ſome dangerous diſeaſe, yet afterwards ſhall we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſee the ſame patient not only neglect his phyſitian ever after in regard of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued thankfull acknowledgement of ſo great a kindneſſe; but afterwards in their need, either for prevention or curation have recourſe to others, and theſe often of very ſmall worth or ſufficiency; and as many others, ſo have my ſelfe often raſted of this potion. Among others, within theſe few yeeres, a young man, a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20476:20"/>
tradeſ-man, living in this towne, falling ſicke of that dangerous diſeaſe, called <hi>cholera morbus,</hi> wherein was abundance of ſharpe choler caſt up, this diſeaſe being alſo accompanied with an acute <hi>fever,</hi> which how dangerous it is, the learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian is not ignorant; and the which, although neither himſelfe, nor his friends thought likely to be cured, yet by Gods bleſsing upon the meanes I uſed, hee reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his former health. Being ſomewhat corpulent, and as in former times, ſo after now and then obnoxious to the head-ach, fearing alſo ſome other infirmities, yet did he never vouchſafe once to aske my counſell, having rather recourſe to a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon practiſer, dwelling ſome dozen miles off. And this laſt yeere, 1631. his wife falling ſicke of this maligne <hi>fever</hi> now for many yeeres ſo frequent in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet made he rather uſe of a Barber-ſurgeon, and his wife after long languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being at length recovered, himſelfe falls immediatly ſicke of the ſame diſeaſe, who uſed ſtill the ſame counſeller, of whom hee had formerly made uſe for his wife, who after the ſight of an amber-coloured urine (as I was told) promiſed his patient ſecurity, who notwithſtanding after the indurance of a many daies great extremity, at length paid that debt, which admitteth of no ſureties. But of a farre different diſpoſition from the former, is a <note n="*" place="margin">M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>George Coles</hi> of Northampton gentl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> very good friend and patient of mine, a man of good eſteeme and worth within this ſame corporation, who for theſe 16 or 17 yeeres, hath made uſe of no other Phyſitian but my ſelfe, either for himſelfe or family, beſides his extraordinary grateful acknowledgement of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor &amp; paines, ſtill laying hold of the ſmalleſt opportunity whereby he may teſtifie his love. Howſoever, this holdeth firme and ſure, that the Phyſitians paines is the greateſt, and his recompence ſmalleſt; I meane ſtill <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> making equall compariſons of all circumſtances: and I am ſure he doth as much for charity as any other profeſsion. And although the ordinary fees of Phyſitians in this kingdome doe ſomewhat exceed ſome other places beyond the Sea (which ſome have, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though impertinently objected) yet are they but anſwerable to ordinary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the place wherein they live, and the ordinary pay of Lawyers and others. Beſides, that in many places beyond the ſeas (as in all high and low <hi>Germany</hi>) the Phyſitians have certaine ſet ſtipends allowed them in townes and cities where they live, and a houſe to dwell in rent-free during their lives; by reaſon whereof their fees may the better be qualified. Now if any publike perſons, and not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wedded to their owne private, would ſet this worke a foot, they ſhould, I thinke, finde few Phyſitians againſt it. This were farre more worthy of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than their ſwiniſh and helliſh drunkenneſſe, and carrouſing and quaffing of healths, till health and wealth be both vaniſhed quite away, that I ſay no worſe. And by this meanes alſo there might bee good Apothecary ſhops ſet up in many places of the countrey, to furniſh good and ſufficient drugges for his Majeſties ſubjects; in many places whereof, by meanes of ill and fuſty or ſophiſticate ſtuffe, many people are utterly undone; there being none to control theſe ignorant countrey Apothecaries, nor yet our ordinary Empiricks and ignorant Practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, doing every man what ſeemeth beſt in his owne eyes. Many other benefits would from hence ariſe, if any ſuch worke were undertaken, and the countrey would finde at length that it would quit for coſt. But becauſe I have already touched this in another Tractat; and beſides, menare ſo wedded to their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that I doubt I ſpeake to the deafe, therefore I will now leave this point, and come to the buſineſſe in hand.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Cauſes mouing the author to undertake this buſineſſe.</note>The cauſe moving and impelling me to ſet upon this Tractat following, was an earneſt deſire I had to free my ſelfe from that neglect I find fault within others, in not applying themſelves to the publike good. And duly conſidering with my ſelfe by what part of my profeſsion I might doe the common-wealth moſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: as I have beene ready by my practicall paines above theſe twenty yeeres to helpe the infirmties of the Diſeaſed; ſo had I reſolved with my ſelfe ſome yeeres agoe the publication of the dieteticall part of Phyſicke, or that part which hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the diet of healthfull people. But in this being prevented by others, and not willing to give over my former purpoſe and reſolution to publiſh ſomething that might be profitable for the publike, I bethought me of a path which had not as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20476:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet been beaten by any, which might bee as uſefull and profitable, if not more, than the other: and this was to ſet downe an orderly courſe of Diet for Diſeaſed perſons; which having hitherto been neglected, hath proved the cauſe of much miſchiefe and diſorder in diſeaſes.

               <hi>Elihu</hi> waited for mine elders; howbeit farre inferior both in yeeres and underſtanding to a multitude of learned and able Artiſts of this Iland, I have been bold to breake this yce, hoping that ſome abler underſtandings will after ſupply my defects: and in the meane time, although I be not furniſhed with rich treaſures of ſilver and gold, pearle and precious ſtones; yet by my mite I may teſtifie and make known my good affection to the publike good.<note place="margin">

               </note> The difficulty of this taske then may from hence appeare, in that this ſubject hath ſeldome been handled by any either anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or moderne Phyſitians: and none of the natives of this our Iland (who of all others had been beſt able to ſet downe ſuch diet as beſt befitted our ſicke; as being beſt acquainted with the conſtitutions and other circumſtances in ſuch a caſe fit to be knowne) hath either in our owne vulgar, or any other tongue ever written any tractat concerning this ſubject. And beſides, euen among all our antient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, none of ſet purpoſe except <hi>Hippocrates</hi> above 200 yeeres agoe, hath hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this ſubject.

               </note> and that according to that countrey and climat of <hi>Greece,</hi> where he then lived, the which how farre it differeth, even at this day, from the diet of this our Iland both in ſickneſſe and in health, thoſe who have travelled into thoſe countries, and the learned Phyſitian are beſt able to judge. And therefore it may eaſily appeare that that antient forme of Diet preſcribed by him in his daies, did much differ from that of our times, eſpecially of this our Iland, and after the revolution of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres. Another Tractat concerning the ſame ſubject was publiſhed by a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Portugall</hi> in the Latine tongue in the yeere 1544. almoſt a hundreth yeeres agoe; the which howbeit it was directed to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of thoſe times,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Brudus Luſitanus</hi> di vita febricit. lib. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> yet how ſhort it commeth in many things of that which concerneth the Diet of our Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the learned Phyſitian is beſt able to judge; and may partly appeare by that which ſhall be by us ſaid concerning this ſubject. Our practicall Writers have indeed here and there ſet downe ſome precepts concerning this ſubject, together with the particular Diet in particular Diſeaſes, and that according to the cuſtomes of the countries wherein they lived. Now out of the labours of all theſe learned men both antient and moderne, as well Phyſitians as Philoſophers, Hiſtorians, Poets, &amp;c: have I collected, this ſubſequent diſcourſe, having accommodated what I have collected to theſe our countries wherein we live, and our cuſtome of life: and have withall inſerted many other things concerning this particular ſubject both of my owne and others obſervations, uſefull and beneficiall for the ſicke and diſeaſed in this our <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſoile, and have not heretofore beene publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And beſides, I have here and there as occaſion ſerved, diſcovered and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſome errors of many ignorant and unlearned Practitioners within this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and withall, where fit opportunity is offered, I confute divers erroneous opinions held by the vulgar ſort of people, and by them falſely mainteined, to the no ſmall prejudice and diſadvantage both of healthfull and ſicke perſons. Now it may perhaps ſeeme ſomewhat ſtrange, that I ſeeme to diſclaime the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the diet of healthfull perſons, and yet notwithſtanding, handle the ſame in my firſt Booke. I anſwere, that howſoever I doe indeed handle this ſubject;<note place="margin">Reaſons why the diet of healthfull people is alſo here handled.</note> yet is it not that I principally aime at; neither yet doe I handle many things in that maner as I would, if this had bin that I principally intended. And indeed my chiefe and principall reaſon was this, that I thought it very requiſite in handling the one to ſay ſomething of the other. And if we ſhall ſeriouſly conſider of it, we ſhall ſee ſome reaſon for it; the matter of both diets being one and the ſame, howbeit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring in preparation and ſome other circumſtances, as more fully in its proper place ſhall appeare. Beſides, one finding ſet downe certaine ſorts of Diet, and yet ignorant of the nature and vertue thereof, might be ſomwhat troubled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, not knowing how to find out the vertue and efficacy of the ſame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the end the Reader might be ſatisfied in his expectation, I thought good

to ſet downe in the firſt booke, the nature and vertues of the Diet of the health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, the which howſoever by others heretofore learnedly handled; yet may the Reader, perhaps here and there find ſome things, either not heretofore touched, or at leaſt ſome things cooked after a new manner to ſet his appetite on edge.

In the ſecond booke I come to that which I principally and firſt intended, the Diet of the Diſeaſed, where I proceed in order, as may appeare by the titles of the Chapters and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Booke, and ſo proceed in the third and laſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is likewiſe to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that ſome things concerning all evacuations, but by phlebotomy and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation eſpecially are here particularly and largely diſcuſſed, whereby people may the better be enabled to detect and diſcover the ignorance and unſufficiency of many ignorant perſons intruding upon the practice of this profeſsion, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent impoſture.

And beſides, the vulgar are ordinarily ſo ignorant of the nature of that which is with them in moſt frequent uſe, that they often judge of it farre otherwiſe than it is indeed. And whereas in ſome diſeaſes, diet it ſelfe, if duely adminiſtred, might ſometimes even cure the diſeaſe; and in others accelerate, facilitate and ſhorten the cure of the ſame; the patient is often, by reaſon of the neglect thereof, much wronged, and health much hindered.

Give a ſicke perſon food in the height of the paroxyſme or fit, and ſee what will be the ſucceſſe. The like may be ſaid concerning the due, timely and orderly adminiſtration of Phlebotomy, and the uſe of all manner of other evacuations. And then conſider whether this be all that belongeth to the practice of Phyſick, to exhibit ſome medicine at randome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe, as is the too too frequent cuſtome of many now adayes.

And I dare be bold to affirme, that if all the good and the harme theſe proſtituted medicines have produced, were laied in even ſcales, the hurt and harme would farre weigh downe the help. If it were poſsible to ſet downe remedies with all the ſeverall circumſtances, whereby they might be duely accommodated to ſeverall individuall parties as they ought, there were ſome reaſon for it. But this was never yet in the power of any mortall man to effect. And therefore, me thinkes, it is farre better to teach the ignorant people, that things without reaſon are to be ordered and guided by the lawes and rules of reaſon.<note place="margin">Remedies can never be rightly applied to particular indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall perſons, but by the learned Artiſt, howſoever people are commonly caried a quite contrary way.</note> Thoſe remedies therefore are to be ſought for in the learned workes and volumes (which Empiricks and all ſorts of ignorant Phyſitians are never able to attaine unto, and by conſequent unfit to practiſe this profeſsion) of the judicious and learned Phyſitians of all ages; and can by none but by a judicious underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, trained up in that profeſsion, be duly as they ought accommodated to ſeveral individuall parties; <hi>obſervaris obſervandis,</hi> with due obſervation of all the ſeverall circumſtances of time, place, perſon, &amp;c. Hence then may eaſily be evinced the error and ignorance of ſuch as divulge abroad in the vulgar tongue, their rare ſecrets (as they call them) againſt any diſeaſe whatſoeuer. I doe not deny, but they may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be ſeconded by ſome proſperous and ſucceſſefull iſſue in ſome: but that it is but by hap and hazard (as we ſay) <hi>as the blinde man throwes his ſtaffe;</hi> concerning which, ſomething hath bin ſaid already. But when I ſee the world uſe theſe aright,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20476:21"/>
they have already, then ſhall I be both ready and willing to communicate further what I know. My earneſt care and indeavour hath ever bin ſince my firſt ſetting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this profeſsion, is, and ever, I hope, ſhall be to benefit the publike: but by ſuch a courſe I ſhould rather abuſe than benefit any. What my owne paines have beene in this particular worke, I leave to be judged by the judicious and learned; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as have themſelves beene no ſtrangers to theſe labours of the minde, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken eſpecially to be publiſhed to poſterity, and to remaine upon record for after ages. And whereas I here and there meet with ſome particular offenders faults or errors, let the publike plead my apologie, whoſe cauſe I have here undertaken. And he who is the ſearcher of all hearts, is my witneſſe, that I am farre from hating the perſons of any of theſe offenders, but hate their faults only, and wiſhing a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, where the publike, eſpecially, is ſo much thereby intereſſed.<note place="margin">The publike muſt be preferred before any private perſon.</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as charity is not ſuſpicious, ſo I hope the honeſt and ingenuous Reader will interpret my honeſt indeavours in the beſt ſenſe. I might, I confeſſe, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from acting any part in the view of ſo learned, eloquent and elaborate an age wherein we now live, as is proverbially ſaid, <hi>Obſtrepere anſer inter olores:</hi> yet having now by experience found, that my former rude labour of ſo ſmall account, hath found ſome kinde entetainment abroad, I have been thereby the more imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened to proceed to the publication of this worke, which yet, I hope, ſhall be of ſome better uſe. And if this ſhall find expected acceptation at thy hands, courteous Reader, it ſhall, I hope, afterwards appeare, ſo long as God ſhall preſerve health and life, that I ſhall not with that evill ſervant, hide my talent in a napkin, but put it forth to the profit of the publike. And whereas I have here inſiſted me pupon generall directions, if God prolong my life, I may hereafter proceed to a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular direction for the diet in particular and individuall diſeaſes; although there be here many particulars concerning acute diſeaſes ſet downe. I am not ignorant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that among ſo great a multitude of judicious and refined underſtandings, there may occurre divers dainty apitian palates, who will ſcarce allow of my courſe cookerie, how dainty ſoever and wholeſome the diſh be in it ſelfe to a hungry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: and ſome criticke and ſharp cenſuring <hi>Ariſtarchus,</hi> may, perhaps, condemne both me and my worke. But I ſhall be no whit thereby diſcouraged to be a ſharer with many betters than my ſelfe: My chiefe aime and intention, I confeſſe, hath beene, and is herein to helpe the ignorant and deluded multitude, wherein ſome of the better ſort may, perhaps, be acquainted with ſomething they knew not before: I have for this cauſe accommodated my ſelfe as much as in mee was poſsible, to the underſtanding of the meaneſt &amp; moſt ignorant, whoſe cauſe I take here principally upon mee to plead. And yet I have ſo framed this whole building, that the learned ſhall finde here and there ſome marginall refreſhings. And although I ſometimes handle one and the ſame thing ſeverall and divers times; yet may it plainly appeare, that this is no tautologie and vaine repetition of things already handled: As water is firſt handled as an element common to all creatures, and the various diviſions, and the utility thereof in generall. It is againe handled as the firſt and moſt ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common drinke, together with the ſeverall waies of cooling and correcting the ſame. In the third place, among ſeverall drinkes of the diſeaſed, this is alſo menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and whether it may ſafely be exhibited to ſicke people, and when or what may ſupply the defect thereof; and divers profitable points concerning the ſame. And in like manner, the aire is in the firſt booke handled as a common element, with divers other things concerning the ſicke, with many other things thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing. But leſt I prove unmannerly in deteining thee too long in the porch, I ſhall intreat thee, courteous Reader, now to enter with me into the parlour, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſuch homely proviſion as I could provide for thee, and what is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe wanting ſhall be ſupplied with a hearty welcome.</p>

Now, as the great Architect of this univerſe, hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a multitude of meanes, both for preſerving in health, and repairing the ſame when it is loſt, to this <hi>Microcoſme</hi> man; ſo among all theſe none more effectuall than a due and orderly Diet: And becauſe the matter of diet, as well in healthfull as diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is one and the ſame in ſubſtance, howſoever differing in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. therefore, I muſt of neceſsity ſay ſomething concerning ſuch things as are incident to the uſe of man, for the maintaining of health, and preventing future infirmities, and afterward deſcend unto a particular ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the diet of the diſeaſed, with divers things thereto belonging. But before we proceed, it will not be amiſſe, firſt,<note place="margin">Divers ſignifications of this word Diet.</note> to explaine the ambiguity of this word Diet. Amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> this word Diet hath divers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and firſt, a certaine kinde of life, or profeſſion: Secondly, it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> an habitation, or certaine place of abode, as in <hi>England, France, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Againe, it ſignifieth certaine houſes of pleaſure, into the which, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of note did, ſometimes, for their recreation withdraw themſelves. Amongſt the <hi>Latines,</hi> it ſignifieth a certaine place next adjoyning to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> parlour, or rathet a part of the ſame, wherein (ſaith <hi>Varro</hi>) they were wont in the day time to take their repaſts. It ſignifieth alſo an aſſembly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> or meeting of many about ſome ſerious and important buſineſſe; and thus the <hi>Germans</hi> call their generall meetings, wherein the <hi>Princes, Electors,</hi> and other Princes of the <hi>Empire</hi> are aſſembled, Diets; and ſuch alſo are our Parliaments here in this Iland. In theſe latter times, cuſtome hath ſo farre prevailed, that not onely hydroticke, or ſweating drinkes, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> for the cure of the poxe and other chronicall diſeaſes; but even our purging ales alſo, and ſuch other infuſed purging drinks, and continued for certaine daies, have aſſumed unto themſelves this ſame name. But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Phyſitians doe moſt commonly take it for all the ſixe things, called not naturall, as the aire; meat and drinke; repletion, and evacuation;<note place="margin">And as Phyſitians commonly us it.</note> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or motion, and reſt; ſleeping and waking; paſſions or perturbations of the mind: of all which, by Gods good aſſiſtance, I purpoſe hereafter to ſpeake ſomewhat largely, and how hurtfull and helpefull they are, both in ſickneſſe and in health. <note n="a" place="margin">Lib. ad Thraſib.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> obſerveth, that in the time of <hi>Homer,</hi> diet was not taken notice of, nor any waies looked into: And <hi>Plato</hi> writeth, that the antient Phyſitians ſeldome obſerved this diet. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> was the firſt

                  <hi>Galen</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines it a ſymmetrie, or due proportion. Now, this due proportion is double, the one perfect and abſolute, the other imperfect, and declining from the former integrity. In like maner, health is of two ſorts; one perfect and exquiſite, and another imperfect: and yet betwixt theſe two is a great latitude comprehended, in ſo much that it may be divided into eight ſeverall degrees, anſwerable to the eight ſeverall temperatures, or conſtitutions of mans body. So that we may ſay, a man is in health, when as there is no ſenſible impediment or hinderance of his actions to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whereby diſeaſes are ingendred.

But becauſe this is a queſtion better befitting the ſchooles than this place, I paſſe it over, and proceede to that which followeth, to wit, Whether diet be a thing neceſſary for healthfull and ſicke people or no.</p>
               <p>That a ſtrict and preciſe kind of diet is by diſeaſed and ſicke people to be obſerved, may perhaps finde entertainment for truth, from an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry underſtanding: and that by reaſon, that whenſoever the ſpeedy reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of former health is hindered, it is for the moſt part occaſioned, by reaſon of the omiſſion of the neceſſary rules of diet, for the which cauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the antients, after <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as the Phyſicians employment was not in every one alike, ſo were there ſome of ſet purpoſe appointed to wait upon the ſicks diet, called for this cauſe <hi>Clinici,</hi> or attending the bed of the ſicke, as hereafter ſhall appeare. And <hi>Galen</hi> writes, that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie whatſoever of ſo powerfull an operation, that can performe the helpe it promiſeth; without the help and furtherance of a good and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diet. But whether it be ſo ſtrictly by healthfull perſons to be obſerved, may, and that not without ſome ſhew of reaſon, be called into controverſie,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20476:23"/>
and that by reaſon of the ſaying of <hi>Celſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A good and laudable diet is not only to be obſerved of the ſicke, but even of ſuch as are in health alſo.</note> 
                  <hi>that a healthfull man ought to be tied to no rules of diet;</hi> and not farre diſſenting from this, is that old ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Qui medice vivit, miſere vivit.

And I make no queſtion, that without ſeeking farre, wee might eaſily find many of this <hi>Epicurean</hi> Kings mind: but ſince that health comprehends within its compaſſe a great latitude, it cannot be that a like diet ſhould fit every individuall and particular perſon: Such as by reaſon of a laudable temper, and natural conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body, even from their very cradle injoy a perfect health, are by an extraordinary prerogative privileged above their neighbours, and may more boldly deale with any kinde of diet; but let even ſuch not be too bold, but wiſe and circumſpect, leſt they be overtaken: and although the conſtitution may be ſtrong, yet we know a ſtrong and able horſe may be overloaded, and ſometimes haue his backe broken: and let the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be of as laudable a condition as it will, and thy ſtomacke as ſtrong as that of the Oſtrich, yet may it be maſtered at length.

                  </note> our life conſiſteth in moiſture and heat, neither is our life any thing elſe, <hi>but a ioint-continuance of heat and moiſture in our bodies.</hi> But ſince our heat doth daily conſume &amp; waſte away this naturall and radicall moiſture, it is againe by the like humidity to be repaired. Now, this is performed by meanes of food, both meat and drinke; the right and moderate uſe whereof this dieteticall part doth inſtruct and direct; the which alſo not onely maintaineth and entertaineth health preſent, but helpeth alſo to recover that which is by ſickneſſe impaired (and as ſome would have it) produceth the life of man farre beyond the fatall period for all men appointed. And ſome there were, who by meanes of diet, would promiſe the perpetuity of mans life, and of a mortall man, to make him immortall; and ſuch a one was that <hi>Sophiſt</hi> mentioned by <note n="c" place="margin">

                  <hi>Galen,</hi> who promiſed immortality to all ſuch, whoſe education he had from their tender yeeres undertaken. <hi>Galen</hi> is of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the neceſſity of death, can by no ſolid reaſon be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, but confirmed by experience onely.

In the golden me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diocrity conſiſteth this health we now diſcourſe of, the which, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſtrictly obſerve, ſhall prolong his life for many yeeres. This mediocrity did our forefathers in that firſt and golden age of the world, ſtrictly obſerve, and ſo many of them attained 900. and ſome neere 1000. yeeres. Neither are we to ſuppoſe that theſe were Lunary yeeres, or of the age of a Moone onely, as <note n="d" place="margin">

And beſides, may it not eaſily to an indifferent underſtanding appeare, how ridiculous this opinion is, that <hi>Adam,</hi> and the reſt of the old Patriarches lived ſo long by vertue of the Philoſophers ſtone?

in the world, may appeare to thoſe that will ſearch into antient writers: and thus wee read of ſome that lived 200, ſome 300 yeeres; and the above-mentioned Writer relateth the long life of <hi>Iohannes de Tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> or <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Times,</hi> and divers others; and late Writers tell us ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the long lives of the people in <note n="p" place="margin">The ſobrietie of the <hi>Floridens</hi> doeth lengthen their dates in ſuch ſort, that one of their kings told me (ſaith <hi>Morques</hi>) that hee was 300 yeeres old, his father which he there ſhew'd mee alive, was 50 yeeres elder than himſelfe; when I ſaw him, mee thoght I ſaw nothing but bones covered with skin.

There are ſome of my acquaintance yet alive, who have told me they have knowne an inſtance of this laſt period, in each of theſe two ſeverall kingdomes of great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. To atteine to 100 is no wonder, having my ſelfe knowne ſome of both ſexes. If I might dwell upon this point, I could produce many proofes to confirme this truth; but this I thinke may ſuffice, and ſuch as are deſirous to receive further ſatisfaction, may have recourſe to this late Author, of whom before. The like objection is likewiſe made concerning the ſtature of men, which heretofore, as ſeemeth, hath bin very great; and have we not even in our daies ſeene ſome of a ſtupendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous great ſtature? And if it ſhall be again replied, that ſuch be not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary; I anſwer, that ſuch great ſtatures were not ordinary, and therefore in holy writ, we have <note n="r" place="margin">Deuteron. 3.11. 1 Sam. 17.4, &amp;c. 2 Chron. 11.23. <hi>Switzers</hi> tall and luſly men, eſpecially in the Canton <hi>Zurith.</hi>
                  </note> ſuch men ſingled out, and, as it were, pointed out by the finger. I doe not deny, that both among our ſelves, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other nations, it may be, in former times, men have beene both of ſtronger and health fuller conſtitution of body, and of taller ſtature; but this alteration proceedeth not from any ſenſible decay in nature, but by reaſon of our diſorderly diet, luxurious lives, nice and effeminate education, ſo farre degenerating from our antient predeceſſours, who, thorow their valour and martiall exploits, were famous thorow the world; and we now are become contemptible to ſuch as before ſtood in awe of this Iland. But that even at this day there are people of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry tall ſtature, whoſo hath travelled into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> ſhall perceive by oculare inſpection; where the people are ordinarily of a very tall ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Zurich:</hi> and a <note n="ſ" place="margin">Platerus <hi>obſervat. medicin. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 548.

Now, before I proceed, I muſt ſpeake a word or two concerning an aſſertion, affirmed by ſome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the abbreviation of mans life, to wit, that, After the flood, the whole frame of the earth was ſo altered, and, as it were, poiſoned, that people could not live ſo long after, as before. To this I anſwer, that if we compare lives with lives, wee ſhall finde this falſe; and beſide, that this ſame abbreviation of mens lives was begunne before the flood, and that ſome lived as long after the flood as did before, at leaſt within
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20476:26"/>
a little; ſtill comparing the declining of the age of man before the flood, with that which ſucceeded after. We ſee <note n="t" place="margin">Geneſ. 3.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Methuſalem</hi> lived 969 yeeres; and his ſonne <hi>Lamech</hi> came almoſt 200 ſhort of his age: againe <note n="u" place="margin">Geneſ. 9.29.</note>

                  <hi>Sem</hi> lived compleat 600 yeeres, and 500 of this after the flood; and ſo comparing one with another, we ſhall find that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this begunne abbreviation, <hi>Sem</hi> lived as long after the flood, as <hi>Lamech</hi> did before, although this abbreviation did not hold alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: For, <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> we ſee, lived longer than any either before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him; God, in this, manifeſting his mighty and omnipotent power, leſt wee ſhould aſcribe too much to the order of inferiour cauſes. But leſt I heare <hi>ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi> I leave this theme to the Divine. Howſoever, the daies of man were much abridged in the daies of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> but eſpecially in that age wherein <hi>Moſes</hi> lived; and therefore we eaſily perceive this point to be cleare, that the time of mans age hath not ſenſibly declined ſince that time. It may be alſo ſome would aske what ſexe is of longeſt life? I anſwer that the <note n="y" place="margin">Man is ordinarily longer lived than the woman. And why, <hi>Ariſi. lib. de longitud. &amp; brevit. vita cap.</hi> 2.</note> male, by reaſon of his ſuperaboundant heat, and good temperature of body: howſoever, this muſt ſtill be underſtood, with that parity we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore mentioned: for, no queſtion ſome women are farre longer lived than ſome men; a temperate woman, and of indifferent conſtitution of body, therefore may by many yeeres out-live a debauched ſwagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, luxurious good fellow.<note place="margin">What complexion longeſt lived.</note> And the ſeverall complexions are not here to be paſt over: the ſanguine of all others being of longeſt endurance; and next to it the cholerick; the phlegmaticke ſucceed, and the melancholy are ordinarily ſhorteſt lived.<note place="margin">In what Climat.</note> The climat wherein one liveth, maketh alſo much for the long life of man, and therefore we ſee that in our Northern countries oftentimes people live long: and in one and the ſame country, the native inhabitants thrive better, and live longer many times than ſtrangers; as may appeare by the <note n="z" place="margin">Purchas <hi>li.</hi> 14. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>S.

And there are yet divers other things which may lengthen or abbreviate the life of man, as the particular influence of the ſuperior powers, and to us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, &amp;c. But above all, there is a ſupreme over-ruling power in our great and omnipotent Maker, to lengthen and ſhorten the life of man at his good will and pleaſure.

                  <hi>Arabian</hi> Author doth yet much more magnifie theſe climatericall yeeres: <hi>The leproſie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is never cured by phyſicke, except it be adminiſtred in ſome criticall yeere, wherein nature of its owne accord doth attempt ſome renovation, and is ſuch a time, as nature hath for this ſame purpoſe appointed; and this is yet further witneſſed by the great</hi> Zacharie, <hi>and I my ſelfe have likewiſe tried it.</hi> Thoſe who labour to render a reaſon of theſe climactericall yeeres, render a threefold reaſon: 1 Numericall, 2 Aſtrologicall, 3 Phyſicall. To beginne then with the Numericall, they much magnifie the number of 7. and that out of <hi>Plato, Pythagoras,</hi> and <hi>Macrobius.</hi> And firſt, ſay they, becauſe it is compoſed of divers figures, it admitteth of divers formes; and therefore call it a virgine and number of perfection; and that by reaſon it is a full and compleat number, and may be divided into one and ſixe; and againe, to two and five; and finally, into three and foure, which is not incident to any other number whatſoever. Againe, they ſay, this is called the holy number; for, it is certaine, that God himſelfe ſanctified the ſeventh day, and having made the whole frame of the univerſall world in ſixe daies, hee reſted the ſeventh. Againe, the ſame God appointed the <hi>Iewes</hi> a ſeventh Sabbaticall yeere, in the which it was neither lawfull for them to till their ground, to ſow ſeede in it, or to dreſſe their vines: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven weeks of yeers being paſt, which was the fiftieth, was their Jubilee. Again, to magnifie this number of ſeven, they allege that on the ſeventh moneth the arke reſted on the <note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 8.4.8.12.</note> mount <hi>Ararat:</hi> on the ſeventh day, <hi>Noah</hi> ſent out a Dove which returned, with an olive-branch in her bill: after other ſeven daies, he ſent her out againe, and then ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned no more. <note n="i" place="margin">1 King. 8.65.</note> 
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> celebrated ſeven feſtivall daies, and all <hi>Iſrael</hi> with him, and many other ſuch numericall niceties. Againe, ſay they, the life of man imitateth the creation of the world, which was finiſhed in ſeven daies; and ſo the little world man, is certainly conceived at furtheſt on the ſeventh day: and the childe borne before the ſeventh moneth, liveth not. And the ſame <note n="k" place="margin">Lib. de carn ſeu prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipius, ubi multa de hos numero ſeptenario.</note>

Now, that many notable alterations are often obſerved to befall our bodies in theſe ſeventh and ninth yeeres, eſpecially the ſevenths cannot be denied: and with <hi>Hippocrates</hi> we may well ſay, that the ſeventh yeeres are no leſſe criticall in the life of man, than are the ſeven daies and moneths in the criſis of acute and chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſeaſes; and yet theſe numbers have no vertue to produce any ſuch

And as for aſtrologicall vanity, it hath been already by ſo many worthy, and learned men confuted, and ſomething alſo ſhall be ſaid hereafter of their fooliſh and ſuperſtitious opinions, ſo that at this preſent I paſſe by it. Onely this by the way, let it be kept in minde what hath lately beene ſaid, that theſe great and notable events fall not alwaies out on the ſame yeere, but ſometimes before, and ſometimes after; and <hi>Saturne,</hi> to whom they principally impute theſe ſtrange events, muſt keepe his ſet turnes in his regular motion every ſeventh yeere: beſides, that by their owne aſſertion he is quite excluded from the ninth. And although ſome ſuch notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects fall out about ſuch a time, and about the time of ſome great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; yet are they no more cauſes of ſuch effects, than the ſhining of the Sunne is the cauſe of a mans intended journey, of him before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon, whether the Sunne ſhone or no.

                  </note> learned late Writer labours to acquaint us with the reaſon of the prerogative theſe climactericall yeeres aſſume unto themſelves. <hi>In the periods and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions of certaine yeeres</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is a great abundance of ſuperfluous humours collected in the body of man, by the motion and agitation whereof diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes commonly are ingendred: For, when as the body hath collected ſuch an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuperfluous humours, that the places accuſtomed to receive the ſame, are now no longer able to conteine them, diſeaſes muſt of neceſsity follow, and, if not remedied, death it ſelfe. And therefore to avoid this danger, he adviſeth people in the ſpring and fall every yeere, by purging and bleeding to unburthen their bodies of this maſſe of oppreſsing humours, by which meanes at the returning period of theſe yeeres, they may live more ſecure and free from feare.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, there is a fatall neceſſity and diſpoſition to die, from the very firſt birth, attending and unavoidably accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying every man; and this was firſt procured by that wilfull and wofull fall of our firſt parents, and from them, as a legacie propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to all their ſinfull poſterity: which fatall period is often furthered or hindered, by the good or bad order of diet, and divers other exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and inevitable cauſes, and yet nothing befalling us without the all-diſpoſing and overruling providence of the Almighty. And in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, although many dangerous diſeaſes do often, both about theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and other times alſo, ceize upon a mans mortall bodie; yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till this appointed period, nothing can cut the thread of this life. Now, that every one may be acquainted with theſe yeeres, I ſet them here downe to thy view: The ſevenths are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98. Then ninths are 9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99. Who ſo ſurpaſſeth this number, let him reckon the reſt himſelfe.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S man by naturall compoſition partakes of all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo in this life can hee not long life without the uſe of them all, eſpecially of this ambient aire; and of the which, for this cauſe wee will ſpeake in the firſt place. Now, the utilitie, and neceſſity of this element, doth in this appeare, that howſoever, ſometimes, one may live without meat and drinke for divers daies, if not moneths and yeeres, (as ſome relate) yet, without the uſe of this element, was never any yet able to ſubſiſt and continue one day, no, nor yet one houre, there being ſo great an uſe for the body of man, both of perſpiration and reſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The whole body of man is compoſed of a triple ſubſtance; of an aire or ſpirituous, and next of ſeverall humours; and laſtly, of a more ſolid ſubſtance, fleſh and bone. Now, theſe three, from the very firſt beginning to the end of our daies, are continually decaying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt daily be repaired, if life be continued. The loſſe then of the firſt is repaired by meanes of this aire; of the two later, by meanes of meate and drinke. Now, ſince the uſe of this element is ſo great, that it not onely cooles and refreſhes the exceſſive heat of the heart, but alſo repaires our decaied ſpirits; wee will ſay ſomething thereof.<note place="margin">Quality of the aire.</note> The proper quality then of the aire, is reputed to be warme, joined with moiſture; I meane, in a temperate, and not in any exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive degree: howbeit, according to the ſeverall and manifold alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it is ſubject unto, it often altereth, not the body onely, but the minde of man alſo. A good laudable and temperate aire, is a great meanes to uphold the health; on the contrary, being corrupted, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth often the cauſe of many diſeaſes: and that the aire doth not a little affect the mind,<note place="margin">The aire doth not a little affect both the body and the minde.</note> may from hence be evinced, that ſuch aire as we moſt commonly breath in, ſuch ſpirits are there ingendred. Of a thicke and cloudy aire, thicke and groſſe ſpirits are moſt commonly produced. For this cauſe the <hi>Athenians</hi> were accounted wiſer than the <hi>Thebans,</hi> by reaſon they lived in a purer and more refined aire. And all <hi>Scythia</hi> brought forth but one famous Philoſopher, <hi>Anacharſis;</hi> and this they impute to the thickneſſe of the aire of that countrey. <hi>Plato</hi> made choice of a <note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iu</hi> Academo, <hi>unde</hi> academici. Ficinus <hi>in vitae</hi> Platonis.</note> moiſt and mooriſh place in the ſuburbs of the City of <hi>Athens</hi> to teach in; and that of ſet purpoſe, to blunt the ſharpe edge of his pregnant wit. And <hi>Plato</hi> himſelfe affirmeth, that <hi>Minerva</hi> being to build the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> did well before conſider the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that countrey, as promiſing no leſſe then ſuch famous worthy wits, as in antient hiſtories are recorded. Now, the healthfulneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the aire, according to <hi>Galen,</hi> is determined by the purity and good temper thereof. A pure aire is called a ſubtill aire, infected with no corrupted vapours, nor noiſome ſmells: A temperate aire is ſuch a one wherein we neither quiver for cold, nor yet ſweat for heat. Now, if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20476:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the aire of any countrey whatſoever, of it ſelfe naturally unhealthfull,<note place="margin">What is meant by a pure aire.</note> no art of man ever can amend it; and then the beſt remedy I know,<note place="margin">A temperate aire. Aire naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfull cannot be corrected.</note> is with all poſſible ſpeed to make choice of a better. If the aire be but accidentally bad, then there may be uſe of Art, and ſo it may, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the exceſſe in any quality be corrected: as wee read that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> corrected the malignity of a peſtilentiall aire,<note place="margin">Alteration of the aire by meanes of the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the yeere.</note> by making of great fires of ſweete ſmelling wood: as concerning that alteration of the aire occaſioned by meanes of the times and ſeaſons of the yeere, we are alwaies carefully to preſerve the laudable temperature thereof by contrary remedies, as farre as in us lieth: as the ſharpneſſe of winter is to be helpt by good fires, and warme clothes. In the parching heat of ſummer, we are to coole and refreſh our bodies by correcting the aire with contrarie coolers, eſpecially within doores, as alſo by the uſe of thinner clothing. Now, that aire which any one hath ſuck'd in from his infancie, ſuteth farre better with that conſtitution than another, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, perhaps, in it ſelfe, of a more laudable quality. It behooveth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one, as far as in them lieth, to make choice of a good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable aire. But becauſe moſt men muſt be contented with that aire they firſt breathed in; therefore this would chiefly be diligently &amp; carefully conſidered of our new colonies,<note place="margin">Advertiſement for undertakers of new plantations.</note> who tranſplant themſelves into remote regions, that they firſt make choice of a country, whoſe naturall temper differeth not much from their owne; but with this <hi>proviſo,</hi> that it be rather warmer than colder than their owne. In the next place, let the place of thy particular habitation be ſetled in a good place of the countrey, and that both in regard of the aire and water,<note place="margin">Errour committed in the fitſt plantation of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
                  </note> as alſo all other neceſſarie commodities. Our <hi>Virginian</hi> colonies therefore were at the firſt in this very farre over-ſeene, not being ſo carefull to build their townes in a good and laudable aire: and likewiſe my Lord of <hi>Baltomore</hi> was too confident in ſetling himſelfe in ſo tempeſtuous and cold a place of <hi>New-found-land,</hi> which forced him at length quite to relinquiſh that land. And I wiſh all other undertakers may take warning by other mens harmes. Now, it is to be obſerved, that the aire is much altered in quality, according to the high or low ſituation of the place; and hence commeth it to paſſe, that there is a great difference betwixt the aire of the high hills, and that of the vallies, the aire being commonly exceeding cold on the top of thoſe hills, yea, even when it is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent warme in the lower regions: and this travellers, that paſſe the <hi>Alps</hi> and <hi>Pyrenean</hi> hills, doe often finde true, where the ſnow covereth their high tops, when there is none to be found in the lower regions.

He caſt up phlegme, choler, and blood, and thought he ſhould have caſt vp his heart alſo. Some thinking preſently there to die, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded confeſsion; and ſome are ſaid to have loſt their life by this accident.

                  </note> The reaſon many be, in the firſt place, becauſe, perhaps, this wind bloweth ſometimes too violently, and ſo in too great abundance drawne in by the inhabitants; or elſe by reaſon, that by the ſea aire, divers marſhes, or ſtincking ſtanding pooles and ponds; or yet ſalt water mingled with freſh, or any the like occaſion, which cauſing the water to putrifie, ſendeth forth ſuch ill vapours and exhalations, as are altogether hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the health of man. And by reaſon this is ordinarie in moſt places of <hi>Italy,</hi> hence have we this evill report; and ſlander raiſed upon the ſea aire and wind: which, notwithſtanding, is onely accidentall, being in it ſelfe moſt healthfull, and without any hurt at all.

moiſt exhalations, which deſcending againe in great abundance upon the face of the earth, doth plentifully refreſh &amp; water the ſame; and this ſeaſon they therefore call their Winter. But againe, when the Sun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth a little, the beames not darting downe ſo perpendicularly as before, there not being now that forcible attraction of vapours; and by conſequent, as fewer clouds, and leſſe raine, ſo heat to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, being then intended, and of greater force than before: and this time they call their Sommer, as being fairer and warmer than the former, quite contrary to that which befalleth us here without the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pickes; as in particular may be obſerved in the country of <hi>Chili</hi> in the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi>

And among our ſelves the inſtances, I thinke, are freſh enough yet in our memories, of this laſt yeere, 1630. which deprived many of life, and many ſo pinch'd with poverty, that the wound is not yet healed up. It is then apparent that the ſeverall ſeaſons of the yeere, together with the alterations and changes thereof doe not a little affect both the body and minde of man; and therefore diligently and carefuly of Phyſitians to be conſidered.</p>

Celeſtiall are either ſnow or raine-waters. Terreſtriall, is either ſpring or river-water, well-water, or of a pond and ſtanding lake. Raine-water is engendred in the middle region of the aire, of certaine vapors, which the Sunne by his heat in the day-time draweth up. <note n="g" place="margin">2 Meteor. cap. 3.</note>

The ſubſtance of raine-water is moſt ſubtile and ſweet, by reaſon that the moſt ſubtile and thinneſt parts are exhaled and drawne up by force of the Sunne-beames. Snow-water is either of ſnow alone, or of ſnow mingled with haile or yee;<note place="margin">Snow-water nothing worth.</note> or elſe ſnow and yee are mingled with other water.

Now that any thing cary the name of aliment or nouriſhment, it ought to be indued with theſe qualities following.

And it is to be obſerved, that moſt of theſe hiſtories are of young women, of a cold phlegmaticke conſtitution, which humour without heat, and that of ſome ſtrength, cannot be congealed into ſo hard a ſubſtance. And beſides, it is recorded, that many of theſe parties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned afterwards to their former appetites againe.

Some, againe, are of a more ſlender and ſmaller nouriſhment; as wheat bread leavened, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in an oven, then waſhed in faire water, barley bread, ptiſan, rockie fiſh; and ſuch as are of a ſoft ſubſtance; being eſpecially prepared with vineg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The meane, betwixt both, is beſt for ordinarie food and nouriſhment; to wit, ſuch food as is neither groſſe nor ſlender; ſuch is good wheat bread, not too cleane dreſt, well leavened and baked; oatmeale gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, reare-roſted egges, new milke of a young cow; amongſt fiſh, the Pickerel, Carpe, Turbot; and the fleſh of Hens, Capons, Turkies, Pigeons, Veale, Lamb, &amp;c. of all which in their proper places. It is alſo to be obſerved by the way,<note place="margin">Qualitie of aliments.</note> that ſuch meats are of eaſieſt degeſtion: As for the quality, they ought to be of a good juice, <hi>euchymi;</hi> ſuch as are thoſe we mentioned laſt, &amp; the like, which are alſo the beſt for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as on the contrary, thoſe of a bad juice, affoord but a bad nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body of man: ſuch as are bread made of corrupted corne, of darnel, rie, panick, and millet; as likewiſe bread baked on aſhes, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer fruits, which laſt not; and whatſoever is quickly corrupted
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20476:39"/>
in the ſtomack, &amp;c. As for the quantity,<note place="margin">Quantity variable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſundry circumſtances.</note> in regard of the variety of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, complexions, cuſtoms, courſe of life, age, and ſuch other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances, it cannot certainly be determined. Old age muſt not feed ſo liberally, as luſty yong laboring men: and ſuch as lead a ſedenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry life: as Schollers, women, &amp;c. muſt not feed ſo liberally as husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſailers, &amp;c. But although wee cannot certainly determine the due quantity of food; yet ſearching into antiquity, wee may find out the quantity of food ordinarily uſed, and allotted a man for one day, which will not be unworthy our conſideration. In old times, wee read,<note place="margin">Allowance of foode for one naturall day in old times.</note> that the ordinary allowance for a mans diet, in one naturall day, was that meaſure which they called <hi>choenix,</hi> conteining about a quarter of a peck of our ordinary meaſure, or forty ounces, according to the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <note n="b" place="margin">Budans lib. <hi>3.</hi> de aſſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Budaeus.</hi> And this quantity of <hi>Manna,</hi> did God himſelfe allow his owne people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe. This quantity was when they were deprived of any other ſuſtenance: for this quantity is to be underſtood both of bread, fleſh, or any other food; all which joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, did not commonly exceed, in ſober men this aforenamed quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; howbeit, no queſtion, many ſober people did then content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with leſſe allowance: and the like proportion of drinke is likewiſe to be underſtood. Obſerve alſo, that all this while the people of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ordinare drinke, was nothing elſe but water; as likewiſe moſt other nations uſed this for their ordinary drinke, except the better ſort, at feſtivall times, and ſome extraordinary occaſions. As for us in theſe Northerne parts of the world, although all have not wine,<note place="margin">Northern people, and living in cold climate are allowed a more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall uſe of diet, than ſuch as dwell in hot countries.</note> yet doe wee ordinarily uſe a drinke anſwerable to it, which doth not a little nouriſh, and therefore may we be the more ſparing in the quantitie of our food. And yet I doe not deny, but that our Northerne cold climats may be a little freer in the uſe of food, than the inhabitants of the Southerne parts and hotter countries, howſoever, it is alwaies good to uſe a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Husband-men, and ſuch as labour hard, have able bodies, and take great paines; we cannot well regulate nor accommodate this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion preciſely to all; Schollers, and ſuch as have weak ſtomacks, and weake digeſtion, not being often able to overcome this quantity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the quality of the aliment, of hard or eaſie digeſtion, doth often indicate an alteration of the quantity; and yet I thinke few of our people, although reaſonable aged, and otherwiſe valetudinary, will content themſelves with twelve, thirteene, or fourteene ounces of food for one day, unleſſe their ſtomacks be exceeding weake; although Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="c" place="margin">See Sir <hi>William Vaughan</hi> his newlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cure, <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>ſect.</hi> 2.</note>

Cuſtome, education, and out cold climats, doe hinder the effecting of that which otherwiſe in hotter countries may eaſily be brought to paſſe. Next followes the preparation, which is very various,<note place="margin">Preparation various.</note> according to the diverſity of diſhes; ſome being roſted, ſome boiled, ſome baked, ſome fried, &amp;c. and ſome requiring one preparation, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt be ordered after another manner; whereof more hereafter in the particular diſcourſe of diet. The order of ingeſtion is that which is next to be conſidered, concerning which point,<note place="margin">Order of ingeſtion.</note> our Authours ſpeake at length, and wiſh us alwaies to take with us this rule of direction, that the lighteſt meat, and eaſieſt of digeſtion ought firſt to be eaten, quite
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20476:40"/>
contrary to our ordinary and uſuall cuſtome; and that both in regard, ſay they, the bottome of the ſtomacke is warmer than the upper part, and becauſe the lighteſt meates being firſt eaten, ſooner deſcend into the guts after concoction, which if laſt eaten, are by the other hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to deſcend, and ſo putrifie, and ingender crudities, the originall of obſtructions, and conſequently of many dangerous diſeaſes: as for mine owne opinion, I thinke the ſtomacke mingles all confuſedly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making thereof, that which Phyſitians commonly call <hi>chylus,</hi> and afterward converted into blood. To prevent, therefore, all diſorder, doubts, danger, and feare, were beſt to eat but of one or two diſhes at moſt at a meale; and if thou ſhouldſt ſometimes take unto thy ſelfe a greater liberty, keep this caution, that the diſhes thou eatſt of differ not much in quality, being all eaſie of digeſtion. And for the quantity, let the ſtrength of thy concoction be alwaies thy beſt guide, and keepe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within, than at any time exceed the ſtrength of thy ſtomacke.

But here ariſeth a queſtion to be diſcuſſed, How many meales a day ought we ordinarily to uſe? This queſtion hath beene variouſly toſſed to and fro amongſt our Phyſitians, ſome being of one minde, and ſome of another: Some hold it beſt to eate but one meale a day, and ſome twice. <note n="d" place="margin">2 De diaera acut.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſeemeth to favour one meale a day. Others hold that one meale a day maketh men more cholericke, by reaſon the humors by abſtinence are too much ſharpened, which by meanes of food are well qualified. <note n="e" place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Celſus</hi> is for two meales a day; the which ſeemeth beſt to agree with reaſon: for hee that uſeth but one meale a day, is forced to eat as much at one meale, as another at two. Now the ſtomacke being oppreſſed with too great a quantity of food, it failes under the burden, and the ſtrength of it is quite overthrowne: for by ſo great a diſtention it loſeth much of its thickeneſſe and firmeneſſe;<note place="margin">Cauſe of the weaknes of gluttons and belly-gods ſtomackes.</note> which two make not a little for the retention and concoction of the food: neither is there any other cauſe to be inquired into of the weaknes of gluttons &amp; belly-gods ſtomaks. It is further to be obſerved, that the ſtomacke being too much ſtuffed up with food, cannot ſo freely concoct the ſame; which may eaſily appeare in a pot full of meat, where the meate is not ſo eaſily boyled as when there is more roome.

Bread of wheat taketh its difference, either from the parts of meale or floure whereof it is made; or from the manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. Of the meale, ſome parts are finer, and ſome courſer. Bread made of the courſer nouriſheth leſſe, yet keepeth the body more ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but that made of finer floure, as it nouriſheth more; ſo maketh it not the body ſo ſoluble; and is worſe for obſtructions and the ſtone; and as the bread partaketh more of the one or the other, ſo are the vertues thereof. The next difference is taken from the preparation.<note place="margin">Second difference from the preparation.</note> All ſorts of bread were either leavened or unleavened; unleavened bread was commanded by <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 13.1, 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> God himſelfe in the inſtitution of the Paſſeover, howbeit not for their ordinary uſe.

The leaven maketh the bread lighter, and of eaſier digeſtion. To make our bread light,<note place="margin">Bakers abuſe the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by putting too much barme in their bread.</note> there is with us a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome to adde barme, whereof the antients were ignorant: but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is better and wholeſomer.

puffing up their bread with a great deale of bitter barme, which mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the bread both more unſavorie to the taſte, and unwholeſomer for ordinary uſe. The <hi>French</hi> Nation doth parallel, if not exceed any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world in good wholeſome light bread of divers ſorts; and yet never uſe any barme. Now the baking maketh or marreth the goodnes of bread: and that which is baked in an oven, not overheated, is of all others the beſt: the reſt, by reaſon of the inequality of the parts of bread ſo baked, then externall parts being burt, and the internall raw,<note place="margin">Third difference fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the age.</note> are not to be ranked with the former in goodneſſe.

And therefore, in that ſo abſolute and compendious forme of Prayer, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Saviour himſelfe, under the name of bread all other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries are comprehended.

               <p>Beſides, bread is that nouriſhment with which a man may longeſt ſubſiſt, and without loathing continue in the uſe thereof; whereas any other food, eſpecially long continued, will weary and tire us out, which bread doth not. And the preheminence of this food may alſo from hence appeare; that whereas fiſh and fleſh will in three or foure dayes putrifie, and ſend out an evill ſmell, bread, unleſſe it be ſalted, may well grow mouldy at the worſt, or dry; but never putrifie. By reaſon then of this prerogative,<note place="margin">Inconveniences of feeding more on fiſh and fleſh than bread.</note> I adviſe all thoſe who have a care of their health, at their meales to eate more bread than any other food. And ſuch as feed more freely on fiſh and fleſh, and eate leſſe bread, have not their fleſh ſo firme as thoſe who feed moſt on bread: beſides, that oftentimes their breath ſmelleth ſtrong. And for this ſame cauſe, fiſh being prone to putrefaction,<note place="margin">Bread to be uſed with Sommer fruits.</note> and very moiſt, require a more libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall allowance of bread than fleſh; and the moiſteſt fleſh, as veale, and lamb more than other. And this reaſon may alſo be a warrant for us to uſe bread with our Sommer fruits, cherries, plumbs, abricocks, &amp;c. Now beſides this moſt noble, and, of all others, moſt excellent and uſefull bread made of wheat, there is yet bread made of ſeverall ſorts of other graine, and firſt of barley, As for barley bread, although it be inferior to wheat, yet it is not to be deſpiſed: and, howſoever, it nouriſh not ſo much as bread made of Wheat; yet being made of good barley, it nouriſheth well, and looſeneth the body more than wheat bread.<note place="margin">

And this was the reaſon, why <note n="c" place="margin">Flavius Vopiſcus <hi>in eius vita.</hi>
                  </note> the Emperour <hi>Tacitus</hi> in his feaſts, above all other diſhes, uſed this herb moſt liberally. Cuſtome notwiſtanding hath now ſo farre prevailed, that to whet on the appetite, it is with oile and vineger uſed at the beginning of our meales; and unto it moſt commonly are added perſlie, and ſome other hot herbs, which doe well allay the coldneſſe and moiſture thereof. It hath beene received by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for an uncontrolled truth, that lettice hurteth the eye-ſight: but ſince neither <hi>Galen,</hi>

it is for them a moſt ſoveraine alimentary medicine) and that without addition of other things, which correct ſuch a quality,<note place="margin">It may ſafely be eaten as it is ordinarily uſed.</note> if any there were. And therefore being uſed, as commonly it is with oile, vineger, and ordinarily ſome hot herbs, as ſaid is, what hurt can there be in it? As for the oile, although it doe ſomewhat looſen and relax ſome weake and choice ſtomackes; yet is this by meanes of the tartneſſe and ſharpneſſe of the the vineger well corrected; and the oile alſo, being of a temperate heate, doth in ſome ſort correct the others cold quality: and of this temper, is the ſugar alſo, which is often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; howbeit in my opinion, a little ſalt, as the <hi>French</hi> uſe, would farre better correct any ſuperfluous moiſture, it correcting alſo any cold and crude quality.</p>

There be divers ſorts of theſe herbes which grow wilde, participating of the ſame qualities, yet, I thinke, ſcarce ſo cold, but rather inclining to ſome temperate heat, and prove more forcible againſt obſtructions; although not ſo pleaſing to the palat as thoſe which grow in gardens. Among theſe kinds, there is one moſt commonly taken notice of by the name of Dandelion, corrupted from the <hi>French, dent du Lion,</hi> or Lions tooth, and may well be uſed in all obſtructions of the liver, as the others, and in ſuch other caſes.</p>

                  </note> But a late writer rejecteth the uſe of them how curiouſly ſoever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared; and imputeth the raigning of many contumacious <hi>Fevers,</hi> and other diſeaſes in <hi>France,</hi> amongſt other cauſes, to the too frequent uſe of this unwholeſome fruit.</p>
               <p>There is yet another fruit called a melon, and with us commonly a muske-melon: the <hi>French</hi> call them <hi>Melons,</hi> and the Poitevins in <hi>France</hi> Poupon, from the <hi>Latine Pepo,</hi> which is thought, was only a great ripe cucumer. This is <hi>the beſt of the bunch,</hi> as is the Proverbe; howbeit in this our cold &amp; moiſt climat I hold them nothing worth. This fruit moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth very much, and is by many eſteemed to be cold in quality: but for my part, the ſweetnes of their taſte (and therefore by the <hi>French</hi> called ſugar melons) make me rather of opinion that they partake of ſom heat, or at the leaſt that they are temperate. <hi>Galen</hi> eſteemeth them far better than any of the former, as being of a more ſolid ſubſtance, &amp; nothing ſo mioſt. They ſtir up the appetit, provoke urine, and moiſten the body. They are pleaſant to the taſte, but are eaſily converted into choler, &amp; ſo produce both putrid <hi>Fevers,</hi> and the bloudy fluxe; as I have obſerved in <hi>France,</hi> where they abound; and therfore let our yong Gentlemen tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers take heed, leſt ſweet meate at length prove to have ſowre ſauce. They are to be eaten before meales, as many Sommer-fruits, and ſome counſel a cup of wine after them. But whither that wil not too ſpeedily carry thoſe crudities into the ſmall veines, may be queſtioned. The beſt grow in <hi>France, Italy</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and ſuch hot countries: and in <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Tours</hi> ſouthward. In and about <hi>Paris</hi> they are nothing ſo good, the ground being ſo forced by art, they growing, as it were on dung-hills. They may be diſcerned to be good by theſe properties following. Firſt if they be heavy, of a pleaſant ſmell; if they have thicke ſtalks, and the outward ſkinne greene; and withall they muſt have the inward pulpe firme without moiſture, and the ſeeds ſticking faſt to it. I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what the longer inſiſted upon this point, to acquaint travellers with the nature, uſe and danger of ſuch things as are not ſo common with us here at home.</p>

But here is a queſtion moved by a <note n="a" place="margin">Aleiſius Mundella <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 34.</note> learned late writer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good to eate bread with thoſe ſhort continuing fruits or no? He anſwereth, that if they bee uſed as Phyſicke, they are then to bee uſed without bread or any other food: but if uſed for food, then bread is to be eaten with them.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all theſe fruits we will firſt beginne with the Strawberry,<note place="margin">Of Strawberries.</note> although no fruit of any tree; yet becauſe of the affinity &amp; reſemblance of it to the fruit of ſome trees and ſhrubs, I follow other mens method. The antient <hi>Greekes,</hi> it ſeemeth, were ignorant of this plant, although <hi>Plinie</hi> mentioneth it, howbeit deceived in the deſcription thereof, while hee aſcribeth unto it five leaves,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20476:52"/>
which is the right <hi>Pentaphyllum</hi> or our ordinary Cingfoile.

They are of themſelves no enemy to the ſtomacke, unleſſe it be very moiſt and phlegmaticke. Their ſtilled water is very uſefull for all internall heates,<note place="margin">Straw berries with creame not to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily of every one uſed.</note> and to cleanſe the kidnies and urinary paſſages. In hot ſtomacks and like conſtitutions of body, they may ſafely be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with roſewater or the like. Some uſe them with creame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I adviſe weake, cold and phlegmaticke perſons beware. And yet this is a diſh wherein our Gentle-women doe much delight, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver not ſo agreeable to their conſtitution of body. Some uſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with a little claret wine and ſugar; which in ſuch conſtitutions is to be preferred before the former. The Strawberry is alſo accounted cordiall, for the which cauſe it may well be uſed in all cordiall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps; where cooling eſpecially is required. They are to bee eaten before other food; the which is in all theſe ſhort-laſting Summer-fruits to be obſerved.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of Raſpes or Fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boeſes.</note>There is yet another ſmall fruit, not much unlike the former ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in forme or operation, and in no ſmall requeſt both for food and phyſicke. And although ſome preferre the Strawberry before the Raſpe, yet is not this the judgement of all; this being accounted more cordiall than the Strawberry. And indeed the ſmell and taſte, me thinks, doe inſinuate no leſſe unto our ſenſes; which occaſioned moſt of the Apothecary ſhops of <hi>Germanie</hi> to be alwaies well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſirup of this ſimple, in imitation of that great <hi>Geſner,</hi> who had it in ſo high an admiration. And although it bee accounted as cooling as Strawberries; yet I incline rather to thinke it tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, if not inclining to ſome moderate heat. Howſoever, neither of theſe fruits nouriſh much, and moiſten apparently, their ſiccity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſmall. This fruit is alſo eſteemed good againſt the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mouth and tenſills, and fluxes of the belly.

This fleſh, as divers others, differeth according to age. Beefe that is young, indifferent fat, and a little corned, either of an oxe or Cow, is very good and wholeſome meate for any indifferent good ſtomacke, a ſavory nouriſhment, and with the which, the ſtomacke will long agree, without any loathing. It is beſt that exceedeth not two yeeres or three at moſt. Old Beefe, eſpecially long ſalted, is both harder of digeſtion, and ingendreth groſſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike humors, being no wiſe fit for choice weake ſtomackes, ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and ſuch as lead ſendentary lives. And therefore that which is called Steere or Heyfer-beefe is the beſt. Beſides, this is yet to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the younger the beefe be, the better it may bee roſted; and the older better to bee boiled. Very old tough leane beefe, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for ſtrong labouring people, that in a manner can turne Iron into nouriſhment; eſpecially Bull-beefe, which is the worſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                  </note> mans boldneſſe hath yet extended it ſelfe to ſtrange and prodigious diſhes. So that now we are not contented to feed on Sheep and Cattell, Hens and Capons, and other ſuch creatures uſefull for the maintaining of the life of man; and fit them for our tables: but prodigious gluttony hath now deviſed to feed upon the excrements of the earth, the ſlime and ſcum of the water, the ſuperfluity of the woods, and putrefaction of the ſea; to wit, to feed on frogs, ſnailes, muſhroms, and oiſters. And that this cuſtome hath beene very antient, may by <hi>Pliny</hi> appeare;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20476:65"/>
who writeth that they uſed to feed ſnailes in warrens, as they did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures. And it ſeemeth that ſuch creatures were at the firſt uſed either as Phyſicke, or in the defect and want of better food. And it ſeemeth that ſome antient Phyſitians uſed frogs in <hi>Conſumptions</hi> and waſting away of the bodie, as alſo in that oppilation of the pipes of the lungs called, <hi>iſthma.</hi> But this was never their meaning that they ſhould be either of them, or any other as an ordinary food, but rather Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, or at leaſt phyſicall food, <hi>alimentum medicamentoſum.</hi> But to ſpeake the very truth, both frogs and ſnailes are now adaies ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſed for wantonneſſe, and to pleaſe our curious palats, than for any neceſſity, or defect of other food. And thus are they ordinarily uſed in <hi>France,</hi> and ſome other countries, although yet not in fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent uſe with us; howbeit, one of theſe daies theſe diſhes may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as common as our new <hi>French</hi> faſhions of apparell. To enter upon a large diſcourſe of the nature, properties, and preparation of frogs, and the manner of uſing them, is not here my purpoſe; and therefore leave it to them that have more leiſure, and purpoſe to feed upon them. If any have a purpoſe to uſe them, let them beware of thoſe that are venomous. And my advice ſhall bee rather to abſtaine from ſuch things, wherein there may be either danger or doubt, and to make choice of that which is free from either, where there is ſuch choice and variety. And this I would have alſo underſtood concerning muſhroms (whereof ſome thing hath been ſaid already) and the like.

                  </note> antient <hi>Romans</hi> fed them in their warrens, ſo doe ſome even at this day feed them in their gardens. Now ſome are of opinion that Snailes are of a very nouriſhing faculty; and for this cauſe, our women doe often ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily indifferently exhibit them in <hi>Conſumptions</hi> of any kind whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; ſometimes in milke, and ſometimes in broth, even as their owne fancie leadeth them. But by the way, if Snailes be ſo nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I wonder why our Papiſts uſe them ſo ordinarily in the time of Lent, when as they will not allow ſo much as a bit of Porke or pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered beefe! They may well anſwer, they may as well be allowed as wine; and I thinke ſo too, and farre better, and nouriſh farre leſſe, and with leſſe ſpeed, I am ſure, than wine and divers other things they uſe. The reaſon why they are eſteemed of ſo alimentall or nouriſhing a nature, is by reaſon (ſay ſom) that in Winter they are able to ſuſtaine themſelves with their owne ſubſtance: and that for this ſame cauſe, <hi>Galen</hi> appointeth them in <hi>Hecticke Fevers</hi> and <hi>conſumptions.</hi> But the truth is, that theſe creatures, by reaſon of their viſcidity, and gluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tough ſubſtance, and the imbecillity and want of naturall hear, looſe little or nothing of this their tough and glutinous ſubſtance, and by conſequent need no reparation of the ſame. And as for the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them in <hi>Hecticke Fevers,</hi> it is rather by way of humectation and refrigeration, than for any ſtrong alimentall quality hee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth in them. <note n="*" place="margin">

Beſides, this is done without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of circumſtances, either of age, ſtrength, time of the diſeaſe, &amp;c. And therefore I leave it to the underſtanding and judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to judge, whether this be a legall and laudable courſe or no. And withall, let the judicious and ingenious Reader judge of the neceſſity and utility of handling the diet of the diſeaſed. Beſides all the former ſorts of diet, there hath a barbarous and inhumane cuſtome of killing and eating mans fleſh, not of late onely; but even many yeeres agoe, crept into the world; inſomuch that wee know for a truth, that now there are divers of thoſe <hi>Anthropophagi,</hi> or men-eaters in divers places of the world. And truely, I thinke, there is ſcare any among vs that would eaſily have beleeved, that any that bare ingraven the ſtamp and image of his Maker, could ever have harboured ſo barbarous a thought within his breaſt; farre leſſe to have acted ſo tragicall and inhumane a crueltie, unleſſe it had been by divers true hiſtories teſtified unto us, and related by word of mouth by thoſe, who, to their great griefe, have been ſpectators of ſo barbarous and inhumane a cruell cuſtome. The late hiſtories of ſuch as have travelled of late yeeres into thoſe parts of the Weſterne world doe evidently witneſſe the truth thereof. And it is yet further recorded, that in <note n="p" place="margin">Beyond the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of Loango are the Anziges, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elleſt Caniballs which the Sun ſeeketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.

I doubt not but that the very reading of theſe things will ſtrike a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine horror and amazement in the minds of many men, with an <hi>horreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co legens,</hi> when they conſider of the cuſtomes of theſe cruelleſt Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls of all others; and iuſtly ſo they may. But have we no ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Caniballs</hi> here at home among our ſelves? The law would take hold of ſo barbarous a fact. But if there be not as bad, if not worſe <hi>Cani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls</hi> among our ſelves, let the world judge. I could inſtance in many ſeveral ſorts of extortioners, and daily grinders of the faces of the poore, if this were a theme befitting my perſon &amp; profeſſion. But there is one particular kind, which not in my private opinion alone, but of many both of the moſt judicious and honeſt, hath beene alwayes accounted and reputed as horrible and cruell an oppreſſion, as any other whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; if not far crueller.

All fiſhes are of a cold and moiſt temperature, but ſome exceeding others in bounty, according to the nature of the water,<note place="margin">Diviſion of Fiſhes.</note> and places wherin they live.

That fiſh that liveth in a pure water, toſſed to and fro with waves, is better than that which hath leſſe agitation and motion, and liveth in a more muddy water. And ſuch as live moſt neare a rocky or ſandy ſhore, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than where there is much ſlime and mudde: and therefore were <hi>Piſces ſaxatiles,</hi> or rockie fiſh, for this cauſe ſo called, in ſo high an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme among antient Phyſitians. And ſo among freſh-water-fiſh ſuch as live moſt commonly in cleere, rockie or gravelly Rivers, and which are of a ſwift courſe, are the beſt, an of beſt nouriſhment. Such fiſh againe, as live in ſlimy and muddy waters, in the fens, marſhes, Ponds, Pools and motes, are nothing ſo good, nor yeeld any good and laudable nouriſhment to the body. And howſoever, Fiſh have beene in uſe and great eſteeme among the ancients, eſpecially the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſold at a very high rate; yet if wee compare their nouriſhment with that of fleſh, it is in many reſpects farre inferior to it; as not yeelding ſo wholeſome and laudable a nouriſhment to the body. And it is to bee alſo obſerved, that fiſh are greateſt enemies to cold the moiſt phlegmaticke bodies, and old age, eſpecially the moiſteſt and ſlimieſt. Now ſomething of ſome ſorts of fiſh.

will beginne with the <hi>Sturgeon,</hi> called of the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> as is ſuppoſed, <hi>Acipenſer</hi> and by ſome, the ſea-peacock, which was in ſo great requeſt among the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> that not onely was it ſerved in to the table with muſicall Pomp; but even they alſo who carried it in,<note place="margin">Sturgeon.</note> were to weare garlands on their heads. The <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is of a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good nouriſhing ſubſtance, if it be not too fat, which will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cloy the ſtomacke; and then take heed of ſurfetting with this diſh, which hath indangered ſome, and coſt ſome their life, for want of good take heed. We have it commonly brought to us barrelled up, from the Eaſterne countries, being commonly uſed at great feaſts: and then by reaſon of the ſalt and vineger, (although it pleaſe the palat) yet muſt it needs be of hard concoction, and ingender melancholie, and bad humors; being eſpecially mingled with ſo many ſeverall ſorts of food. The young <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is farre better, and of eaſier conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction than the old; but if thou be wiſe, eate as little of the fat of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as thou can. The belly of the <hi>Sturgeon</hi> is accounted the beſt.</p>

               <p>Vineger is a ſauce in no ſmall requeſt for ſeaſoning of meat. It is, as the word importeth, nothing elſe, but a ſowre wine, uſed both to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and to keepe meats, howbeit farr inferiour to ſalt. For, although it preſerve meat from putrefaction, yet will it not keepe it ſo a long time, unleſſe it be often renewed. That it is very dry, even as farre as the ſecond degree, is true; but as for the other qualities, <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, it is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20476:71"/>
compoſed of hot and cold. It is of a piercing nature, and apt to diſſolve hard ſtones, wherof <hi>Hannibal</hi> had a ſufficient proofe, while he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a paſſage into <hi>Italy</hi> thorow the <hi>Alps,</hi> in diſſolving the hard rocks by meanes of hot vineger, with the loſſe of one of his eyes. It is good to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate groſſe, tough and phlegmaticke humors; it is not ſo good for leane, cholericke and melancholick people; and the too frequent uſe of it is an enemy to the nervous parts, the ſtomacke, guts, the womb; as alſo the liver and lungs, and all the pectorall parts. Let women, ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, as think to make themſeves look leane and faire with the uſe thereof (young maids eſpecially) take heed what they doe, for feare of a late repentance.<note place="margin">Wine-vineger is the beſt &amp; moſt forcible.</note> Theſe ſtrong and forcible effects of vineger, are eſpecially to be underſtood of that which is made of good ſtrong wine; that which is made of our Beere or Ale, being farre inferior to the other, both in the one and th'other qualities; drying, I meane, and heating and cooling. And that of Wine differeth alſo, according to the nature and quality of the Wine whereof it is made; that of white Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more opening, and of claret more binding. Vineger ſtrongly reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth putrefaction; and therefore is good in the time of the plague of peſtilence, and other diſeaſes proceeding of putrefaction of humours, and ſtrengthneth the gums, and diſſolveth ſoft, phlegmatick and rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick tumors thereof. With the addition of ſome herbs we may make vineger participating of the like vertues, as of Roſes, Elder, and many others. That made of red Roſes with claret Wine vineger is very good, and moſt ſtrengthning for the ſtomack, &amp;c. Vineger made of Cider or Petry, is liker unto the nature of Verjuice made of Crabs, than to wine vineger.</p>

It is not to be too ſmall beaten, for feare of inflaming the blood, and other profitable humours of the body; it is ſafelier uſed in old age, than in younger people; for whom the too frequent uſe of it is exceeding hurtfull. And therefore it ought not to be ſo ordinarily,<note place="margin">Caution in the uſe of pepper.</note> without any conſideration had either to age or ſeaſon of the yeere, as it is, uſed of every one. Let youth therefore take heede how they uſe, too liberally, Veniſon ſo much peppered and ſalted in the Sommer-ſeaſon; and to mend the matter after, make it ſwimme in wine. It is thought, pepper heateth leſſe than other ſpices:<note place="margin">Whether pepper hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth leſſe than other ſpices, and how.</note> and this I doe not conceive, that other ſpices are indeed actually hotter; but by reaſon the heat of it is leſſe durable, and it is not of ſo terreſtrious a ſubſtance. And for this ſame cauſe, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, long Pepper, by reaſon of a more terreſtrious ſubſtance, and more durable heat, is accounted hotter, by reaſon of this durable, biting and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding heat. And this, I ſuppoſe, gave the vulgar occaſion to call Pepper hot in the mouth, and cold in the ſtomack. But let the dulleſt taſte try a ſmall quantity of Pepper, and I will appeale to his ſenſes, whether it be hot or cold; ſo that I ſhall need uſe no other argument to proove it.</p>

And although it be not ſo intenſe in heat as Pepper, I meane in the degree, yet heateth it more by reaſon of its terreſtrious ſubſtance. It is brought over unto us either dry, or elſe preſerved greene in ſirup: and it is ſometimes, yea, very often, preſerved after it commeth over, being firſt ſteeped and boiled in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which, notwithſtanding, yeeldeth much in goodneſſe to the former.

for a while very carefully looked into, and many ſumptuary lawes then made for this ſame end and purpoſe. And it is well obſerved, that before theſe lawes were made, that people was exceedingly given to exceſſe and riot: for the which cauſe, it was commanded that they ſhould dine and ſuppe, their doores ſtanding open, that thereby better notice might bee taken of their exceſſe, if any committed. And beſides, <hi>Gluttony</hi> was then come to that heighth, that many youths, to pleaſe their palates, and ſatisfie their greedy guts, did not onely ſell themſelves for ſlaves; but even abandoned their bodies to be in moſt beaſtly maner abuſed by thoſe who were addicted to this unaturall and unlawfull luſt. The firſt of theſe lawes was called <hi>Orchia,</hi> from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Orchius:</hi> and in it was ſet downe the number of the gueſts which were to be invited to any great meeting, the which number they ſhould not exceed. The next was that, called <hi>Fannia lex,</hi> made by the conſent of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> and the whole people of the City, and this limited the expences which might be ſpent at any feaſt, which to exceed, was not allowed. And afterwards followed that, call <hi>Lex Didia,</hi> extending the former Law, (which before was moſt injoin'd to be obſerved in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) to all <hi>Italy.</hi> And againe, adding this likewiſe, that not onely ſuch as invited their gueſts; but even the invited gueſts alſo themſelves ſhould be accounted tranſgreſſours, and breakers of this law. There followed yet another after, called <hi>Lex Licinia,</hi> appointing ſmaller prices, upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things they were before ſold for: but this was not in that eſteeme, as the former.</p>

And ſuch as will have but that care of themſelves that they have of their Hawkes, and many other creatures, to whom they will give no new food untill they have concocted the former; follow the advice of the Wiſe man, I live not to eat, but eat to the end I may live:</hi> and againe, the ſame Authour hath theſe words: <hi>The greedy deſire of ſuch gluttons, is like unto the deſire of the Divell, or of hell it ſelfe: for as Hell ſwallowes up many people, yet never is ſatisfied; yea, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſorry it cannot ſwallow more; for the which cauſe theſe helliſh miniſters leave no wind unſailed: even right ſo fareth it with Gluttons who are never ſatisfied, to whom it is ſaid,</hi> Agg. 1. <hi>You have eaten, and yet are not ſatisfied, to wit, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their diſorderly appetite, being diſpleaſed with themſelves, that they are able to devoure no more. And for this cauſe, they invent all the waies they can, to pleaſe their palates, both in the colour, taſte, ſmell, and in the various multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of meat and drinke. And hence commeth it to paſſe, ſaith Saint</hi> Bernard, <hi>that they double their great diſhes, upon the which, being totally intent, they can
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20476:77"/>
keepe no meaſure in eating, &amp;c.</hi> Is not this then a great blurre and diſgrace to our Chriſtian profeſſion, that we ſhould be farre inferiour to ſo many heathen and meere morall men? But eſpecially, is this a time for riot and exceſſe; for chambering and wantonneſſe, when many of our neighbours and brethren by Chriſtian profeſſion, lie groaning in grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous affliction? The want of this ſympathiſing with the afflictions of the Church, is that which God reproacheth his own people, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.4. <hi>They drinke Wine in bowles, and ſtretch themſelves upon beds of yvorie; but no man remembred the afflictions of</hi> Ioſeph. And as at all times, ſo more eſpecially in the times of penury and ſcarcity, wee ought to be ſparing in our diet; and thoſe whom God hath inabled, ought to be the more helpfull to the poore; whoſe pinched bellies often would be glad of the ſcraps and crums, which fall from many a rich <hi>Gluttons</hi> table. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, I could wiſh, that many did not ſo profuſely ſpend upon unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures, and that onely for ſport and recreation, that which would fill the bellies of many a poore Chriſtian, who ſcarce can have a bit of browne bread to ſatisfie their hungry appetites, while their beaſts have abundance of the beſt. If any ſhall here againe reply, may not I doe with mine owne what I liſt? Let mee then be ſo bold againe, as to demand what is their owne? And if they will not, I will anſwer for them, that is, juſt nothing: they are but onely Stewards, put in truſt with their Maſters goods, the great God of heaven and earth, and there will come ſhortly (and how ſoone they know not) a meſſenger to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them of their Stewardſhip: <hi>thou maieſt be no longer Steward,</hi> and then if thou haſt been a good and faithfull Steward, and canſt make thy Maſter a true account, thou maieſt expect with comfort that <hi>Euge bone ſerve, Well done faithfull ſervant, enter into thy Maſters ioy:</hi> but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, let them looke to it. I will conclude with the words of the late alleged Author: <hi>Now, who ſo will not by all the former inconveniences and dangers be reclamed, neither by afflictions and troubles, nor yet by faire perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yet let this one thought and conſideration, what they ſhall be after death, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright them: for all Gluttons, and generally all ſinners and wicked people are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affraid of death, the which Gluttony, if not avoided, will inevitably haſten and further.</hi> I have ſomewhat the longer inſiſted upon this point, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this ſinne is ſo frequent in this Kingdome, which hath been there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by with our neigbours, the <hi>French,</hi> reproached, <hi>Les Anglois ſont grand man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geurs, Engliſh are great eaters.</hi> But wee have eaten more than enough, it is time wee now proceed to drinke.</p>

Some hot and dry bodies, may, perhaps, plead for ſome privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, who, of all others, are moſt to be excuſed, eſpecially, if they be not rheumaticke; and in ſuch a caſe, let not the drinke be too ſtrong. And as for antient people, and cold conſtitutions, who, perhaps, will take it ill to be abbridged of their morning draught; of wines, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadine, ſweet canary, and the like, with a toſt ſoked in them and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, are the beſt, and a cup of good wholeſome ale, with a toſt, ſome nutmegge and ſugar may be allowed. But the ordinary uſe of morning draughts, being indifferently of every one uſed, is not ſo good for the health of the body, whatſoever our toſt pots prate to the contrarie. And now I proceed to the next.</p>
               <p>In the next place it may be demanded,<note place="margin">Whether it be good to beginne our meale with a draught?</note> whether it be good to begin our meales, as likewiſe to end the ſame with a draught? As for the firſt, it hath beene by mani holden as an oracle to beginne the meale with drink; which was alſo held by the <note n="i" place="margin">Vt vites paenam, a potibus incipe coenam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Now, as in many other things, ſo in this particular alſo, can we ſet downe no certaine preciſe rule, which may fit every particular individuall conſtitution. But this, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my opinion, and of our Phyſitians of the beſt note, is the beſt for health, in ordinary conſtitutions, and the moſt part of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to beginne their meales with ſolid food.<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> And from this rule none is to be exempted, unleſſe ſome hot dry conſtitution; and in ſuch bodies, the pot may be waſhed, (as ſome uſe to ſay) or rather moiſtned before the meat be put into it; providing alwaies there be no pottage,<note place="margin">Beſt to beginne the meale with ſolid food</note>

or other liquid meats; in which caſe they may well ſupply the place of drinke.

And as concerning rheumaticke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I wiſh them to be ſparing both in the uſe of pottage and drinke; eſpecially when rheume is moſt buſie. And as for a cup of ſacke, it cannot be indifferently good for every one at the beginning of meales; but onely for feeble, phlegmaticke, cold and old conſtitutions, and that immediately before meales: for otherwiſe it may even hurt ſuch conſtitutions, eſpecially, if ſubject to any diſeaſes of the head and nerves:<note place="margin">Drinking of ſacke at the entry of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is not ordinarily of every one to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</note> as <hi>Epilepſie, Apoplexie, Palſie,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </note> Now by antient Authors it may appeare, that there were cups called after three ſeverall names uſed about that time: one was drunke in honour of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> called <hi>Olympius,</hi> or in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of all the gods: the ſecond was in honor of deified men, whom they called <hi>Heroes;</hi> ſuch as be our Popiſh canonized Saints: the third was in honor of <hi>Iupiter Saviour,</hi> called <hi>perfect,</hi> from the number of three, wherein is the beginning, the middle and the end. By ſome alſo this was called the cup of health or good lucke, which they dranke one to another: and by ſome alſo it was called the cup of their good ſpirit or God, which was uſed both at the beginning, and ending of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per before they roſe from table. And after this laſt cup was once drunk, then all the gueſts roſe, and all was taken away; as may by that ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious pranke plaied by <hi>Denis</hi> the tyrant appeare: <hi>who comming into the temple of</hi> Aeſculapius <hi>within the city of</hi> Syracuſe, <hi>where was the ſtatua, or image of</hi> Aeſculapius, <hi>with a table of pure gold ſtanding by it, tooke a cup full of wine, adding theſe words, I drinke to thee</hi> Aeſculapius, <hi>the cup of the good God or ſpirit, and with this word cauſed preſently carry away this golden table. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Indians it was called the cup of</hi> Tantalus. But now to the ſolution of the queſtion, whether is it better to cloſe our ſtomacke with meat or drinke? I anſwer, that for the generall, and for the moſt part, it is holden, that it is beſt to cloſe it up with meat; yet with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20476:79"/>
that ſuch as are hot and dry,<note place="margin">Who are allowe to drinke laſt at their meales.</note> and are troubled with thirſt may drinke a little at the latter end of their meale. And of ſuch is <hi>Celſus</hi> to be underſtood, when hee willeth us to cloſe up the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with a cup of cold water (a cuſtome I am ſure would not be very welcome to the Swill-bowles of our times) and that of <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> who in feare of fumes and hot vapors ariſing up, and fuming into the head, adviſeth us to uſe this water or elſe very thinne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh white wine. But there are many pleaſant aſtringent meanes which in ſuch caſes may better bee uſed; as namely, marmalad of quinces, of gooſe-berries, preſerved quinces, conſerve of barberries, of rasps, and many other ſuch things aſtrigent and acid in taſte. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, it is the beſt courſe ordinarily to cloſe the ſtomacke rather with meate than drinke, according to this verſe:
<q>
                     <l>Sit tibi poſtremus ſemper in ore cibus.</l>
                     <l>Let a morſell of meat be ever laſt in thy mouth.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Now the anſwer to the other queſtion, whether it bee good to drinke to bed-ward, or going to bed, is concluded to the negative,<note place="margin">Whether wee are to drinke going to bed. <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </note> that we are not at all to drinke at that ſeaſon, for feare of hindering concoction. But if the body be hot and dry, the ſtomacke eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and the partie thereunto accuſtomed, and ſometimes in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary great thirſt, heere ſomething is to bee yeelded to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: in which caſe it is good to be ſparing, and when concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is almoſt finiſhed, as foure or five houres after meales, a more liberall draught may then bee allowed. And this may likewiſe ſerve for an anſwer to that queſtion, whether one may drinke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt meales? So that I ſhall not need to make any repetion,<note place="margin">Not good to drinke betwixt meales.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this point. As for very aged people, of cold windy ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes, I ſhall not find fault with them, if they take a little draught of ſacke, or ſuch liquor at the end of their meale.</p>

                  </note> Writer confirmeth this ſame opinion by the authority of divers other writers, by valid and probable reaſons thereto perſwaded. The chiefe and principall reaſons are deſumed from the inbred principles of this element; as light, heat, agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mobiltie; which conſtitute and make the eſſence or being thereof: as alſo from the actions; as the manifold generative power, perſpicuity, raritie; the taſte alſo, bitter, ſalt and ſweet, &amp;c. Of the other quality of moiſture there is no controverſie. Now, concerning the drinking of water, wee are herein to conſider three things, the good quantity, the quality, and the order. The qualities of the beſt water have already largely beene deſcribed, and that among all waters, raine water was the beſt; and next unto it, the beſt ſpring water, or good river-water. In quantity, it muſt not exceed: for ſo it would hinder the concoction of the ſtomacke. And as for the order, it muſt be drunke, as is already in the generall directions of drinke ſet downe; little, and often at a meale. Vſed before meales, it moiſtneth much dry bodies, and cooleth more than ſacke, or any wine whatſoever, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20476:80"/>
to ſmall; and therefore fitter for hot and drie bodies, than wine or ſtrong drinke. Vſed after meales, it inhibiteth and hindereth the hot vaporous fumes of ſtrong drinke to aſcend into the braine; and ſo is ſaid to reſiſt drunkenneſſe: but I adviſe weake ſtomackes to looke unto themſelves, for feare of too much debilitation, proceeding from too much humectation. And howbeit in hot countries, their water, by reaſon of correction by the ſplendor of the Sunne-beames is accounted wholeſomer than ours; yet might ours be farre more uſed than it is, eſpecially by hot and dry bodies, eſpecially ſuch ſtomacks, and yonger people eſpecially: but this is the miſchiefe, that ſuch commonly powre downe moſt ſtrong drinke, by this meanes adding fewell to the fire, untill <hi>Fevers, inflammations,</hi> and ſuch furious diſeaſes, in the very Aprill of their age bring them to an untimely death. And the poorer ſort, I am ſure, might make more uſe of the ſame than ordinarily they doe; which would better become them than go a begging ſtrong drinke; or which is yet worſe, ſteale, to procure mony to buy it. And notwithſtanding this our nicity, I know ſom honourable and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ladies who drinke little other drinke; and yet injoy more perfect health than moſt of them that drinke of the ſtrongeſt. Two things do moſt deterre people from the uſe of this noble antient drinke, the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the crudity. As for the coldneſſe, howſoever it doth often actually to the palat appeare ſuch; yet have I ſhewed that there is no ſuch intenſe cooling quality here to be feared. The other is the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; which is indeed nothing elſe but the abundance of moiſture, wherewith it is indowed; and moſt offenſive to weake and moiſt ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes: and all is notwithſtanding ordinarily imputed to the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of water. Some to correct what they deeme amiſſe in water, uſe to adde ſome ſugar to it, and ſo thinke all is well amended, and is moſt practiſed by the female ſex. But this is no good correction: for of this they cannot be ignorant, and experience teacheth no leſſe, that ſweet things doe rather hurt than helpe a weake and tender ſtomacke. And beſides, Sugar being but temperately hot could adde but a little heat to ſuch a drinke, if it were as cold as is ſuppoſed. Againe, ſugar ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no drying quality aſcribed unto it; but rather a meane moiſture, it will rather adde to, than detract from this moiſt quality. But in my opinion, the beſt correction is by boiling it firſt, and then if thou wilt, adde thereunto a little hony or ſugar, and a little wine vineger (which well correcteth the moiſture, and joined with the other ſugar or hony, giveth it a pleaſant relliſh) thou maieſt make thee a pleaſant and wholeſome drinke.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the boiling of waters, there is a controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the quantity, or how much ſhould be boiled away;<note place="margin">Correcting of bad watersfirſt by boiling 2.

And as the new wines are not to be allowed for ordinary uſe; no more are the very old wines better to be liked of: for then they become farre hotter, ſharper, and ſometimes bitter alſo. As for the certaine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate time orange, when wine might ſafelieſt be drunke, no man can certainely determine, for ſome laſted twenty, ſome more, ſome fewer yeeres.<note place="margin">Very old wine.</note>

And it is to bee obſerved, that mingling grapes of divers colours, the wine becommeth of a mixt colour: as the white and red grape mingled together maketh a claret; and the more red grapes be in the mixture, the higher coloured is this claret; and the more white grapes, the paler coloured it is; approaching both to the colour and quality of white wine; as is to bee ſeene in that wine called from the colour of peach flowre, <hi>couleur du peſche.</hi> The fourth difference is taken from the taſte,<note place="margin">4 Difference from the taſte.</note> ſweet, ſowre, ſharpe or bitter.

my meaning is not of any artificiall ſmell procured by the wit and invention of the vintner, no more than that which already hath bin ſpoken concerning the ſubſtance, colour and taſte. Another difference may yet be deſumed from the ſoile, and the naturall temper of the aire where ſuch wines grow. And thus in one and the ſame country are ſo many ſeverall ſorts of wine to be ſeene, differing in goodneſſe one from another; and yet far more thoſe of one countrey from thoſe of another.

                  </note> a late writer, who hath contradicted this opinion, and would have them when they grow in yeeres, to uſe wine well diluted with water, and afterwards vvhen they are novv atteined to decrepit old age, to give them onely hony-vvater, or boiled vvater to drinke. But I thinke fevv that read this, but vvill thinke this too rigid; and ſo am I of their mind. His reaſon is becauſe (ſaith hee) hot ſtrong wine drunke in abundance hath need of a like proportion of naturall heat to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, otherwiſe it ſowreth in the ſtomacke, oppreſſerh naturall heat, ingendreth crudities, and proveth the cauſe of many noiſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth crudities. The chiefe hurt befalleth old age by the too liberall uſe of ſtrong hot vvines, in my opinion, is by way of ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ccation, their bodies howſoever repleniſhed with an accidentall and excrementiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture; yet the naturall <hi>Craſis</hi> and conſtitution of their bodies get, inclining to ſiccity. The exceſſe in the uſe of any ſort of wine I allow not of. But I ſee no ſound reaſon, why the moderate uſe of our Muſcadines, ſweet Canary ſackes; and ſweet nouriſhing red wines may not ſafely and to good purpoſe be allowed this age, which beſides the former benefits may likewiſe by their mild fumes and vapors ſo irrigate the braine, that it may procure them quiet and comfortable ſleepe to this age ſo acceptable. And by this moderate uſe I ſee not but it may likewiſe communicate a gentle warmth to all the parts of the body; although I am not of opinion this is the only uſe, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor ſeemeth to allege.</p>
               <p>And in the uſe of wine among the antients this is yet to be obſerved, that they were either to drinke this or water, there being no other in ordinary uſe among them; and therfore, wheras they allowed youth at the age of 22. to drinke wine, this is not a precept for us to practiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with ſo fit and wholeſome drink, and ſo appropriated and fitted for this climat, and our complexions; and the which may ſafely to any age or complexion be exhibited; and being in our owne power to make it weaker or ſtronger, there is no danger in the uſe of our ale or beere. And beſides, we muſt alſo withall conſider that in the hot ſeaſons of the yeere both wine, and other ſtrong drinkes muſt more ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly be uſed; but in colder ſeaſons we may be bolder. Now againe,<note place="margin">Wine either drunk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In antient times ſome added the water to the wine, and ſome againe wine to the water. Water was, and is uſed to be added
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20476:84"/>
unto wine, to allay and qualifie the heat and fumes thereof, and is more frequent in thoſe countries, where wine is their ordinary drinke. This mixture differeth according to the diverſitie of the natures, of the parties drinking, the wine drunke, together with the ſeverall times of drinking: all which points are learnedly and largely ſet downe by <note n="g" place="margin">Mercur. variar lect. libr. <hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> a famous <hi>Italian</hi> Phyſitian; and which were too long for mee here to inſiſt upon. But this I muſt advertiſe in briefe, that as young people, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, hot and cholericke conſtitutions, ought not to drinke wine; ſo if they doe at any time drinke thereof, they ought to delute, or mingle it with a greater quantity of water than others: and the like I wiſh to be underſtood of the heat of Sommer, when as both ſmaller drinke, and wine more deluted is beſt. Some in ſtead of ordinary ſpring water, uſe roſe water, and a little ſugar, which is not amiſſe: and the like may be practiſed with Strawberry, Sorrell, Succory, or Endive water. But to determine the quantity of water, which differeth according to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, is very hard: but the beſt will be for people to conſider of that proverbiall ſpeech, <hi>Every man is either a foole, or a Phyſitian.</hi> The meaning is, a man ſhould obſerve what beſt befitteth the ſtate of his owne body, and ſo accommodate all things accordingly. Many in hot countries where the wine groweth, ſometimes uſe wine ſo ſparingly, that they adde but a little quantity of wine to a great quantity of water; it may be not the fifth or ſixth part. But with us, where wine is not our naturall and ordinary drinke,<note place="margin">How we uſe to dilute or mingle our wine.</note> this deluting, or mixture of wine and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſo frequent; except ſometimes in Sommer, where often, and moſt commonly ſugar is alſo added thereunto, with ſome Borage flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, and a ſprig of Roſemary, which are not out of purpoſe; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, if the wine be any thing tart, or ſowriſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of the uſe of Sugar with wine.</note>And by the way I muſt here ſay ſomething concerning the uſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar with wines: It is a common cuſtome thorow this kingdome, to adde ſugar to all wine indifferently ſweet or ſowre, or whatſoever ſort. I doe not deny, but ſometimes, to helpe a tart taſte, or to inhibit the hot fumes of a vaporous or ſtrong ſacke, apt to flie up into the braines, a little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar helpeth well: but to uſe it indifferently, with all ſorts of wines, and without any conſideration of circumſtances whatſoever (which is the ordinary and common cuſtome) and that merely for wantonneſſe, and to ſatisfie their luſtfull deſires, I hold it not convenient. Our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations, who abound in all ſorts of wine, and moſt ſomewhat tartiſh in taſte, yet never uſe this addition of ſugar. And therefore, as I advertiſed already, ſo wiſh I all, eſpecially our women (apteſt in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to exceed) to uſe a moderation in the uſe of ſugar. As for wines thus to be mingled with water, they muſt be indifferent ſtrong, and withal, of an indifferent thinne ſubſtance. Wines of a groſſe and thick ſubſtance, are not thus to be mingled with water; but rather moderately and ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly drunke without any addition. And as for our <hi>Rheniſh</hi> and ſmall white wines, they need farre leſſe water than other ſtronger. <note n="h" place="margin">

                     <p>Divers differences in our drinke to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, from the adding or withdrawing of hoppe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, from the corne it is made of.</p>
                  </note> I will not deny; yet I am ſure, the drinke wee make is both wholeſome, and very agreeable to our nature; and beſides, is farre otherwiſe prepared, than that of antient times. Now, of this drinke, there are two ſorts, one bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed without hop, commonly called Ale; the other with hop, and commonly called Beere. In Beere then, as in wine, there are many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to be conſidered, where the firſt is taken from the corne it is made of; it being ſometimes made of one grane, ſometimes of another, and ſometimes of more granes mingled together: but with us, moſt commonly malt is made of barlie alone, which doth alſo with us heere moſt abound. Some doe alſo mingle ſome oats with this drinke, and ſo make it more cooling for Sommer, very quicke to the taſte, and wholeſome for the bodie; the oat being of it ſelfe a daintie, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and nouriſhing graine. Some to adde ſtrength to their Beere, eſpecially that called March-Beere, then brewed to laſt all the yeere, adde thereunto a few peaſe. In ſome places beyond ſeas, they make
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20476:85"/>
Beere of Wheaten malt: as in ſome places of <hi>Saxony</hi> and in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> which much needs be good: and wholeſome, if no errour in the making be commited.<note place="margin">Third difference fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the age.</note> Another difference againe is taken from the age and duration of this drinke: ſome being very new, ſome very old, and kept a long time. Very new drinke is very hurtfull for the health, ingendring both wind and crudities with obſtructions, and many diſeaſes from thence proceeding; as hath beene ſaid of new wine. That which is very long kept, muſt needs be ſtrong; as our March Beere, and ſome others; and yet are not ſo good for ordinary uſe, but rather now and then as phyſicke. The beſt and wholeſomeſt, is that of a middle age. A maine and principall difference is taken from the ſtrength, and is eſteemed by the proportion of the malt to the liquor:<note place="margin">Fourth from the ſtrength.</note> and this varieth much, according to ſeverall circumſtances; as the place where one liveth, the perſons who are to uſe it, the ſeaſon and time of the yeere, &amp;c. This nevertheleſſe is to be obſerved, that in Winter and cold weather, ſtrong drinke is more tolerable than in Sommer, and warme weather; and to old age, there is a greater liberty allowed, than for younger people. Another difference is taken from the ſubſtance, thick or thinne, and perſpicuous or cleare.<note place="margin">Fifth from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</note> Thicke and muddy drinke is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, and the mother of many diſeaſes: and that which is cleare, is beſt and wholeſomeſt; providing alwaies, that water be not too much maſter. Thicke beere ingendreth wind, all manner of obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the ſtone, ſtrangury, and many more dangerous diſeaſes. Againe, that difference taken from the taſte is not to be neglected; ſome being bitter,<note place="margin">Sixth from the taſte.</note> ſome ſweet, ſome ſowre, &amp;c. And this the age will often alter: for very new drinke, if much hopt, muſt needes be bitter: and very ſmall drinke, if long kept, eſpecially in Sommer, will grow ſowre. A meane is beſt, that it be not too bitter, too hot and heady, nor ſowre at all:<note place="margin">Seventh difference from the quantity of the hoppe.</note> and therefore another difference may be taken from the quantity of hoppe, that a due proportion thereof be obſerved; it being hot and dry in the ſecond degree, and ſometimes weaker, and ſometimes ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: and too bitter drinke is more phyſicall than is for our ordinary uſe fitting. The beſt courſe then is to let the hoppe rot in the drinke (as the vulgar people) before wee drinke it. There is another difference taken from the colour;<note place="margin">Eighth the colour.</note> ſome being of one, and ſome of another colour; ſome pale; ſome of a reddiſh, ſome of an amber colour, &amp;c. The higheſt coloured drinke is not alwaies the ſtrongeſt and wholeſomeſt. That which looketh of a pure tranſparent yellow amber colour, like a pure ſacke, is reputed the beſt. The beſt March beere, if well brewed, and no error committed, is often of this colour; and the goodneſſe of the malt whereof it is made, and the fewell wherewith it is dryed, maketh yet another difference,<note place="margin">Ninth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the malt.</note> and often altereth both the colour and taſte of the drinke. Straw is thought better than wood for drying of malt. In ſome places of this Iland, in the Northerne eſpecially, they dry their malt with ling, or heath, called there hadder, which maketh very good malt; ſome alſo uſe furres, or whins, as ſome call them; and ſome againe, broome. But ſtraw, and heath, or ling are the beſt; the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſubſtance of the fewell is, the worſe it is, there being the more danger of over-drying the malt, which may make both the drinke taſte
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20476:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worſe, and ſooke with too high a colour. The Barlie whereof the malt is made muſt be good and freſh, not light, lanke, or worme-eaten, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, &amp;c. And beſides, it muſt not be made of Barly too new, before it hath ſweat in the mow (as husbandmen uſe to ſpeake) and is alſo to be made in a convenient ſeaſon; I meane not in a hot ſeaſon of the yeere, and therefore commonly called in the countrie, <hi>cuckow malt.</hi> The laſt difference is taken from the water whereof the drinke is bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed; and the beſt, if it may be had, is to be preferred before the other,<note place="margin">10 From the water wherewith it is ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, and the fewell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it is boiled.</note> and in defect of the beſt, the next beſt is to be choſen. And what is the beſt we have already at large related: and we find here that many times our well water maketh the drinke looke of a higher colour than is ſutable to the ſtrength thereof. And to the water we may adde the fire wherewith it is boiled, which I thinke is beſt to be wood, and ſuch as we allowed of in making of malt. And yet I confeſſe good drinke is, and may be brewed with ſea-coale, as wee ſee in all the city of London: and the fewell is not ſo materiall here as in making of malt, where the ſmoake toucheth it immediately. Now all theſe differences, except that taken from the hop, are common both to ale and beere; the which in our Ale here is but little, and in the Northerne parts of this Iland is none at all. And becauſe the hop maketh ſome differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in theſe two drinkes, therefore it will be uſefull to ſay ſomthing thereof. Of the temperature of barley, a very wholeſome graine,<note place="margin">Hop and the vertues thereof.</note> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath beene ſaid already, and ſomething yet more ſhall bee ſaid hereafter. As for the hop it openeth the obſtructions of the liver, ſpleen, and kidnies, cleereth the blood, and cleanſeth choler, and therefore this drinke muſt needs be very wholeſome. But if there bee too much hop in it, or yet drinke very new, the hop will wrong the head,<note place="margin">Vertues of Beere.</note> by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up to it hot exhalations, and ſo procureth rheumes; and the bitterer the Beere is, the leſſe it nouriſheth.</p>
               <p>Ale againe is of a groſſer ſubſtance, and nouriſheth farre more;<note place="margin">Of Ale.</note> but is of a more oppilative and ſtopping faculty: and therefore ſuch as are obnoxious to obſtructions ought to bee ſparing in the uſe of this drinke. Such as are leane, and free of this feare, may freelier uſe it. And although hop added to beere would ſeeme to make it hotter than ale, yet when the ſtrength of it waſted, and not much diſcernible in the drinke, in regard of its penetration, and ſcowring away of choler, and the ale having a like quantity of malt in it, I thinke there will be but little or no difference in their heats. Howſoever both Ale and Beere are good wholeſome drinkes; the which if any one will deny, I will appeale to our owne experience: for where can you find ſtronger, healthfuller, and luſtier people, than in thoſe countries, where this drinke is moſt ordinarily uſed? And in this I dare be judged by <note n="a" place="margin">

many of the heathens were, not onely in ſhunning themſelves this vice; but by wholeſome lawes, ſuppreſſing the ſpreading of it abroad into the common-wealth. And no ſmall commendation was it for that great and potent <note n="p" place="margin">

But becauſe I purpoſe not to uncover my parents nakedneſſe, I leave this point, which I have onely touched occaſionally and by the way. Since then drunkenneſſe is ſo loathſome and deteſtable a ſinne, ſo hurtful both to the ſoule and body; leaving both liable to Gods curſe; ſo hatefull to God and man, and by which all Gods commandements are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; it being ſo great an enemie alſo to the common-wealth, and ſo great an enemy to the health of the body, is it not fit that ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould be condignely puniſhed?

I confeſſe indeed, we have good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome lawes enacted againſt drunkenneſſe, and I praiſe God for it: and withall my wiſh is, there were no neglect in the execution. I could likewiſe wiſh, that the ſuperfluous number of Ale-houſes, the very nurſeries and upholders of this ſwiniſh ſinne did not ſo much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. It ſeemeth, that howſoever drunkenneſſe is no new-upſtart, yet in antient times people were not come to that height of brazen-faced impudency to bee drunke in the day time; but as it is a worke of darkeneſſe, ſo was it the cuſtome to be moſt uſed in the night-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as may by the Apoſtles ſpeech appeare: <note n="q" place="margin">1 Theſſ. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

hoſpitality and good houſe-keeping which heretofore hath been ſo common in this kingdome, I leave to the judicious reader to judge what they would ſay to ſuch a ſight. But if I ſhould proceed in this point, I ſhould loſe my ſelfe, and too much inlarge this diſcourſe. Onely this counſell I ſhall be bold to give to ſome that are moſt exorbitant, that wheras they are often ſo punctual in their points of precedency, and ſuch other things, as they ſuppoſe, concernes their credit, that they wil ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, rather than come ſhort an inch of their owne due, take an ell of another mans right: yet by ſuch carriage make themſelves baſe and contemptible in the face of their countrie; howſoeuer, ſome of their flattering claw-backe paraſites, and ſome others for ſome ſiniſter reſpects, may with cap and knee, ſeeme to honour and worſhip their worthleſſe greatneſſe.<note place="margin">Such as are betruſted with matters of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ought to be free from this fault.</note> Howſoever, my wiſh is, that ſuch as are betruſted with matters of juſtice, and have the overſight of Alehouſes, may be free from this fault, or elſe what reformation can wee looke for at their hands? As for his Majeſtie, he hath alwaies expreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his good affection for the ſuppreſſing of this and ſuch other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities: it remaineth therefore, that ſuch as he hath therewith betru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted this buſineſſe, be careful. Now, in many great cities &amp; corporations of this Kingdome there is often too much neglect even in this fame particular; and that often by reaſon of a meere relation unto and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance one upon another, every mans private ſo overſwaying him (quite contray to the <note n="g" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.24. Philip. 2.21.</note> Apoſtles golden rule, <hi>Seeke not every man his owne, but ſeeke yee one anothers good</hi>) that it is a hard matter to have juſtice executed as it ought. And in ſuch ſocieties there is a certaine triumiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat combination betwixt the Maſter, and the Baker, and Brewer (Innes and Alehouſes eſpecially I meane) having neere relation one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and indeede a mutuall dependencie one upon another. Some tradeſ-men againe, for feare of loſing ſome cuſtome, are contented to ſit ſtill, and keeping the formality of the place, and what credit may thereby unto themſelves accrue, goe on ſtill the old pack-horſe pace, leſt they ſhould be thought too ſtirring and pragmaticall. And by the way, I cannot but highly commend one laudable conſtitution of late yeeres made by this corporation: <hi>That no Victualler, or Innekeeper ſhould be elected Governor or Major of this corporation;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Laudable conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Towne of Northampton.</note> which hath alſo beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe twenty yeeres by-paſt inviolably obſerved. But my ſpeech is not here againſt the lawfull uſe of theſe ſo neceſſary places for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and comfort of travellers; my ſpeech is onely directed againſt blinde and unneceſſary Ale-houſes, which might well be ſpared; and others made to keepe the ſtatutes made to that end and purpoſe. I therefore earneſtly exhort all thoſe with whom God hath betruſted authority, and the ſword of Juſtice; that as they would avoid, and turn away Gods heavy judgements from themſelves, &amp; from the whole land; and as they will give a good account of their ſtewardſhip at that laſt and dreadfull day, they would be carefull to draw the ſword of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt both theſe active and paſsive offenders; the Drunkard, I meane, and the diſorderly Ale-houſe. And whereas by a laudable late law; there is a pecuniary mulct inflicted upon the Drunkard, I pray you robbe not the poore, but let the offender be puniſhed, and the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20476:90"/>
poore have his due. And as concerning Gods heavie Judgements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon great Princes, whole kingdomes and common-wealthes and many private perſons, by reaſon of this ſame, it were eaſie for me to compile a whole volume. But this I can ſay of mine owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that for the ſpace of about twenty yeeres at leaſt, ſince my firſt comming into this place, I have obſerved few of thoſe who kept ſuch tipling houſes, and died ſince that time I mentioned, ever attaine to the period of old age; and died for the moſt part of <hi>dropſies, conſumptions, palſies,</hi> or the like diſeaſes. My purpoſe is not here to enter upon a large diſcourſe againſt drunkenneſſe, the multiplicity of dehortatory arguments againſt it, being ſo various, ſo many, and handled by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, both prophane and divine Writers; what I have ſaid, is but by the way, being an abuſe of that good creature, wherof I have at great length ſet downe the right uſe, and therefore ſhortly and briefely have tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon it, and how hurtfull it is to the body (that being moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with moſt men) with a little touch of ſome other hurts. As for that forced kinde of drinking by meaſure (commonly called drinking of health) I thinke it a Satanicall invention, to rob men both of health and heaven. The multitude of ſtrong unanſwerable arguments, both againſt this and all maner of drunkenneſſe; as alſo the authorities, both divine and humane, Chriſtian &amp; heathen, lawes and conſtitutions, both civill and eccleſiaſticall, as they are many; ſo are they learnedly, and at great length ſet downe by a learned religious Gentleman,<note place="margin">W.

I anſwer, it may as well be demanded, whether wee may not ſinne, that ſome future good may thereon enſue, and I doubt not, but all ſound Divines will anſwer with a negative voice. And beſides, there is no benefit can this way be proved, but we may farre ſafelier, both for ſoule and body, effect it by other meanes.

Among the antients this part of Phyſicke hath ſcarce by any of ſet purpoſe been touched, but ſcatteringly here and there ſome few things have been ſaid concerning this ſubject. <note n="a" place="margin">

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is the firſt we read of, that ever ſet upon this buſineſſe, and wrote ſome thing concerning the diet of acute diſeaſes againſt the <hi>Guidian</hi> Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians of his time, above 2000. yeeres agoe, and which differed not a little from the diet uſed in our daies. And beſides, his witing is ſo ſhort and ſuccinct after his <hi>Laconicke</hi> manner, that they are not obvious to every vulgar underſtanding. Since his time I know not any that hath publiſhed any tractat concerning this ſubject, excepting onely one <note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the great commanded to put to death his Phyſitian <hi>Glaucias</hi> for allowing his favorite <hi>Hephaeſtion</hi> to drinke too much: or as ſome will have it, that ſeeing him drinke wine abundantly, he did not inhibite or hinder him.<note place="margin">Among the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>

Since therefore, this part of Phyſicke concerning the diet of the diſeaſed is ſo much neglected, what marveile, if diſeaſes prove ſo fierce and furious?

reaſon of their willingneſſe to be ordered by the Phyſitians preſcipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whereas the richer ſort often oppoſe them, deſiring commonly to be cured with ſlight and triviall medicines, not able to expell ſo ſtrong an enemy. And ſometimes this is againe occaſioned (ſaith <note n="f" place="margin">1 Meth.</note> he) by the aſſentation and indulgence of the Phyſitian, who will give them drinke as much as they deſire, let them drinke wine when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, and ſuffer them to doe whatſoever they liſt: and finally, in every thing carry themſelves in a ſlaviſh maner towards their patients, quite contrary to that which becommeth ſuch as are deſcended of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculapius,</hi> who ought to command his patients, as a Generall of an army commandeth his ſouldiers, or a King his ſubjects.<note place="margin">The office of the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian among the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients divided into three parts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently there were 3 ſorts of phyſicians, 1 <hi>Clinici.</hi> 2 <hi>Architectonici.</hi> 3 <hi>Pepaedeumeni.</hi> Ariſtot 3. <hi>polit.</hi>
                  </note> It is moreover to be obſerved, that among the antients, the office of the Phyſitian was divided into three parts, and by conſequence there were three ſorts of Phyſitians. The firſt were ſuch as aſſiſted the ſick obſerving all their actions, and ſeeing them obſerve the diet, and other things preſcribed by the chiefe Phyſitians, called <hi>Architectonici,</hi> (anſwerable to our rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Phyſitians) when they came at their accuſtomed houres to viſit them. The third ſort were called <hi>Pepaedeumeni,</hi> who taught this art in the ſchooles, and brought up others in the ſame profeſſion: to which are anſwerable the Doctors of the chaire in our Vniverſities. Now, ſuch as aſſiſted the ſicke, by reaſon they ſate by their bedſides, were called <hi>Clinici;</hi> and from thence this part of phyſicke handling the diet of the diſeaſed, was alſo called <hi>Clinice.</hi> The two later ſorts of Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, wee have here in our countries; but with the firſt ſort wee are not acquainted. And in truth this is a great defect,<note place="margin">The care of aſſiſting the ſicke moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly committed to women.</note> and the prejudice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by redounding to the publike not ſmall, for as much as this charge is moſt commonly committed to ignorant women, with us called nurſes, a people for the moſt part ſo wilfull, and wiſe in their owne eyes, and ſo ſelfe-conceited, that in ſtead of furthering the Phyſitian in his courſe, by keeping the patient ſtrictly to his preſcription, they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the readieſt to overthrow whatſoever they ordaine, unleſſe it pleaſe them very well. And many other women alſo (the judicious, diſcrete and better bred, I alwaies except) who take chiefely this charge upon them, are much of the ſame ſtamp.

                  <hi>Celſus</hi> wiſhed an able and underſtanding Phyſitian never to be farre from his patient. Of this ſame diet of the diſeaſed, my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is with the aid of the almighty to diſcourſe. Now, howſoever the matter of this diet be the ſame with that of healthfull people; yet the manner of preparation, uſe, and other circumſtances doe not a little differ, as hereafter ſhall more plainly appeare. And firſt, I will begin with the aire:</p>
               <p>As then the aire is that elemenr without the which, in health the life man of cannot ſubſiſt, and a ſweet, pure, temperate aire a great meanes to preſerve health: ſo is the aire, endued with the ſame laudable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties a great means to further the recovery of health already loſt. In ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therefore, it is a matter of no ſmall conſequence how the aire is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Now, as it will not of any be denied, but that the beſt aire is to be made choice of, ſo againe, all are not able to change their owne naturall aire; ſome for want of ability, and ſome in regard of the nature of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20476:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſeaſe. In acute diſeaſes (<hi>Fevers</hi> I meane, and ſuch diſeaſes as have <hi>Fevers</hi> for their continuall attendants; as <hi>Pleureſies, Squinancies, &amp;c.</hi>) it is not ſafe to tranſport the ſicke: In chronicall, and diſeaſes of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance; as <hi>dropſies, conſumptions, &amp;c.</hi> thou maieſt be bolder. The aire then is in a double reſpect to be conſidered, either as the common ambient,<note place="margin">The aire conſidered in a double reſpect.</note> or as it is included within ſome particular roomes. The aire, as the common ambient, which is of a laudable qualitie, neither too cold and piercing, nor too hot and foggy, if it be poſſible, and thy diſeaſe will permit, is to be made choice of. Now, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the beſt and moſt laudable aire, together with nature &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of ſeverall ſorts of winds, have beene heretofore at great length related. True is it indeed, that acute diſeaſes ſeldome ſuffer the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to remove his habitation, after he is once ceized with the ſame; for the which cauſe, we muſt uſe art to alter and correct the quality of the aire contrary to the diſeaſe,<note place="margin">In chronicall diſeaſes the aire is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for a better if it may be, but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in acute.</note> as wee ſhall ſhew anon. In chronicall and long lingering and continuing diſeaſes, ſuch as are <hi>dropſies, conſumptions, quartanes,</hi> and the like, one may eaſily exchange the place of his abode for a better. And that this was alſo the practice of the antient Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth by that of <note n="i" place="margin">6 Epidem.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plainly appeare, who wiſheth the ſicke in long continuing diſeaſes, to retire themſelves into another aire. And <note n="k" place="margin">5 Math med.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe, ſent ſuch as were ſicke of <hi>conſumptions,</hi> by meanes of ulcerate lungs, to a place not farre from <hi>Rome,</hi> called <hi>Tabiae,</hi> being a pretty high place, where was a pure dry aire, the which is even at this time alſo much frequented by ſuch diſeaſed people. And for this ſame cauſe in <hi>Plinies</hi> time,<note place="margin">Cuſtome with us to ſend the ſick into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other aire.</note> many, upon the ſame occaſion ſailed into <hi>Egypt.</hi> The like cuſtome in theſe our countries wee likewiſe obſerve, to ſend the ſicke either into a better aire, or elſe into his owne native ſoile.<note place="margin">Qualities of the aire whither one is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himſelfe.</note> Now, the aire whither they are to retire, ought to be a pure, ſweet, and freſh aire, not infected with any noiſome and evill ſmells, nor yet neer any fennes, and ſtanding pooles. But before I proceed, I muſt needs give an aduertiſment to the reader, concerning the place for burying of the dead, on the which, if I inſiſt a little, I muſt needes crave pardon, the matter being of ſome conſequence for the health of mankinde. I ſay then,<note place="margin">Inconvenience in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of dead bodies in the Church-yard.</note> that the inveterate cuſtome of burying the dead in Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, but eſpecially in Churches, proveth often very pernitious and hurtfull to the health of the living. And this inconvenience in popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous cities and townes, (eſpecially in the noble City of <hi>London</hi>) may not ſeldome be obſerved: and that in ſuch places principally, where the Church and Church-yard are ſo little, that often times new graves are digged for new gueſts, before the old inhabitants be quite metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed into their mother mold; the which how inconvenient it is, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially where the corps muſt ſtand unburied untill the ſermon be fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, let the unpartiall reader judge. Sure I am this great Church of All-ſaints, in this towne, was already this laſt Sommer ſo fraught ful of dead corps, that it was a hard matter to finde a place to digge a new grave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet ſince that time, how many have there beene buried, there are a many witneſſes. And ſo good Church men would many be after their death, who in their life time cared but little for comming at the Church aſſemblies; that if they be of any ranke or means, they muſt

But they will finde I warrant them, that they reckoned without their hoſt. And that this is not mine owne private opinion, it may appeare that it was accounted a matter of policy, not to bury within cities and townes; as may by a <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> learned late Writer, who proves that the dead ſhould be buried without cities and townes, and not in Churches; where are frequent aſſemblies and great concourſe of people, which he there proveth by divers arguments and reaſons. <hi>1.</hi> This is proved, ſaith he, by the continuall cuſtome of Gods owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who buried their dead not within townes and temples, but in the fields, as by the Patriarchs may appeare. And this is yet made more manifeſt by that place of S. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. where mention is made of the ſon of the widow of <hi>Nahum,</hi> who being dead, was carried out of the towne to be buried: upon which place, all the learned interpreters doe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that, not among the Jewes onely; but even among the Gentiles alſo, it was the cuſtome to bury their dead without their cities and townes. 2 Reaſon is taken from charity towards our neighbour, againſt which is this cuſtome of burying the dead in townes and temples, the health of the living by this meanes being hurt, and that by meanes of vapors and exhalations ariſing from theſe dead carkaſſes; and the which muſt needes exhale and riſe up in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, by how much more the place is cloſe, and warmed by the multitude of people. And that ſuch vapors and exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (eſpecially if they proceed from bodies dead of the Plague) are venomous and contagious, our Phyſitians doe witneſſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this earth being thus embrued with thoſe venomous vapors, when it is moved, and caſt up to bury new bodies, muſt needs ſend out evill and venomous vapors to the living. The 3. reaſon is taken from the originall of this cuſtome, which was evill, and at firſt introduced by the Monks, Franciſcan Friers eſpecially, and that for their owne profit and gaine. And whereas God himſelfe affirmed to the people of the Jewes, that the very touching of a dead corps made them uncleane, and that the place where it was laid, was thereby polluted: yet, thoſe holy begging brothers hold that the ſepulchers are the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and purer, the nearer they lye unto the high Altar, howſoever their churches have before beene conſecrated with their holy water. 4. The civill law it ſelfe condemneth this cuſtome; and to this purpoſe are there cited the words of a learned writer: that to prevent the ſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and noiſome ſmell proceeding from dead bodies, by our anceſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors ſepulchers were diviſed, not for the dead, but for the good of the living: for by reaſon of this noiſome ſmell where dead bodies are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, therefore the Emperour <hi>Adrian</hi> inflicted a mulct or fine of forty crownes to bee taken of ſuch, as ſhould bury any dead body within a city or towne, the place likewiſe to be confiſcate, and the body like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be from thence removed; the magiſtrate permitting to be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe puniſhed. And the law of the 12 tables commanded likewiſe dead bodies to bee buried without the cities and townes. And ſome haue beene of that opinion, that no buriall place was to bee compared
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20476:94"/>
with that of the open fields whereas graſſe and flowers grow in great abundance. And 5. This is the laudable cuſtome of ſome common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths: as of Strasbourg, Nuremberge and Leipzig, whereas either very ſeldome, or never bury they any dead bodies in their Churches. Beſides, this ſame point concerning the buriall of the dead, among other things was thought a matter worth the reformation: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at this day they have ordinarily other convenient places deputed for the buriall of their dead. And if we will yet more narrowly looke into this buſineſſe, conſidering this is Gods houſe, the which, wee ought at leaſt to keepe as cleane and ſweet as thoſe of our owne ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abode; I thinke, we ſhall find it but a matter of equity. And I will yet appeale to any, whether they would have their owne houſes, eſpecially their parlours or roomes, where they are moſt frequently to be made places of burying the dead. And the Papiſts would yet make a man wonder more, who were ſo carefull and curious in contenting the outward ſenſes, that not onely would they pleaſe the eyes of the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with curious pictures and images, and by melodious muſicke of organs and other inſtruments of muſicke beſides vocall, give ſo good content to the eares that notwithſtanding, they were ſo careleſſe of this other ſenſe of ſmelling, that they would not ſpare to bury the dead even under the high Altar it ſelfe. But I thinke they may reply, there was another ſmell which did more affect them, to wit, that which did ſo much affect that <hi>Roman Emperour, Veſpaſian,</hi> the ſmell of gaine. And this pleaſant ſmell was that which firſt forged purgatory, indulgences, conſecrating of <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> Epiſcopall palles, and innumerable other things, ſent to Princes and great perſons, and ſold at a high rate: and this ſame bred firſt this burying in Churches, in S. <hi>Francis</hi> his habit, yea, caven hard by the high Altar; the which was little above 400 yeers agoe brought into the Church, whenas this begging brother-hood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to increaſe to a greater number than their almes and ordinary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance would well maintaine. But on this particular I will not dwell any longer, but wiſh that things might be ſo carried, as injury might be done to none: and withall, that a publike good might be alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before any private or perſonall reſpects: neither were it a hard matter for mee to anſwer whatſoever could be objected againſt this ſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20476:94"/>
laudable a cuſtome of burying the dead in ſome place ſet apart for this purpoſe in ſome out-part of Townes and Cities, or rather without the ſame.

Neither yet hath this Towne come ſhort of any in expreſſion of dutifull and loyall affection to their Princes, according to the poſſibility of their powers. My wiſh therefore is, that a mother in <hi>Iſrael</hi> may not decay, but ſome regard may be had to the re-eſtabliſhing of the former flouriſhing eſtate of this antient corporation. And this by no meanes, in my opinion, might ſooner be effected, than by ſetting up this antient trade of clothing againe: for this purpoſe it were a worthy worke,<note place="margin">Clothing wold make this corporation flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</note> and deſerving great commendation, if ſuch as have had their firſt being in this place, God having now made them his Stewards of a great ſubſtance, would helpe to uphold their aged, and weake decaying mother. And this were a pious worke (at leaſt in a large acceptation) and a part of that honour the childe oweth to an aged, and decayed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Remember that the very heathen held this tenent, that men were not only borne for themſelves, but that their common countrie claimed ſome intereſt in them. To incourage others in the proſecution of ſo laudable a worke,<note place="margin">Maſter <hi>Iohn Denbigh,</hi> one of the Aldermen of <hi>Northampton</hi> hath begun to ſet up clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> one Alderman of this ſame corporation, hath now of late broken the yce, and againe, like a good Patriot, minding the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good (whereof now moſt are unmindfull) hath at his owne coſt and charges, begunne to ſet a foot this laudable trade of clothing: the which, if well followed, and ſeconded by others, and neighbours in the country would further to ſet forward ſo laudable an enterprize; it would in a ſhort time, prove no ſmall benefit both to the towne and countrie; and by this meanes, many poore might well be ſet a worke, who now are forced either to begge their bread, or elſe labour hard at knitting ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, which will not furniſh them with browne bread to fill their hungry bellies, eſpecially in theſe hard pinching times: beſides, ſome other inconveniences on which I cannot ſpend time.

They ſuffer no ſtraggling beggers among them, and why may wee not as well? Another thing there is, which would much further and advance this buſineſſe, and prove beneficiall, not to this corporation alone, but to other market townes alſo: to wit, <hi>Owndel, Thrapſtone,</hi> and <hi>Waldenborrow,</hi> together with the whole adjacent country, and other neighboring ſhires: and this is by making the river of <hi>Nine</hi> navigable from <hi>Peterborrow</hi> to <hi>Northampton.</hi> Now, let every one ſeriouſly conſider the need, and they ſhall find more than enough; if it were but even in regard of the ſcarcity and decay of fewell in this Weſterne part of the ſhire, beſides many other bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits would from thence ariſe: as preſerving the high-waies (now chargeable to the countrie in regard of much carriage by cart) keeping

And yet it is thoght by many that the head can never be ſufficiently coverd. I confeſſe, in this caſe it is hard to ſet down and determine all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumſtances; as of the time of the yeer, the ſex, the nature of the diſeaſe, the age and conſtitution of the diſeaſed, according to which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20476:98"/>

There is a great difference to bee had both in our clothing and diet, according to the ſeverall ſeaſons of the yeere.<note place="margin">Difference of clothes according to the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</note> The apparell in Sommer and warme weather, ought to be thinner than in Winter; and among theſe, the hotter conſtitutions ought to goe thinlier clothed than others. And as on their body, ſo on their bed the clothes ought to be thinner. But few, if any, obſerve the difference to bee obſerved of the beds they lye on; it being for an uncontrolled cuſtome received, both for young and old, hot and cold complexions, to lye both Sommer and Winter on the ſofteſt feather-beds they can.<note place="margin">Downe and feather-beds hurtfull for hot livers, kidnies, and the ſtone.</note> And yet for hot conſtitutions, eſpecially the younger ſorts, and ſuch as have hot livers and kidnies, and moleſted with the ſtone in the kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, eſpecially in the Summer time, this cuſtome cannot but be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And as for this covering of the head, as it is indifferently uſed, alike in Sommer and Winter, of young and old, and all complexions whatſoever, I hold it a very pernicious cuſtome, eſpecially in the younger ſort, and very prejudiciall to their health.<note place="margin">Parents much to bee blamed for the toe too nice and tender education of their children.</note> It is a great fault in many parents, that they are too carefull in the nice and choice ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der educating of their infants, who in their tender yeeres might be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily accuſtomed to goe thinner in their apparell; and cuſtome would afterwards make this eaſy.

Long and thicke haire keepeth in fuliginous excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the head, and ſuffereth them not ſo well to breath out of the pores; from whence rheumes are ingendred, the originall almoſt of all diſeaſes. Hence was it that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> painted <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> bald; thereby ſignifying thus much, that the haire was to be cut ſhort; yea, if it were even ſhaven, it were better for a mans health than to weare long haire. It is therefore beſt in all diſeaſes of the head, eſpecially in long continuing defluxions of ſharpe rheumes, to ſhave the head, according to the opinion of antient and late Phyſitians. In a word, it is better both in ſickeneſſe and in health to have the haire rather ſhort than long; howbeit the too often cutting of the haire is not ſo good, and the often ſhaving of the beard and face is evill, and not to be uſed. I enter not here upon particulars, in what diſeaſes the haire is chiefely to be cut, yea even ſhaven; whereof ſomething may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps more largely be ſpoken in any another place.<note place="margin">Effoeminate cuſtom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But theſe, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more of their pranks are better knowne to the Chriſtian world than I can relate them. My purpoſe is onely here to let the world know, how ſenſleſſe and abſurd is this ſuperſtitious kind of abſtinence from fleſh onely, whereof like proud <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they make ſo great an oſtentation, and would put out the eyes of the world, that they ſhould ſee nothing in the cleere Sun-ſhine. And yet what is all this but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing of the antient hereſies lately mentioned? and renuing heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſuperſtition? Nay it doth plainely and evidently appeare, that the antient hereticks and heathens did farre ſurpaſſe in this point, many of our <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> If they would, as they pretend, ſubdue the luſt of the fleſh, why doe they not then abſtaine from wine, in that point farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing any fleſh, as hath been proved?

The <hi>Abiſsine Prieſts</hi> and religious perſons ſo ſtrictly obſerve their Lent faſt, that it is reported of them, that they eat nothing but roots, and drinke water during that time; yea, and ſtand often up to the chinne in cold water: and the Laity, during that time onely eate bread and drinke water. If our ſupercilious <hi>Phariſaicall Romaniſts</hi> would imitate this rigid auſterity, the Clergy I meane, it would coole their courages, yet withall purchaſe them a great deale of more praiſe and reputation, than many of them have hitherto attained unto. I am not ignorant, that ſome of the ſimpler ſort of their religious orders are more rigid and auſtere in their manner of living than many others: but this I confidently avouch, that for the moſt part, their Clergy, eſpecially the greater ſort, are as licentious and luxurious, as any ſort of people this day living under the face of heaven, upon which point I will not here digreſſe. Now to conclude this point of abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, we are ſo farre from rejecting, and far leſſe from finding fault with it, that we wiſh it in farre greater requeſt than hitherto it hath been: I meane, not onely that ordinary and cuſtomary abſtinence, or ſobrietie in meat and drinke, and other delights; but even that other ſort of faſt alſo, which we have wiſhed might bee more in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. But I hate and abhorre theſe counterfit and hypocriticall, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh and hereticall-like faſts of our <hi>Phariſaicall Romaniſts,</hi> with their many idle repetitions of their many <hi>mumpſimus</hi> upon their beads, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſhew of prayer, where there is nothing but a little lip-labour, without any true religion, or any true devotion indeed. But having ſaid more than I doubt I ſhall be thanked for, I leave this point, and proceed.</p>

                  <hi>Galen</hi> for our warrant: a thinne or ſlender, a full and liberall, and a meane or middle diet betwixt both. Now theſe two extremes have a great latitude and extenſion. In the firſt place, a thin and ſpare diet is either ſimply thinne and ſparing, more ſparing, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20476:103"/>
moſt ſparing of all. So againe, the like by way of oppoſition is to be underſtood of a full and liberall diet.<note place="margin">Abſolute thinne and ſpare diet.</note> Now an abſolute thinne and ſpare diet, called <hi>victus tenuiſsimus,</hi> is nothing elſe but an abſolute abſtinence from all manner of food whatſoever: or at moſt, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely the uſe of a drinke made of water and hony, called by the antient <hi>Greekes, melicratum.</hi> And this manner of abſtinence did the antients uſe in moſt acute diſeaſes, which were terminated on the fourth day. And when they did a little exceed this firſt ſo thinne and ſlender diet, or abſtinence, they did then allow the ſicke ſome barly-water, ptiſan or creame of ptiſan at moſt. This was uſuall among the <hi>Greekes,</hi> which ſtrict and rigid kind of diet the <hi>Arabians</hi> were not able to undergoe. And it may bee the <hi>Greekes,</hi>

But herein I would not that any one ſhould, at randome, let looſe the reines of his appetite, but carefully, and with good counſell regulate and moderate his deſires. We are in the next place to conſider the time of the yeere, howſoever, many may, perhaps, thinke it to ſmall purpoſe. But as in health this is to be obſerved, there muſt then be like correſpondency in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20476:105"/>
the time of ſickneſſe. And certaine it is, that in Winter, the internall heat of the ſtomacke, and inward parts, is farre intenſer, and greater than in Sommer, and the concoction eaſilier performed; and therefore no queſtion is to be made, but that the quantity of aliment muſt needs be anſwerable, and in greater abundance than in Sommer, when as by the heat of the ambient aire the internall is extracted, the pores of the body rarefied and dilated, and ſweat with fuliginous excrements more copiouſly expelled. And therefore a leſſer quantity of food, of a laudable quality and eaſie of digeſtion; as alſo a more liberall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of drinke is then to be permitted. And this was the opinion of <note n="d" place="margin">Aph. 18. libr. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and ſo hath beene held by all our Phyſitians, that in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wee are to feed moſt liberally, in Sommer very ſparingly, and in the Spring and Autumne, to keepe a meane, betwixt both the former, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever any ſay to the contrary.<note place="margin">8 The region where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one liveth.</note> The region wherein any one liveth, is likewiſe not to be neglected: for in cold countries, where people feed more plentifully, there the ſicke is to be allotted a more liberall allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,<note place="margin">9 The calling, or courſe of life.</note> than in hot countries: as <hi>Spaine, Egypt,</hi> and the like. And mee thinks, that beſides all the premiſſes, the calling, or courſe of life one leadeth is worth the conſideration: for the which cauſe, ſchollers, and others accuſtomed to a ſedentarie life in their health; as then their diet ought to be more ſparing and eaſier of concoction than for other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ſo falling ſicke, the like caution muſt be obſerved. And here women come alſo to be conſidered, who, for the moſt part uſe leſſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe than men, and have the pores of their bodie leſſe perſpirable, and often a colder complexion: and this is chiefely of the better ſort, who live in eaſe and idleneſſe, Influence and abundance of all things, to be underſtood. In the next place wee come to rules of diet deſumed from the diſeaſe it ſelfe, which was the ſecond head wee here propoſed to handle.<note place="margin">Rules, or indication deſumed from the diſeaſe it ſelfe.</note> And theſe rules muſt be underſtood by dividing them into their proper ranks, and muſt be illuſtrated by accommodating them to <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> few diſeaſes without a <hi>fever</hi> ceizing on the body of man; and therefore in this diſcourſe wee have of them a ſpeciall regard, though other diſeaſes alſo ſhall not be neglected.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F the three ſeverall ſorts of Diet fit for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed; to wit, a ſparing, ſlender, or thinne, a liberall or full, and a meane diet betwixt both, wee have already diſcourſed. Each of theſe diets is ſo called in relation to the ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which nouriſh ſparingly, liberally, or in a meane maner. Now, in each of theſe ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we are to conſider the ſubſtance, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, quality, the fit time for feeding the ſicke, the order, and the preparation, or manner of preparing the ſame.

The quantity or meaſure of the Diet of the diſeaſed, muſt be ordered according to the ſenſe and feeling of the ſicke, and nature of the diſeaſe, as <note n="c" place="margin">Lib. de veteri medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> well expreſſeth it. Now, it is not unknowne, that whole and ſicke folkes are not with alike quantity of food to be fed. And this by the practice in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> appeareth, where <note n="d" place="margin">

The next is the quality, which we are not to neglect, nor ſlightly to be paſt over. Healthfull and ſound people ought to uſe a diet like unto their owne temper and conſtitution: but the ſicke are to uſe a diet contrary to their diſeaſe. A hot diſtemper requireth a cooling diet, and reſt from motion. Neither are wee in the diet of the diſeaſed, onely to conſider the firſt qualities; as hot and cold, moiſture and drineſſe, but even the ſecond qualities alſo; as opening and aſtringent, &amp;c. If the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours be tough, then have they need of opening diet; as all manner of obſtructions: defluxions need aſtringent and ſtrengthening diet. As for the time of feeding the ſicke, as witneſſe <note n="g" place="margin">

                  <hi>Galen,</hi> it is very hard to define, and that in regard of the diverſity of <hi>fevers,</hi> requiring divers times for diet. In diſeaſes, wee may conſider a double time of feeding the ſicke, one of election, another of coaction, or neceſſity. That of election I call, when as the diſeaſe gives the ſicke ſome truce, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20476:106"/>
leaveth the ſicke ſometime free for food. That of neceſſitie and coacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when as for preſerving ſtrength, we are forced at uncertaine times to feed the ſicke.

And yet ſome would have the ſicke uſe variety of diſhes, eſpecially in a weake and queazie ſtomacke, that by taſting a little of every diſh, his weake ſtomacke might the better be whetted on. But if it be poſſible, and ſtrength ſubſiſt, the ſicke is not to be incited to ſuch variety,<note place="margin">Preparation of the diet varieth much.</note> for feare leſt he eat more than hee can well overcome. But in the diet of the diſeaſed, the preparation is not of ſmalleſt moment: as whether it be better roſted, boiled or baked, the which is, according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers circumſtances, varied, as wee ſhall heare more hereafter. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo ſauces are not unſeaſonable for the ſicke; and for this cauſe ſome Phyſitians have written tractats concerning this ſubject: and to ſpeake the truth, they are the fitteſt for the ſicke, to excite and ſtir up their weake and languiſhing ſtomacke, which often by all our art, wee can ſcarce indure to take ſo much ſuſtenance, as will ſupport their weake ſtrength for a few daies.

Among plants or vegetables, corne, and among corne, wheat, whereof the beſt and wholeſomeſt bread for the uſe of man is made, challengeth by right the firſt place. That bread then is beſt for the uſe of the ſick which is made of the beſt wheat,<note place="margin">Beſt bread for the uſe of the ſicke.</note> not fuſty, mildewd, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill quality; and withall made of new ground meale, which is better than long kept.

In our countries here we have a cuſtome to adde barme to our bread, which other countries, as <hi>France, Italie and Spaine,</hi> &amp;c. uſe not; and therefore I give warning, that this be ſparingly uſed in the ſickes bread, very bitter barme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially; which maketh both the bread unpleaſanter, and hotter in acute diſeaſes, and hot bodies.

                  <hi>Pliny</hi> affirmeth that wheat-bread being waſhed either in cold or warme water, is a very light food for the ſicke. Now they uſed to waſh their bread two manner of waies: either they ſoaked and ſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their bread in warme water, which they often ſhifted untill ſuch time as it had quite loſt all the taſte of leaven and ſalt: or elſe they grated and punned it ſmall, and ſo ſteeped it in faire water, and ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it through a cleane linnen cloth; by this meanes making a ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſolid from the ſubtileſt parts, which ſubtile thinne part they afterwards boiled untill it grew thicke. This waſhed bread both <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> uſed to coole in all kindes of <hi>Fevers.</hi> Wee uſe rather to waſh it in roſe-water, adding ſome ſugar and currants.<note place="margin">Our manner.</note> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it the cuſtome onely to ſteepe bread in water,<note place="margin">Bread ſoked in wine.</note> but in wine alſo; where they were free from any <hi>Fever.</hi> Wee uſe rathe to toſte bread at the fire, and ſo ſteepe it in wine,<note place="margin">In fleſh broth.</note> And that ſometimes alſo they mingled bread with freſh broth is apparent out of the ſame <note n="e" place="margin">Lib. de affection.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> There are alſo divers artificiall preparations of bread which may be uſefull in ſome diſeaſes:<note place="margin">Biſcuits and the like.</note> as biſcuits prepared with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ingredients; as yolkes of egges, anniſe and fennell and coriander ſeeds, with a little ſugar, and may be uſefull for weake ſtomakes, and rheumatik perſons. But becauſe few of our Gentle-women are ignorat of the preparation of theſe and the like,<note place="margin">March-panes.</note> I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon their preparation. Beſides theſe, there are divers ſorts of march-panes made, partly for ſuperfluity and adorning great feaſts, and great mens tables; and partly alſo ſometimes for phyſicall uſes: as in <hi>hecticke Fevers,</hi> and ſome pectorall diſeaſes, which here to particularize, is neither the particular place, nor my purpoſe. But before I finiſh this point concerning bread, I muſt advertiſe all diſeaſed people,<note place="margin">Vnleavened bread unwholeſome.</note> that ſince unleavened bread, as pycruſts, many ſorts of cakes and the like, are not ſo fit even for the uſe of healthfull people; how much more then are they unfit for the ſicke?

               <p>Now in the Diet of the Diſeaſed there is no ſmall uſe made of herbs,<note place="margin">Herbs uſefull in the Diet of the diſeaſed.</note> whereof we have ſpoken already.

Such fleſh is in a double manner adminſtred unto the ſicke; either in ſubſtance, boiled or roſted; or elſe their juice drawne out by decoction, called broth; or elſe expreſſed and ſtrained; called commonly colices or gelees: or, laſtly, diſtilled; and ſo called deſtilled reſtorative water of Capon, or any other fleſh.

But a queſtion may be here asked, whether fleſh be in diſeaſes a fit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient food.

But to know the new laid from old, ſtale and addle, wee muſt yet finde out ſome more markes. New laid Egges are commonly full, and the ſtale empty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the broder end, which is alſo the cauſe that ſtale and addle Egges ſwim in the water, when as the new laid fall to the bottome. Beſides, new laid Egges, betwixt thee and the light looke brighter and clearer than the ſtale and addle ones, which looke more darkly and obſcurely. Another ſigne is, that when it is opened, an old and ſtale Eg, the yolke eſpecially diſperſeth it ſelfe, whereas the new and freſh laid clingeth cloſe together. I have the longer inſiſted upon Egges, by reaſon it is ſo uſefull an aliment for the ſicke, and the vulgar is ſo poſſeſſed with a needleſſe feare of a ſuppoſed exceſſive heat in this food, and therefore thought good to remove all ſuch rubs.</p>

But if wee ſhall in even ſcales weigh both fleſh and fiſh, we ſhall finde that fleſh doth farre ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe fiſh in good and wholeſome nouriſhment, and that even by the teſtimony of <note n="f" place="margin">Lib. de affection.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf. Fiſh indeed, ſaith he, in the ſame place, are a light meat, both boiled and broiled, both by themſelves and with other meat. And yet they differ thus among themſelves: fiſh of ponds and pooles, the fatteſt eſpecially, as river fiſh alſo, are harder of digeſtion: but Sea, fiſh living neere the ſhore, are lighter; and eaſier of digeſtion: and among them againe,<note place="margin">Different nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which fiſh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord.</note> fiſh boiled are eaſier of digeſtion than roſted or broiled. And therefore in caſe of reſtoring ſtrength, feed the ſick with the former: but if thou wilt either keepe the ſicke at a low ebbe, or yet abate ſome of his ſtrength, feed him with the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20476:114"/>
latter, which are lighter and nouriſh leſſe. Fleſh therefore beeing wholeſomer than fiſh, yeelding a more laudable nouriſhment to the body, they are rather by way of permiſſion, to ſatisfie their languiſhing appetites, then otherwiſe allowed ſicke people; and that even in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>

But then if may in the next place bee demanded, what fiſh are beſt for the uſe of the ſicke? All fiſh are either bred in freſh waters or in the Sea. Sea-fiſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, are either ſuch as frequent the ſhore, called <hi>littorales:</hi> or elſe live moſt among rockes, called <hi>Piſces ſaxatiles;</hi> or elſe they live in the depth of the maine Ocean, callen therefore <hi>Pelagici.</hi>

                  <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in that hot coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie would have the drinke for the diſeaſed to be expoſed to the night aire, that ſo it might receive the morning dew, which might increaſe the coldneſſe thereof: but becauſe this procureth to it ſome acrimony, ſome would have other meanes tried; as ſalt-peter, ſnow, &amp;c.

But I would not have any ſuch extraordinary actuall frigidity by any ſuch meanes in this caſe procured, it being ſo prejudicial to heath, howſoever, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the firſt not ſo ſenſibly perceived. Now, in the exhibition of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the ſicke, two things are to be conſidered, the fit and convenient time when, and the quantity thereof. The time is either generall,<note place="margin">In the exhibiting of cold water, what things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</note> to wit, the courſe of the diſeaſe, or particular, the exacerbation or paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xyſme, which we call the fit.

                  <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſitians are of another minde, and would have us give ſtore of cold drink in the very beginning of the diſeaſe.

Water boiled is more ſubtill and of a more ſudden penetration,<note place="margin">Boiled water.</note> than crude as it commeth naturally out of the earth. The antients boiled it either with the heat of the Sunne, or of the fire. And the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian Kings</hi> were wont to boile their water at the he at of the Sunne, were it never ſo thinne and pure in it ſelfe. With us we have in uſe a double boiling of water: the one by the heat of

the fire in ordinary veſſells,<note place="margin">Diſtillation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Which of theſe two wayes is the beſt, we are now to inquire. Our Phyſitians are for diſtilled water, and muſt needes be the beſt. Indeed boiled water is to bee preferred before the crude, and is farre more familiar for the ſtomacke: but in this, diſtillation hath the preheminence,<note place="margin">Diſtilled waters to be preferred before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> that whereas by decoction many thinne parts are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporated, this is here avoided. And indeed by diſtillation all uncouth taſte, if any, is removed, and by reaſon of this refining and attenuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will alſo keep a long time without putrefaction. But this point is ſo cleere, that I ſhall not need to proſecute it any longer. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we are not accuſtomed to diſtill ordinary water, yet is it very frequent with us to diſtill waters out of ſimples of all ſorts, both hot and cold, whereof here to ſpeake is not now my purpoſe. Onely this one thing I adde, that whereas ſome object that waters diſtilled in ſtills made of metall, either are not ſo good by reaſon of ſome relicks of the mettall communicated unto them, or elſe have ſome ſmoakie or firie impreſſion left behind in theſe waters: I anſwere, the firſt feare is frivolous, and builded on a falſe foundation, and the other may by care and diligence be much prevented. But if any be ſo curious and fearefull, they may have their waters diſtilled <hi>per balneum Mariae,</hi> in glaſſe ſtills, if they will be at coſt. But it is the cuſtome of many people,<note place="margin">Needleſſe feare of ſom conceived in the uſe of diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> that they would fare well and pay little for it. Now before I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh this point, I muſt give warning to ſuch as attend the ſicke, that they doe not unſeaſonbly too much obtrude upon the ſicke theſe their warme drinks, or ſuppings, wherein women doe very much exceed, and many times quite debilitate and overthrow their weak ſtomacks. And this ſhall for this particular now ſuffice: as occaſion ſhall offer it ſelfe, I ſhall now and then touch upon ſome particular abuſes and failings in this kind; and now I proceed to ſome other drinks, and firſt concerning wine, and whether the ſicke may be ſuffered to drinke any.</p>

And in acute diſeaſes to none but ſuch as have manifeſt remiſsions, eſpecially in the night time, the halfe of the danger being in the night time, that is, hope of ſleepe to ſuch as ſhall then drinke. It muſt therefore be given onely with meate, neither after ſleepe, nor yet after any other drinke, that is onely taken when the diſeaſed is dry, and almoſt in the caſe of greateſt extremity, all hope almoſt now failing us.</hi> In ſuch places then where ſuch ſmal wines grow, as in the Ile of <hi>France</hi> about <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the countrey of <hi>Xantonge,</hi> eſpecially about <hi>Rochell,</hi>

It is not unknown that our cold moiſt climat bringeth not this noble liquor of the grape to any maturity or perfect ripeneſſe, ſo that whatſoever wine we uſe,<note place="margin">Accommodation to our climat.</note> we are beholden to our neighbour countries for it: beſides, that wine not being our naturall drinke in time of health, is neither in time of ſickeneſſe of us to be uſed, eſpecially in hot acute diſeaſes.

But God of his ſingular goodneſſe hath furniſhed us with a wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting our owne countrie and climat, which being alſo in ordinary uſe in time of health, may freely and without any danger be allowed the Diſeaſed in time of ſickneſſe, But becauſe in imitation of wine, this our northern wine (for ſo I may cal it) wee are likewiſe furniſhed with divers ſorts, differing in ſtrength one from another, we may, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the diſeaſe and conſtitution of the diſeaſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſicke ſuch as ſhall be thought moſt fitting.

Moſt of our ordinary people, in the country eſpecially, are perſwaded, that wine and ſtrong drinke will recover all diſeaſes whatſoever, bee they never ſo hot and acute. And a bottle of good wine is commonly the firſt phyſicke they ſend for to the next market towne.

But I heare nothing but words, their ſmoakie promiſes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeconded by anſwerable events, as I have already proved. But I wiſh people to be wiſe, and cautelous in the uſe of this or any other ſuch hot fiery liquor. Thoſe of whom this late alleaged Author made mention,<note place="margin">Srongwaters ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; warily to be uſed.</note> were Phyſitians, and of a good age, and no ſtrangers to the ſtate of their own bodies, and well able to judge what might beſt make for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their own healths, and ſo might find that benefit therby, which another might long ſeek, and at length, perhaps, for his labour,<note place="margin">For whom moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> find a late repentance. If it be uſefull for any, it is eſpecially for old and cold moiſt conſtitutions; and ſo no queſtion, moderatly uſed now and then, it may produce a marvellous good effect in ſpinning out of divers yeeres, the thred of mans life.

beſides, being once ſet a fire, it is quickly all waſted away. And ſuch a liquor would be uſed onely in extremity, in ſwounding, and the like, and then but a very ſmall quantity at a time. I deny not but it may be of good uſe alſo, which commeth ſomewhat ſhort of this abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: howſoever, I adviſe thee, as thou loveſt thy life and health, know well what water thou medleſt with, and eſpecially ſhunne ſuch ſtuffe as I have already diſclaimed.

This is likewiſe cautelouſly to be uſed, and eſpecially of cold phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticke conſtitutions, and in a cold and moiſt conſtitution of the aire. But ſtill beware of exceſſe, even in thoſe whom it beſt befitteth. There are yet an infinit other varieties of ſtrong waters, both ſimple and compounded,<note place="margin">Great variety of ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g waters.</note> deſtilled both with wine, ale and beere, and take the denomination from that ſimple or ſimples wherewith they are diſtilled: as <hi>Wormwood-water, Balme-water, Cinnamon-water</hi> and the like; and they reteine the vertue of the ſimples whereof they are diſtilled, whereof we have at large already diſcourſed. Some of theſe waters againe, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of many ſeverall ſimples; and take the denomination either from that which is moſt predominant; as the <hi>Theriacal-water:</hi> or elſe from the ſublime and extraordinary effects; as <hi>aqua coeleſtis, aqua mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis, &amp;c.</hi> and ſometimes from the Author alſo; as <hi>Doctor Stevens</hi> his water.<note place="margin">Great danger in the too frequent uſe of theſe ſublimate wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, eſpecially in the yonger ſort.</note> But whoſoever is too buſie, or bold with any of theſe hot waters in ordinary uſe, either for furthering concoction, or otherwiſe, ſhall at length finde them produce the like effect, as lime laid to the roots of trees; which howſoever it haſten the fruit for the preſent, yet killeth it the trees in a ſhort time. And this I have in ſome of my very good friends and patients often found too true; with whom I wiſh ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might have more prevailed than their owne diſorderly appetites. I have obſerved in ſome, who had theſe hot liquors in too frequent uſe, as they pretended, to warme their ſtomacks, that at length they came to this pitch, that whether they drunke any of theſe ſublimate waters, or the beſt ſacke or other wine whatſoever, they found no more heat in it than of a cup of cold water powred downe their throats. But this was not all the harme from thence enſuing, but was after accompanied with an extraordinary great diſtempered heat, both in the liver and kidnies; and in ſome an irrecoverable <hi>ſcirrbus</hi> in the liver, a diſpoſition to a dropſie, and in concluſion, an untimely death. I could eaſily, at great length, dilate and diſcourſe largely upon this one point, but that I haſten to the other matters which yet remaine to handle.</p>

And to this purpoſe it may either be beaten in a bagge, as wheat is commonly ordered for frumenty; or elſe, which is the cheaper and leſſe chargeable, provide a deep ſtone or wodden trough, wherein put a little quantity of rough barly with a little warme water, and then with a beetle with a long head for the purpoſe, beat it untill the husks come off: afterwards winnow it, ſtill rubbing it with thy hands, and then let it dry, and when thou wilt uſe it, waſh it in warme water, which thou maieſt ſhift untill it looke cleane and white, and colour the water no more. And this may with a ſmall labour, and I am ſure with leſſe charges, be made ready as often as need ſhall require. And this may be uſed whenſoever we need the uſe of barly, either for this we have ſpoken already, for broth, barly water, almond milke, or any like uſe. And thus they prepare it in the north parts of this kingdome, in all the kingdome of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in <hi>Ireland</hi> alſo, where they uſe much barly in their brothes, and for other uſes alſo; and yet never make uſe of any but this.<note place="margin">Orgemond, and what it is.</note> And beſides, in <hi>Scotland</hi> of this graine there is made a diſh, which they there call orgemond; and is made of barly thus prepared, together with milke and hony, and is anſwerable to our frumenty here; but in my opinion farre wholeſomer: and this is a diſh, at moſt of the country merry meetings in no ſmall eſteeme there among them.</p>

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20476:123"/>
ſaid already.

               <p>Beſides theſe drinkes made of barly,<note place="margin">Of emulſions or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond milke.</note> wee have yet amongſt us the frequent uſe of a drinke which was not uſed among the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, made of ſweet almonds in manner of a milke, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commonly called by the the name of <hi>Almond-milke.</hi> This milke is much uſed, in <hi>Fevers</hi> eſpecially,<note place="margin">In what caſes moſt uſefull.</note> and in pectorall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, being often alſo called by the name of emulſion. This drinke is ſometimes made of water and almonds alone without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny addition, and after ſweetned with ſugar; or elſe are boiled in the decoction many other ingredients. And howſoever Almonds bee in themſelves a little hot, or rather temperate, yet being prepared, and made into an emulſion after this manner, they qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and moderate the heat of the body, and withall doe cut and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuat tough and phlematicke humors in the breaſt,<note place="margin">The quantity of the Almonds muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is made thicke or thin, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the vulgar make it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly too thick and fulſome,</note> and further expectoration. And this emulſion ſerveth often in ſtead both of meat and drinke, and is often uſed, when as all other food is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. And I thinke it often with us, ſupplieth the roome of that <hi>Ptiſan</hi> ſo much and ſo often by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> commended; although wee have it alſo in uſe with us. But for the moſt part we uſe a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction made with barly, cooling herbes, raiſins of the ſunne ſtoned, and ſometimes in pectorall infirmities, a little licorice, and ſo make a decoction, whereof we make our almond milke. The barly may be of our ordinary barly without any other preparation,<note place="margin">The manner of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</note> ſave a little bruiſing. The almonds are to bee blanched in warme water, and cleanſed from their thinne skinnes (unleſſe in ſome looſeneſſe, where we require aſtriction) and then beaten in a ſtone morter with a wooden peſtell, the liquor by little and little added, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times ſqueezed out, untill all the milkie ſubſtance be expreſſed. And take heed the almonds be not too old, as being then too oilie; and withall let the liquor bee warme, when it is added to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20476:124"/>
muſt be cleanſed from their skums, and ſo mingled with the almonds ready blanched, and beaten with them, and the other ſeeds mingled and beaten without any other preparation: and of theſe greater ſeeds we mingle ſometimes a greater, and ſometimes a ſmaller quantitie, and ſo of the others,<note place="margin">Cautions to bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in emulſion.</note> as neceſſitie requireth.

It is alſo in the uſe of theſe emulſions to be obſerved, that they be neither too frequent, nor yet too fulſome or thicke of the almonds; and it is beſt after the expreſſion of the almonds, to give it a wame or two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fire, and then adde ſome roſe-water to it, if thou wilt.

If any acid thing, as juice or ſirup of lemmons or the like be added, it muſt onely bee added to the draught the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent takes at one time; otherwiſe it would quickly ſowre it all.

Of this milke <hi>Hippocrates</hi> maketh no mention, which may ſeeme ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſtrange. The beſt excuſe wee can for this pretend, is to ſay, that he regarded not ſo much in milke this alimentary power, as the abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty, in cleanſing the ulcers of the lungs. In goodneſſe of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment next to it is thought to Ewes milke by ſome,<note place="margin">Ewes milke. Goats milke. Cowes milke.

In abſterſion and cleanſing of the lungs, aſſes milke hath alwaies challenged the firſt place, and with us, next to it is goats milke, for camels milke wee cannot come by it. But of all others Cowes milke both in ſickeneſſe and in health with us is moſt uſuall and ordinary.

for aſſes milke it is thinner,<note place="margin">Commendation of aſſes milke.</note> more cooling and moiſtening than any of the other, and ingendreth no obſtructions, as other milke doth; and is therefore more phyſicall. And concerning this milke, this much upon mine owne experience I can teſtifie, that during my long ſickeneſſe in <hi>France,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> I found more benefit by a moneths uſe of this milke, than by all the other coolers I uſed: in ſo much that whereas before no drink could ſatiat my unſatiable drouth, I was with my mornings draught of this milke ſo refreſhed, that I little regarded any other drinke for all that day following. But becauſe cowes milke is with us in moſt frequent and common requeſt, wee will bend our ſpeech moſt to this kind of milke.<note place="margin">The beaſt from whence the milke is milked.</note> And becauſe the goodneſſe of the milke dependeth not a little upon the goodneſſe of the beaſt from whence it is milked, we are therefore to conſider the eſtate and diſpoſition of the creature. A browne womans milke is accounted the beſt, even in the judgement of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> The beaſt from whence milke is to bee milked, ought to be of an indifferent ſize of body, neither too fat or corpulent, nor yet too leane.<note place="margin">The colour.</note> And here the colour commeth alſo to bee conſidered. A blacke Cowes milke is by moſt eſteemed the beſt, howbeit ſome like as well of a red or kindled coloured, as they call it. Some againe eſteem browne beaſts milke the beſt, as being of a ſtrong conſtitution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But indeed none of theſe can come amiſſe, howbeit I thinke that of a blacke cow rather beſt than otherwiſe: but of white beaſts, the milke is worſt and weakeſt. The difference in the goodneſſe of the milke is likewiſe taken from the goodneſſe of the food the beaſt feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on.<note place="margin">The food on which it feedeth.</note> In the beginning of the Spring therefore, by reaſon the herbs are then moiſt and wateriſh, therefore the milke is then alſo thinner, and nouriſheth leſſe: it is better towards the latter end of the Spring and beginning of Sommer, and yet better in the midſt of Sommer. In Autume it is thicker,<note place="margin">In what time of the yeere beſt.</note> and nouriſheth farre more, although then, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in Winter, it is not ſo phyſicall. The worſt milke is that which is milkt from beaſts feeding on graines, in ſuch places where they brew much: as in ſome populous townes, where in the Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they feed their beaſts with graines; the which, although by this meanes it is more copious,<note place="margin">The place where the beaſt feedeth.</note> yet is it thinne, wateriſh, and of ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, as the beaſt likewiſe feeding on this food is the worſe.

Both theſe ſorts were prepared after a double manner; one without commixtion of any other ſubſtance, called a ſimple manner, and was thus prepared: the milke being very hot, they ſuddenly ſet within it another veſſell full of cold water, and ſo by this ſudden concurſe of hot and cold, was made this ſeparation.

It is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to be obſerved, that whey acquireth unto it ſelfe divers qualities according to the various preparations thereof: for that which is made
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20476:126"/>
with rennet is ſharper than that which is made without any addition of any other ſubſtance. That which is made with ſowre juices, as of lemmons and the like, is more cooling and pleaſing to the palat, and more appropriate, and fitting for hot and maligne diſeaſes; howbeit more hurtfull for any internall ulceration, or excoriation. Now,<note place="margin">The quantity or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> for the quantity, it muſt be meaſured according to the nature and conſtitution of the patient, obſerving alſo theſe cautions following: to wit,<note place="margin">Cautions to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the uſe.</note> that it be drunke blood-warme in a morning faſting. Some give above a pint, if for the qualifying of ſharpe humours; but if to purge, then about three pints, and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to almoſt two pints more. Wee follow rather the <hi>Arabians</hi> directions, who give it from halfe a pint to a wine quart and upwards; and this quantitie muſt be taken by degrees, not all at once, and the patient muſt walke a turne or two betwixt, as is the manner in drinking of minerall waters. And as did the antients,<note place="margin">Clarified whey.</note> ſo doe we likewiſe, often boile in our whey divers ſorts of ſimples, and with us is much uſed in the Sommer-time, for cooling and clearing the blood.

And as for our eating poſſets (although many country people are of opinion,<note place="margin">Eating poſſets uſed moſt for wantonnes.</note> that a poſſet, a cup of wine, or ſtrong water, will cure any diſeaſe) I adviſe the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20476:127"/>
ſicke altogether to abſteine from them. And to ſpeake the truth, in beſt health, they are uſed rather for wantonneſſe than need, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſuperfluous, being uſed eſpecially after a good meale, as they are often uſed after ſupper.<note place="margin">Beſt poſſet-drinke in in health.</note> In <hi>Scotland,</hi> the better ſort make their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet onely of milke and white wine, with a little ſugar and cinnamon, which they drinke, and give away the curd, which is the beſt way of uſing it, and leaſt hurtfull to health.</p>
               <p>Now, in milke, the next ſubſtance to be conſidered, is that which ſwimmeth upon the top, and is called the creame of the milke, or <hi>flos lactis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Butter, and the beſt uſe thereof.</note> which we commonly call butter, and uſe it for dreſſing of meat, and many other uſes, as in other countries they uſe oyle. It is a very wholeſome diſh for healthfull people, moderatly, and in due ſeaſon uſed; beſt in a morning, at the beginning of dinner, or at breakefaſt. If immoderatly and unſeaſonably uſed, it ſwimmeth on the top of other meats, hindreth concoction, fumeth up into the head, dulleth the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note place="margin">Whether it be uſefull for the ſicke, and how to be uſed.</note> and hurteth the eye-ſight. In ſicke folkes it is ſeldome to be uſed, eſpecially in a weake ſtomack, as it is moſt commonly: and their meat dreſſed with much butter oftentimes, ſo cloggeth their ſtomackes, that it maketh them altogether unfit for any other food, and eſpecially butter much boiled, as it is not good in health, ſo is it yet farre worſe for weake and ſicke people: and therefore I adviſe all thoſe who dreſſe the ſickes meat, to be very circumſpect in the uſe of butter.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Of cheeſe.</note>The third ſubſtance in milke, is the terreſtrious ſubſtance, which we commonly call cheeſe, and concerning this, it may be demanded, whether the ſicke may ſafely eat cheeſe,<note place="margin">Whether the ſicke may ſafely uſe cheeſe. <hi>Anſwer.</hi>
                  </note> or no? I anſwer, that in acute diſeaſes, where ſolid food is not allowed, farre leſſe are we to give way to this ſolid and terreſtrious ſubſtance. But in the declining of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, &amp; when the ſick beginneth now to feed more on ſolid food, if eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it be earneſtly deſired; and in chronicall diſeaſes, if the ſicke hath before bin accuſtomed to this food, then a little ſometimes, to ſatisfie a longing appetite, may be allowed: provided it be good cheeſe, made of unskimmed milke, neither too old, nor too new, and in a ſmall quantity. Others, I wiſh to be ſparing in the uſe of this aliment. In all manner of laskes and looſneſſes, the uſe of it is moſt ſafe, if there be no other impediment.<note place="margin">Cheeſe ſparingly to be uſed.</note> Old hard cheeſe is neither good in ſickneſſe nor in health; nor that which is made of too cleane skimmed milke, whereof I have ſeene ſome in <hi>Saxony</hi> which might well have ſerved in ſtead of chalke; and to mend the matter, was well ſeaſoned with blacke poppy ſeeds. And what good can any expect from the uſe of rotten putrified cheeſe, crawling full of maggots, ſo greedily, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome gluttons gaped after? Now, whereas I ſay, that too new cheeſe is not to be uſed, I doe not exclude the uſe of new cheeſe, after it is a little kept, as is the cuſtome in many places of this Kingdome, and none better than in <hi>Northampton ſhire,</hi> without any diſparagment to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places. And of ſuch cheeſes, I thinke, is hee to be underſtood, who wrote theſe <note n="k" place="margin">Baptiſta Pieria.</note> verſes following:

And therfore it is a good caveat which was included in this verſe following:
<q>

                        <hi>Caſeus eſt ſanus, quem dat avare manus.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And in making of cheeſe this caution is to be obſerved,<note place="margin">Caution in making of cheeſes:</note> that it taſte not too much of the rennet, which is nothing ſo pleaſant to the palat, and maketh the cheeſe hotter. And therfore the <hi>Italian Parmeſan</hi> cheeſe is for this cauſe in farre higher eſteeme, by reaſon they ſay it is made with thiſtles, only, without any rennet at all. As for ſtrong ſtomackes, and laboring people, with Oſtritch ſtomacks, which would overcome yron, and whoſe beſt meales are often made with cheeſe, theſe rules doe not ſo much concerne them.</p>
               <p>And now in generall, concerning the uſe of milke in healthfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I deny not, but for many people it is very ſoveraine good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome aliment, eſpecially for hot bodies, and in Sommer time, and ſo it moiſteneth very much, and may be corrected with ſugar or ſalt from curdling in the ſtomacke, or with ſome ſpear-mints put into it. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times milke ſowreth of ſelfe, eſpecially in the Sommertime;<note place="margin">Sowre milke.</note> and ſometimes it is alſo of purpoſe ſuffered to ſowre, and that for the <hi>ſerum</hi> or ſowre whey it aftewards yeeldeth, which is very pleaſing and uſefull for a hot and dry body, and exceeding good to quench thirſt, and allay the extremity of heat in any hot diſeaſe, being an eaſie and cheape drinke for the poorer ſort, eſpecially. This kinde of drinke is in very great requeſt in the Northerne parts of this Iland, where it is called of ſome whigge, and of others wigge. Butter-milke,<note place="margin">Whigge, or whegge. Butter milke.</note> which remaineth after the chirning, is cooler than other milke, yet not ſo good for nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments, and being a little ſowriſh, it is beſt for hot and dry bodies. For ſicke people, it is beſt to make with this milke a poſſet,<note place="margin">Butter milke. Poſſet drinke.</note> with a little white wine, which will be a very pleaſant and wholeſome drinke, the curd being ſeparated from the drinke. And it is to be obſerved, that that whey which is laſt preſt out of the cheeſe is the thickeſt, apteſt to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20476:128"/>
ingender obſtructions, and not ſo uſefull as that which is thinner. Milke is beſt, as we have ſaid, for hot &amp; dry bodies, and good ſtrong ſtomacks, and if uſed of moiſter and more phlegmaticke bodies (for whom it is not ſo good) it will be beſt to boile it, adding thereunto a little ſugar or ſome hony and ſalt,<note place="margin">When milke is to be eaten.</note> and a little powder of cinamon &amp; other ſpice. And it is alwaies beſt to eat milke by it ſelfe, a pretty diſtance from other food, and after the uſe of it, waſh well thy teeth &amp; gums with beere, wine, or vineger. As for the proverbiall ſpeech, <hi>If thou wilt live ever, waſh milke from thy liver,</hi> it is moſt abſurd and erronious; this being a meanes to make it curdle the ſooner,<note place="margin">Of white meats.</note> which is that wee labour here to avoid. But of milke are made many other diſhes, which wee commonly call white meats, whereof a word or two before wee conclude this point. White meat is not only here, but in many other places of Chriſtendome in very great uſe, and in no ſmall eſteeme among many; of all which, to ſpeake, were here too tedious. In generall then, all manner of white meats are apt to ingender obſtructions, to fill the body with groſſe, crude, and phlegmaticke humours: and therefore altogether unfit for weake ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes,<note place="margin">For whom unfit.</note> and ſuch as are ſubject to any kinde of obſtructions, either in the breſt or nether belly: and are worſt for old age, cold and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke conſtitutions, and all ſuch as lead a ſedentary life, although I ſhall hardly perſwade women that they receive any harme by the uſe of them. Of all other white meats, there is here with us one ſort of white meat made of milke and wheat,<note place="margin">Of frumenty.</note> called frumentie, in greateſt and moſt frequent requeſt, which is a ſtrong nouriſher, and therefore requireth a ſtrong ſtomacke, it being hard of concoction, and a great enemy to any oppilations, eſpecially if it be thickened with flowre, as moſt doe ordinarily uſe it; howbeit corrected with cinnamon or other ſpices, it is ſo much the better, and ſome adde alſo ſugar and currants, wherewith I can finde no fault.

Violent exerciſe in Sommer in the heat of the Sunne, heateth much, diſſolveth and melteth the humors, and procureth diſtillations: and where the braine aboundeth with humors, the head weake, and the ſtomacke ſtuffed with crudities, it occaſioneth ſometimes death, or at leaſt very dangerous diſeaſes. And in Winter exerciſes in the Sun, being violent, cauſe wearineſſe, inward impoſtumes, as <hi>pleureſies;</hi> in hot countries, I thinke eſpecially, ſuch as is <hi>Spaine,</hi> where this author lived. In the ſhade it is ſafer, yet ought it to be ſhorter in Sommer, and leſſe violent: but in Winter it may bee more violent. In the uſe of exerciſe, againe we are to conſider the perſons to be exerciſed: as whether men or women, young or old, weake or ſtrong: for according to theſe and other the like circumſtances, the manner of exerciſe muſt bee ordered and altered. The ſtrong may uſe ſtronger exerciſe than the weake; and the man other exerciſe than the woman: and againe, the ſame patient is to alter his exerciſe according to the ſeaſons of the yeere and other circumſtances. Children againe are not to uſe ſuch exerciſe as able young men; and old age muſt uſe ſuch exerciſe as becommeth that age.

Exerciſe of the body ſtanding upright, is more beneficiall, and eaſier; bending and ſtooping is more laborious and painfull: but circular motion or turning round is of all others the worſt, procuring giddineſſe and caſting, eſpecially where the body is thereunto moſt prone.

And therefore all ſuch members as have a free motion, and for ſome proper utility and uſe, ought to be exerciſed; as the lungs, breſt, armes, legges, &amp;c. But the head, becauſe it obtained not motion from any proper utility or profit, but onely to avoid dangers, therefore needeth it no exerciſe.

Great, loud, long, crying and ſinging, ſounding the trumpet, playing on pipes, and the like inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are hurtfull to ſchollers eſpecially, in that it attracteth the heat upwards.

But cleaving of wood, ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drawing of water, howbeit they exerciſe the armes and pectorall parts, yet communicate they not ſo much motion to the reſt of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as the former.

And yet, ſaith he, ſome there are, who thinke it a thing very abſurd and unſeemely at ſuch publike mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, to admit of any ſpeech of God, of divine matters, or a Chriſtian mans duty: howbeit, on the contrary they admit and allow of the free uſe of ſcoffing, flowting, of unſeemely jeſting, quips and ſatyricall tants, not only vaine, idle and ridiculous; but even oftentimes blaſphemous againſt God, and contumelious to our neighbors. But farre different from this was the cuſtome of our moſt wiſe Lord and Maſter</hi> IESVS CHRIST, <hi>who, as in the whole Evangelicall hiſtory may appeare, not onely in the Temple, in the Synagogues and other places; but even at table tooke all occaſions of giving good and wholſome precepts, not onely for leading an honeſt and civill life here among men, but even to atteine to eternall life alſo.

In the ſame place he mainteineth certaine hymnes and praiers, which did both proceed and follow theſe love-feaſts. And S.</hi> Chryſoſtome hath to this ſame purpoſe a worthy ſpeech, not to be paſt over in ſilence: <hi>Would to God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that both in the wine Tavern, at their merry meeting in their feaſts, in their hot-houſes, yea, and every where men would diſcourſe of hell-fire: for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remembring of hell, would prove a meanes to keep men out of hell. And for this ſame cauſe was hell made and threatned, that by the ſeare thereof being battered,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20476:133"/>
wee might not fall therein.</hi> Beſides theſe ordinary grave Philoſophicall and religious diſcoureſes during their meales, they had oftentimes alſo others, who, during their meales, read to them ſome antient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſome other memorable matters, as the ſame Author out of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny antient Writers, maketh it evidently appeare. And it is recorded of <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> the Emperour, that during dinner or ſupper, or elſe, after, either he himſelfe read ſomething, or elſe gave diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to others while they read. And of the ſame Emperour it is alſo recorded, that whenſoever hee dined or ſupped in private, then hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his company <hi>Vlpian,</hi> and other learned men, by whoſe lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſcourſes, hee confeſſed he was both refreſhed and fed. The like is alſo recorded of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, that during dinner and ſupper, hee had ſome hiſtories or exploits of antient <hi>Kings</hi> read unto him. And not onely the Chriſtians of the primitive Church, did in laudable imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of antiquity accommodate this cuſtome unto themſelves, in cauſing read ſome portions of holy Scriptures during meales; but is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cuſtomary in ſome Colleges of our Vniverſities. I will adde yet but a few words out of this ſame Author, they being ſo pertinent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I finiſh this point. <hi>Now, from theſe conviviall conferences, as well of our Saviour Chriſt, as of the Chriſtians of the primitive Church; how farr doth our table talke differ, daily experience ſufficiently doth teſtifie unto us. Their ſpeeches and conferences were grave, modeſt, chaſt, pious and religious: ours againe, are light, vaine and idle, filthy and obſcene, blaſphemous, contumelious and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to God and man. And it was a holy ſaying of the antient</hi> Hebrewes, <hi>that ſuch as in their feſtivall meetings had no talke of divine matters, were as if they had eaten of the ſacrifice of the dead. But on the contrary, ſuch as doe magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Word of God, his Law, his workes of divine wiſedome, upon thoſe reſteth the divine benediction, and are as if they had eaten at Gods owne Table. But now with us the cuſtome is farre contrary, many Chriſtians being of opinion, that all religious ſpeeches are then altogether out of ſeaſon, and if any one ſhall ſpeake any thing tending this way, hee ſhall be eſteemed an uncivll and unmannerly perſon. And now (alas, the greater is the pitty) our feaſts are ſo full of intemperance and gluttony, that if a man ſhould inſert any holy and pious ſpeech, it will be but as pearles caſt to Dogges and Swine.</hi> I need no comment to explaine theſe words; the text is plaine enough, and I leave the explication.</p>

I wiſh therefore that the ſicke (eſpecially in acute diſeaſes, <hi>fevers,</hi> and the like) be troubled, as little as may bee with any ſerious or weighty affaires, either ſtudies or others. I except alwaies the care of the ſoule, which is never unſeaſonable, which nevertheleſſe, I wiſh, it be not put off to the laſt, as is too common with the moſt part.

The nature therefore of phlebotomy is to draw indifferently any humor whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is conteined in the veines, not making any election of this or that particular; and although it draweth from the whole body, yet doth it draw immediatly from the next veines, and the part next adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it; and ſecundarily it doth evacuat the whole body. Now for our orderly proceeding in this particular, it being a matter of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are to conſider theſe five heads. 1. In what infirmities of the body, this generous remedy is to be uſed,<note place="margin">In phlebotomic five things to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> and the ſeverall kinds thereof. 2. What veines or arteries are to be opened. 3. What bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may beſt beare this remedy, or are not able. 4. How much wee may evacuate, how long, or how often this remedy may bee reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 5. The time, when it is to bee uſed. As for the firſt, we have already mentioned a double repletion in the body of man; one called <hi>Plethora,</hi> wherein we make uſe of phlebotomy; an other <hi>cacochymia,</hi> wherein we uſe purging medicines.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20476:138"/>
alſo a repletion or fulneſſe preſent <hi>actu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plethorie, actuall or potentiall.</note> actually in the whole body, or ſome part thereof; another <hi>poteſtate,</hi> onely in power, which is likely ſhortly to ceize upon the ſame: as when by the ſuppreſſion of any wonted evacuation of blood, we feare a fulneſſe in the whole body; or when as by the affluxe of ſome humor to ſom determinate part, we feare ſome inflammation, putrefaction or paine, &amp;c. Now phlebotomie doth evacuat this fulneſſe in the whole body, or any part thereof, either in any great diſeaſe already preſent, or yet imminent. A great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe I here underſtand, not onely that which by reaſon of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; as ſome great inflammation or would is eſteemed to be ſuch; but even in regard of the excellency of the part, and ſome malignitie of the diſeaſe: for a ſmall inflammation in ſome ignoble part of the body, although ariſing from the abundance of blood, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire phlebotomie or any other great remedy. In great plethoricall diſeaſes we are to uſe this remedy, eſpecially, if the ſtrength bee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, which is the chiefe indication to be regarded. And here we are to obſerve,<note place="margin">Indication of phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie.</note> that the indication of this evacuation is ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed from the diſeaſe it ſelfe: as in an exquiſite <hi>Tertian,</hi> we open a veine for eventilation, not for any great evacuation. Againe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the cauſe wee are often undoubtedly to uſe this remedy: as in the ſuppreſſion of the piles in men, and menſtruous fluxe in women; and ſometimes in <hi>dyſentericall</hi> and <hi>lientericall fluxes</hi> proceeding from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat of the liver.<note place="margin">The uſe and end of phlebotomy two-fold.</note> The uſe and end of phlebotomy is not alwaies one and the ſame: for the moſt part indeed, wee uſe it as a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt repletion, and then we uſe it for it ſelfe. Sometimes wee uſe it for an other end, when as we would bring ſome thing to paſſe, which without this cannot well bee effected: as, when in the beginning of any diſeaſe wee uſe this remedy for ventilation, or breathing of the blood, and not for any copious evacuation, that thereby concoction may the better be procured, putrefaction of the humors may bee inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, and all other remedies may more commodiouſly be exhibited. Of it ſelfe, and for its owne worke we uſe this remedy in a double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. Firſt, that this double repletion, of the which before, conſiſting either in the whole body, or in ſome part of the ſame, may be evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that the humor may bee diverted or turned backe from the part affected, or for preventing of a particular repletion. The humor is recalled or turned backe two waies: firſt, when as it hath a ſudden influxe upon any part, it being from thence againe pulled backe to the contrary part: and againe, if the influxe of the humor be without any force,<note place="margin">Phlebotomie three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> or this fulnes be <hi>partim in facto, partim in ſieri,</hi> or partly in being, and partly already bred, if it be then derived to the next place. Hence have we three ſorts of Phlebotomy,<note place="margin">Phlebotomia evacuant, revellem, &amp; derivans.</note> 
                  <hi>evacuans,</hi> or evacuating, <hi>revellens,</hi> or pulling backe, <hi>derivans,</hi> deriving or diverting, as it were turning aſide. That which evacuateth, doth either ſimply evacuat from the whole body, or elſe from ſome one determinate part onely; if the humor be inherent without any new affluxe.

Of theſe ſwinnes alſo, the one was afterwards a captaine in the Low-countries, and died afterwards at home in his bed: and the daughter was married to a gentleman of good meanes, and lived to be a mother of many children.</hi> By theſe and the like theſe fooliſh and idle objections are eaſily anſwered, and yet, ſure I am, many of thoſe poore people would be glad to injoy ſuch comforts as thoſe of the better ſort doe; Howbeit, I thinke, they would ſcarce exchange their condition with that of thoſe poore people, nor yet imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this laſt or the like example, howſoever the party ſped well.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T followeth now in order, that wee ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the veines to be opened in the body of man. Vnder this name, veine, wee underſtand, beſides the ordinary veines, the arteries alſo, which by antient Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were often opened for divers infirmities; the arteries have their originall from the great artery planted in the heart, and ſending branches thorow the whole body, filled with a pure, thin, ſubtile, and more refined blood than that of the veines, and full of the vitall ſpirits. Theſe arteries are not with us uſually opened, as they were in antient times, and that both in regard they are not ſo eaſily found, alſo for the difficultie in the ſolidation, there being danger of <hi>gangrene,</hi> or at leaſt of a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tumour, called <hi>ancuryſma,</hi> which are hard to be cured: of theſe therefore I will ſay no more.</p>
               <p>The liver is the fountain and wel-ſpring of blood, from whence by the veines, as it were ſo many pipes, it is conveied thorow the whole body.

And theſe veines are branches of the great truncke deſcendent of the great hollow veine. Many ignorant Surgeons doe indifferently often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times open the wrong veine in the foot in women, that in the outſide for the other in the inſide,<note place="margin">In phlebotomy a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> and ſo doe them wrong. In phlebotomy we are likewiſe to obſerve a rectitude, or anſwering of the place affected, to the place by which we evacuat, and this in revulſion is the beſt way, and giveth ſpeedieſt eaſe: as in a <hi>Pleuriſie,</hi> to open a veine in the arme of the ſame ſide; as if in the right ſide, the right arme; if in the left, the left arme. And <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe witneſſeth, that the parts of the body which have this relative ſituation, have likewiſe a great commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or ſympathy one with another: as likewiſe eruptions of blood proceeding from any part of the ſide affected, bring no ſmall profit; whereas that which proceedeth from the contrary ſide bringeth but ſmall benefit, or if otherwiſe, it is after a long time. But upon many other particulars concerning this point, and many other alterations concerning the veines to be opened, I thinke it not pertinent now to inſiſt. The manner of opening of the veine, and the orifice are not to bee paſſed over.<note place="margin">The manner of the ſection.</note> Now as for the manner of the ſection, it is of three ſorts: oblique or ſlopwiſe, when as wee reiterate this operation the ſame day, tranſverſe or overthwart, when as wee purpoſe no reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: downe-right, when we intend reiteration the next day.

and melancholicke, in Harveſt and Winter, and in ſtrong and able conſtitutions. And therefore in all diſeaſes proceeding from melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholicke or phlegmaticke blood, as in the <hi>Fever, quartane, quotidian, madneſſe</hi> proceeding from melancholy in the braine, <hi>Apoplexie, ſuppreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of menſtruous fluxes</hi> in women, we are to uſe a large and ample orifice,<note place="margin">A ſmaller orifice.</note> as likewiſe, when we are to make uſe of a plentifull evacuation. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againe, we are to make a ſmaller orifice, and that both to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent weakneſſe, to evacuat the thinneſt blood, and to avoid the dangers which might inſue upon immoderate evacuation. If the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty likewiſe prove unruly, as in <hi>Delirations</hi> or <hi>Phreneſies;</hi> or yet fall out in the night time, the ſame courſe is to be taken, and the ſicke to bee watched, leſt the opening againe of the orifice ſhould procure a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if not deadly evacuation.</p>

So then in the firſt place the temperature of the body hot, of a ſolid and firme ſubſtance, with large and ample veines, may ſuſtaine a large and ample evacuation: the contrary conſtitution either admitteth of a very ſmall, or no eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation at all. Againe, a hot and moiſt conſtitution of body, of a ſoft and thinne ſubſtance, and often induring great diſſipation, doth in no wiſe ſuſtaine any great evacuation. A temperature of body, hot and reaſonable dry, with large veines, will indure a more liberall evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than a body either cold and moiſt, or cold and dry; by reaſon that both theſe conſtitutions have but ſmall veines. And let this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies carefully be obſerved, that ſuch bodies as have ſmall veines and little blood, can ſpare but little, if any at all, of this ſo noble and neceſſary a humor. And for the moſt part in fat folkes the veines are ſmall: but if they be larger, they endure phlebotomy better than the former.<note place="margin">What age fitteſt for Phlebotomy, and what not.</note> Againe, ſeverall ages have their ſtrength and naturall vigor for the moſt part anſwerable. Middle and flouriſhing age is ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt commonly luſty and ſtrong, abounding both in blood and ſpirits, and by conſequent is more able to endure a more copious eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of blood. But old age, decrepit I meane, by reaſon of the defect thereof, is to be exempted from this evacuation. And children before 14. yeeres of age, although their ſtrength in the ſubſtance doe abound, yet by reaſon of their ſoft and tender bodies, and by meanes of much evacuation, endure a daily diſſipation, doe therefore either admit of little or no evacuation at all by phlebotomie; howbeit we take not alwaies our indication from the age, as hereafter ſhall appeare. Againe,<note place="margin">The ſexe.</note> we are to conſider the ſex, for men generally and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are for the moſt part better able to beate this evacuation than women, ſuch eſpecially as are of a thinne and foggy conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, with ſmall narrow veines.

And here cuſtome commeth alſo to be conſidered: for ſuch as are altogether unaccuſtomed to this evacuation, uſing a ſpare Diet, turmoiled with cares and troubles of mind, are leſſe able to endure this evacuation. The contrary is to be underſtood of ſuch as are thereunto accuſtomed,<note place="margin">Things contrary to nature doe inhibite evacuation.</note> and feed more liberally: Againe, things contrary to nature, in regard they overthrow the ſtrength, do inhibite this evacuation: as diſeaſes proceeding from crude and ill humours without repletion; as a <hi>Dropſie,</hi> or the like.

Beſides, it is not unknowne that ſome women cannot goe out their full time, unleſſe they make uſe of this remedy.

It is true indeed, the iſſue and event is not in the power of mortall man; and perhaps; ſometimes ſome have obſerved ſome ſiniſtrous accident to have in ſued the uſe of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, which may deterre others from the uſe of it. But by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we may reject the moſt laudable and uſefull evacuation in time of greateſt need, it not alwaies anſwering our expectation: I can, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, upon mine owne experience teſtifie, that ſome, to whom upon neceſſity,<note place="margin">In the Authors owne experience ſafe.</note> I adminiſtred this remedy, did afterwards confeſſe, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found more eaſie and ſpeedy labour, than after they had uſed both this and ſome other evacuating remedies, being likewiſe freed from divers accidents wherewith they had beene in former times after their delivery moleſted. Others, I make no doubt, can ſpeake as much <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon. </seg>5</label> upon their owne experience. Beſides, the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> alloweth women with childe, the uſe of ſtrong purging medicines in certaine moneths, which is yet, in my opinion, more dangerous, and not ſo in our power to ſtop when wee pleaſe: as for phlebotomy, it is alwaies in our owne power, according to our diſcretion, as we ſhall ſee neede require, to take more or leſſe, and to uſe reiteration, if wee ſhall not ſee it ſafe to take our full allowance at the firſt. But let no man here miſ-take my meaning, as though I would perſwade women,<note place="margin">This remedy not raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be attempted.</note> deſperately and unadviſedly to ruſh upon this noble remedy: nay, my meaning is ſo farre from this, that I wiſh them to be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and circumſpect in the uſe hereof, but when the caſe without it is dangerous, if not deſperate, then my counſell is, that they rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a lawfull warranted remedy, which, by the bleſſing of God, is in all likelyhood and probability like to doe them good, then to lie ſtill in the ditch and cry God helpe mee, and yet ſuffer none to put to their helping hand.

When nature therefore is ſtrong, then dare we boldly goe about that which the diſeaſe doth indicate: for nature it ſelfe being once ſet aworke by ſome auxiliary meanes, doth afterwards of it ſelfe perfect the reſt. The quantity then of evacuation of blood muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in quantity to that which aboundeth in the body, provided the ſtrength can beare it.<note place="margin">No certaine rule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the quantity can be ſet downe.</note> But becauſe there is no certaine rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtrength, neither doe wee aſſuredly know or fore-ſee divers circumſtances and accidents to inſue after; as of the conſtitution of the ambient aire, &amp;c. this quantity therefore muſt needs remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine. It being, notwithſtanding, in our power when wee open a veine, to take leſſe or more, according to our liking; therefore comparing the ſtrength with the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the body, by the proper ſignes of them both, it will not be very hard by an artificiall conjecture, to come very neere to the juſt quantity.<note place="margin">How to finde it out.</note> But if yet wee cannot ſo well bring our purpoſe to paſſe, it ſhall be the ſafer courſe to keepe within compaſſe, and reiterate the remedy another time, than ſtanding too much upon our preciſe quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, indanger the ſicke by diminution of ſtrength. Now, wee muſt alwaies meaſure the quantity of evacuation, by the quantity or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the cauſes requiring, and ſtrength tolerating the ſame. And from the mutuall compariſon of the diſeaſes requiring, and the ſtrength tolerating,<note place="margin">A triple quantity ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</note> this phlebotomy admitteth a three-fold difference: for there is one ſort of phlebotomy called great or perfect, evacuating all or the greateſt part of the matter of the diſeaſe; another profitable but imperfect, which detracting ſome part of it, leaveth a leſſer quantity
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20476:146"/>
behinde, which therefore nature may eaſily overcome: there is yet a third, ſo ſmall and little in quantity, that not only may it be called im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but being ſo ſmall, is alſo unprofitable, and no whit benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The like we may ſay concerning the ſtrength, which is either ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and in the heigth, in a meane declining from the former,<note place="margin">The ſtrength three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note> or weake and overthrowne: the firſt requireth perfect evacuation; the next, though imperfect, yet may prove profitable: the laſt admitteth either of a very ſmall, or no evacuation at all. The like diviſion may we likewiſe make of the diſeaſes. And if wee would ſafely proceed in our cure, this rule muſt alwaies be obſerved, that wee lay in even ſcales the greatneſſe of the diſeaſe with the meaſure of ſtrength. If the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be very great and dangerous,<note place="margin">When to uſe a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and plentifull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation, and when a leſſer.</note> accompanied with ſtrength anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, we are not to deferre a full and copious evacuation: if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be leſſe, yet with full ſtrength, a leſſer evacuation may prove pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, that the cure may be ſafe, although not ſo ſudden: for to uſe a plentiful evacuation at the firſt, is not alwaies ſo ſafe. Againe, if the ſtrength be but ſmall, yet not altogether proſtrate, meeting with a great violent diſeaſe, it will be beſt to divide this evacuation, and in the time interceding theſe two evacuations, before wee come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteration, to refreſh and cheriſh languiſhing nature. In acute diſeaſes,<note place="margin">Reiteration when to be uſed.</note> by reaſon of greater danger, wee may uſe a more plentifull evacuation, if ſtrength be not quite proſtrated: but if onely oppreſſed and langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, we are not to omit, but divide it, as hath beene ſaid, which wee commonly call phlebotomy, <hi>per</hi>

The antients, I find, were very laviſh in this kind of evacuation, and let them blood often, till they ſwounded; and yet is this no certaine rule how long they ſhould bleed, neither yet is it ſafe,<note place="margin">Swounding no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſigne of the quantity.</note> although both by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> in ſome caſes preſcribed; for neither are ſuch as fall into thoſe fainting fits, alwaies ſufficiently evacuated, neither yet will ſome ſwound, although they loſe a farre greater quantity of blood than the former.

And this is diligently to be obſerved of covetous or ignorant ſurgeons, either in the City or the country, many being often too ready to exceede the limits of reaſon; as little certainty is there to be found in the changing of the face &amp; eyes.<note place="margin">As little certainty by the change of the face and eyes.</note> And in the ſtreame or impetuoſity of the fluxe of blood, there is yet as

But if it be in thy option, no neceſsity compelling thee, make choice of the moſt temperate time. But if thou beeſt ſurprized with any acute or dangerous diſeaſe, whatſoever the ſeaſon be, take heed of dallying with thy diſeaſe: take counſell of a judicious and able Artiſt, and thou ſhalt finde, hee can accommodate his phyſicke to any ſeaſon.

                  <hi>Purgation therefore we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine to be an evacuation of humors abounding in quality, procured by the helpe of nature, together with the efficacy of the purging medicines adminiſtred by the Phyſitian, for the preſervation of health preſent, or recovering of health already loſt.</hi> In purgations properly ſo called two things are to be conſidered: firſt, that which is to be purged, and do principally indicate purgation: to wit, the humor abounding in quality, which we call <hi>cacochymia,</hi> and is of many ſorts. Againe, in purgation we are to conſider that which purgeth. Nature it ſelfe, or the expelling faculty purgeth, yet not ſimply in it ſelfe, but ſeconded and ſet forward by the power and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of the purging medicine, and exciting the expulſive faculty to purge away the ſuperfluous humor, either upwards by vomit, or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by dejection. Such purging medicines are of two ſorts, either ſuch as by a manifeſt quality evacuat any obvious humor: and ſuch are ordinary looſening herbes; as betes, mallowes, ſpinage, coleworts, and infinite others. Againe, there is another ſort of purging medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, properly ſo called, and by a proper name <hi>cathartica,</hi> and make peculiar choice of one or more certaine peculiar humors,<note place="margin">In purgation three things conſiderable.</note> called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>electiva purgantia.</hi> Now in purgations wee are to conſider three things: the firſt doth concerne the medicaments wherewith we purge. The ſecond, the manner or method how to uſe them. The third, the accidents following upon purgation, or ſuch things as are to be done
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:20476:157"/>
after the taking of a purgation. Purging medicines, as wee have ſaid already, are of two ſorts, either purging by manifeſt qualities, heat and cold,  without any diſtinction, any or all humors: or elſe one or more particular humors,<note place="margin">A ſpecificall quality in purging medicines</note> or from ſome particular part. Now although purging medicines by reaſon of heat, attract unto them peccant and no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>xious humors, yet that the attraction is of this or that particular humor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proceedeth from a ſpecifical quality, or from the whole ſubſtance. And yet ſuch medicines as together with this ſpecificall propertie partake of a greater heat, doe more forcibly and effectually attract the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated humor. Each purging medicine moſt commonly evacuateth one particular humor, ſometimes two, ſeldome three, and never all, unleſſe, either the medicine be ſo violent, or nature ſo weake, that it is not able to maſter them: and then it oftentimes worketh ſo violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">

In theſe purging me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines then foure things are to bee conſidered. Firſt, what hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor they are properly to purge, whether choler, phlegme, water or melancholy. Secondly, by what wayes they evacuate: for ſome purge upwards by vomit, and ſome downe-wards by dejection. Thirdly, from what parts principally: for ſome purge from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belly,<note place="margin">Purging medicines differ both in ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and by reaſon of the part to purge.</note> ſome from the liver, ſome from the head, &amp;c. Fourthly, after what manner: for ſome purge gently and mildly, ſome againe more forcibly and violently, and ſome keep a meane betwixt both. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, Caſsia,</hi> ſirup of <hi>Roſes</hi> purge gently: <hi>Rhubarb, Sene,</hi> and the like, keepe a meane: <hi>Scammonie, Colocynthis,</hi> ſtrongly. It were eaſie for me here to make an enumeration of variety of purging medicines appropriated to ſeverall humors. And although theſe medicines both weake and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger draw ſome from the more remote parts, ſome from the neerer; yet have ſome of them a neerer relation to one, and ſome to another part: as <hi>Colocynthis</hi> and <hi>Agaricke</hi> moſt effectually from the head, <hi>Rhubarb</hi> from the liver, <hi>Aloc</hi> from the ſtomacke, &amp;c. Theſe milde and gentle medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, by reaſon of their milde and eaſie evacuation, are rather refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to preparations than purges; theſe other being of a farre more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible power to attract and draw humors from the remote regions of the body. Notwithſtanding, the judicious Phyſitian can eaſily quicken them according to occaſions, with an addition of a ſmall quantity of the ſtronger;<note place="margin">Compou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d medicines</note> as likewiſe, with ſome of the milder medicines, blunt the edge of theſe ſtronger and more violent purgations. Of theſe ſimple purging medicines,<note place="margin">Their divers and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious formes.</note> divers compounded are made, and that in ſeverall formes; which are either taken inwardly by the mouth, or injected, and put up into the fundament: or elſe outwardly applied, by way of cataplaſme, ointment, &amp;c. Such as are aſſumed at the mouth, are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken either to worke upwards by vomit, or downewards by ſtoole; and are, according to their formes, divided into three ſeverall ſorts: ſome liquid, as <hi>potions</hi> made after divers manners; ſome, againe, ſolid, as <hi>pills, ſolid electuaries,</hi> or <hi>confections:</hi> ſome of a ſoſter, and as it were, of a middle ſubſtance, betwixt both; as our ordinary <hi>electuaries.</hi> In the fundament

I anſwer, this holdeth true of ſuch ſtrong purgations as were uſed in the time of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen:</hi> but in our milde and gentle purging medicines, there is no ſuch cauſe of feare, they being rather in ſtead of a preparation than of any ſtrong purgation: for the

which cauſe, being my ſelfe adminiſtred, they may ſafely be uſed of all ſorts of people, to looſen the belly, to expell the common excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the guts, and withall, to prepare the humour cauſing the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. And we may ſafely purge any body, although living now in health, and that by way of preventing the accumulation of humours, which in time might produce ſome diſeaſe. Hence appeareth the frivolous feare of many people,<note place="margin">Needleſſe and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous feare of the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people.</note> who being altogether ignorant of the true knowledge of this ſublime profeſſion, yet, with open mouth cry out there is poiſon in all our purgations: but the judicious are not ignorant with what caution and circumſpection the honeſt and able Artiſt, even in caſes of greateſt neceſſitie, and with what correction and preparation, and in how ſmall a quantity they make uſe of theſe ſtrong medicines, which, notwithſtanding, were in onely uſe among the antients, and yet many of theſe plantives themſelves will often in their need, ſooner have recourſe to ſome ignorant Empericke, ſome unskilfull Barber-Surgeon, yea, to a beard-ſhaver, or a woman, who will adventure upon any the moſt deſperate medicine, without any preparation, or knowledge of the conſtitution of the body: than to the learnedſt and ableſt Phyſitian, who is able, if it were a poiſon, ſo to prepare and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it, that it may ſafely be taken without any danger: and indeed, who deale with ſuch chapmen, may often cry out with theſe Prophets, <hi>mors eſt in olla,</hi> death or poiſoniis in the body, howſoever the effects are not alwaies upon the ſudden ſo ſenſibly perceived. Beſides, ſome of theſe ſevere cenſurers are often as buſie with a pipe of <hi>Tabacco,</hi> as with their appointed food? and yet no bill of inditement preferred againſt it. Now, I will be judged by the learned, if this ſimple be not indued with as poiſonable and maligne a qualitie as any of theſe ſtrong and violent purgations the antients uſed: I will except neither <hi>Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore,</hi>

In the next place,<note place="margin">Vrging accidents.</note> urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accidents doe often inhibit ſtrong evacuation. Strong Purgations, ſaith <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are not fitting for ill-coloured perſons, very dry or drouthy, that have a dry cough, and diſtenſion under the ſhort ribs; as alſo ſuch as uſe evill diet.

And yet, if there be need, and nature be wanting, wee are not to deny even a ſucking child ſuch an evacuation: yet with the counſell of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we are then to exhibit ſome gentle purgation to the nurſe, which communicateth a purging facultie to her milke: to children of fuller yeeres we may ſafely adminiſter ſome gentle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.

Now it cannot be unknowne, that the ſuccuſſion and ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the body one day in ſo extreme a manner, offereth more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence both to the mother and the child, then three or foure dayes would doe with ſome gentle purges downewards. It will be replied, this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence is naturall, and therefore not ſo dangerous. I anſwere, violence is alwaies violence, howſoever procured; and the action is alwayes the ſame, whatſoever the inſtrument be: a man may breake his necke as wel by a natural fall from the top of a tower without any violence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; as when he is puſht downe by the hand or otherwiſe.

All the anſwere will be, that in them we uſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke their menſtruous fluxe, which here is no waies to be tolerated, far leſſe attempted. I anſwere, wee may freely with gentle medicines purge away theſe corrupt and evill humors, ſo offenſive both to the mother and the infant, without feare of any danger whatſoever. Now this is not my private opinion onely, but generally of all our beſt and moſt famous Phyſitians, wherewith I could ſtuffe up this my booke, and make it ſwell to a too great voluminous bigneſſe.

Her neighbours (of the female ſexe I meane, they being eſpecially in ſuch phyſicall affaires, more pragmaticall than men) utterly diſſwaded her from any phyſicke whatſoever. I confeſſe, I was unwilling, if it had beene poſsible, to have meddled in ſo dangerous and intricate a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſse, and where the event was ſo doubtfull, and where, if all things ſucceeded not according to expected deſire, I expoſed my ſelfe to the cenſure and ſlander of ſo many venomous and virulent tongues: yet being thereunto lawfully called, I firſt acquainted both her ſelfe and husband with the danger both the mother and the childe were in without the meanes, and that by the uſe of phlebotomie and purgation, wee might through the bleſsing of God hope for ſome good ſucceſſe, howſoever the iſſue or event was not certaine.

At length the Phyſitian forſooke her, as then irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable, eſpecially by reaſon of her ſpitting of blood, which was ſuppoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the lungs. In this caſe ſhe continued ſome three weekes, or neere by, and after my comming home ſhee ſent for mee: but hearing of all that was paſt, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, although twice or thrice intreated, hearing of ſo deſperate a buſineſſe, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intreated, to give her ſatisfaction, at leaſt by ſeeing her, although I adminiſtred nothing. At length, after I had ſeene her, and well conſidered of this blood thus reiected, I found it proceeded not from her lungs, whereof I gave her notice, and withall proceeded with cordialls, and other things fitting for her cough, eſpecially excretion of blood, which were by this meanes qualified, and the excretion of blood within a few daies was quite ſtaied; and although I know both phlebotomie and purgation to be of very good uſed for theſe diſeaſes, yet durſt I not then adventure on any of them, but continued this courſe with diet ſuch as was fitting. At my firſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting of her, ſhe was now above a moneth quicke with childe, and very feeble, and for the moſt part kept her bed: her looſneſſe left her about a moneth after, and her cought and caſting, together with her Fever, forſooke her about a moneth before ſhe was brought to bed, and was delivered of a ſonne, who lived a moneth, and was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted with fits of a Fever of the the ſame manner as the mother, and died about the end of the moneth. The mother, notwithſtanding all the premiſſes, a few daies after her delivery was aſſaulted with the meaſels, and afterward, recovered her perfect health, and lived after that many yeeres.</hi> It may then plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that it is not a matter ſo dangerous as it is deemed, ſometimes in time of need to give a woman with childe ſome gentle phyſicke, as ſhall by a judicious and underſtanding Phyſitian be thought fitting:<note place="margin">Great caution to be uſed in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Aph. 6. lib. 1.</note> Thus great diſeaſes require great remedies, as witneſſeth <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> and ſom bodies are moved with gentle remedies, and others againe although of a weaker conſtitution, yet endure ſtronger purgations. Againe, ſome bodies are ſtrong and well able to endure ſtrong purgations; as in the middle age: ſome againe, as young children, and decrepit old men, are either not to be purged, or very gently, and ſo are we alſo to conſider the ſeverall parts to be purged: as the head, liver, ſtomack, kidnies, &amp;c: and to obſerve the ſeverall circumſtances in them and other parts to be obſerved. Now to every purging medicine Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians doe commonly aſſigne three doſes, comparing the ſtrength of the patient with the medicine: to wit, to ſtrong people, the greateſt; to weake the ſmalleſt, and the middle or meane to the middle or meane ſtrength.<note place="margin">The quantity of the medicine to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or remitted according to ſeveral circumſtances.</note> The quantity of the medicine is alſo intended or remitted according to the ambient aire, region,  as alſo according to the nature of the noxious humor: for thinne moveable humors will give way to a mild medicine; but tought, thicke and clammie humors, and impacted in the part, will not ſo eaſily bee removed. Beſides, we muſt neither exceed in giving too ſmall a quantity: for that often ſtirreth and moveth the humor, gripeth the belly, and putteth the patient to great paine,<note place="margin">Safer to erre in the defect than in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</note> howbeit to ſmall purpoſe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet muſt it exceed in too great a quantity, which is yet farre worſe; and a more dangerous error than in the defect which is eaſilier remedied than the other in the exceſſe. Now ſometimes we evacuate all the noxious humor at one time, and ſometimes wee returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine once or oftner. This firſt is called a full evacuation, and then onely hath place where the body is ſtrong, and nature it ſelfe leadeth the way: and this commeth to paſſe, when as in diſeaſes the humors are already concocted, and withall doe ſo abound, that they, as it were, ſwell and rage.

Some of the antients againe, quite contrary to the minde of <hi>Aſclepiades,</hi> were ſo farre in love with this evacuation, that they preſcribed it even in time of health, every moneth for two or three daies together, which I confeſſe was too much, and tending to another extremity. But all are not fit for the uſe of ſo noble and generous a remedie, ſuch eſpecially as are not accuſtomed to it, are not, unleſſe in caſe of great extremity to be urged to the uſe of it. And againe, wee are to looke unto the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the humor, whether it incline that way or no, and then are we to ſecond this naturall inclination of the humor by exhibiting help for the bettet furtherance of this worke. But great care and caution muſt be uſed in the adminiſtring of this remedie in regard of the partie to uſe the ſame: for ſuch as are narrow breaſted, have a long necke, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a <hi>conſumption,</hi> are not to uſe this remedy: and ſuch, whoſe ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes are unfit for it, a weake braine, women ſubject to <hi>hyſtericall</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, indure not <hi>vomits</hi> eaſily. And to induce this evacuation, there is a good ſtrength required in the ſtomacke, eſpecialy if the <hi>vomit</hi> be ſtrong. Now, as in other evacuations, ſo in this alſo, wee uſe in time of need ſome preparation to facilitate the operation thereof. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation of the ſtomacke by outward inunctions and fomentations I hold ſuſpect, for feare of too much debilitating the ſtomacke after, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in this ſo nice and effeminate age. For an inward preparation to

facilitate the operation, we uſe ſometimes to ſuffer the patient fill his ſtomacke before, with divers ſorts of food,<note place="margin">Inward preparation.</note> eſpecially ſuch as may cleanſe and cut, or attenuate: as ſalt meats, onions, and the like; and this is when the matter is tough, congealed and ſtuffed in the ſtomack, where the uſe of hot herbs, Time, Savory, of <hi>Oxymel</hi> and the like may ſafely ſometimes be permitted. But when the humor is thin, fluid, and eaſie to be purged, then poſſet drinke blood warme, now and then taken after the aſſuming of thy <hi>vomit,</hi> will ſerve the turne.

Now, a noxious humour either taketh hold of the whole body, and all the regions thereof, or elſe ſome one region, or one part of it: as the head, ſtomacke, &amp;c.

Some are called cold, by reaſon they ſeeme in trickling downe to be cold; ſome againe ſeeme to bee hotter; and others are called dry: and theſe be ſuch, as falling downe are quickly dry againe. Some againe are called thicke, and ſticke cloſer to the cheekes, and ſome againe thinner, which are quicklier diſſolved, and are of a very thinne and watery ſubſtance. Teares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine ſometimes come in great abundance, and ſometimes in a ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler quantity. Some againe ſalt, ſome ſweet, ſome bittter. Some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine are without any ſickneſſe, and ſome with ſickneſſe. Some come eaſily and of themſelves, and ſome againe are forced.

Before entring into any of theſe baths of any kind whatſoever, wee are to ſee that the body be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cleanſed, and that the common excrements of urin and ordure firſt be evacuated, for feare of ſome defluxion upon the feeble parts, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving &amp; liquifying the humors of the body. Neither yet are we to uſe exerciſe before it, for feare of filling the head with fumes &amp; vapors: and food muſt alſo be refrained from, for feare of crudities, from whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and divers dangerous diſeaſes might after inſue. If the party be not able to abſteine, let him take ſome little ſuſtenance in a morning, a little biſcuit,<note place="margin">In bathing how to be ordered.</note> or ſome cordiall electuary, or the like.

               <p>In the firſt place then, let us take notice of the originall of this leap-yeere, and what it is. Before the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Originall of leap-yeere.</note> it is thought that moſt nations uſed the computation of the yeere according to the courſe of the Moone, the which, becauſe it was uncertaine, the Moone in her motion being ſo unſtable and uncertaine; therefore <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> 54 yeeres before the nativitie of our Lord and Saviour, after he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his warres, taking into his conſideration this irregularity of the yeere, reſolved to rectifie the ſame. And for this ſame purpoſe he ſent into <hi>Egypt</hi> for the moſt expert Mathematicians of that Kingdome, and among the reſt one <hi>Soſigenes</hi> (from whence, as from this <hi>Iulius</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led the <hi>Iulian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iulian, or Soſigenian yeere.</note> ſo from this ſame <hi>Soſigenes</hi> it is called the <hi>Soſigenian</hi> yeere) and therefore whereas before the yeere was ordinarily meaſured by the motion of the Moone, it was then reduced to the motion of the Sunne, which finiſheth his courſe in 365 daies, and 6 houres. Theſe daies he divided into twelve equall parts, called by the name of <hi>Menſis,</hi> or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And becauſe there reſted yet 6 odde houres, for avoiding confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which in proceſſe of time might thereby be occaſioned, every fourth yeere, there being juſt 24 houres remaining, theſe making up a juſt naturall day, were inſerted into the moneth of <hi>February,</hi> which before had but 28 daies. And yet this computation is not ſo perfect, but that it admitteth of ſome defects, here being added unto this yeere more by the fifth part of an houre than ought: and by conſequence more added every leap-yeere unto <hi>February</hi> than ought, by 48 minutes: the which hath made an alteration in the <hi>Aequinoxes,</hi> and <hi>Solſtices</hi> ſince this Emperours time, about 11 or 12 daies. Beſides, that I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the motion of the Moone, wherein was likewiſe ſome defect, notwithſtanding the courſe was taken to rectifie the ſame, which made a great confuſion in the time of the obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> betwixt the Eaſterne and Weſterne Churches, untill the councell of <hi>Nice.</hi> The emendation of this errour,<note place="margin">Alteration of the yee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Pope, by the helpe eſpecially of one <hi>Lilius,</hi> a Doctor of phyſicke, tooke ſuch a courſe to reforme the Calender, that the vernall Aequinoxe was from the 10 of <hi>March</hi> reduced to the 21, to the ſame day that it was at the <hi>Nicene</hi> councell. Now, this could not be, unleſſe in the Calender and computation of the daies of the yeere there were 10 daies quite cut off. And for this cauſe, this ſame <hi>Lilius</hi> choſe the moneth of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> wherein this Pope was borne, and tooke quite away from it tenne daies: ſo that when the 5 of <hi>October</hi> was to be numbred,<note place="margin">Amputation of tenne daies from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer yeeres.</note> in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſubſtituted the 15. and <hi>October</hi> that yeere had but 21 daies.

Now, theſe celeſtiall bodies keepe conſtantly the ſame courſe they ever did ſince the firſt creation, theſe humane conſtitutions neither adding to, nor detracting from theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies any new energie, vertue or power.

This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, would, perhaps, make our <hi>Heretickes</hi> and <hi>Huguenots</hi> thinke better of S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſe.

But if his holineſſe could but ſtay a little the courſe of the Sunne or Moone, there might yet be ſome witneſſes of it. But yet, to give the divell his right, I doe much commend the attempts of ſome Popes, for attempting, but

And the ſame are here to be obſerved, which before in the uſe of artificiall baths were mentioned: to wit, obſtructions to be opened, the body to be well purged according to the nature of the diſeaſe, ſtrength of the party, and other anſwerable circumſtances, and withall, there muſt be a care had, that the concoction be well accompliſhed, there be an abſtinence from the venereall act, and a freedome from paſſions and perturbations of the minde.<note place="margin">The time of the day for uſe.</note> The fit and convenient time to enter into theſe baths, is two houres after Sunne riſing in a morning: and if the nether parts be affected, the party is to ſit in the water, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red therewith to the navell: if the upper parts be affected, as farre as the necke.

Againe, in the confines of <hi>Lorreine,</hi> there are hot baths called <hi>Plumbarenſes,</hi> participating of the nature of Lead, Brimſtone and Salt-peter. In the Dutchie of <hi>Wirtenberg,</hi> there is the wild bath, called <hi>Silveſtres,</hi> or <hi>Ferinae,</hi> participating of the nature of brimſtone, ſalt and alum: and as ſome ſay, of copper and ſalt-peter alſo. And beſides theſe, a great number of many others alſo, not differing from the former in operation: ſome of them, as they ſay, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating alſo of the nature of gold, which I hardly beleeve,<note place="margin">Gold and ſilver com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate no vertue to ſuch waters.</note> it being of ſo ſolid and well compacted a ſubſtance, that hardly doth it communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate any vertue to waters that runne thorow ſuch mines, no more than ſilver alſo, being likeſt unto it for ſolidity of ſubſtance. As concerning our owne baths with us here in great uſe for a multitude of infirmities, and which doe moſt concerne us, becauſe a learned <note n="a" place="margin">Doctor <hi>Venner</hi> in his treatiſe of baths of <hi>Bathe:</hi> and ſince the collecting of this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctat, I ſaw a learned tractat of baths, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iorden,</hi> reſiding there.</note> Phyſitian hath lately explained their vertues and uſe, as being beſt with them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, I ſhall not need to ſay any thing; the vertues of others of the ſame nature and kinde in other countries, being much alſo of the ſame vertue and efficacy. But becauſe peregrination and travell, partly for profit, and partly for pleaſure and other ends, is now much in this our age improved, and by reaſon it concerneth not a little the health of ſuch as are to live or travell in remote and forren countries, to know the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vertues of ſuch minerall waters as are found in theſe countries, I will therefore ſay a little concerning ſome of them. Among all thoſe,<note place="margin">Acid or ſowre waters. They abound in high <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </note> ſuch as are of an acid or ſowre taſte, and much abounding in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of high <hi>Germany,</hi> beare away the bell. And theſe waters doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly participate of the nature of vitriol or copperas, of alum and yron, with the admixture often of other mineralls or metalls: as ſulphur, ſalt, &amp;c. There ſowre waters ſometimes ſomewhat differ in taſte one from another; and ſometimes little or no difference at all in their taſte can be obſerved. Their chiefe vertues in the body of man are theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing; In the firſt place, they are very ſoveraine good againſt all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of obſtructions of the liver, ſplene, kidnies, and meſeraicall veines,<note place="margin">Their vertues.</note> and for this cauſe conduce not a little for the infirmities of thoſe parts, being very good againſt exorbitant caſting,<note place="margin">In what infirmities helpfull.</note> which by their aſtringent facultie they cure: and they helpe alſo the <hi>Iaundiſe,</hi> the <hi>Dropſie,</hi> in the beginning; cleanſe the kidnies, bladder, and other urinary paſſages, purging away gravell, or any other matter lying in theſe paſſages. They are alſo good againſt the <hi>itch, ſcab,</hi> and any other defedations of the skinne, all <hi>foule ulcers</hi> and <hi>gangrenes.</hi> But <hi>Nihil eſt ex omni parte beatum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In what hurtfull.</note> So are not theſe acid and ſowre waters able to helpe all infirmities: and in particular, they are great enemies to infirmities of the lungs, eſpecially where there is any <hi>ulcer, waſting</hi> or <hi>inflammation.</hi> They are hurtfull alſo for the <hi>bloodie fluxe,</hi> with exulceration of the guts, and any other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ulcer, or excoriation, and that in regard of their acidity or ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

No more can the meaſure or certaine quantity be gaged, ſome contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with halfe a pint, and ſome againe will drinke double, ſome 4 or 5. And the more freely they paſſe thorow the body by urin or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the bolder in the uſe of them may we be. How the body before the uſe of theſe waters is to be prepared, the Phyſitian ſhall in time of need give notice, and according to all ſeverall circumſtancess give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular directions.<note place="margin">They loſe much ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue by carriage.</note> It is to be obſerved, that theſe minerall waters, by carrying from one place to another, loſe alwaies ſomething of their former force and efficacie, how cloſe ſoever they be ſtopt up, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſſe powerfull.<note place="margin">Obſervation in the uſe of theſe waters.</note> It is further diligently to be obſerved, in the uſe of all minerall waters that are to be drunke, that when as they are drunke twice a day, the partie uſing them muſt be carefull that din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be well digeſted before they be drunke in the afternoone: and for this purpoſe dinner muſt either be very ſparing, or elſe a long diſtance betwixt dinner and the drinking of them; or elſe it were better to drinke it but once in a morning, and ſo double the time of continuing this drinke, as for a fortnight, a whole moneth. Moreover, if the caſe ſhould ſo require, that the party ſhould need both to drinke of this water, and bathe in it, it would be moſt expedient to doe them ſeverall: as firſt for certaine daies to drinke them, and afterwards for as long to bathe in them. But becauſe wee in this Iland are ſo farre remote from theſe acid and other fountains, that ordinarily we cannot have recourſe unto them, therefore I ſhall not need to particulariſe many of them; of one only, being ſo much freequented by many of the gentrie, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neerer unto us than the reſt, I will ſay a little; the ſo much renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Well of <hi>Spa</hi> I meane.<note place="margin">Of the Well of <hi>Spa.</hi>

Now, for the affinity it hath with ſweat, being much of one nature, although both at divers paſſages, and in a different manner voided, it ſhall ſucceed in the next place. Of the nature of this excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humour, the manner of generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deceit and coozenage of ignorant and erronious practitioners, in the judgement by the ſame, and many things which concerne this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, hath beene <note n="*" place="margin">See our arraigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and anatomy of urines.</note> elſe-where handled at great length; where hath beene ſufficiently proved the uncertainty of judging the iſſue of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes by this bare ſigne onely; being a ſigne whereby ſome diſeaſes only, and ſomtimes, may be diſcerned: and yet but a generall one,<note place="margin">Vncertaine and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iudgement for the moſt part affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us by urine.</note> which can neither acquaint us with the ſtrength of the patient (a thing of all others in diſeaſes of great moment) nor many other particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, wherewith the Phyſitian ought, in ſo waighty a buſineſſe, to be acquainted. And there we likewiſe proved, that from thence wee could neither gather any certainty of conception, nor yet of the ſexe. I ſay, nevertheleſſe, that urine is not to be neglected either in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or in health: but withall, let other ſignes not be neglected, but have their due deſert. That urine therefore, both in ſickneſſe and in health, which is of a laudable colour, and contents anſwerable,<note place="margin">Beſt urine.</note> doth commonly argue that body to be in beſt caſe, eſpecially if all other ſignes concurre; as if it be otherwiſe, wee are to conceive the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. That urine we commonly call beſt, that is of a light golden colour,<note place="margin">Beſt colour.</note> with a meane white coloured even contents: and the farther it decline from this golden rule, the worſe we deeme it: as ſometimes when it is of an intenſe red colour, it often argueth <hi>Fevers,</hi> or <hi>inflammations,</hi>

But in ſtead of all other medicines uſed for the expurgation of this excrement, there hath beene of late yeeres, ſince Sir <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> firſt voiage into the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> in uſe with us the ſmoake of an <hi>Indian</hi> herbe, called by the <hi>Indians Tabacco.</hi>

               <p>As therefore every creature of God is good, ſo in this ſimple,<note place="margin">Conſideration of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, and the uſe thereof.</note> this is as eaſie to be ſeene and obſerved. That this ſimple then is hot and dry in the ſecond degree, cannot be denied: as for the ſecond qualities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the firſt, as attenuation, penetration, diſcuſſion, &amp;c. they cannot likewiſe be denied. And beſides the afore-mentioned qualities, it participateth yet of a narcoticke or ſtupifying nature; which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it proceed from heat, cold, or the whole ſubſtance, it is not my purpoſe here to diſpute, leaving it rather to be diſcuſſed in the ſchooles. And howſoever out antient Phyſitians did attribute unto thoſe narco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke medicines a tranſcending cold, even to the fourth degree: yet am I ſure, that in this ſimple, with this narcoticke quality, concurreth both calidity and ſiccity. By reaſon then of theſe firſt qualities,<note place="margin">Narcoticke quality.</note> it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and drieth very much; and by conſequent, conduceth in cold and moiſt diſeaſes, and alike conſtitutions: and by reaſon of theſe ſecond qualities, it openeth obſtructions, cutteth tough and ſlimy humours, attenuateth and rarefieth them; and therefore helpeth defluxions of phlegmaticke humours upon the wind-pipe and lungs, obſtructions of the liver, &amp;c. By its narcotick quality, it ſtupifieth &amp; benummeth the ſenſes, and ſo allaieth paine. And the <hi>Indians</hi> often endure many daies hunger by the onely uſe of the ſmoake of this herb, this ſtupifying qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity bereaving the nerves of ſenſe, and procuring often times an artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and forced ſleepe. Beſides all theſe, we have already proved,<note place="margin">Violent purgation.</note> that it is indued with a violent purging quality, both upwards and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and that in as violent a manner, as either <hi>antimony,</hi> or that ſo much renowned <hi>hellebore,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe violent purging ſimples, uſed by <hi>Hippocrates</hi> or others. And this proceedeth from none of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned qualities, as all our Phyſitians confeſſe. It is likewiſe by the learned in this profeſſion confeſſed, that ſuch violent purges par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate all of ſome maligne quality, contrary to mans nature: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

When this excrement ſtinketh,<note place="margin">Divers ſignifications of this excrement.</note> it is alwaies taken for an evill ſigne, indicating an ulcer, and ſometimes taken for a ſigne of headach proceeding from wormes.

When it is of a reddiſh colour, it is not ſo to be approved of, as arguing alwaies ſome blood. Salt or bitter argue ſome heat; ſweet and inſipid, the contrary. When this excrement is ſtopp'd, and the head ſtuffed, the paſſages muſt by convenient and fit meanes be opened, by means of the juice of beets, marjoram, and many other ſuch opening ſimples, either the juice or dry powder thereof being for this purpoſe uſed.

And yet in the uſe of them there is no ſmall caution to be obſerved, both of the ſtate of the body, the time of the diſeaſe, the part ttanſmitting, commonly the head; and the part recipient, or receiving, to wit, the parts within the breſt. When as this excrement is hard to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, wee are by all meanes poſſible to further and facilitate the ſame: and this difficulty proceedeth from a double cauſe, the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſharpneſſe, or from the toughneſſe and clammineſſe of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. The former we effect by incraſſation of the humor,<note place="margin">Preparation before expectoration.</note> by ſparing and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:20476:185"/>
orderly Diet, and divers other things which doe incraſſat and thicken this thinne matter: as conſerve of roſes, ſirup of violets, of Jujubes, &amp;c: and divers compound medicines tending to this ſame purpoſe. If it be tough and impacted into the pipes of the lungs, then are wee to uſe ſuch meanes as may both cut and expell it: as colts-foot, mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens haire,<note place="margin">Divers preparations.</note> hyſſop, licorice, and the like; whereof are made divers ſirups and other compoſitions for the effecting of this buſineſſe. And when theſe will not ſerve the turne, then make we uſe of ſome more forcible meanes, as of <hi>Oxymel ſimplex,</hi> and compounded with divers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible ingredients, as ſquills, &amp;c: as ſhall by the counſell and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the learned be preſcribed. And this is the proper way by which diſeaſes of the pectorall parts are ordinarily purged: howbeit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, although ſeldome, we uſe to purge by ſtoole in theſe caſes. It is here alſo to be obſerved, that ſuch medicines as are for this purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,<note place="margin">The forme.</note> be prepared in a ſolid, or at leaſt not a very liquid forme, that they may be lickt downe, or elſe let melt under the tongue: for taken in a great quantity, and drunke or ſwallowed downe, they goe onely into the ſtomacke, and ſo into the guts and veines, and therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce not the expected effect.<note place="margin">Error of the Vulgar.</note> Hence doth appeare the error of ſuch as thinke to drive away their cold, as they call it, by large draughts of buttered beere to bed-wards; which is ſo farre from anſwering their expectation, that by hindring and interrupting concoction, increaſing crudities, opening the orifice of the ſtomacke, and looſening the ſame, and by fuming up into the head, it rather furthereth and increaſeth this cough or cold,<note place="margin">Caveat concerning ſweet things.</note> call it as thou wilt. It is in like manner to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that as ſweet things looſen tough phlegme, and ſo facilitate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectoration, ſo doth the too frequent uſe of them much debilitate the concocting faculty of the ſtomacke, beſides that in cholericke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they are apt to ingender the like humor. And the too frequent uſe of too acid,<note place="margin">Acid and tart things.</note> tart or ſharpe things, is here alſo to be ſhunned: but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, howbeit better for both, yet ſcarce ſo wel-come to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitian</hi> palats of our age.<note place="margin">In pectorall diſeaſes that which is ſpit up, is eſpecially to bee conſidered.</note> And it is here likewiſe to be obſerved, that in diſeaſes conteined within this ſecond region, the ſpittings up, <hi>ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> are equivalent to the urines in many other diſeaſes, whereby wee judge of the concoction or crudity of the diſeaſe: as <note n="c" place="margin">

But as in all other things, ſo here eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, I meane, a moderation ſhould bee obſerved, and herein the Lawes of God and man be not infringed. The moderate; timely and

The age fitteſt for this act,<note place="margin">The fitteſt age.</note> is manly age, to the younger ſort and old age it being rather hurtfull. From hence may then evidently appeare the prepoſterous courſe of many, who, for ſome ſiniſter reſpect, either for covetouſneſſe to compaſſe ſome great match, ſome great alliance or the like, often cauſe children to marry before ever they know what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage meanes (although not alwaies conſummate,<note place="margin">Inconveniences by marrying young chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp; yong people.</note> yet in effect, and finiſhed at parents or neere friends pleaſure) or how to make a free choice, which ought to be voluntary, and not forced: and hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth it to paſſe, that both their bodies are debilitated, their growth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hindred (that which ſhould have turned to the nouriſhing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing of the body, being too ſoone, as we have already ſaid, turned another way) divers diſeaſes ingendred, and their iſſue (if they have any, they being ordinarily not ſo fruitfull as others) proving often craſie and valetudinary, and by the juſt judgement of God, upon ſuch unlawfull matches, there is ſeldome ſeen that firme love and true affection, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and concord betwixt ſuch parties as ought to be, in this ſacred

ordinance, as I have often obſerved, and by relation heard of a many more: beſides, that many times they prove afterwards more inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: for conſidering that they were not of judgement ſufficient when they were firſt married, diſliking the party that before was, as it were, pinned upon them, breake forth into unlawfull luſt. It is their ſinne,<note place="margin">Duty of parents in this caſe.</note> I confeſſe, but parents and friends miniſter occaſions, which prove more dangerous, when theſe parties have not firſt been trained up in the feare of God, which, alas the pitty, is too much neglected. Such, therefore, as have children marriageable, it is the parents duty to provide for their children matches in due time, obſerving the diſpoſition of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, leſt the neglect of this duty done in due time, extort out of them aftewards a too late repentance. Such as cannot ſo ſuddenly,<note place="margin">Diligent care ought to be had in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of children.</note> as need requireth, be furniſhed to their liking, let parents be more watchfull over them, and all have a care of their pious education in their younger yeeres, preventing all occaſions of evill; idleneſſe eſpecially, reading of lewd laſcivious love books, frequenting lewd and laſcivious compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; ſtage-plaies eſpecially, the very bane and break-necke of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, honeſty and chaſtity: and all other things that may worke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in this kind. And ſuch as are of yeeres of diſcretion, and <hi>ſui iuris;</hi> and now by death of parents freed from that triall of obedience, I wiſh them to marry, rather than burne and breake out in ſinne, and ſo live to diſhonour God, and ſcandaliſe their neighbour. And if they cannot accommodate themſelves ſo ſuddenly, let them in the meane-time avoid all provocations to luſt, uſe ſpare and thinne diet, avoiding the pampering of the fleſh, uſing often for companion the Bible and other good bookes, and other good meanes. But in any caſe, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon thy ſelfe to idleneſſe; but alwaies be imploied in ſome good and laudable vocation, whereby thou maiſt prove profitable either to Church or Common-wealth.

As for the age, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular yeeres cannot ſo well be determined, ſome being more able at twenty, than others at thirty or upwards: and ſome old men of foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, abler than others at fifty: but yet, as I touched before,<note place="margin">The certaine number of yeeres when to marry cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</note> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry children, or young people while they are yet a growing, it is both prejudiciall to the publike, and their owne private perſons. For feeble old age, it cannot but prove very pernicious, as any one may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. As for the time of the yeere, the moſt temperate,<note place="margin">The fitteſt time of the yeere.</note> keeping a

Under watching wee here comprehend both the functions of the common ſenſe. The firſt is the diſtribution of the animall faculty proceeding from the head to the organs of the outward ſenſes, to the end they may receive the <hi>ſpecies:</hi> and the next is, the perception it ſelfe, and the judging of ſuch <hi>ſpecies</hi> received into theſe organs of the outward ſenſes. Now ſleepe is not properly a function of any ſenſe, but a certaine affection following upon the naturall function of the ſenſes, to wit, waking, that thereby the ſtrength which by waking was tired out, might the better be repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and refreſhed. The moderation of both theſe in ſickneſſe and in health are very neceſſary, and when either exceedeth, the body is much endamaged, and health much hindered. Immoderate watching drieth up, attenuateth, exhauſteth and debilitateth the body, and ſpendeth the ſpirits; and therefore in hot acute diſeaſes, if long continuing, prov<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the very dangerous. Sleep, produceth the contrary effects; howbeit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding meaſure dulleth the body, moiſteneth too much, oppreſſeth and ſuffocateth naturall heat, ingendreth abundance of excrements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and drowneth both the ſenſes and the mind. But ſleep moderately uſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitteth both the body and the mind: for by this meanes the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the aliment in the ſtomacke and all the parts of the body, are by the teſtimony of <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <hi>Galen</hi> him ſelfe ſeconded. Sleep moiſtneth alſo the body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it ſeemeth the <note n="f" place="margin">Virgil.</note> Poet alluded, <hi>feſſos ſopor irrigat artus.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it nouriſheth and maketh fat, and what is corrupted expelleth by ſweat or urine, and what is not fully concocted it perfecteth and maketh profitable for the nouriſhment of the body: beſides all this, it qualifieth and mitigateth choler, the cauſe of many dangerous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: and it ſtaieth and hindereth any evacuation except ſweat, and withall cooleth the body.<note place="margin">What ſleep is.</note> 
                  <hi>Sleep then is a naturall reſt, and that almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of all the externall ſenſes; or a naturall impotency of the animall faculties to the actions, by reaſon of a mild and pleaſant vapor ariſing from the aliment irrigating, and as it were, beſprinkling the braine, that in the meane time, the vigor and ſtrength of the body may be this meanes bee repaired and refreſhed.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">In ſleepe there is not a totall ceſſation of the influxe of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimall ſpirits in the organs of ſenſes.</note> although there be here a ceſſation of the influxe of the animall ſpirits into the organs of the outward ſenſes, yet is there not a totall ceſſation of this influxe: for then a man ſhould not againe waken at all, and this would prove a ſtupefaction of the ſenſes, and not a ſleep. Sleep is therefore, as it were, a binding or tying up of the common ſenſe, and a hindering of the influence of the animall ſpirits into the organs of the outward ſenſes in part onely; as wee ſee by experience in reſpiration and many motions the body uſeth in ſleepe: but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxe of ſo great a quantity and quality of ſpirits into theſe organs

of the outward ſenſes, as for the performance of their functions is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, then is denied. And in a profound, ſound or deep ſleep, as we may call it, there is a ſmaller or leſſer influence; in a leſſe profound ſleep, when as the ſenſes worke but ſlenderly, there is a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſpirits. This humor or vapor thus moiſtening the braine, being ſpent, the body awaketh, and ſo becommeth more fit and quicke to goe about all ordinary imploiments; and theſe two doe thus alternatively ſucceed each other, according to the Poet.</p>

               <p>And all this is to be underſtood of naturall ſleepe, uſefull and uſuall both in ſickneſſe and in health, there being alſo ſome ſleepes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoporiferous affections which are not naturall. And this unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or ſoporiferous ſleep is often an accident of acute diſeaſes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dangerous, and ſometimes free there from. Sleep then being ſo neceſſary for all ages, ſexes, and ſorts of people, wee will ſay ſomething concerning the fit and convenient time for ſleepe, as alſo of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and continuance thereof, and with what ſite or poſture of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy we are to ſleep, and who may ſafely ſleepe longeſt, and who are not allowed ſo long a time.

               <p>I have a little before in another chapter touched upon a principall remedy, concerning the care parents ought to have in the education of their children; and therefore, as likewiſe being a theme proper for the Divine, I will not here meddle any more with it, nor repeat any thing that hath beene ſaid already. But it will, perhaps, be demanded what is then the remedy for ſuch as are already intangled with this love paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? I anſwer, that here I have not undertaken to ſet downe a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cure of this, or any other particular infirmity, but only to ſet downe ſome generall directions to remedy this paſſion.<note place="margin">Things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in matching.</note> There muſt therefore a due conſideration be had of the individuall partie, conſidering the ſexe, age, temperature, and conſtitution of body, and the object whereunto this furious paſſion is fixed. If there may be a yeelding to the parties deſire without the breach of the lawes of God and man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, perhaps, ſome diſparity betwixt the parties, in regard of wealth, birth, or both; yet, if there be danger in the deniall, my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, rather to yeeld to an inconvenience, than to a miſchiefe, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the diſparity is not ſo great.

But among us in this age, there is many times a great overſight in parents, who ſtand often ſo punctually upon ſome points: as of wealth eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſome others; that vertue and true worth, the true feare of God eſpecially, is ſet in the laſt place, and ſcarce, indeed, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any place. Hence commeth if often to paſſe, that many of our young prodigalls ſo gallop out of their goodly eſtates, and are throwne off their horſe before ever they were well ſetled in the ſaddle; and their wealth many times quite vaniſhed away, before they atteine to a dragme of wit. I ſpeake not here againſt ſome ſutable proportion betwixt parties to be matched in marriage, and ſome competent meanes according to their places and callings; but my meaning is, that many times true worth and vertue is ſo, by worthleſſe people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued, that this proverbiall ſpeech is often very truely verified,

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene an inveterate opinion, and is yet faſt rooted in the mindes of many, that there are certaine medicines of that naturall force and operation, that being taken within the bodie, they will inflame that party that taketh them with this paſſion of loue. Now whether this be ſo or no? and if it be, whether it can force the affection to any one individual perſon more than another, is worth the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. As for the firſt, it would ſeeme there were ſome ſuch medicines,<note place="margin">Mention made of love potions among antient authors.</note> there being ſo frequent mention made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our Authors of theſe love medicines. The poets both <hi>Greeke</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> often mention them, and ſome alſo ſet downe the matter, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they are made,<note place="margin">Whether any ſimple be endued with a property to procure love.</note> which is without all controverſie: but whether they be indued with any ſuch efficacie, let us now inquire. We have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared that all ſimples worke either by their ordinary qualities of three ſeverall ſorts, as we have ſaid already: or elſe by an occult and hidden qualitie: as we ſee the loadſtone draweth the yron; and divers purging medicines make choice of certaine ſelect and peculiar humors: as rhubarb purgeth choler, &amp;c. Now that there proceedeth no ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from any of theſe ordinary qualities, it is ſo manifeſt that none did ever yet affirme it. It reſteth then that it muſt needes proceed from an occult qualitie. It muſt needs then follow, that there are ſome ſimples that will procure love: and ſince love is an affection of the ſoule, why may there not be other ſimples to worke upon other affections of the ſoule: as harted, anger, &amp;c? and if ſo, then theſe medicines which are corporeall, may worke upon the affections of the ſoule, which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, which is abſurd. But will ſome reply, it cannot be denied, that ſome medicines there are which procure love. I anſwere, that ſome doe provoke luſt,<note place="margin">Some ſimples may procure luſt, but none force to love.</note> I doe not deny; but to procure love is not yet proved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch produce this effect by an ordinary and to us knowne qualitie as ſome by increaſing the blood, and conſequently the ſeed of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſome by meanes of their flatuous quality: and ſome againe by their acrimony,<note place="margin">Some of theſe love-medicines are veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous.</note> ſharpe and venomous quality, doe often provoke an irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and are of ſuch a corroding and fretting nature, that they often make piſſe blood, and cauſe irrecoverable ulcers in the kidnies and obſcene parts. And ſometimes theſe intoxicating medicines fly up into the head, and cauſe madneſſe, of the which fearefull effects fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent mention is made in divers Authors. And it is memorable which is written of <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Poet, who howbeit he ſet downe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers directions againſt love, yet could he not eſcape death by this owne

And this wee ſee often verified in magicall ſpells, and characters, which in themſelves have no ſuch efficacy and power to produce ſuch ſtrange ſtupendious effects, where it may plainly appeare that <hi>Satan</hi> is the chiefe actor in the action. <hi>During my abode in</hi> France, <hi>ſom</hi> 25 <hi>yeeres agoe, I was familiarly acquainted with a gentleman of</hi> Poitou, <hi>who had a Tennant dwelling in the ſame towne,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory.</note> 
                  <hi>ever which hee was ſole Lord, whoſe wife told mee, that ſome few yeeres before that time, being married, the very ſame day as they went out at the Church doore, the one ranne away from the other, and could not indure either to come neere, or indure the ſight one of another: and when the one was brought at unawares into the preſence of the other, they cryed out, that they were in that caſe as though they were all pricked with pins and needles, and hated as much one another, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Land-lady, a ſtout and couragious; Gentlewoman commiſerating this diſtreſſed couple, and ſuſpecting a knave accuſtomed to play ſuch prankes, and living in the ſame towne, ſent for him to her owne houſe, and taking him aſide into a private roome, drew her knife, and vowed ſhee would preſently cut his throat with her owne hands, if hee redreſſed not the wrong hee had done her tennants; who, after a ſaint deniall at firſt, yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed hee would preſently accompliſh her deſire, which as ſoone was performed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this villaine went but a little way into an adioining cloſſet, where with his knife he digged out of the ground a point, with certaine knots on it, with a croſſe ſticke, and I remember not if any thing elſe; after the untying of which knots, accompanied with ſome ſecret whiſpered words, this couple came preſently together, without any feeling of theſe former painfull accidents, and ever after that loved one another in ſuch a manner as became ſuch as were ioined in that honorable eſtate.</hi> And this I had from the womans owne mouth who was ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as likewiſe from the relation of the Gentlewoman her ſelfe, of whom I learned all theſe particular paſſages. <hi>Beſides, this ſame Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man told mee that another time all her pigeons came flying out of the Dove-coat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory</note> 
                  <hi>and would not by any meanes any of them goe in: the which this ſame Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

perceiving, uſed this ſame fellow after the former faſhion, and he preſently went up within the Dove-coat, and tooke out of a hole a croſſe ſticke, with a little ſalt, and I know not what elſe, and before the fellow came downe three or foure rounds of the ladder, the pigeons were all got in, and continued their former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> Beſides, I was credibly informed, by many of good worth, that this practice towards new married couples was there ſo common, that many for this cauſe married in the night time: and yet many times the Prieſt himſelfe that married them was the worker of this villainy, who, even as he married them would uſe this charming or inchaunting, call it which you will. And I was informed of three neigbouring Prieſts, in the three next adjacent townes to this Gentlemans dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who ordinarily played ſuch prankes. And while this laſted, there was neither love betwixt thoſe parties, nor the man able carnally to know his wife. And theſe relations I had from Papiſts themſelves. As for the Proteſtants, I ſpeake it unfainedly before God, I never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that I heard it practiſed among any of them, either in that Kingdome, or any other place of Chriſtendome where I have travelled: farre leſſe did I ever heare any of their Preachers to be tainted with any ſuch infamous courſes. It is then apparent that this was no vertue or power in theſe things whereof uſe was made; but was the immediate operation of <hi>Satan,</hi> who, by Gods permiſſion, and for cauſes beſt knowne to himſelfe, ſometimes ſuffered <hi>Satan</hi> to afflict the bodies of men after ſtrange manners; the which by the hiſtory of <hi>Iob,</hi> is apparent. And as for theſe amorous potions, wee finde they prove rather poiſons, than produce any amorous effect; as by that wee have already ſaid of the Poet <hi>Lucrece</hi> may appeare.

But even many of the ſame heathen Poets, who plead for all that may procure love, do often diſclaime theſe amorous medicines, as may at length in their writings appeare. And many times a love potion is pretended to colour a great deale of knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and many times a pretenſe of the affections to be forced by ſome ſuch meanes, is made a ſtalking horſe to hide and cover our owne foule luſt. <note n="y" place="margin">Idem. ibid.</note> Mine Authour rehearſeth to this purpoſe a hiſtory: <hi>Wee have knowne, ſaith</hi> Henry Jnſtitoris, <hi>and</hi> James Sernger, <hi>Doctors in divinity, an old woman, who, with her love-drinkes, not only bewitched and inchaunted three Abbots one after another, but likewiſe (as the common report goeth, yet at this ſame time amongſt the fryers of that convent) that ſhee made them all three to die, and ſet the fourth beſides himſelfe. And this ſtrumpet is not aſhamed to confeſſe in publike, that ſhee hath not only done, but continueth ſtill to doe the ſame villainy, and that theſe Abbots are not able to withdraw themſelves from her love, and that by reaſon they had eaten as much of her dung as her arme was

But</hi> (ſaith mine Authour) <hi>I am of opinion, that this dung ſhee ſaith ſhee hath made them eat, was nothing elſe but their filthy luſt and pleaſure, in the which, as in a ſtinking filthy mire, theſe Monkes being now as it were drowned, and having ſo often now taſted of this carnall and filthy luſt with this old ſtrumpet, they were now at length, as it were, ſo poiſoned, and bewitched therewith, that they were never after able to leave this beaſtly ſin, and returne againe to their right wits.</hi>

This being brought to</hi> Olympias <hi>the Queene, it is no marvell if ſhee tooke it ill, the which did yet the more trouble her, in that it was reported, that by meanes of amorous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhee had attracted the Kings affections; much therefore mooved at this matter, ſhe ſends to the lodging where ſhe lived, commanding to bring her to her, with a ſtedfaſt purpoſe and reſolution to ſhut her up in ſome dungeon or elſe to ſend her away into ſome remote country.

As concerning medicines which provoke luſt, I hold it altogether unfit for the unmarried to uſe them: and for ſuch married people only, who, for the better furtherance of procreation of children, do deſire and crave the aid of the honeſt and learned Phyſitian, to excite and ſtir up the force &amp; vigor of nature now languiſhing. As for others, yea, even in wedlocke it ſelfe, merely for wantonneſſe to increaſe their carnall luſt, I adviſe all thoſe of mine owne profeſſion, that they yeeld no ſatisfaction to theſe their diſorderly carnall luſts: and that as they will not be acceſſary to their ſinne, and as they will anſwer it at that great and dreadfull day, when that great Houſe-keeper ſhall call for a <hi>redde Rationem villicationis tuae.</hi> The like I ſay of our complexion-mongers, who, as our Taylors deviſe new faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

ſo theſe are ready to deviſe new faces, to ſuch of our diſcontented female ſexe; who, not contented with that feature and comelineſſe of face, which their Lord and Maker thought fitting, will yet make uſe of a painter. And I thinke it much derogates from the dignity and worth of an ingenuous and generous Phyſitian to abandon himſelfe to ſuch baſe imploiments (I meane, both this laſt and the former) as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come better ſome Bawd than an honeſt Artiſt, profeſſing ſo excellent and eminent a calling. <hi>Sed manum de tabula.</hi> Howbeit I could yet inſiſt at length on theſe matters, yet I haſten to that which followeth.</p>

Idem ibid</note> And ſome write of certaine families among the <hi>Triballians</hi> and <hi>Illyrians,</hi> who, if they looke earneſty, eſpecially if angrily, upon any one, they preſently kill them by their bare aſpect onely; and they likewiſe write of ſome women of <hi>Scythia,</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers living neere unto <hi>Pontus,</hi> having in one of their eyes a double bale, and in the other the ſhape of a horſe, being very terrible to behold, and who being throwne into the water, clothes and all, could not be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Now, this faſcination among the antients was ſo frequent, that the very brutes were not freed therefrom; as may by the Poet appeare. <hi>Neſcio quis teneros, &amp;c.</hi> Many other things might here out of antient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors be alleged, but that I haſten to that which followeth. Beſides this faſcination by ſight, antient Authors mention yet another kind by meanes of ſpeech and tongue. And <hi>Gellius</hi> maketh mention of whole families in <hi>Africke,</hi> bewitching with their ſpeech and tongue: who if they praiſed much either young children, trees, corne, cattell, or any thing elſe, all died, and withered away preſently. Hence have wee this cuſtome derived from antiquity, that when wee praiſe any thing in a high manner, wee uſe a kinde of prayer, deſiring God to bleſſe it, leſt, perhaps, our tongue hurt it. And there is yet another phraſe in uſe among the vulgar eſpecially, when any thing proſpereth not according to our intents and wiſhes, to ſay it is foreſpoken. But whatſoever credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous antiquity hath beleeved concerning this matter, yet in truth there is no ſuch efficacie in either of theſe as was ſuppoſed. I beleeve no ſuch ſtrange effects produced by bare beholding of any. If any children or weake natures received any ſuch venomous impreſſions from ſuch eyes, it was but rare, and ſeldome came to paſſe. And as I ſaid before, ſo here againe: why might not God ſometimes ſuffer the divell to inflict ſome hurt upon children or other, after ſome ſuch particular perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent fixing their eyes upon them, which that arch-enemy of mankinde might afterwards make them beleeve came to paſſe by reaſon of their intent aſpect; as he does ordinarily make our deluded witches beleeve that by meanes of certaine words, ſpells, or other creatures, ſuch effects are produced, howbeit moſt falſely, as ſhall preſently appeare. And that which ſome relate, that if a Wolfe ſee a man firſt, it bereaveth him of his ſpeech, is but a mere fiction.

And if I ſhould grant that ſometimes there might proceed out at the mouth ſome virulent vapours which might annoy a tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, eſpecially by neere approaching, yet tell mee, I pray thee, what ſo forcible vapours can come forth at the mouth of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man to infect forreſts of trees, and whole come-fields. It is then a cleare caſe, that when any ſuch accidents come to paſſe, they are effected by Satan himſelfe, GOD in his hid and ſecret wiſedome, and for cauſes beſt knowne to himſelfe, ſuffering ſome perſons themſelves, or their goods, to be in this enemies power: and many times ſuch perſons as are by the vulgar ſuſpected of performing ſuch ill offices, are ignorant wicked people, filled with envie and malice, often wiſhing ſuch harmes to their neighbours, which Satan by his power from above, putting preſently in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe wicked malicious people are often beleeved to be the actors; and ſometimes God in his juſtice ſuffereth ſuch to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by the ſword of the Magiſtrate, although free from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact with Satan;<note place="margin">Sathan often the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</note> God ſometimes thus juſtly puniſhing their envie and malice, and other ſinnes.

This the young woman for a while continued, and was ſo long as ſhee wore the amulet free from her former ſits: afterward being by ſome put in doubt of the lawfulneſſe of this manner of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine ſhe left it off, and ſtill after that was haunted with her old fits, as before. But being againe by ſome perſwaded, if I remember right, ſhee made againe tryall of the ſame medicine with a like effect following as before. But after a while being without the uſe of this ring, whether it was loſt, or whether ſhee left it off of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emember not well, but ſhee was ſeized with her fits as before.</hi> Now, this Miniſter demanded of me, whether I thought this to be a regular cure, and warranted by the rules of our art, and by us ordinarily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; my reply was, that cures were all either ſupernaturall, or naturall: the former proper to almighty God, and practiſed both in the old and new Teſtament. As for natural means, the Phyſitian makes uſe of them, as <hi>medicus eſt naturae miniſter,</hi> the Phyſitian being an aſſiſtant and helper of nature in time of neede. And thus Phyſitians make uſe of ſeverall ſorts of ſimples of all ſorts, variouſly prepared, and exhibited often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, ſometimes applied but outwardly, according to ſeverall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and ſuch ſimples as the Phyſitian knowes to be indued with ſuch vertues and qualities, or elſe he meddleth not with them at all. As for this ring made of a ſolid metall, although our Chymiſts attribute ſome antepilepticall quality to ſilver; yet neither uſe they this not gold it ſelfe (of the medicines whereof they tell us ſuch wonders) without a laborious and artificiall preparation, and then exhibit it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, moſt commonly in a potable forme; and yet are many times, yea, for the moſt part fruſtrat of her expected effects. And as I ſaid then, ſo I ſay now, that I ſee no naturall cauſe of this cure: the ſilver being ſo ſolid a ſubſtance, can ſend out no ſuch forcible vapors as might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo ſtrange an effect. Now, then, it reſteth it muſt either be effected by vertue of theſe barbarous words of the ring, or force of the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting faculty, and her ſtrong conceit of the excellency of the medicine: the former of the which I have already proved to be falſe, and that words have no vertue either to hurt or heale. It reſteth then, if by any meanes, it was by vertue of her ſtrong imagination, by reaſon of the high conceit ſhee had of this medicinall ring. But this is falſe: for howſover ſhee might at firſt have ſome high conceit hereof, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her minde was quite altered, and what ſhee then did, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt her judgement, and with feare, as not being perſwaded of the lawfulneſſe thereof. But now I appeale to the ingenuous and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unpartiall reader, whether this be fit and comely for a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to make uſe of ſuch meanes, which, ſuppoſe they be not unlawfull, yet at leaſt are they ſuſpicious. And the Apoſtle wiſheth us <hi>to abſteine from all appearance of evill;</hi> if this precept my be extended to all Clergie men. And whether there be not here at leaſt an appearance of evill, that I ſay no further, let the learned and judicious judge. I cannot dwell longer upon this point, but wiſh maſter parſon now in his old age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now <hi>capularis ſenex,</hi> to leave theſe vanities, and betake himſelfe to doe what good he can in his owne miniſteriall function, not meddling
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:20476:202"/>
with ſuch things eſpecially, as have bin by the honeſteſt and moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of all ages condemned; and ſo may he at that great day of account give up a good reckoning. Now, becauſe in this point of faſcination there is often much uſe made of imagination, and having beene lately alſo mentioned, it ſhall not be impertinent, ere wee proceed further, to ſay ſomething thereof.</p>
               <p>I purpoſe not here to enter into any exquiſite and accurate Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall diſcourſe, concerning this ſubject, nor yet the ſtrange effects thereby produced, but to demonſtrate the erroneous opinion of ſome concerning the ſame. <note n="p" place="margin">Phantaſia eſt ſenſus interior, ſpecies a ſenſu communi perceptas, vel a ſe formatas diutius retinens, &amp; diligentius examinans, <hi>Magir-Phyſiol.</hi> caep. <hi>7.</hi> lib. <hi>6.</hi> ex <hi>Ariſt. 3.</hi> de anima.</note>

But all theſe ſtrange effects are yet imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and confined within the body imagining, not tranſient or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon any outward object. For although wee ofte gape or make water when we ſee ſome others doe ſuch things, yet is this but by way of remembrance, and being excited by their example, and not forced thereunto by their imagination.

And this hath been by our <hi>Arabians</hi> ſtrongly mainteined, that the ſoule approached neereſt to the celeſtiall underſtandings, and by that meanes was indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with extraordinary vertues and powers, and among the reſt, to command inferiour natures.

                  <hi>Crollius</hi> tells us yet ſtrange things of this imagination; to wit, <hi>it dependeth wholly upon the ſtarres, yea, that it is all one with them, as alſo, that the firmament it ſelfe is indued with imagination, howbeit it be void of reaſon; as man hath imagination with reaſon. And that the whole heaven is nothing elſe but mere imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſending downe upon this inferiour world,</hi> fevers, peſtilences, <hi>and the like, without any corporeall inſtrument. And this imagination,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is as a load-ſtone, yea, farre exceeding the ſame, working beyond thouſands of miles: yea, ſaith be, in its exaltation it attracteth from the elements whatſoever it pleaſeth. So that theſe wiſe men can attract the power and vertues of the ſtarres into any image, metall, or any other thing whatſoever; inſomuch, that the power and efficacy therof may therin plainly and conſpicuouſly be ſeen.</hi> Many more ſuch things may there be ſeen, the confutation of the which fooleries may in the forenamed <hi>Libavius</hi> at great length be ſeene: where the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour juſtly taxeth the other, that if hee can attract any thing from the
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:20476:203"/>
elements, as hee ſeemeth to have both heaven and earth at command, why then doth not he and his fellowes help the publike in time of need? And why did he not, ſaith hee, in the yeere 1613. draw downe ſome warmth, to qualifie the extreme cold of that nipping winter: and if he can doe good to the publike, and be ſo envious, it is a pitty, ſaith he, but he had beene buried in the ſnow. I adde yet, where were all our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-mongers this laſt yeere 1630. where drouth, and by conſequence famine and ſcarcity prevailed through the moſt parts of Chriſtendome? It was a very malicious minde, that had no pitty of the publike. If they would not helpe their enemies, yet they might have helpt their friends. But I am ſure for all their ſtrong imaginations, if our poore people had not found more reall comfort by the charity of well diſpoſed people, they might often have dined with Duke <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and gone ſupperleſſe to bed.

This ſame laſt yeere there came forth a little Tractat, diſclaiming the uſe of this ointment, and proving it altogether unlawfull. But the ſame yeere there was by a learned Phyſitian of the Colledge of London publiſhed an other Tractat, wherein he not onely labours to confute his adverſaries arguments (wherein I confeſſe hee ſatisfies me not, whatſoever he doth others) but with might and maine, by a freſh ſupply of arguments and examples, labours to uphold and mainteine the credit of the Weapon-ſalve. In the firſt place then to divert our thoughts from any conceit of a cacomagicall cure (ſo I cal it according to his owne mind) or diabolicall cure; the defendant (ſo here I call the Doctor,<note place="margin">The Devil may often do things apparently good, as cure diſeaſes and the like.</note> as the impugning Parſon the plaintiffe) takes great paines to prove, and that by many places of Scripture, that becauſe God alone operateth all in all eſſentially, therefore there is no devill nor evill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that can produce any good worke or doe any good, his nature being deſtructive and altogether evill, quite contrary to the manner of Gods ſpirits operation; and therefore that he is altogether for hurting but never for healing of mankind. As for Gods omnipotent power and goodneſſe, that hee is good, yea goodneſſe it ſelfe, to prove the ſame were but to ſpend our time in vaine: as likewiſe, that the divell is the prince of darkneſſe, aiming at the overthrow and utter ruine both of the ſoule and body of man, cannot be denied. And although his end be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies evill, yet is his purpoſe not alwaies proſecuted after one and the ſame manne. Can any deny this <note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> text, that <hi>Satan oftentimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth himſelfe into an angell of light?</hi> And what more contrary than
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:20476:204"/>
light and darkneſſe? Why doth he thus transforme himſelfe? Is it not becauſe he cannot alwaies in his owne lively colours deceive every one; and therefore when the Lions skinne will not ſerve the turne, he puts on that of the Lamb. It will perhaps be objected, that then his actions are ſtill evill, which is the point in hand. I anſwere, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever indeed that be true, yet it ſerveth our turne, if theſe actions be apparently good, which is that moſt men looke after. Now that God oftentimes ſuffereth the devill and his inſtruments to doe ſome appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent good, in healing ſome diſeaſes, &amp;c: if any ſhall deny, experience of all ages will evince the contrary.

Beſides (as the ſame Authour allegeth) that the fleſh and the blood are not here as divers and diſtinct ſet downe, as differing ſo much one from another, but the ſame in ſubſtance; and yet was the fleſh of beaſts even then permitted to be eaten, and ſo was the milke, being nothing elſe but blood refined and dealbuted or whitened in theſe gloobus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millarie glands.

And as for the ſpirits in the blood, wee juſtly deny ſo active operating ſpirits in the blood now ſeparated from the body.

And what if the blood be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied by the poxe, plague, poiſon, or any other contagious diſeaſe, the blood being ſtarke naught, ſhall theſe corrupt ſpirits be ſo powerfull and efficacious? Surely, the more we ſtirre in this buſineſſe, the more it ſtinketh.

On theſe, I ſay, and the like places, impiouſly (in mine opinion) and out of purpoſe alledged, I cannot now longer inſiſt, but leave them to the ſcanning and judging of by the judicious and learned Divine, and come to the manner of cure.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt intreate the Reader to call to mind what was firſt ſaid concerning this cure. In the firſt place then the blood was to bee ſtanched, the wound waſhed with the patients owne urine, and well bound up: and that the Author might act his part more handſomely, if a bone were broken then he put into this ointment ſome comfrey rrots. The condition and quality was that it were neither of any principall part, nor yet yet that any nerve or arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie were cut. And what need ſuch adoe about nothing, this being ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily by nature effected? Waſh an ordinary wound, and keepe it cleane, and I warrant it will heale without this curious ointment, which effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth juſt nothing,<note place="margin">This ointment effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth iuſt nothing.</note> eſpecially as it is uſed. The beaſts (dogges eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally) wee ſee licking a wound or ulcer, and by this meanes keeping it cleane from corruption (the chiefe impediment hindring the healing) is thus eaſily cured without either ſtitching or any other helpe. And therefore if this have beene accounted impoſtorious to make the world beleeve that was done by the vertue of ſuch ointment wherewith the weapon was anointed,<note place="margin">Sympatheticall and why.</note> let no man marvell. This manner of cure is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſympatheticall and magneticall by way of ſympathy and attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and from the ſuppoſed attracted vertue from the ſtarres, <hi>ſtellatum,</hi> or ſtarrie ointment. Now, as concerning the operating vertue by ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,<note place="margin">In ſympathies the things ſympathiſing are not farre remote one from another.</note> as I doe not deny, ſo I ſay the ſame is not here to be ſeene; and where this ſympathy is to be found, the things ſympathiſing are not far remote one from another: as in the uniſone harmony and conſent of

two lutes or vialls may eaſily appeare, which is the defendants owne inſtance. But let any one touch the ſtring of a lute or viall, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the uniſone ſtring of another lute a mile off will make any vibrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſtirring of the ſtraw, or make it leape from one thing to the other uniſon with that of a miles or more diſtance; ſuppoſe alſo there be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wind ſtirring, nor interpoſition of houſes, or any other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatſoever. And therefore the length of a table is no proportionat diſtance to that often, yea, twenty miles of the operation of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-ſalve, as is applied by our defendant. And as little, or farre leſſe for this purpoſe make the reſt of his examples of ſympathie: as of the maw or guſſord of fowles, alleaged for this ſame ſympathie, good to corroborate the ſtomacke, braines to braines, lungs to lungs, heart to heart, guts to guts, &amp;c. If I ſhould yet grant all this to be true (whereof I have yet juſt cauſe to doubt, if not to deny, whatſoever ſome others have held to the contrary; and fox lungs working by their abſterſive and opening quality) yet would all this make juſt nothing for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, theſe working, <hi>per contactum phyſicum,</hi> by mutuall contact, and their operation exuſcitated and actuated by the internall naturall heat; but none of them producing any ſuch effect at a miles or more remote diſtance.

And as concerning the point of the needle compaſſe alwaies looking to the North, that is not univerſally tree: for ſailing towards the Werſterne world, paſſing under the <hi>Meridian</hi> of <hi>Aſores</hi> or <hi>Terceres</hi> Ilands, the compaſſe then turnes, and lookes not towards the North pole as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. And not onely there, but even in our owne hemiſphere al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:20476:207"/>
that the needle of the compaſſe declines from the line looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, from the <hi>Canarie</hi> Ilands to <hi>Carygara,</hi> about ſome nine degrees. But of this ſubject, although I could ſay a great deale more, yet this ſhall here ſuffice. And in the fire this is yet more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, where there is an emanation of heat, which warmeth at a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate diſtance: and therefore although the fire heat, and warme at a remote diſtance, yet is this not indefinite, but proportioniate, the fire warming according to the bigneſſe of the fire, and the propinquitie or remoteneſſe of the object.<note place="margin">Fire warmeth not at any indefinite diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce</note> And therefore although the fire be a very active agent, yet make a fire of ten or twenty load of wood or coales, and in a cold froſtie morning let any ſtand a mile or two off, yea, although there be neither hill, nor any other obſtacle betwixt, yet let him tell me what great warmth he findes thereby. As for the diſtance alleaged, ſometimes to interceed betwixt the bullet and the party thereby offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,<note place="margin">In all theſe there is ſtill a phyſicall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact, which is not in the Weapon-ſalve.</note> it makes as little for the purpoſe: for the bullet violently beats the aire, the aire thus agitated, worketh ſuch a violent impreſſion on the bodie: and the like may be ſaid of the lithning producing the like effect. But this aire ſo agitate by ſuch an agent will not offend the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie many miles diſtant from thence. <hi>A friend of mine told mee, that in a hot skirmiſh, betwixt the</hi> Engliſh <hi>and the</hi> Portugalls, <hi>in the Eaſt</hi> Indies, <hi>a bullet ſhot from the enemies ſhip, paſt over him within a yard or little more of his head, and yet never hurt him.</hi>

The like is likewiſe here in our owne countries, by meanes of the bloſſomes of peaſe and beanes obſerved. And yet this ointment, being ſo little in quantitie, notwithſtanding all winds, or other interceding rubs or hinderances, can by a direct line ſend out for many miles a ſanative vertue from this ſalve and beſmeared weapon to the wound. Now, yet ſomewhat more concerning this operating medicine, beſides the blood beſmeared on the weapon, there is alſo great ſtore ſpilt upon the ground, and on the patients clothes, and in the ſame, no doubt, great ſtore of ſpirits, and therefore the greater ſtore of blood be effuſed, the ſooner ſhould the cure be performed: and if thoſe few ſpirits in ſo ſmall a quantitie of blood ſo far remote from the patient produce ſuch ſtupendious effects, ſhall all thoſe ſpirits of the hot blood ſo neere the patient be idle, and of none effect? But I will yet demand further, whether the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared on the weapon, or that mingled with the ointment gives this efficacie and operation. If that in the ointment, how then, when there is no blood in the ſame,<note place="margin">The blood uſed in the Weapon-ſalve is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But if they
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:20476:207"/>
will yet hold ſo neere a ſympathy, then this cannot hold betwixt thoſe that differ ſo much, it may be in complexion, and many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but eſpecially betwixt man and beaſt.<note place="margin">This neer ſympathy, if any, ceaſeth, the blood being once ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</note> But if we ſhould yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of this ſympathy, yet when the blood is now ſeparated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, this ſympathie alſo ceaſeth: and although there remaine ſome vertue in the parts ſo ſeparated, yet are they farre different from thoſe of a living man, a dead man being a man onely equivocally: for the which cauſe it commeth alſo to paſſe, that of the dead carkaſe of a man are ingendred ſome other creatures, but never a man being of the ſame <hi>ſpecies.</hi> And hence alſo is evinced the impertinency of the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants compariſon betwixt the blood and a graine of corne: for, as I ſaid, the blood now ſeparated from the body hath loſt thoſe lively ſpirits and operations it injoyed being within the body; therefore when as being yet within the body,<note place="margin">Blood now ſeparated from the body, hath not ſuch active ſpirits as before, neither yet hath it that potential energy as a graine of corne.</note> it was not able to produce any ſuch effect at ſo far a diſtance, farre leſſe now reteining onely the nature of a part of a dead carkaſe. But the caſe is not alike with the graine of corne, which hath not yet left its proper forme and potentiall energie to produce another corne like it ſelfe, being ſowne in a fit and convenent ſoile, as the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt husbandman in the country can tell; and when I ſhall have as good triall of the former as of the later, and as good reaſon, I ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to beleeve it. And therefore the ſeede of generation of man, being ſowen in a fruitfull ſoile, had been more pertinent to be compared with a graine of corne, howbeit it is true, this would not have proved the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the defendant tooke in hand. The blood had farre more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently beene compared with the chaffe or ſtraw: and as the ſtraw will never produce corne, ſow it and dung it as much as you will, no more will the blood produce any ſuch effect as is pretended, order it as you pleaſe. There is then no ſympatheticall nor magneticall cure perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by this ointment, as is erroneouſly pretended. This opinion ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolles too much with <hi>Paracelſus</hi> his imagination, whereof ſomething hath beene lately ſaid. As concerning the cruentation,<note place="margin">The bleeding of the dead corps is not a certain and undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſigne whereby to diſcover the murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> or bleeding of the corps killed, at the preſence of the murtherer, it would take up a larger time to diſcourſe of, than I can here well ſpare. Some would have it by antipathy, and ſome otherwiſe; howſoever, it is not alwaies obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to hold true, although ſome ſtrange things concerning the ſame are received, beſides, that ſometimes ſome innocents have beene by this meanes accuſed. And if this come by antipathy, then when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the approaching of ſome whom the deceaſed dearely loved, it muſt come to paſſe by ſympathy; and thus ſhall wee have one and the ſame effect produced by two ſo contrary cauſes: and therefore the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant findes as little helpe here, as in the other arguments. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be obſerved, the time of the yeere,<note place="margin">Many things may hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or further this bleeding.</note> the ſite or ſituation of the dead, the nature or quality of the blood, magicall ſpells, with many other things, may hinder or further ſuch an effect: as alſo when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Magiſtrate or other maketh the party ſuſpected, put his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the wound, &amp;c. And therefore I adviſe Magiſtrates not to be too raſh in giving credit to every ſuch ſhew of detecting a ſuſpected perſon.<note place="margin">This oyntment recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertue from the ſtarres.</note> And as concerning the operation this ointment taketh (as is ſuppoſed) from the ſtarres, I have already proved, that many times this
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:20476:208"/>
cure is as well performed by other things where there are no ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents collected with the obſervations of the heavens. And as I doe not deny a power from the ſuperiour powers of the heavens upon our inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſublunary things here below; ſo in like manner doe I acknowledge the ſame to be but generall, and ſo effect things here below, as they find them diſpoſed. And even in ſome of thoſe moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly received and ſubject to our ſenſes, all is not ſo cleare, but may admit of ſome doubts.<note place="margin">Whether the Moone be the cauſe of the ebbing and ſtowing of the ſea.</note> As who makes any queſtion of the Moones predominant po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over humid and moiſt things; and hence is the cauſe of the fluxe and refluxe of the ſea aſcribed to this planet, together with the ſpring-tides, and yet might it be asked why have wee ſo high a ſpring-tide in the change of the Moone, when ſhee is quite hid from our ſight, and ſhines not in our horizon, as well as when ſhe ſhines in her full and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt glory and ſplendour: and likewiſe ſince the ſea in moſt places keepes a like time of ebbing and flowing, yet in ſome other againe, it ebbes and flowes farre oftner,<note place="margin">It ebbeth &amp; floweth there ſeven times in 24, houres.</note> as in the <hi>Euripe</hi> and at <hi>Burdeaux</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> And why againe in ſome places it neither ebbeth nor floweth: as in the <hi>Balticke</hi> ſea; of ſome of which, althoug ſome have indeavoured to render a reaſon, yet are they not ſatisfactory and without doubts. If there be then ſuch doubt concerning this neereſt planet unto us of all others, what may wee ſay of the remoteſt fixed ſtarres, and their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſuppoſed influences? And therefore although ſuperiour bodies produce due effects upon theſe inferior creatures, yet have they no ſuch particular influences upon theſe inferiour bodies, as is ſuppoſed. And ſince the ſtarres are of ſo vaſt a bigneſſe, that the leaſt fixed ſtarre farre exceedeth the whole earth in bigneſſe, they ſend not downe ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular influences upon the particular ſubjects, but affect theſe inferiour things, as wee have ſaid already. And therefore wee juſtly deny thoſe particular influences upon particular ſimples,<note place="margin">Starts make not ſome bodies ſtiptick and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prone to fluxes.</note> as wee have ſaid. As with like reaſon doe wee deny that ſome ſtarres make the body ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, and ſome againe prone to fluxes. But wee finde by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in obſtructed bodies, without previous preparation, phyſicke will not ſo well produce its expected effect. But becauſe ſomething concerning this hath beene ſaid already, I will here ſurceaſe; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all I would have the reader take notice of one point whereby the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant would faine ſeeme to mainteine the credit of particular effects of the ſtarres; he wreſts and detorts ſome places of Scripture, as in other paſſages of his booke may evidently appeare. Hee makes uſe then firſt of that place of <hi>Eccleſiaſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.1.2, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a time to plant and a time to pull up.</hi> What can be here collected, but that we are in all our actions to lay hold on the right time and oportunity, as he inſtanceth in the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and here he ſhall finde no particular influence. As little for his purpoſe maketh that place of the <hi>Pſalme:</hi>

                     <hi>The Sunne ſhall not burne thee by day, nor the Moone by night,</hi> where <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth his confidence in God ſo much, that nothing can hurt him, no, not the Sunne himſelfe, nor the Moone, theſe being the two planets that have moſt powerful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Neither is here any particular influencee vinced, but ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary operations as are by them produced upon theſe ſublunary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And if I ſhould grant the Moone produced the Epilepſie (which
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:20476:208"/>
is yet to prove) yet would it not prove this particular influence. Againe, there is a place produced out of the <note n="a" place="margin">Epheſ. 6.11.</note>

I wil proceed no further to this apocriphall proofe, which, notwithſtanding, would ſtand him in as little ſtead. Now, I proceed to that which remaineth.</p>
                  <p>All the former arguments and allegations ſeeming too weake,<note place="margin">The curing by the weapon ſalve accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted miraculous, and ſometimes miſticall.</note> and the credit of the weapon-ſalve now being in danger, the defendant is forced to flee to a miraculous operatoion, whereat indeed, in moſt of thoſe generall paſſages concerning the Almighty power of God hee aimeth at. And thus it appeareth, that not onely in ſome places, hee calleth it miraculous, but affirmeth, that <hi>that man that beleeveth, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon this ſpirit, may effect what hee deſireth,</hi> and that <hi>even by the true knowledge and uſe of it, the Prophets and Apoſtles did wonders, as well in curing, as effecting matters of greater moment.</hi> Now, that the Spirit, or omnipotent power of the Almighty, can doe whatſoever it pleaſeth, is without all controverſie; howbeit here he ſeemeth to intimate unto us this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or power of working miracles, and then immediatly afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to the dead blood. I know not what hee meanes to make ſuch a mingle mangle of miracles with this working of the weapon-ſalve. If it be miraculous, like the cures performed by the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, let it appeare, and wee will beleeve it; and if this be true, hee might have ſpared all this labour in alleaging falſly ſo many places of Scripture with his other arguments. And yet I deny, that he that hath the gift of miracles may doe what hee liſteth:<note place="margin">

I beleeve it is not the cuſtome either of the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> or his enemies, to lap up their weapons by a fire-ſide; and yet, if one ſhould make inquiry, hee ſhould find, that many of them were not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding eaſily cured without great paine,<note place="margin">The ambient air<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some wounds againe in regard of the ambient aire, although but ſmall, and in themſelves ſeeming ſecure, yet many times prove mortall: that I ſay nothing of the ſeverall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of bodies, time of the yeere, the country, age and ſex, &amp;c. But it ſeemeth this cure like an Empiricke contemneth and neglecteth all ſuch circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>As for the ſigne of life and death by the blood ſweaty drops,<note place="margin">The like may be ſaid concerning drops of blood on the weapon when the patient tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Powder of red ſanders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laid upon the weapon being warme, and being moiſter then it may make a ſhew of bloody ſweat, and then this is but to cozen the world: and if otherwiſe, it is already anſwered. And as for the knowledge of life and death by a lampe made of his blood with the ſpirit of wine, I have already touched it, and if any ſuch thing be effected, it is more like to bee produced by art diabolicall than otherwiſe. As for that which is alleaged, that lying with a menſtruous woman will fruſtrate the operation, I hold that the carnall knowledge of any woman is hurtfull to the wounded; and this ſtandeth to farre better reaſon than that the perſon that anointeth the weapon, lying with a woman ſhould be hurtfull to the wound. But on theſe and the like I will not any longer inſiſt, but proceed to ſome examples.</p>
                  <p>Now although that which hath beene ſaid already might ſuffice to prove the invalidity and unlawfulneſſe of this cure,<note place="margin">Lying with menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous women.</note> yet will we ſay ſomething of theſe examples alſo. Theſe examples then are of two ſorts, either of ſuch cures are ſuppoſed to have beene performed by the weapon-ſalve, or of other magneticall and ſympatheticall cures (as
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:20476:210"/>
the defendant calls them) ſeeming farre ſtranger than thoſe perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by this ointment. As for the firſt ſort then, admit they have been performed, wherein I will not call in queſtion the relaters credit, of what quality ſoever, the queſtion is not here <hi>de facto,</hi> as we ſay, but <hi>de jure;</hi> not whether there hath beene any ſuch cure performed, but by what meanes, and therefore they are of no validitie. And the invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of this argument deſumed from iſſue and event, I have already in the beginning of this diſcourſe anſwered. Of one of thoſe cure not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I will ſpeake a word.<note place="margin">Hiſtorie.</note> 
                     <hi>A fellow</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>had his finger cut with a ſith, and when the blood could not bee ſtanched, the Noble man his Maſter wiſhed to knocke off the handle of the ſith, and ſend him the very ſigh to anoint; the which, the wounded fellow himſelfe went about, and at the very firſt knocke he gave the ſith that had wounded him the blood ſtanched.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The myſtery of this cure new aſcribed to the ſecret or inviſible ſpirit in the blood, and not to the ſalve.</note> In the ſame place he avoucheth that the ſame noble perſonage acknowledged, that although there <hi>were not drop of blood to be diſcerned on the weapon, yet if hee anointed the place of the weapon that made the wound (which oftentimes he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed was done by gueſſe) he did aſwell performe the cure, as if the blood had ſtucke upon it. out of which revelation or detection</hi> (ſaith our Defendant, for they are his owne words) <hi>I gather, that all the myſtery of this cure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the ſecret and inviſible ſpirit that is within the blood, aſwell remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill and operating in the wounded body, as that which hath penetrated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly into the weapon: or elſe without the preſence of the viſible blood it could not operate.</hi> Out of which I againe likewiſe collect, that if all this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery conſiſt in the ſecret and inviſible ſpirit of the blood; then no part of this myſtery conſiſteth in the ſalve; and ſo by conſequence the variety of ingredients blood,<note place="margin">The ſalve then is of no efficacie.</note> fat, mummy, moſſe and bones, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the ſtarres and poſition of the heavens in the collection and compoſition are of no efficacy, and not to be regarded, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it will follow that this is a meere gull and tricke put upon the world to cozen them, and by this meanes the cure will anſwere the name by ſome impoſed,<note place="margin">Marke well.</note> to wit impoſtorious. Againe, whereas it is ſaid, that the cure was aſwell performed without any blood to be ſeene upon the weapon, as with it; that the ſame Noble man ingeniouſly confeſſed, that he was often forced to anoint the weapon by gueſſe, I againe gather this concluſion, that the former tenent of the emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpirits of the blood in the wound to that of the weapon, and the ſympathy betwixt both is frivolous and idle. The weapon is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times anointed by gueſſe, there being no blood ſticking on the ſame whereby to diſcerne it; and yet this ſtout Champion, where both ſenſe and reaſon faile, loath to have the foile will needes have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the blood to bee there by ſecret penetration. I thought ſtrange before to heare of ſo ſubtile, penetrant ſpirits of blood ſeparated from the body, and now I confeſſe I am more amazed to heart as much of the emanation of ſpirits of blood where no blood at al is to be ſeene. In a peice of wood, perhaps, there might be more appearance of this pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating ſpirit, but in yron or ſteele it is farre more unlikely.

This cure of the <hi>Jaundize</hi> is performed by meanes of a paſte made of the aſhes of certaine wood againſt the <hi>Jaundize,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the urine of the patient,<note place="margin">A ball for the cure of the Iaundize at ſuch a diſtance.</note> with a blade of ſaffron in the top each ball.

                     <hi>and ſonne to an antient, reverend, grave Divine this laſt yeere</hi> 1631. <hi>having for a while loſt the uſe of his rationall part, for a long time uſed the Counſell and advice of ſome learned and expert Phyſitians of the City of</hi> London, <hi>of whoſe labours, notwithſtanding, no ſudden effect did follow, ſo that at length they deſiſted from any further adminiſtring Phyſicke. In the meane time during this reſt, mention is made of certaine Empirick, a Barber by profeſsion, but accounted very famous for ſuch cures. The friends of the patient taking hold of any hope of doing him good, commune with this barber</hi> Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius, <hi>who would not under</hi> 20. <hi>pounds undertake his cure, and for that ſumme he made no queſtion of the cure: and after ſome dayes demurre, the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents friends ſtanding upon the ſumme demanded, the patient ſuddenly recovers without any further meanes than what had beene formerly by his Phyſitians pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</hi>
                     <pb n="379" facs="tcp:20476:212"/>
Some were ready to cenſure the Phyſitians,<note place="margin">See then how much the learned Artiſt is often injured.</note> that they could not helpe him: and had this bold Empiricke exhibited the leaſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine (yea although contrary to the diſeaſe, as is with them moſt common and frequent) the whole credit of this cure had beene aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to this ignorant Empiricke, whereas, next vnto God, it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the meanes thoſe learned and rationall phyſitians uſed, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the effect ſo ſuddenly followed not. But leaving divers other things I could except againſt this <hi>Jaundize</hi> cure, I proceed.</p>
                  <p>To confirme this wonderfull working of the Weapon-ſalve, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is not contented with homebred examples, but ſeekes abroad for forraine aid. He tells us of a Noble man of <hi>Italy</hi> recovering a noſe loſt. <hi>This Noble man having at a combate loſt his noſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hiſtory of an <hi>Italian</hi> Noble man recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twice a new noſe</note> 
                     <hi>afterwards by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Phyſitian, for a ſumme of money and liberty, got his ſlave to yeeld to wound his arme, and ſo joyned his owne wounded noſe to his ſlaves wounded arme, and ſo cauſed bind them faſt together, untill theſe two fleſhes were united and aſsimilated, and after a collop or gobbet of fleſh was cut out of the ſlaves arme, and faſhioned like a noſe unto this Lord, and ſo handled by the Surgeon that it ſerved for a noſe. The ſlave manumitted and rewarded went from</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne <hi>to</hi> Naples. <hi>Afterwards it fell out that this ſlave died, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the Lords noſe did gangrenate and rot off, whereupon the part of the noſe which he had of the dead man, was by the Doctors advice cut away, and hee being animated by the foreſaid experience, followed the advice of the ſame Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, which was to wound in like manner his owne arme, and to apply it to his wounded and mutilated noſe, and to endure with patience till all was compleate as before. Hee with animoſity and patience, did undergoe the brunt, and ſo his noſe continued with him untill his death.</hi> Here is then the ſtorie which the Doctor had by relation. Upon this is concluded an undoubted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and this example taken for a ſtrong argument to prove the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Weapon-ſalve, how truely let us a little inquire. From hence (ſaies hee) is inferred, that the concourſe of theſe two ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or rather (as he calls them) one ſpirit, being as a line ſtretched out from the extremities of ſo farre a diſtance, could neither by the tall hills of <hi>Hetruria,</hi> nor yet the high <hi>Apennine</hi> mountaines bee ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. In the firſt place then, for the credit of the Hiſtory wee have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Authors owne bare relation, ſo that wee muſt take it upon his truſt; and how well it is knowne in <hi>Italy,</hi> I am ignorant.<note place="margin">This makes nothing for the confirmation of the matter in hand</note> But put the caſe this were yet true, what will his new noſe make for the confirmation of the matter in hand. Hee ſayes it was related to him that immediatly upon the death of the ſlave, the Noble mans noſe gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grenated and rotted off. Well,<note place="margin">This artificiall noſe might rot off about the ſame time the ſlave died, caſually, or yet by reaſon of a like radicall temperature of the part with the whole.</note> I am neither certaine of the time nor manner; and yet of this am ſure enough, that many have not onely had their noſes, but ſome other parts alſo rotted off, with the <hi>Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane</hi> or catholicke diſeaſe. What doe I know whether this might not be ſo, and concurre about the time of the ſlaves death, it may bee a little before or after, or what, if at the very ſame inſtant? What from this effect will follow for the fortifying of this former poſition. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over what, if, as we ſometimes obſerve neere kinsfolkes, brothers, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, &amp;c: by reaſon of a like radicall temperature fall ſicke, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dye at one and the ſame time, although many miles aſunder,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:20476:213"/>
as I could inſtance in examples of mine owne and other mens obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, if I did not feare to treſpaſſe on the readers patience: ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe this ſlave and that piece of his fleſh, although now incorporated with the Noble mans noſe, participating of one radicall temperature (notwithſtanding ſome difference in their late aliments) might both periſh at one and the ſame time. Divers other things concerning this ſame point I were yet able to ſay, if it were neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> howſoever, if it were but this, that it might be a catholicke, <hi>Neapolitane</hi> noſe, and ſo periſh without any poaſting and repoaſting of catholicke ſpirits o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Hetrurian</hi> or <hi>Apennine</hi> mountaines,<note place="margin">There might be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanical operation.</note> may ſuffice. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Defendants peremptory opinion, that here can be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Divell, I affirme, that as wiſe men, at lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> as will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the contrary, might here maintaine a poſſibility of ſatanicall operation, but I will not inſiſt upon this point. And thus by way of conceſſion of the ſuppoſed truth of the ſtory, it is apparent, that this ſtory proves no more than any of the former, which without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might well ſatisfy the Reader. But beſides that which hath been already ſaid, what if I ſhould hold this artificiall reparation of noſes ſcarce to bee faiſable, and this ſtory conſequently to be falſe? I can produce mine Author, one of the famouſeſt <note n="l" place="margin">Quod ſi integer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus velnaſi portio peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus exciſa fucrit, non ſperabilis re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But to daw now towards an end of this controverted point, I thinke it is now apparent to the indifferent and unpartiall Reader, that this cure by the weapon-ſalve cannot be ranked amongſt ordinary naturall cures, being neither performed <hi>per contactum phyſicum,</hi> nor being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpheare of activity, as the plaintiffe well pleadeth, howbeit, in mine opinion, the defendant anſwereth not ſo pertinently. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, there is no ſuch manner of operation recorded in holy writ. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cures are there performed <hi>per contactum phyſicum:</hi> as <note n="m" place="margin">Iſaiah 28.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> ſore healed by a lump of figges, a medicine befitting the ſame. Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous cures have ſometimes conceived <hi>contactum phyſicum,</hi> howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the inſtrument uſed have in it no ſuch energy or efficacy: as the river Jordan to cure the Leproſie, clay to cure the blinde, &amp;c: As we have already inſtanced. Sometimes againe is no inſtrument at all uſed, but the abſolute Power of the Almighty: as in the lepers, para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyticks and others may be obſerved. But ſuch cures as this of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon-ſalve we have no where in Scripture recorded. And thoſe who uſe ſuch cures, let them take heed leſt they fall ſuddenly in to Satans ſnares. I doe not deny, that many excellent and rare concluſions are by that called naturall magicke, or wiſedome brought to paſſe. But I affirme againe, that this ſame hath often proved a ſtalking horſe to cover a great deale of cacomagicall impiety, as might eaſily bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This ſpirit of error hath now by the experience of ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeeres well improved his cunning and skill in ſeducing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving mankind, and although he yet many times eaſily ſeduce the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler ſort, and weaker ſex, eſpecially by reall contracts and bonds; yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

                  </note> learned late writer that laboureth much to prove this, howbeit in my opinion to ſmall purpoſe. His firſt argument is taken from the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Paraphraſts, who both in both places <hi>(Geneſis,</hi> I meane, and the <hi>Canticles)</hi> tranſlate this word Dudaim,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bed</hi> and <hi>Dudaim</hi> have divers ſignifications.</note>

Againe, ſaith he, both the ſeptua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint, and the old <hi>Latine</hi> tranſlation hath tranſlated this word Dudaim, <hi>Mandragora</hi> in both places. Againe, ſaith he, Dod, and in the plurall Dodim, ſignifieth love or charity; and therefore the breaſt and paps are alſo called by this name, being, as he ſaith, the ſeat of love, and in forme like this apple. But the truth is, that whatſoever faire flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes theſe reaſons may make, yet in them is no certaine nor aſſured truth. For as concerning the ſignification of the word he himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that the word Dod from whence Dudaim is derived, beſides this ſignification, ſignifieth alſo a caldron, and laboureth alſo to apply this to the forme of the <hi>Mandrake:</hi> and againe, Dod ſignifieth an uncle, and Dodah an aunt, from the effect of love, and would have this <hi>Greeke</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

To come then to our purpoſe, it ſeemeth this word is not proper to this plant onely, or rather is a generall word,<note place="margin">It is a generall word, as appeareth by the tranſlation of <hi>Junius,</hi> and <hi>Tremellius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe being a Iew.</note> ſignifying well-ſmelling fruits or flowers; as doth appeare by the late tranſlation of the learned <hi>Tremellius,</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a <hi>Jew,</hi> and his friend <hi>Junius,</hi> who both in both theſe places where this word is onely found, tranſlate it well-ſmelling fruits or flowers; in <hi>Engliſh</hi> indeed, in both places it is tranſlate <hi>Mandrakes.</hi> Now if wee but conſider a right this place of the Canticles, it ſeemeth to ſtand to beſt reaſon that it ſhould be tranſlated ſweet ſmelling flowers, or at leaſt, of very pleaſant and delectable fruit, there being mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it the vine and pomegranat; and after all manner of pleaſant fruits.

                  </note> This ſoporiferous and narcoticke quality (ſay our Chymiſts) proceedeth from a narcoticke ſulphur, whereof this loathſome ſmell is an individuall aſſiſtant. <hi>Galen</hi> alſo himſelfe judgeth of the quality of the ſimples, not only by the taſte, but alſo by the ſmell: and ſuch as are of a ſweet and pleaſant ſmell, not only he, but all other Phyſitians after him, account to comfort and corroborate the ſpirits, and principall parts; which no man yet ever affirmed of any narcoticke: nay, nor yet of <hi>Tabacco</hi> it ſelfe, although growing betwixt the <hi>Tropicks</hi> in <hi>Trinidad.</hi> Is it then likely, that the holy Ghoſt, and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> his Pen-man, and ſo well skilled in the nature and vertue of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, would ranke a venomous plant among ſo pleaſant fruits or flowers? But put the caſe, that this ſimple growing in thoſe hot Eaſterne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, did ſmell well, and loſt that loathſome and unpleaſant ſmell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to ſuch ſimples (which, notwithſtanding, is not likely, theſe hot countries commonly intending their properties and ſmell, as appeareth in <hi>Tabbaco,</hi> &amp;c.) yet then, why may not I with as good reaſon affirme, that many of our ordinary fruits or flowers, tranſplanted into <hi>Salomons</hi> pleaſant garden, might much improve their former properties and ſmells, inſomuch, that they might farre ſurpaſſe this plant and fruit, and ſo ſhould be in ſmall requeſt, where there were ſo many better? I thinke now I have made it to the indifferent and unpartiall reader, plainly appeare, that there is ſmall probability, that this Mandrake mentioned in the Scripture, is our Mandrake. And put yet the caſe it had beene ſo, yet wee ſee it produced not that effect in her that obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this plant; and ſhe that parted from it had children in a ſhort ſpace. But let us yet ſearch a little further into this love-property attributed to it: this property is only confined to helpe womens ſterility by thoſe who ſtand ſtiffelieſt upon the point. And yet our antient Phyſitians, neither <hi>Dioſcoride</hi> (who reckoneth up all the ſeverall properties thereof, yea, even a violent purging quality, equalling, if not exceeding, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore it ſelfe) <hi>Galen,</hi> nor <hi>Pliny,</hi> make any mention of this property. And whereas they make mention of ſome names, tending to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they only relate other mens opinions, they never aſcribing any ſuch property unto it. I will not indeed deny, but it might have bin uſed by witches and Sorcerers in their love-potions, (as I may call them) and ſo were bones of Frogs, haires of a Wolfes taile, <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> and ſuch other traſh (which no underſtanding man ever thought to be indued with any ſuch quality) by wicked people, notwithſtanding, imploied for ſuch purpoſes. And this ſame late alleaged Author, when he alleageth the ſuppoſed love quality in this ſimple, groundeth his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on the cooling quality of this ſimple, fit, ſaith he, to coole the hot wombs of thoſe Eaſtern women, as he thinketh it to be incident to moſt women dwelling in hot countries. But what if this ſimple be hot in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity? I think then his building wil ſoone fall to the ground. <note n="m" place="margin">Loceo prius citate.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:20476:216"/>
joyneth heat with the cold quality in this ſimple. And I thinke, let but a judicious Phyſitian well conſider of the purging quality, and many other operations in this ſimple, incident (at leaſt many of them) to other narcoticks alſo, will acknowledge a hot quality predominating in it, and then this cooling effect is quite vaniſhed away in ſmoake. And put the caſe this were yet true, then were it onely good for women of very hot wombes, and not proper for ever barren woman; and withall, were not good for women of our cold Northerne climat, who are not, for the moſt part, ſo hot wombed as there Eaſterne wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Beſides, if by reaſon of its narcoticke and ſoporiferous quality, by reaſon it provoketh to ſleepe, and conſequently the better to reteine the ſeed of generation, why may not <hi>opium,</hi> henbane, or hemlocke doe the like? Or why ſhould that plead ſuch privilege above other ſimples of the ſame nature and quality? Moreover, if this plant had beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with any ſuch vertue, is it likely that <hi>Leah,</hi> who had now for a long time beene debarred from bearing of children (inſomuch that for this cauſe ſhe had given her maid to her husband to helpe out her num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) would ſo eaſily have parted with ſo effectuall a meanes, to her ſiſter eſpecially, betwixt whom and her ſelfe there was ſuch emulation and debate? To conclude then this point, there is no probability, that this <hi>Mandrake</hi> hath any ſuch power or vertue, as to make barren women fruitfull; and yet farre leſſe to procure love, or make any love better, howſoever, it may be that in antient times, it hath, perhaps, beene uſed as other poiſons for this ſame purpoſe, as I have ſaid already. And <hi>Pliny</hi> himſelfe mocketh the Magicians, who attribute ſtrange ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to herbes, and divers ſimples, and ſuch as is impoſſible for any reaſonable man to beleeve, as namely, to open any locke without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, to drie up rivers and lakes, to ſupply all wants, and make ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to flee.

                  <hi>Galen</hi> well compared and paralleled together anger and reaſon, comparing anger to a horſe, and reaſon his rider: As the horſe then (ſaith he) ſhould be ruled by his rider, ſo ſhould anger be ruled by reaſon, which made <hi>Vlyſſes</hi> curbe and keepe in his anger, and juſt indignation conceived againſt his maids for their great inſolencies, it being then no fit and opportune time to puniſh them according to their deſerts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when reaſon beareth rule, then this furious and raging beaſt, anger, is ſuppreſt and kept under: as when the rider is maſter of his horſe, and both ſtrong and skilfull enough to rule him, then the horſe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Maſter, and doth him what ſervice is ſit for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. But it commeth ſometimes to paſſe, that either by imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillirie and weakeneſſe, or unskilfulneſſe, or both; the horſe gets the head, and ſo, running away, hee throweth his rider: Even
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:20476:217"/>
ſo commeth it often to paſſe, that this raſh and precipitate anger getting the head and maſtery, often over-throweth reaſon his rider, and ſo giveth him the foile. This, when <hi>Homer</hi> would expreſſe, hee brings in <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Achilles,</hi> young men, ſuccumbing and yeelding to this furious paſſion: but on the other part, <hi>Vlyſſes, Polydamus</hi> and <hi>Neſtor,</hi> prevailing and getting the victory over the ſame. But if I ſhould ſpeake of the miſchiefes procured by this furious wilde beaſt, anger, I ſcarce know where to beginne, and might compoſe great volumes of this ſubject onely. It armeth the will to all manner of villany, and openeth a doore to all manner of wickedneſſe. Is it not often the cauſe of great warres, broiles, diſſention, of the overthrow of whole countries and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous cities. And therefore well may it be called a moſt cruell informe monſter, matamorphoſing man, not only into the ſhape of ſome furious cruell wilde beaſt, but even into the ſhape of the Divell himſelfe: and as ſmoake dazleth the eyes of the body, ſo doth this the eyes of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And what marvell, I pray you, if a man now deprived of the uſe of reaſon, and following the violence of this furious paſſion be tranſported to the perpetration of ſtrange and enormious facts? It was not therefore ſaid in vaine; <hi>Ira furor brevis eſt,</hi> anger is but a ſhort fury: and wee may as well ſay, <hi>Furie is but a long anger.</hi> How many mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have beene by this furious monſter committed? Have not men thereby become more cruell one to another than the very wilde beaſts? according to that old proverbe, <hi>Homo homini lupus.</hi> See how this anger prevailed in that great conqueror of the world, <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who yet could not conquer himſelfe, but in his drunken anger killed <hi>Clitus, &amp;c.</hi> It is recorded of <hi>Vedius Pollio,</hi> a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> having invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> to a feaſt, and his Butler having broken a cryſtall glaſſe, hee caſt him into his fiſh poole to be food for his Lampreies: for the which cauſe, that Noble Emperour cauſed breake all the reſt, leſt they ſhould afterwards be an occaſion of any ſuch cruelty. But I ſhould ſpend too much time, if I ſhould inſiſt upon many particular relations of this nature. It will be better to ſet downe ſome antidots, both out of ſacred and prophane writers, againſt this diſorderly paſſion. The Wiſe man well acquained wiih the evills and miſchiefes thereby procured, therefore in that golden booke of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and in ſeverall places of the ſame, ſetteth downe the evills of anger, and the antidots againſt it.

                  </note> And yet (as a late Writer well obſerveth) there were three great and notorious offences, which incited this pious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to this ſevere revenge, leſt it may be imagined, that like a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant hee raged thus againſt his ſubjects without any ſeeming reaſon, for a ſmall or no cauſe at all. For in the firſt place, the people would not ſuffer a villaine to be puniſhed, who had raviſhed a youth to abuſe him againſt nature: againe, when as hee was by this good governour com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to priſon, they raiſed a tumult about ſo infamous a buſineſſe: and when as this governour did labour to ſuppreſſe this their ſedition, they killed both him and divers others of worth aſſiſting him. But it is now more than time wee come to the hurt it procureth to the bodie,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:20476:218"/>
both in ſickneſſe and in health. And firſt in health, it often altereth the naturall comlineſſe and decency thereof, changeth the colour of the face, dazleth the eyes, maketh the tongue clamorous, armeth all the parts of the body; as hands, feet, teeth, &amp;c. And as for diſeaſes thereby procured to the body, they are not a few, and no paſſion more prejudiciall to the life of man, and which more accelerateth or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth on old age. And this to be conſonant and agreeable to right reaſon, may eaſily appeare: for anger being nothing elſe but a heat, or ebullition of the blood, and a violent motion of the ſame in the heart, which at length with violence is diffuſed and diſperſed over the whole body; as <hi>Galen</hi> himſelfe defineth it: it muſt needes over-heat and dry up the bodie; by which meanes, it ſometimes exciteth <hi>Fevers;</hi> in ſuch bodies eſpecially as are apt for a long time to reteine this impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of heat. And although oftentimes the violent motion of the heart be ſetled and ſtaid, there remaineth, notwithſtanding, in the body an unnaturall heat, from whence often proceed <hi>Fevers.</hi> Many alſo overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with this paſsion, have beene ſuddenly ſurprized with <hi>Apoplexies, Epilepſies, Convulſions, Palſies,</hi> trembling of the joints, and gouts of all ſorts. Some alſo have fallen into <hi>Pleureſies, laundizes,</hi> many ſorts of laskes, proceeding of choler, &amp;c. But ſuch eſpecially are moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this paſsion, that are of a hotter conſtitution of bodie than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, either naturall, or adventitious, by meanes of any infirmitie: but ſuch eſpecially, as have the head and heart hot naturally, or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally, are moſt obnoxious to hurt by the ſame. In all hot and acute diſeaſes, therefore, as alſo in hot cholericke conſtitutions, we are by all meanes poſsible to prevent this paſsion, the patient then of himſelfe, by reaſon of his infirmitie, being more peeviſh and froward: for the which cauſe there muſt ſuch caution and circumſpection be uſed of thoſe about the ſick, that all poſsible content muſt be afforded, and ſuch placed about them in whom they moſt delight. Their diet alſo and their Phyſick muſt with all diſcretion be accordingly accommodated, as hath alreadie beene related. But it may, perhaps, here be demanded,<note place="margin">Whether anger be uſeful in any diſeaſes?</note> whether anger be not uſefull in ſome diſeaſes?<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> or whether it be hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in all? I anſwer, that in ſome diſeaſes it may be beneficiall for the patient.

                  </note> that it is not ſufficient for the Phyſitian to play his part, but the aſsiſtants alſo, and attendants; and all other things muſt alſo be anſwerable. The ſicke, wee know, by reaſon of his ſickneſſe, hath ſorrow enough, eſpecially, if the party be of a feeble, fearefull and puſillanimous ſpirit, the phanſie ſtill framing unto it ſelfe new feares of ſome bad and ſiniſtrous event. And thus wee ſee through raſhneſſe and indiſcretion of ſome about the ſicke, ſometimes by relating to them ſome evill tidings, and ſometimes putting them in needleſſe feares, without any ſure ground: or yet when there is juſt cauſe of feare in the ſicke; yet being indiſcreetly revealed to him, either by the Phyſitian, or others, or yet at an unſeaſonable time: as about the time of reſt, or before meales, may much prejudice the ſicke. And therefore I adviſe all thoſe whom it concerneth,<note place="margin">Care and circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to bee uſed whom wee ſuffer to come about the ſicke.</note> to be very vigilant and circumſpect, whom they ſuffer to come about the ſicke, wee finding by daily experience, that many times ignorant and unadviſed people, prove the cauſes of infinite evills to the ſicke: and that ſometimes by diſſwading them from a laudable and legall courſe for the ſpeedie recovery of their health, preſcribed by learned and wiſe counſell; eſpecialy if their ſhallow capacities be not able (as ſeldome they are) to dive into the depth of the Phyſitians intentions: and ſometimes alſo by erring in the maner above-mentioned.

                  <hi>A merry heart maketh a chearefull countenance.</hi> And a learned expoſitor upon this place affirmeth, that <hi>although the ſubſtance of the ſoule and the body differ much; God hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding tyed and united them ſo faſt together, that there is no ſmall harmony and ſympathy betwixt them: inſomuch that either of them being affected, the other ſuffereth alſo. And although the harme redoundeth to the whole body; yet becauſe it is moſt conſpicuous in the countenance, therefore the Wiſe man maketh chiefely mention of the countenance; and teacheth us here likewiſe, that a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and merrie heart not onely maketh the body ſound and healthfull; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a cheerefull and amiable countenance. Hence commeth it to paſſe, that when as the heart is merry and cheerefull, the eye is lively and quicke ſighted, the cheeks of a comely, ruddy colour, &amp;c. But all contrary, when the mind is heavy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. In what an account and high eſteeme this is in all the parts of our life can ſcarce be declared. For firſt, in Divine worſhip and ſervice it is very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that we be of a cheareful countenance. And hence was it that</hi> Iſaac <hi>preparing himſelfe for that propheticall benediction of his ſonnes, calls firſt for wine and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon, whereby his heart being cheered and refreſhed, hee might the better performe this Propheticall function. And the holy Prophet</hi> Elizeus <hi>being much grieved at the ſight of wicked</hi> Joram, <hi>before ever he went about to refreſh thoſe three Kings diſtreſſed with thirſt, calleth firſt for a cunning Muſitian, whereby the griefe and ſorrow of his mind might be mitigated. Now if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets themſelves, inſpired with a propheticall ſpirit, had need of this chearefulneſſe of heart for the better performance of Gods worſhip and ſervice, how much more have others uſe thereof? And ſuch ſervices as performed by ſad and heavy perſons, we ſee, are not ſo acceptable: as may in</hi> Mardochee <hi>and</hi> Nehemia <hi>plainely appeare. And we ſee that</hi> Eſau <hi>being cheered with</hi> Jacobs <hi>gift, was of ſo cheerefull a countenance, that</hi> Jacob <hi>confeſſeth he beheld his countenance as though he had beheld the face of God. But in the godly</hi> (ſaith the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <hi>this doth yet farre more plainely appeare, who being refreſhed with the peace of a good conſcience, have a cheerefull and lovely countenance. This may plainely appeare by the example of the</hi> Nazarites <hi>who drunke no wine, &amp;c: As likewiſe by the example of</hi> Daniel <hi>and his fellowes, who although they fed but on pulſe and water, yet their countenance was farre fairer and better liking than of any of the reſt who were fed with all the Kings dainty fare. And therefore this Ioy &amp; mirth conſiſting in our reconciliation with God from whence proccedeth a good conſcience, is farre to be preferred before all the moſt curious waſhes and paints, wherewith the laſcivious and dainty Dames of our times doe dawb, and as they thinke, ſo curiouſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="399" facs="tcp:20476:222"/>
the comely colour of the countenance.</hi> That the life therefore might bee the more comfortable, and that griefe, ſorrow and ſadneſſe might not too much prevaile and oppreſſe us, it was the bounty of our good God to give us not onely food and raiment for neceſſitie, and water to quench our thirſt: but to give us alſo wine to cheere the heart, oile to make glad the countenance (in the hot Eaſterne countries then in great requeſt, howbeit in our cold climats not ſo uſefull) and muſicke both vocall and inſtrumentall, to ſtirre up, and excite the dejected me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholicke minde. And therefore the moderate uſe of all theſe comfortable creatures is, as we ſee, allowed by God himſelfe: and beſides good merry company, either at meales or otherwiſe; provided, the mirth be honeſt, not ſcurrilous, and offenſive either to God or man: and thus may theſe verſes following be underſtood:

And yet, as by this precedent diſcourſe hath plainely appeared; Diet is that which principally, and above all other meanes, is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to be looked into. And that this is not a matter of ſo ſmall a moment, as by the vulgar it is accounted, hath at great length,<note place="margin">Many things in this diſcourſe to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</note> by the authority of the learned in all ages, beene plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

plants, fit for the uſe of man; the variety whereof, together with their ſeverall vertues, wee have at length ſet downe. Againe, there being ſuch varietie of other creatures, foure-footed beaſts, fowle and fiſhes, which afford food for ſuſteining of mans life, their natures muſt be well knowne, and what food they afford the ſicke, and how ſafe it is to adminiſter the ſame. Beſides all this, the right prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is duely and carefully to be obſerved; ſome ſickeneſſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring one, and ſome another kinde of food, and a different pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. And beſides, the quantitie muſt carefully be obſerved, and that according to ſeverall individuall bodies; and the order, when more than one diſh is allowed. Now, all this is yet nothing, if the ſtate of the individuall bodie thou dealeſt with, be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great care and diligence looked into. And principally, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other things, wee muſt have a watchfull and carefull eye over the ſtrength of the ſicke, and not onely narrowly obſerve the difference of ſeverall and individuall parties, one from another, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeverall complexions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but even one and the ſame individuall partie, how it differeth from it ſelfe, according to the ſeverall ſeaſons, not onely of the ſickneſſe, but even of the time of the yeere alſo. All the which circumſtances, as they have beene at great length diſcuſſed, ſo doeth it as evidently appeare, that this is not the taske of any ignorant quack-ſalving Mountebancke, Empericke, Barber-ſurgeon, or of an ignorant buſie-bodie woman-phyſitian; nay, nor yet of a medling pragmaticall Miniſter: but of a skilfull and judicious Artiſt, able upon all occaſions to adde what is wanting, to alter what is not uſefull, and detract what is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.<note place="margin">If it tranſcend the skil of the ignorant Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, to preſcribe good and wholeſome diet for the diſeaſed, how ſhal they be able to preſcribe phyſicke fit for the ſtate of the ſicke bodies.</note> If this then be true in this dieteticall part, as hath bin proved, what ſhall wee then ſay of the adminiſtration of phyſicke it ſelfe? If the unlearned, by reaſon of their unſufficiencie, are not to be allowed to deale with this dieteticall point, how much more are they unable and unfit for this other of ſo great a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? If the vulgar be ſo afraid of phyſicke, that ſcarce can they ſometimes be perſwaded in caſes of greateſt extremitie (and I cannot in ſome ſort blame them, there being ſo many dog-leaches, and ignorant practitioners of all ſorts ſuffered, as it were, to throw lots upon mens lives) to admit of any lawfull remedie, although exhibited by the hand of a skilfull, learned and rationall Phyſitian: why are ſome of them, yea, and ſome of a more refined judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment often ſo laviſh of their lives, that they will ſooner commit themſelves into the hands of any quack-ſalving Mountebancke, or Barber-ſurgeon, than into the hands of the muſt learned and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Artiſt, and are often ſo ſhy of phyſicke, as of ſome deadly and deleterious poiſon: But it often befalleth them according to the old Proverbe.</p>

to nature; and if at any time the greatneſſe and malignity of the diſeaſe indicate an addition of ſtronger remedies, either to acuate and quicken the dull and ſluggiſh quality of the others, or to eradicate ſom inveterate diſeaſe; yet is he able ſo to correct the malignity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that he can make it a ſoveraigne medicine for the healing of his infirmity: the other on the contrary uſeth moſt commonly his crude, maligne and unprepared medicines both mineralls and vegetables; the hurt and ſmart whereof, howſoever they be not at the firſt felt, yet are they often afterwards the cauſes of many miſchiefes: beſides, that this kind of counterfeit Phyſitian purgeth often away as well the good as the bad humor, the which is impoſſible for the patient to obſerve or diſcerne, howſoever he knowes it to his coſt. But beſides Empericks, there is yet another ſort of intruder upon the profeſſion of phycſike as faulty (if not more, all things conſidered) as the former: practiſing Miniſters, I meane, concerning whom although I have in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this diſcourſe ſaid ſomething; yet by reaſon of ſome ſeeming colourable objections might by themſelves or others be made in their behalfe.

This reaſon, as it firſt makes a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhew, ſo if we ſhall narrowly view this pretended reaſon, we ſhall find it like <note n="b" place="margin">

Charitable workes, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, are to be performed; but every perſon is not fit for the performance of every worke of charity. The miniſters charity is to have a care of his peoples ſoules, to viſit and comfort them when they are ſicke; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to extend their charity to their bodies, according to their ability. As for the curing of their bodies, that exceedeth the compaſſe of their callings, and in ſo doing they break down hedges, and intrude upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans right. If they ſhall reply, that ſometimes they do it to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place of a Phyſitian (perhaps) wanting. I anſwere, they are very witty to deviſe wiles to maintaine a wrong cauſe. And it was a good ſpeech of a worthy Divine of this ſhire, now reſting in peace: <hi>O quam argutatrix eſt humana ratio, praeſertim quum aliquid de ſuis commodis &amp; emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumentis deciditur!</hi> How hard doe men plead for their profits! I ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, If a miniſter bee endued with any competent skill in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as perhaps having learned it before he betooke him to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion) and any of his pariſhioners be amiſſe, either in the abſence of a ſufficient Phyſitian, or yet in caſe of the patients poverty, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters charity in ſuch a caſe is moſt ſeaſonable. But my meaning is principally of ſuch as make a pecuniary trafficke of this profeſſion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Apothecary ſhops in their houſes, and often traine up others in

that profeſſion which they are yet themſelves to learne, and have been knowne to have been moſt buſie, where able and ſufficient Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians were to be found. And the want of able and learned phyſitians is often by meanes of their lawleſſe intruſion occaſioned. It is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to ſome, that ſome of theſe men have beene ſo impudent and ſhameleſſe, that they have often offered their ſervice to the Gentry, and people of beſt note, ſome of them traffiquing to and fro to engroſſe all imployment into their owne hands, debaſing and vilipending the actions of other able phyſitians: and if (perhaps) at any time, ſome ſucceſſe doth ſecond their bold attempts (as ſometimes <hi>Audentes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuna juvat,</hi> fortune helpes the hardy) thou ſhalt then have them like that proud <note n="d" place="margin">

Let the ingenious Reader then judge, whether any of theſe can juſtly plead poverty. Others againe, I confeſſe, have ſmaller allowance, and therefore would ſeeme to deſerve more favour.

Againe I ſay, there may here fall out by this meanes ſome inconvenience; ſo that ſtill, <hi>Latet anguis in herba.</hi> Beſides, theſe two caſes are farre unlike, there being therein a great diſparity.<note place="margin">Conſider the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of theſe two caſes.</note> The Phyſitian may in time of need give the ſicke good and wholeſome counſell for his ſoules health: and this may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a neighbour aſwell, yea, it may be, better performe, than either the Miniſter or the Phyſitian. The Phyſitian then performeth this charitable worke, as the duty of a common Chriſtian, and that which any other that is able is allowed to doe, there being no danger in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying this remedy, if done but in any ordinary diſcretion: although it were to bee wiſhed the ſpirituall Phyſitian himſelfe were able alwayes to adminiſter his owne Phyſick. Now the caſe ſtandeth
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:20476:226"/>
not alike with the miniſter, who may eaſily be miſtaken either in the diſeaſe, or the remedy due to the ſame, or yet in the due and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time of application, with divers other conſiderable circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, unleſſe hee be skilled aſwell in a theoricall knowledge, as in the practicall imploiment of this profeſſion: unto the which he ſhall hardly ever atteine, without the neglect of the worthieſt of the two. And put the caſe hee may yet helpe ſome diſtreſſed neighbour in his need, it will both draw him on to doe the like for others, who may plead the like intereſt in him; and againe, his example may incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſome ignorant and idle dames to doe the like. <hi>Principiis obſta.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt occaſions of errour at firſt. All the errours of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church at firſt crept in upon faire and plauſible pretences, as might eaſily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; the which now are become ſo many, and ſo ſtrongly mainteined, that wee had now need of ſome <hi>Hercules</hi> to cleanſe this uncleane and filthy ſtable. And the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe, made he any ſmall account, thinke you, of ſuch ware, whenas <note n="l" place="margin">Hiſtory of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Trent.</hi>
                  </note> hee ſent his holy ghoſt ſo often poſt in a cloak-bagge from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Trent,</hi> to inſpire the Fathers of that councell, to ſtand ſtoutly to the mainteinance of this their freehold? But if they will yet plead any ſufficiency in themſelves, whereby they may ſafely practiſe this profeſſion, and if any <hi>Aeſculapian genius</hi> hath infuſed into them the <hi>Hippocraticall</hi> skill, I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from doing good, even in this ſame kinde. But let this <hi>proviſo</hi> be put in, That they firſt reſigne their livings to thoſe who will affoord them better attendance. I neede not mention that young frye of able ſchollers, theſe famous nurſeries of good learning, like two fruitfull mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſend yeerely abroad into this our fruitfull <hi>Canaan,</hi> flowing with milke and hony: and how many of theſe ſtand idle in the market-place, no man hiring of them into his Vineyard; when as others undertake and ingroſſe farre more worke than either they are able, or is fit they ſhould deale with. But if the dole be a dealing, I ſee no reaſon why the Phyſitian may not claime a ſhare in it, as well as they doe in others. The <hi>Talion Law</hi> will allow it, and I make no queſtion, but they may finde ſome of them as fit to preach, as they to practiſe. As for that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection taken from the affinitie of the ſoule and body, I thinke it not of that worth,<note place="margin">Objection taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the affinitie of the ſoule and the bodie, idle, and to ſmall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</note> as to be objected by any ſcholler: and yet I have heard that ſome have pleaded this. Now, if it may take place, it will make as much for the Phyſitians preaching, as for their practiſing. And beſides, if this argument may take place, then by reaſon of this affinitie of the members of the bodie one with another, the Tailor ſhall become a Shoo-maker; and againe, the Shoo-maker a Tailor: and the Haber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſher (becauſe he dealeth with the head, the moſt eminent part, and ſeat of the ſenſe and reaſon it ſelfe) will, perhaps, plead a priviledge in all three, and more alſo. I have ſomewhat the more at large inſiſted upon this point, not only for that this notorious abuſe, hath ſo long continued; but likewiſe to give warning for the time to come, that Miniſters keepe themſelves within the precincts of their owne calling. To this the weight of their owne calling, if there were nothing elſe, might be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient motive: beſides, that I have proved in the beginning of this diſcourſe, that the Phyſitians pains and trouble are greater than of any
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:20476:226"/>
calling, yea, even of the painfull and laborious Divine himſelfe. It is true, the Divine hath his evaſion: for many of them have this tricke (although ſcarce honeſt) that they are ready to gleane what gaines they can gets by ſitting ſtill in their cells, caſting waters, as they call it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing medicines to the abſent, fall out as it wil: and when the patient hath moſt need of their preſence, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parſon cannot come then: and by this means, many times M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Parſon hath his gaines come in eaſily, decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the greateſt pains; and if the patient rely wholly upon him, he ſhal either be denied that attendance is due in time of danger, or elſe caſt upon another phyſitian, who muſt now take the worſt, when Maſter Parſon hath had the beſt. Some againe will ſometimes, and that often, attend, as another Phyſitian, on the neceſſitie of the ſicke: and here is then another inconvenient, that many times, when Maſter Parſon or Vicar ſhould be in his pulpit, his patient calls for his preſence. Let the judicious and unpartiall reader then judge of the equitie of this cauſe. Wee ſtill hope, (and have hoped a great while) that the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers of the Church will have an eare open to heare this more than juſt complaint. No ignorance can be pretended, this not being done in a corner, but in the eyes of all <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And among them, ſuch eſpecially, as are too much addicted to judiciall Aſtrologie, and many ſuſpicious, if not ſinfull things thereupon depending: as calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of nativities, and prognoſticating future events thereby; uſing amulets without any ſhew of reaſon, to cure diſeaſes, and to prevent many outward accidents, are to be inquired into: if the antient <note n="m" place="margin">Si quis Aſtrologia, vel matheſi exiſtimat eſſe credendum anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mafit. <hi>Toletan. 7.</hi> con. <hi>21.</hi>

But I leave this text, wiſhing withall, that people would not prove a means of diſtracting the Divine, and hindering him in that whereunto he is called and ſet apart, leſt they prove acceſſary to his neglect, if he have not ſo much grace to looke to it himſelfe. I have <note n="n" place="margin">In the prefacé to the arraignment of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines.</note> elſewhere alleaged the example of <hi>David,</hi>

               <p>But before I end,<note place="margin">Sordìde and baſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Empiricks.</note> although I have already ſaid ſomewhat of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes, yet a word or two more. There is an ordinary objection where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many people deceive themſelves in this care of Emperickes: for, ſay they, wee are by uſing Emperickes often freed from a great deale of charges which learned counſell would coſt. I anſwer,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> that in the firſt place they build on a falſe foundation, parallelling and equalling ignorant Empetickes with the judicious and learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian: and this erroneous opinion is often confirmed by meanes of the like events often befalling both the one and the other, which I have ſufficiently confuted in the beginning of this diſcourſe. It is then apparent, that this ſeeming ſaving of charges, is but a meere fallacie, and ſo many of them finde it at the laſt, when it is too late. For in the firſt place, the ignorant and unskilfull, howſoever moſt preſumptuous of their owne skill and ſufficiencie, yet are they not able often to finde out thy diſeaſe; eſpecially, if either it be uncouth or intricate, compoſed or partaking of divers diſeaſes, accompanied
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:20476:227"/>
with various and ſeverall ſymptomes:<note place="margin">Emperickes can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther finde out the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, nor apply right remedies.</note> farre leſſe then are they able to apply a right and laudable remedie to the ſame. Againe, put the caſe they both finde out the diſeaſe, and apply ſome remedy: yet are their remedies often ſo rough, venomous and unprepared, that they leave a virulent and evill impreſſion behinde them; the which, howſoever, peradventure, not at firſt felt, yet at length often payeth both the principall and intereſt. Beſides, that I ſay nothing of their ignorance in the application, according to the ſeverall conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the individuall bodies, ſexes, ages, order, time, quantity, qualitie, due preparation and correction; but eſpecially the ſtrength of the patient, &amp;c. Beſides all this, when they have thus hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their lives, ſpent their mony, poiſned their bodies, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected good and wholeſome remedies, which in time and place, in all probabilitie were like to have cured the infirmity: it commeth often to paſſe, that at length, howbeit too late, they are forced to flie unto the learned and judicious Phyſitian, as I could inſtance in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. Now, if the patient recover, what is here ſaved? is he not here at a double charge, beſides the hazard of his life? and if hee die, I confeſſe there is ſomething ſaved: but I thinke people that are wiſe, ſhould in this be of Satans minde, <note n="p" place="margin">Iob. 1.</note>

As for the meaner and poorer ſort, there is no honeſt Phyſitian, but in charitie hee will be readie in time of neede to further their health with his beſt counſell. But this fault we finde to be as frequent in the rich, as in the poorer ſort: ſome I know doe it out of meere ignorance; but others out of meere avarice and fordid tenacitie. And yet I have heard ſome ſay, their Empericke coſt them as much as better counſell had done in former times. The ignorant are more to be excuſed, and therefore it were to be wiſhed (and I doubt we may wiſh long enough) that there ſtumlbing blocks, which vulgar eyes are not able to diſcerne, were removed out of the way. Then ſhould our Surgeons betake them to curing of their ſores, wounds, and other things thereunto belonging: Apothecaries to their compoſitions; and other ignorant and illiterate Emperickes, forced to forſake their profeſſion, and if they were of any before, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them to the ſame againe, or to ſame imploiment befitting them, if they were of no calling before. As for women, they might finde them worke within doores about their houſewiverie, farre better beſeeming their ſexe, than to play the buſie-bodie abroad, medling with that whereof they are altogether ignorant.

Many men thinke, yea, ſome of a generous note, wherin they bewray their careleſſeneſſe, if not their ſtupiditie too, that whileſt they are in health, they may for prevention take phyſicke from any one, it matters not
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:20476:227"/>
from whom it be, nor what phyſicke it be, ſo it worke with them. I muſt tell you, that many overthrow their bodies thereby, and that there is no leſſe art and iudgement required for preſerving the bodie in health, than for curing of it being ſicke, if they did but know how the foure humours are, or ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned in their bodies: for inioying according, to their conſtitutions, a ſound and healthy ſtate, they would, I am perſwaded, be more cautelous, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves into the hands of the unlearned, who, by their inconſiderate courſes, take humours from them at an adventure, ſo well thoſe that are not offenſive, as thoſe which are, to the utter ſubverſion of the oeconomie of the bodie: whereof though, perhaps, in regard of their ſtrengths, they are not by and by ſenſible, which is that which onely cloaketh the errours of Emperickes, and as a vaile masketh many mens eyes and underſtanding therein: yet they will, as I have in divers obſerved to their perill, by little and little, incurre a lapſed ſtate of body. It is ſtrange to ſee the ignorance of moſt people, how backward they are to give to the learned profeſſors of phyſicke their due, readie to lay ſcandalls upon them; but forward to magnifie Emperickes, their phyſicke, their honeſtie, their care, willing to paſſe over and excuſe their groſſe ſlips and abſurdities,</hi> O mira hominum ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditas! <hi>But proceeds this altogether out of ignorance? I ſuppoſe no: for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe many ſeeke unto them, and magnifie their phyſicke, becauſe it is cheape: but ſuch are fooles and Gulls indeed; for they wrong, and even poiſon their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with groſſe and ill qualified phyſicke to ſave their purſes. But to anſwer the reaſons, or rather words which they produce and alleage in the favour and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Emperickes: to what purpoſe is the working of that phyſicke which reſpecteth not the peccant humours, nor parts affected, but to the overthrow of the bodie? What is a ſuppoſed honeſtie in a Phyſitian without learning, but a ſnare wherein the ignorant doe voluntarily entrap themſelves? I ſay ſuppoſed: for I cannot thinke that man to be honeſt, which uſurps a calling, which with a good conſcience hee is not able to diſcharge. Or to what purpoſe is the care that Emperickes take about their prepoſterous and ill compoſed medicines, but to the utter ruine of the patients bodie, as too too unluckie happened of late to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of good worth and note, who taking phyſicke by way of prevention,</hi>

Vaine therefore, and very abſurd is that conceit, which many have in favour of Empericks,</hi> viz, If they doe no good, they doe no harme. <hi>Admit that ſometimes by their triviall pettie medicines they doe no harme; yet nevertheleſſe for that, I muſt tell you that they doe much harme: for the ſicke bodie relying upon their skill, and they being not able to direct and execute ſuch courſes as ſhall be ſitting and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to impugne the diſeaſe, while there is time fitting for the ſame, the ſickneſſe gets the maſterie, and then (perhaps) when the ſtrength is too much weakened, and the diſeaſe become incurable, they ſeeke helpe of the learned Phyſitian. So baſely verily, are moſt of our people affected to their health, that untill ſome practicall Miniſter, pariſh Clerke, Apothecary, Surgeon, or the like, have done their utmoſt hurt, they ſecke not to the Phyſitian. And here to vindicate our Art from calumnie, I cannot but taxe the moſt ſort of people, that being affected with any great or difficult diſeaſe, which by reaſon of the nature thereof, or contumacie of the peccant humours, will have ſuch progreſſe, as that it cannot in a ſhort time, by the medicines and beſt indeavours of the learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian,

But if it happen that they recover there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, they lay an imputation upon their Phyſitian, and grace their Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke with the cure; whereas, in very deed, the matter of the diſeaſe was wholly, or at leaſt the greateſt part thereof eradicated by ſuch fit and powerfull remedies, as the learned Phyſitian had formerly miniſtred unto them: whereupon the reſidue of the cure was effected by the force of nature, not by the weake en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the Empericke, or triviall medicines of any other whatſoever. I have of purpoſe inlarged this advertiſment, and doe leave it far a memoriall and caveat to all poſterity, eſpecially to the Gentlemen of this our age, who, for the moſt part of them, very much wrong their iudgements and underſtanding, in taking phyſicke of the unlearned; and wherein they doe not onely wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo give occaſion of hurt others: For the meaner ſort of people following their example, doe the like, whereby it comes to paſſe, that in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, more untimely periſh (which I beleeve to be true in the</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Hiſtory of a bold Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pericke, diſgraced by that matchleſs prince King Iames, of happy memory.</note> 
                  <hi>and their prepoſterous courſes.</hi> A grave Divine lately told mee a ſtory of a notorious old Empericke, living in the Weſt countrie. This <hi>Empericke was by a Noble man brought before that famous Prince, King</hi> James, <hi>of happy memory, thinking thereby to grace him (a ſmall grace for a great man to grace ſuch worthleſſe perſons) which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, was not anſwerable to expectation. This Noble Prince then, as hee was moſt iudicious, and Eagle-eyed in all Arts and Sciences; ſo had he a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dexteritie in diſcerning a skilfull and learned Artiſt in the profeſsion of phyſicke, from an Empericke, an ignorant and counterfeit Phyſitian. This bold Empericke (as is the cuſtome of ſuch emptie barrells to make a great ſound) bragged before this learned Prince, how many</hi> Conſumptions, <hi>and other dangerous diſeaſes hee had cured: to whom his Maieſty replying, asked him how many hee had killed. This learned Prince asked him after if hee could cure mad men? that I can, quoth the Empericke: Being asked after what manner, by making of them madder, quoth the Empericke. I beleeve thee well ſaith his Maiestie, and withall, asked him whether hee had ever read</hi> Hippocrates,<note place="margin">A ſpeech well befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a Prince.</note> Galen, <hi>and other phyſicall Authours? Who anſwered, that hee had never ſtudied in any ſuch bookes. His Maieſtie at length, thus clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up his diſcourſe, Goe thy way man; for if I have need of good advice for my ſoules health, I will be adviſed by the honeſt and learned Divine; for my bodily health, the learned Phyſitian; and for my temporarll eſtate, the learned Lawyer ſhall give mee directions.</hi> Now then, ſince people are commonly ſo carried with apiſh imitation of great ones, why will not people in this particular imitate the patterne of ſo great a Prince, of whom it may well be ſaid, that ſince the daies of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the world ſaw not a wiſer. But now to draw to an end, what I have ſaid, either againſt theſe, or any other erroneous pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioners,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:20476:228"/>
if the unpartiall reader will but ſeriouſly conſider that which hath beene ſaid alreadie in this precedent diſcourſe, he will, I thinke, ſay, it was no leſſe than neceſſary. I doubt not alſo, but according to the ſeverall and various humours and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of people, this my paines ſhall finde cenſurers of ſeverall ſorts. But againſt all envious detractions the uprightneſſe and innocency of my intention, being a deſire to profit the publique, ſhall be to mee as a brazen wall. Now, if I have done any thing well, as is fitting, it was that I aimed at: and if otherwiſe, yet was my principall aime and indeavour, to doe good: and therefore, in this imitating our gracious God, I pray thee to accept of my endeavours in a good part, and charitably to interpret any error or over-ſight, <hi>Farewell.</hi>
