         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Nor is any employment so honorable, as for a man to serve his generation, and be profitable to many: When like the</hi> Moon, <hi>we bestow the benefits received from</hi> God; <hi>to the profit and commodity of others. It is the</hi> Suns <hi>excellency, that his</hi> bright rayes <hi>and</hi> beamns, <hi>are dispersed into every corner of the</hi> Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.</p>
            <p>The Tragick, Buskin <hi>(as they say) would fit all, that should put it on: Here is that will much benefit thee, (being made use of) be thy condition</hi> good <hi>or</hi> bad, rich <hi>or</hi> poor, learned <hi>or</hi> unlearned, mental <hi>or</hi> manual. <hi>The which to conceal, would argue in the</hi> Authour, <hi>either</hi> too much lucre, <hi>or</hi> too little love. <hi>Even the</hi> Physician, <hi>that hath a</hi> sovereigne Receipt, <hi>and dieth unrevealing it: robs the world of many bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, which might multiply after his death: leaving to all survivers this collection, that he once</hi> did good to others, <hi>but to</hi> do himselfe a greater.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a Gentleman in <hi>Athens</hi> had his plate taken away by <hi>Ahashu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crus</hi> as he was at dinner, he smiled upon his friends, saying, I thank <hi>God</hi> that his <hi>Higness</hi> hath left me any thing. So whatever befals us, this should be our meditation: <hi>It is of the Lords mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that we are not consumed, Lam.</hi> 3. 22. Or this, He that hath afflicted me for a time, could have held me longer; he that hath touched me in part, could have stricken me in whole; he that hath laid this upon my name, or estate, hath power to lay a greater rod both upon my body and soul, without doing me the least wrong. And indeed if we but think of our deliverance from the fire of <hi>Hell,</hi> or that our names are writ in <hi>Heaven,</hi> it is enough to make us both patient and thankful, though the trifles, we delight in, be taken from us.</p>
                  <p>But most men are so far from this, that if <hi>God</hi> does not answer their desires in <hi>every thing,</hi> they will take pleasure in <hi>nothing;</hi> they will slight all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent mercies and former favours, because in one thing he crosses them. Like <hi>Ahab,</hi> they are more displeased for one thing they want (or rather fain <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd pretend they want, or at least have no right unto) than they are thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a thousand things they enjoy; though the least mercy they injoy is beyond their best merit. They are ready to receive all, while they return nothing but sin and disobedience, wherein they more than abound; for they have done more against <hi>God</hi> in one week, than they have done for him ever since they were born: Yea, such sotts they are, that if another dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please them, they will be revenged on themselves, grow melancholy and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, like foolish <hi>Children,</hi> who will forbear their meat, and grow sick of the sullens, if never so little crost. Yea, though men have all their hearts can wish, and might (if they would, and had but the wit and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34603:4"/>
grace) be as happy as any men alive, yet some small trifle shall make them weary of themselves and every thing else, as it fared with foolish <hi>Haman, Esther</hi> 5. 13. More particularly, if their <hi>purses</hi> grow <hi>light,</hi> their <hi>hearts</hi> grow <hi>heavy;</hi> yea, as if men did delight to vex themselves; how many are there, that of happy make themselves miserable? or more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable than they need, by looking upon miseries in multiplying glasses: the opinion onely of being poor, or fear that they may be so when they are old, makes them never injoy a merry day, when they neither want, nor are like to doe; and every man is so miserable as he thinks himself. The tast of goods or evils does greatly depend on the opinion we have of them.</p>

                  <p>Thus millions are miserable, melancholy, discontent, by their own conceit; when thousands would think themselves happy, had they but a piece of their happiness. Which discontent or melancholy occasions more murmuring amongsts us, than ever there was among those <hi>Israelites</hi> in the <hi>wilderness;</hi> an unthankfulness able to make or keep them poor and misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that everlastingly.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, <hi>because judgement is not executed speedily, Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. they think it no sin at all, such is their ignorance, Otherwise they might know, that as the <hi>Israelites</hi> was, so their murmuring is, against even <hi>the holy One of Israel;</hi> as <hi>Isaiah</hi> affirmed of <hi>Senuacherib,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 22. And <hi>David</hi> of <hi>Goliah, a Sam.</hi> 17. 36, 45. <hi>The Lord</hi> (sayes <hi>Moses</hi> to the people, when they grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for want of bread, and also to <hi>Datban</hi> and <hi>Abiram) heareth your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring against him, and what are we? your murmurings are not against vs, but against the Lord, Exod.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 15, 21. Onely this is the difference, multitudes of them were destroyed suddenly (even <hi>fourteen thousand and seven hundred</hi> at a clap) yea, they had all been consumed in a moment for their murmuring, had not <hi>Moses stood up in the gap,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded for them, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 41. to 50. and 32. 10. to 14. and 26. 64, 65, and 11. 12, 33. and 14. 12, 22, 23. and 21. 5, 6. Whereas milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among us do the like, and are not stung with <hi>fiery Serpents</hi> as they were: because they are reserved without repentance, to a <hi>fiery Serpent</hi> in <hi>Hell.</hi> Nor stricken with <hi>death temporall,</hi> because reserved to <hi>death eternal.</hi> But <hi>God</hi> is the same <hi>God</hi> still, and as just now as ever, though now under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> instead of <hi>corporall</hi> judgements he inflicts many times <hi>spirituall,</hi> as <hi>blindness of mind, hardness of heart,</hi> and <hi>finall impenitency,</hi> the fore-runner of eternal destruction of body and soul in that burning <hi>lake, Revel.</hi> 19 20. For why is their ruine recorded? but <hi>for our learning and warning,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 11. Neither is forbearance any acquittance; yea, to be let go on in a continual repeating of so great a sin (under such meanes of light and grace) uncontrouled, is the greatest unhappiness, the heaviest curse, because such seldom rest, untill they come to that evill, from which there is no redemption. <hi>God</hi> owes that man a greivous payment, whom he suffers to run on so long unquestioned, and his punishment shall be greater, when he comes to reckon with him for all his faults together. O that men would but seriously consider this, before it proves too late! and before the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34603:4"/>
draw-bridge be taken up; for favours bestowed, and deliverances from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers bind to gratitude; or else the more bonds of duty, the more plagues for neglect. The contribution of blessings require retribution of obedience, or will bring distribution of judgements.</p>
                  <p>Yea, argue with all the world, and they will conclude, that there is no vice like ingratitude; and meer ingratitude returnes nothing for good, but these return evill for good, yea, the greatest evill for the greatest good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ingrateful to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> than can be exprest by the best <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> alive. <hi>Our Redeemer</hi> hath done and suffered more, or would do (did we not so daily provoke him, for which read <hi>Gods goodness and Englands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness)</hi> more for us, than either can be exprest, or conceived by any heart, were it as deep as the Sea.</p>
                  <p>Yea, <hi>God</hi> hath removed so many evils from us, and conferred so many good things upon us, that they are beyond thought or imagination. And were the whole <hi>Heaven</hi> turned into a <hi>Book,</hi> and all the <hi>Angels</hi> deputed <hi>Writers</hi> therein, they could not set down all the good which <hi>Gods</hi> love in <hi>Christ</hi> hath done us. As consider, if we are so bound to bless <hi>God</hi> for his external, temporal, inferiour, earthly, perishing benefits (as <hi>food, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, friends. fire, air, water, health, wealth, life, limbs, liberty, senses,</hi> and a thousand the like) what praise do we owe him for the lasting fruits of his eternal love and mercy? and how thankful should we strive to be? And as much do we owe unto <hi>God,</hi> for the dangers from which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us; as for the great and many mercies he hath bestowed upon us. Neither could we possibly be unthankful, if we seriously thought upon what <hi>God gives,</hi> and what he forgives.

                  <p>Now can any one in common reason meditate so unbottomed a love, and not study and strive for an answerable thankful demeanour: yet, as if all that Christ hath done for us were nothing to move us, we are so far from being thankful, that our whole life, language and religion is nought else but one continued act of muttering and murmuring! this is the case, and it is the case of almost who not.</p>
                  <p>And is this a small matter? Is it <hi>Gods</hi> unspeakable mercy, that we are not at this present frying in <hi>Hell flames,</hi> never to be freed, and do we complain for want of a trifle?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow for the better discharge of what I have undertaken, you may please to take notice, that a <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>melancholy man</hi> is like a <hi>City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested</hi> with too <hi>Enemies</hi> (the one <hi>forraign,</hi> the other <hi>domestick)</hi> which can never injoy <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>safety,</hi> unless the one be <hi>kept out,</hi> and the other <hi>cast out,</hi> or which is better, both subdued.

               <p>Touching <hi>Poverty,</hi> (for that error in practise proceeds many times, originally and dangerously from errour in judgement; and because a sound mind, and a right understanding of things will much advantage a man in the obtaining and injoying of a good and happy estate (for the one <hi>layes the foundation,</hi> as the other <hi>raiseth the walls</hi> and <hi>roof)</hi> and lastly, because this discourse may inrich the soul, settle the heart, and with <hi>Gods</hi> blessing change the will as well as increase wealth <hi>(an ignorant rich man,</hi> being no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>a sheep with a golden fleece)</hi> that so <hi>God</hi> in all may have the glory; I will first shew <hi>what it is,</hi> and <hi>what it is not,</hi> to be rich, and then acquaint you how of poor you may become rich. As touching the first of these, it is to be observed, that most men are much mistaken in judging who are poor, and who are rich: as strongly perswading themselves, that a man is so much the happier, by how much the more he is wealthier, which is as gross a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion as possibly can be; for there are some cases, wherein men are <hi>never the better</hi> for <hi>their wealth,</hi> and others again, wherein they are <hi>much the worse,</hi> as thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> giveth to every man a stock or portion of this worlds goods (as well as of grace and wisdom) more or lesse to occupy withall; yea, I perswade my self there are few men, that have not once in their life a golden opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered them, whereby, if they neglect it not, they may live comfortably all their dayes; and to him who is thankfull, and useth the same well, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Gods</hi> glory, and profit of himself and others, he giveth more, as <hi>to the servant which used his tallents well, he doubled them;</hi> but to such as are unthankful, and abuse the same to their own hurt and <hi>Gods</hi> dishonour, or distrustfully hoord it up, he either taketh from them that which he had formerly given, as <hi>he took away the od talent from the servant,</hi> which had but one, and <hi>did not well imploy the same, Luke</hi> 19. 24. Or else, which is worse, he gives them all

outward blessings, without his blessing upon them, and then they were better mist than had, and will do them more hurt than good, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5: 13, Or thirdly, which is worst of all, he bestowes riches upon them in wrath, as he gave a <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Israelites</hi> and <hi>Quailes:</hi> of these severally and in order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Onely it will be necessary, that I first give you an account in breif, how sordldly and <hi>ingratefully they deal with God,</hi> that so you may the better see <hi>how God again requites</hi> and payes <hi>them</hi> back in their own coin, without the least tincture of injustice or severity.</p>

               <p>GOD hath bestowed more blessings upon many men, than they have hairs on their heads, yea, <hi>God</hi> hath given them far larger portions of this worlds wealth, than he hath done to millions of their brethren; they so grow and increase in substance, as if they had found out the <hi>Philosophers stone,</hi> and had the art to <hi>turn copper into gold;</hi> or as if with <hi>Thales</hi> they had the faculty to fore-see what commodities will be cheap, and what dear: and the more <hi>God</hi> hath bestowed upon them, the greater is their debt of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the greater their duty of obedience: But alass,
<q>
                     <l>They are like the hog, that acornes feed upon,</l>
                     <l>But never look up from what tree they come:</l>
                  </q>
Or they more regard the <hi>gift</hi> than the <hi>giver;</hi> as <hi>Martia, Catoes daughter,</hi> found it to fare with her <hi>Suitors,</hi> who being asked why she did not marry, made answer, that she could not meet with a man that would love her more than hers.</p>
               <p>Perhaps they will profess they love <hi>God,</hi> and afford him a kind of verbal thanks; so resembling the <hi>Elder-tree,</hi> whose slour is more worth than all the tree besides. Or <hi>Nazianzons Country of Ozizala,</hi> which <hi>abounded with gay floures,</hi> but was <hi>barren of corn;</hi> for their thanks is a meet complement, and their <hi>lip-love</hi> no other than <hi>self-love,</hi> as any one may see by these few signs. As observe but how easily they are moved at their own injuries, how patient at <hi>Gods:</hi> let their own credits or riches be troubled, they rage like <hi>Lions,</hi> let <hi>Gods</hi> honour be questioned, they are as tame as <hi>Lambs:</hi> If the aspersion of scandal lights upon their names, there is sute upon sute, from Court to Court, all to begger the raiser of it, let the <hi>Lords</hi> dreadful name be blasphemed, they are so far from spending a penny, that they will not spare a sillable: like <hi>Jonah</hi> they are more moved for the losse of their <hi>gourd,</hi> than for all <hi>Nineveh;</hi> which could not be if they did in the least love <hi>God,</hi> or were thankful, as they say they do and are.</p>
               <p>Yea, it were well If this were the worst, if they were onely negative, if they did return nothing for all the loving kindness of <hi>God,</hi> and good they have received from him for they return evill; as may not <hi>God</hi> say to these, I mean all unholy and unmerciful rich men, as <hi>Sarah</hi> spake to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning <hi>Hagar, I have given thee mine handmaid, and How I am despised in thine eyes;</hi> And commonly this is the return that rich men make to <hi>God;</hi> for as often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he who <hi>lendeth money</hi> unto his <hi>friend,</hi> looseth both <hi>money</hi> and <hi>friend</hi> too,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34603:6"/>
as <hi>Seneca</hi> observes; so fares it between <hi>God</hi> and the ingrateful. As our <hi>stomacks</hi> are usually <hi>worst</hi> in <hi>summer,</hi> so are our appetites to grace-wards: weakest in time of prosperity and peace. And as the <hi>Moon,</hi> when she is <hi>fuller</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> is still <hi>farthest from the Sun,</hi> so the more wealth men have, the farther commonly they are from <hi>God.</hi> Too much <hi>rankness</hi> layeth the <hi>corn,</hi> and <hi>trees</hi> overladen with <hi>fruit</hi> are their own ruine. <hi>God</hi> hath thrown away a little white and red earth upon thee, and thou art like some vain <hi>Whiffler,</hi> that is <hi>proud of his borrowed chain.</hi> It had been happy for many a man, if <hi>God</hi> had permitted them to be poor still; for as <hi>Saul was changed to another man</hi> presently upon his <hi>aneynting,</hi> so are men commonly upon their advancement, and according to our ordinary proverb, their <hi>good</hi> and their <hi>bloud</hi> rises together: As if you observe, what ever they were before, if they be now but a little crossed, they will swell like the <hi>Sea in a storm,</hi> and be more troubled at <hi>an affront</hi> from their inferiour or equall, than for <hi>death</hi> or <hi>hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, how many with their <hi>greatness</hi> have such <hi>great thoughts</hi> of themselves, that <hi>God</hi> himself must not displease them: for if an unseasonable shower doth but crosse their recreations, they are ready to fall out with <hi>heaven,</hi> and to quarrel with <hi>God</hi> himself (like <hi>Mrs. Minkes</hi> riding to <hi>Ware)</hi> as if they were wronged, because he did not take his times, when to rain, and when to shine, resembling therein the <hi>Horse,</hi> that being over-much <hi>pampered</hi> will grow sierce, and <hi>kick,</hi> and not abide <hi>his rider.</hi> Or the <hi>Mules Fole,</hi> who when she hath <hi>suckt</hi> her fill, and hath enough of her <hi>damms milk,</hi> casteth up her <hi>heels</hi> and <hi>kicks</hi> unkindly. But he is a very quarrellous <hi>curr,</hi> that barks at every <hi>horse,</hi> and In the silent night the very <hi>moon-shine</hi> opens his clamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>throat.</hi> Now how do we not then wonder and blesse our selves, that such men injoy so much, something, any thing! yet hear all, and you will confess that others are more beholding to <hi>God,</hi> whom he denies, and keeps short of these bewitching baits of wealth and greatness.</p>
               <p>But I have not told you one half of their base ingratitude, for common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when they have been <hi>fatted with Gods blessings,</hi> they not onely <hi>spurn at his precepts,</hi> but as if they studied to be superlative in their provoking of him; they return <hi>the greatest</hi> and most malitious evill <hi>for the greatest</hi> and most admired <hi>love,</hi> even hating <hi>God</hi> and his people, <hi>John</hi> 15. 24, 25. yea, they most spightfully and malitiously <hi>fight</hi> on <hi>Satans</hi> and <hi>sins side</hi> against <hi>Christ,</hi> and persecute his <hi>members,</hi> and the <hi>truth,</hi> with all their might, perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and as far as they can, inforcing others to do the same; and all this against knowledge and conscience, as I have upon another occasion made it plainly appear, though the <hi>Devill</hi> so blinds them, that there is no convincing them thereof.</p>
               <p>Thus theis sin is many degrees beyond ingratitude it self; it is a wickedness of that nature, that there is no name significant enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it. Yea, to receive so many, such good things at the hands of <hi>God,</hi> and return such, and so much evill, is a desperate wickedness not to be endured.</p>

               <p>BUt observe what they get by it, and how <hi>God</hi> (even here) <hi>payes them again in their own coin;</hi> whereof I will give you several instances, for <hi>God</hi> does not deal alike with all in this case, but is various in these kinds of retaliation. If I be large upon this point, consider of what consequence and concernment it is, and you will not blame me for prolixity: yea, admit it should be supposed a digression, yet would I hope to have thanks for it.</p>
               <p>First, How many are there, to whom <hi>God</hi> gives abundance of wealth, and after some few years (for their abusing the same, and their great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulness) taketh from them again, even that which he had formerly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them? Yea, how many hundreds are there every year, even in this <hi>City,</hi> reputed good men, yea, formerly known to be so, which all on a sudden have shut up their shop windows, and broke for thousands. Neither was the <hi>talent</hi> onely taken from him in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> that evill <hi>servant</hi> was but a type of many, that should have their talents taken away.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hind in the Fable</hi> (O that it were but a fable) being <hi>hunted</hi> by the <hi>Dogs,</hi> hid her self under a <hi>vine,</hi> whose broad <hi>leaves</hi> covered her, where per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving many <hi>sweet grapes,</hi> she in requital began to <hi>eat</hi> them, but by her breaking and pulling them, she made such a <hi>noyse</hi> and shaking of the leaves, that she was soon perceived by the <hi>hunts-men,</hi> and so taken and devoured by the <hi>Dogs;</hi> such is the gain of unthankfulness. The ingrateful man forfe its all <hi>Gods</hi> favours even what he hath, and what he might further expect, meerly for want of paying that small quit-rent of <hi>thankfulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Strabo</hi> reports in his 8. <hi>Book,</hi> that the <hi>Sea,</hi> raised by an <hi>earthquake,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Helice,</hi> distant twelve furlongs from it, and drowned all the Inhabitants thereof for their inhospitallity to the <hi>Ionians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords <hi>impost</hi> for all his blessings is our <hi>thankfulness,</hi> if we neglect to pay this impost, the <hi>commodity</hi> is <hi>forfeit,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> will take it back, our returns are expected according to our receits.</p>
               <p>So that it is hard to determine, whether the <hi>ingratefull</hi> person be more <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>simple;</hi> for what man is so mad, as to purchase <hi>barren lands</hi> that will bring forth nothing but <hi>weeds, bryars</hi> and <hi>thornes?</hi> Or who will not be willing to <hi>sow</hi> plentifully, where he shall <hi>reap</hi> plentifully?</p>
               <p>The best meanes to get more, is to be thankful for what we have, <hi>God</hi> loves to <hi>sow much</hi> where he <hi>reapes much.</hi> Thankfulness for one benefit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth another, but to do good to an unthankful body, is to <hi>sow corn</hi> on the <hi>sand,</hi> and such speed thereafter. For <hi>the earth, which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and briugeth forth hearbs, meet for him by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God; but that which beareth thornes and bryars is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and is neer unto cursing, whose end is to be burned, Heb.</hi> 6. 7, 8. Whence arises this conclusion, that <hi>want</hi> of <hi>piety</hi> is the <hi>conviction</hi> of <hi>folly.</hi> But</p>

               <p>SEcondly, admit <hi>God</hi> is pleased to continue or increase the unthankful and unmercifull mans meanes, yet he denies to add his blessing withall, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34603:7"/>
then he had as good be without it; for no outward blessing proves a blessing, without <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 2.
<q>
                     <l>The wealth of <hi>Croesus,</hi> were it to he given,</l>
                     <l>Were not thanks-worthy, if un-blest by Heaven.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>That <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon all we have or do is all in all, and that without it all is nothing, is easie to prove. The <hi>diligent hand,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, maketh rich, Prov.</hi> 10. 4. but withall, the <hi>blessing of God makes rich,</hi> sayes the same <hi>Solomon, ver.</hi> 22. not diligence without <hi>Gods</hi> blessing, for without it all the <hi>earning of great wages, is but putting money into a bag with holes:</hi> Haggai 1, 6. <hi>Ye have sowen much, and bring in little, ye eat, but ye have not enough, ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink, ye cloath you, but there is no warmness, and he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes;</hi> and a great deal of the like in verse the ninth: and why all this? they were all for themselves, and sought not the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and therefore he did <hi>blow upon it,</hi> and <hi>blast all their blessings,</hi> as the whole book shews. And the same we dayly see; for have not many men great <hi>sees,</hi> great <hi>offices,</hi> great <hi>revenues,</hi> great <hi>gettings,</hi> and yet they can scarce keep themselves out of debt? Yea, who more needy, and who run more in debt than those, that have hundreds and thousands a year? whereas others that have very little, but small means, and yet maintain themselves and their families well, yea, and help their poor friends and neighbours also. Onely <hi>the word that proceedeth out of Gods mouth,</hi> makes the difference, his blessing sets forward the one, which he justly with holds from the other for their wicked unthankfulness.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Labau changed Jacobs wages ten times,</hi> yet he could not one time change that blessing of <hi>God</hi> which was alwayes with him. <hi>A little thing which the rightoeus injoyeth is better than great riches to the wicked, Prov.</hi> 16. 8. Meat, though it have a vertue to nourish, Medicine, though it have a vertue to heal, rayment, though it can both adorn and defend the body against the injury of air and cold, wealth, though it can make rich, yet <hi>man liveth not by bread,</hi> physick, rayment, &amp;c. <hi>onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God does a man live,</hi> as <hi>our Saviour</hi> speaks, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 4.</p>
               <p>Nay, without <hi>Gods</hi> blessing the very use of their meat is taken away, for it shall not satisfie, as it fell out with them, <hi>Hosea</hi> 4. 10. And the like of other things, <hi>Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it, except the Lord keep the City, the keeper watcheth in vain.

               <p>There is no reason in the world, that <hi>seven leaves,</hi> and <hi>a few little fishes,</hi> in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> should <hi>feed four thousand,</hi> much lesse, that <hi>five loaves</hi> and <hi>two fishes</hi> should <hi>feed five thousand,</hi> meanes very insufficient to natural reason; yet <hi>God</hi> speaking the word to them, they did it. The like whereof we may read 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 43, 44. So for the <hi>apparell of the Israelites,</hi> which they had when they were young and <hi>children in AEgypt,</hi> to serve them till they were <hi>grown men,</hi> even forty yeares together <hi>in the wilderness,</hi> without being worn out, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29 5. and the like of that <hi>water and pulse,</hi> which with <hi>Gods</hi> blessing made <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his companions, <hi>fatter and fairer than all the children, which did eat the portion of the Kings meat,</hi> Dan. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>We live by food, but not by any vertue that is in it without <hi>God;</hi> yea, without the concurence of his providence bread would rather choak than nourish us: if he withdraw his word and blessing from his creatures, in their greatrst abundance we perish.

serve the turn, or do us any good, without the blessing of <hi>God</hi> upon it, let us not forfeit his blessing by our vile ingratitude, but rather desire his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, though we want the meanes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If it be the blessing of <hi>God</hi> that makes rich, and not anything that we can do, let us take heed of ascribing the same to our wit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, of <hi>sacrificing to our net, and burning incense to our yarne,</hi> as the <hi>Prophet</hi> speaks, <hi>Hab.</hi>

               <p>Fourthly and lastly, say not as many do, O that I were so rich, that I had but so much as such a man! then should I be happy: but rather desire <hi>God,</hi> that he will bless and sanctifie unto thee what thou hast, that he may have glory, thy self and others good by the same: or else <hi>God</hi> may give thee thy desire, yea, more than thy heart can wish, as the <hi>Psalmisi</hi> speakes of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7 3. 7, 9. but it shall be to thy grief and sorrow: as it was said to <hi>Neroes Mother</hi> about her sons being <hi>Emperour:</hi> or as <hi>Bacchus</hi> granted the request of <hi>Midas,</hi> whose desire was, that whatsoever he touched might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly be converted into <hi>gold;</hi> which was little to his comfort, when even his <hi>bread, wine,</hi> the <hi>feathers of his bed,</hi> his <hi>shirt garments,</hi> and every thing else turned into that hard mettal, as <hi>Fulgentius</hi> delivers it: he had his desire, but so, as he would gladly now have unpray'd his prayers. Alass, how often does riches, without <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon them, prove or become the owners ruine? Many a <hi>young Heir</hi> hath a great and <hi>fair estate</hi> left him, and is cryed up as happy, but it proves to him within a while, even like the <hi>Ark</hi> to the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines,</hi> which did them more hurt than good; and so fares it with all that forget <hi>God,</hi> and are unthankful to him for what they have.

               <p>As suppose a man growes never so rich by indirect meanes, as some care nor how, but what and how much they get; for to get <hi>one scruple of gold,</hi> they will make <hi>no scruple of conscience;</hi> they care not to <hi>make many poor to make themselves rich:</hi> for they have consciences like a <hi>barn door,</hi> as loving money better than themselves: yea, they care not, so they may <hi>get silver</hi> if they loose their <hi>souls.</hi> Now <hi>God</hi> not seldom suffers such to grow very rich, but together with their riches, they have the curse of <hi>God,</hi> whereby they become the worse, and not the better, for them.</p>

And so of their <hi>Quaeiles, He gave them their desire, but he sent leannesse into their soules,</hi> Psal. 106. 15. <hi>They did eat and were well filled, yet turned they not from their lusts; but the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, even the wrath of the Lord was kindled against the people, and the Lord smote the people with an exceeding great plague,</hi> Numb. 11. 33. Psal. 78: 29, 30, 31. And in another place, <hi>Let their table be a suare unto them, and their prosperity their ruine,</hi> Psal. 69. 22. They had better have had <hi>no meat,</hi> then <hi>such sauce</hi> withall.</p>
               <p>The covetous Cormorant, and unthankful wretch, deales with <hi>God,</hi> as a <hi>dog</hi> does with his master, who devoureth by and by whatever he can catch, and gapeth continually after more: and it were a marvel, that God should answer him with such abundance, and as it were, be still pouring <hi>water</hi> into that <hi>vessel</hi> which already runs over, considering his monstrous unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; were it not to rot the <hi>hoops</hi> and <hi>chines,</hi> that so the whole <hi>cask</hi> may break in pieces, were there not poyson mixt with it, I mean <hi>Gods</hi> secret curse, as I shall suddenly shew.</p>
               <p>We well know, that a <hi>Ship</hi> may be so <hi>laden,</hi> as that her very <hi>freight</hi> may be the cause of her <hi>sinking. Demonioa</hi> having betrayed <hi>Ephesus</hi> (where all her friends and kindred were) to <hi>Brennus</hi> of <hi>Seuona</hi> for the love of gain, was brought to a great heap of gold, and loaded so heavy therewith, that she dyed under the burthen. <hi>Tarpeia</hi> for the desire she had of all <hi>the gold bracelets</hi> which the <hi>Sabines</hi> wore about their left armes, when they went to <hi>besiege Room,</hi> sold the Fort or <hi>Castle</hi> of the <hi>City</hi> (wherein there was a great <hi>Garrison,</hi> of which her Father <hi>Tarpeius</hi> was <hi>Captain)</hi> to the <hi>Sabines;</hi> and asking for reward of her treason, <hi>Fatius</hi> the <hi>Sabines General,</hi> according to his promise, when she had opened them a <hi>gaete</hi> in the night and let them in, commanded his whole <hi>Army</hi> to do as he did, who taking the <hi>bracelet</hi> which himself wore on his left arm, and his <hi>target,</hi> did hang them about her neck, and so all the rest, untill she being bowed down to the ground with the weight of them, was pressed to death under the burthen. And much after this manner does <hi>God</hi> deal with unmerciful misers, and all wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful men. As see the sad condition of a man, to whom <hi>God</hi> gives riches in wrath; it is so well worth your knowledge and observation, that <hi>David</hi> was very inquisitive with the <hi>Lord</hi> about it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 3. to 13 and likewise the <hi>Prophet Jeremy,</hi> chap. 12. <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I speak with thee, yet let me talk with thee of thy judgements; wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously? Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root, they grow, yea, they bring sorth fruit; thou art neer in their mouth, and far from their reines, ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:34603:9"/>
neither will your teeth water after their dainties: as what is ever the conclusion? their felicity and happiness is no sooner mentioned, but it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: <hi>And thou diddest set them in slippery places, thou castedst them down into destruction, they are brought into desolation, in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrours,</hi> Psalm 73. 18. to the 21. verse. <hi>Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter,</hi> Ierem. 12. 3. <hi>They spend their dayes in wealth, and in a moment they go down into hell,</hi> Job 21. 13. <hi>Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God,</hi> Psal. 55. 19. But no greater judgement, then thus to be free from judgements. <hi>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone, saith God,</hi> Hosea 4. 17. And the like: <hi>I will not visit your daughters when they are harlots, nor your Spouses when they are whores,</hi> ver. 14. and hereupon all they do is well.</p>
               <p>But think it not an argument of <hi>Gods</hi> favour or dispensation, that thou and thousands more do prosper in their wickedness, that some eminent judgement is not executed speedily upon them, while they are contriving their deep and divelish plots: For though <hi>prosperous wickednesse</hi> is one of the <hi>devils strongest chaines,</hi> yet there cannot be a greater unhappiness, an heavier curse, than to prosper in ill designs and ungracious courses. Such a mans <hi>preservation</hi> is but a <hi>reservation,</hi> as it fared with <hi>Sodom and her sisters,</hi> which were preserved from the slaughter of the <hi>four Kings,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> might rain down <hi>hell from heaven</hi> upon them. And <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> who escaped the stroak of the <hi>destroying Angell,</hi> that he might fall by the sword of his own Sons, <hi>Isai.</hi> 37. 37, 38.</p>
               <p>Wicked men are not wise enough to cosinder, that usually <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>most afflict</hi> those whom he <hi>best affecteth;</hi> dealing with his children, as the <hi>good husband</hi> deales with his <hi>trees,</hi> those in the <hi>garden</hi> he is ever and anon <hi>medling</hi> with them, either <hi>lopping</hi> off the superfluous <hi>branches,</hi> or <hi>scraping</hi> off the <hi>moss,</hi> or <hi>paring</hi> of the <hi>root,</hi> or <hi>digging</hi> and <hi>dunging</hi> about them, so using all good meanes to make them <hi>fruitfull;</hi> whereas he lets them alone which grow in the <hi>hedge-row</hi> or <hi>sorrest,</hi> till at the length he comes with his <hi>Axe</hi> and cuts them down for the <hi>fire.</hi> Fatted ware, you know, is but fitted for the sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. <hi>God</hi> puts <hi>money</hi> indeed into these earthen <hi>boxes,</hi> that have onely one chink to let in, but none to let out, with purpose to break them when they are full. What was <hi>Haman</hi> the better for all he had, when the <hi>King</hi> frowned upon him? or the happier for being lift up the <hi>ladder,</hi> when he was to come down again with a <hi>rope?</hi> And for ought thou knowest, this very night thou mayest loose both thy gold, thy life, and thy soul too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ever thou makest choise of, let me rather beg with innocent <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then abound with unjust <hi>Ahab,</hi> or unmerciful <hi>Dives,</hi> so shall my turn be soon over, whilst theirs is to come and continue ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.</p>
               <p>But my purpose is not so much to shew you, what will be the end of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful and ungrateful men, as how their riches proves a curse to them here.

And again, <hi>There is one alone, and there is not a second, yea, he hath neither child nor brother, yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, neither saith he, for whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good: this is also vanity, yea, this is a sore travell,</hi> Eccles. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Yea, how many such could I nominate, that are <hi>baser</hi> by being <hi>wealthier,</hi> that are no other than <hi>rich beggers,</hi> or <hi>beggers in the midst of their riches</hi> (as <hi>Cain</hi> was a vagabond upon his own land) upon whose estates there is set <hi>a spell,</hi> insomuch that their wealth sayes to them in effect, <hi>touch not, tast not, handle not.</hi>

They are like <hi>Tautalus,</hi> who stands up to the chin in water, and hath all kinds of fruits hanging over his head, but is not suffered to tast of the one, nor drink of the other: Or like an <hi>Asse,</hi> that is <hi>laden with gold,</hi> or dainty cates, but <hi>feeds upon thistles:</hi> Or like the <hi>Indians,</hi> who though they have all the <hi>gold</hi> amongst them, yet are the <hi>most beggerly</hi> and naked people alive.</p>

Riches are good when the party that possesseth them can tell how to use them; but as <hi>instruments</hi> are of no use unto them that are ignorant of <hi>musick,</hi> so are riches of no use to the covetous. So that in my judgement, that <hi>rich fool</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> was far wiser than these blocks, for he having attained his purpose, got a great estate, could after all afford himself the comfort of it; for these are his words to himself, <hi>Thou hast much goods laid up for many yeares, live at ease, eat, drink and take thy pastime,</hi> Luke 12. 19.</p>
               <p>Nay, to abound with all things, and to be never the better for them, not to partake of them, what <hi>fool or mad man</hi> hath been known so senseless? yea, not to flatter his pretended prudence, no beast will <hi>starve in a fat pasture;</hi> if then a man shall pinch his guts when <hi>God</hi> hath afforded him affluence; the <hi>Asse is not so very an Asse</hi> as he. Nor do I know any beast like him, save <hi>Pharaohs seven lean and evill favoured kine,</hi> and to them he is very like: For when his large and greedy conscience hath devoured or eaten up many Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomers or Clients estates, as they did the <hi>seven fat and well favoured kine,</hi> yet it cannot be known by any reall amendment, that he hath eaten them, but in his food, raiment, satisfaction of his mind, &amp;c. he is as ill favoured as at the beginning. He doth not more lock up his goods from the <hi>theis</hi> than from <hi>himself:</hi> So that I cannot more fitly compare him to any thing, than to an <hi>Idoll,</hi> for as an <hi>Idoll</hi> hath <hi>eyes but sees not,</hi> so he hath <hi>a reasonable soul, but understands not.</hi> And most just it is, that he who is <hi>unjust to all others,</hi> should be <hi>most unjust to himself.</hi> And as a covetous man is good to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, so he is worst of all to himself.</p>
               <p>It is the depth of misery to fall under the <hi>curse of Cham, a servant of servants, divitis servi, maxime servi,</hi> no thraldom to the inward and outward bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage too. So that if there be any creature miserable, it is the miserable miserly muck-worm; and yet he is least to be pitied, because he makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus miserable.</p>
               <p>Now this may move wonder to astonishment! that they should take such care and paines, and cast away their soules to heap up riches, and when they have done, to be never a penny the better for them. Yea, what can any wise man think of them, are they not <hi>stark mad?</hi> are they not <hi>fooles in folio?</hi> What, take so much <hi>care</hi> and <hi>paines,</hi> indure so much <hi>greif, sting of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, losse of credit, deprive themselves of heaven, damn their own soules,</hi> to get wealth, and when they have got it, not to be the better for it: yea, they are lesse satisfied and contented than before, meanlier accommodated than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34603:11"/>
mean men; and could this possible be so, if <hi>God</hi> did not give them their riches in wrath? nor would he otherwise deny them the use of their own; for the <hi>wise man</hi> hath given it as a rule, That <hi>to whom God hath given riches as a blessing, he also giveth him to eat, and drink, and to take pleasure, and delight his soul with the profit of his labours, wherein he travelleth under the sun:</hi> for which see <hi>Ecces.</hi> 2. 24. and 3. 12, 13. and 5. 17, 18, 19. and 8. 15.

               <p>SEcondly, To this is added as another judgement, let the ingrateful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless miser have <hi>never so much, he is</hi> never the more, but the <hi>lesse contented:</hi> As how many have mighty estates, their <hi>houses full, their shops and ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses full,</hi> their <hi>coffers full,</hi> their <hi>purses full,</hi> and their <hi>pastures full,</hi> and yet as if their <hi>hearts were bottomlesse,</hi> that is, still as lank and empty through an excessive desire of more, as if they did indeed want all things. The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants <hi>desires</hi> are rather <hi>sharpened by injoying,</hi> and <hi>augmented by posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>For wishing still, his wishes never cease,</l>
                     <l>But as his wealth, his wishes still increase.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>To shew that covetous men belong to <hi>hell after they dye,</hi> they are <hi>like hell while they liue: Hell is never filled,</hi> and <hi>they are never satisfied,</hi> covetous men <hi>drink brine,</hi> which increaseth <hi>thirst</hi> rather than quenches it. And though the <hi>devil</hi> should say to them as he said to <hi>our Saviour,</hi> touching the whole world, and glory thereof, <hi>all these will I give thee,</hi> (though he needs not offer them all, for they will serve him for less) yet all would not content them, no more than <hi>heaven</hi> it self contented <hi>Lucifer:</hi> For as the <hi>rich glutton in hell</hi> desired a <hi>drop</hi> of water, and yet a <hi>river</hi> would not have satisfied him; for if his desire had been granted in the first, he would have required more, and then more to that, never ceasing to ask, never having enough, nor being the better when he had it: so it fares with the covetous man, his <hi>abundance</hi> no more <hi>quencheth</hi> his <hi>lust,</hi> than <hi>fuell does the flame.</hi> For as <hi>oyle kindleth the fire,</hi> which it seemes to quench, so riches come as though they would make him contented, but they make him more covetous. And is not this thy very case that art covetous? No man more happy, in respect of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, then thy self, couldest thou but see it; thou hast all things that heart can wish, and shouldest thou but come to want what thou now injoyest, and thinkest not worth thanks; when it were past thou wouldest say, thou wast most happy, and after a little misse, wish withall thine heart, thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est the same again: yea, a world for such a condition and content withall. Onely the <hi>devill</hi> (by <hi>Gods</hi> just permission) bewitches thee to think, that thou hast not enough, when thou hast too much, and more than thou needest, or knowest what to do withall.</p>
               <p>Nor is it possible for a worldling to be contented: for whereas <hi>naturall desires</hi> are <hi>soon satisfied,</hi> those that are <hi>unnaturall are infinite. Hunger</hi> is soon apeased with <hi>meat,</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> allayed with <hi>drink:</hi> but in burning Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>quo plus sunt potae plus sitiuntur aquae,</hi> they still love, <hi>amore concupi
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34603:11"/>
scentiae,</hi> never <hi>amore complacentiae.</hi> If covetous, or ambitious men ever feel content in these transitory things, it is no otherwise then as <hi>itching soars</hi> do in <hi>clawing</hi> and <hi>scratching fingers.</hi> And indeed how should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate desires be satisfied with increase, according as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, when these appetites are not capable of satiety?</p>
               <p>Men in this case, are like <hi>poysoned Rats,</hi> which when they have <hi>tasted</hi> of their <hi>bane,</hi> cannot rest untill they <hi>drink,</hi> and then can much less rest till they <hi>drink again, swell and burst.</hi> Covetousness is like the <hi>disease called the Woolf,</hi> which is <hi>alwayes eating,</hi> and yet keeps the body <hi>lean. A moderate water</hi> makes the <hi>Mill goe</hi> merrily, but <hi>too much</hi> will not suffer it to go at all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another reason is, Nothing can <hi>fill the heart</hi> of man, but he that <hi>made it:</hi> The heart shall be satisfied <hi>with gold,</hi> when the body shall be contented <hi>with winde.</hi> The whole <hi>world is circular,</hi> the <hi>heart</hi> of man is <hi>triangular;</hi> and we know a <hi>circle</hi> cannot fill a <hi>triangle.</hi> Yea if it be not <hi>filled</hi> with the <hi>three persons in Trinity,</hi> it will be <hi>filled with the world,</hi> the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>devil.</hi> The heart is the seat or receptacle of <hi>spiritual</hi> things; and the things of the world are <hi>corporal</hi> and carnal: Now carnal and corporal things, can no more fill our <hi>hearts,</hi> then spiritual things can fill our <hi>Coffers. Visible light</hi> will not cleer the <hi>invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble understanding;</hi> nor will corporal food feed the soul. <hi>Blessed are they, sayes our Saviour, who thirst after righteousness, for they shall be satisfied,</hi> Mat. 5. 6. not they that thirst after riches, or honor, or pleasure; for instead of being satisfied, they thirst more. Yea these <hi>Mammonists</hi> are so <hi>infinite in desiring,</hi> that could such a one swallow the <hi>whole earth</hi> that swallows all, and will swallow him ere long, it might choak him, but not satisfie him, as abundance of examples that I could give you, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently prove: namely <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> and <hi>Marcus Crassus,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>THirdly, to this is added as a further judgement, that as the more he hath the more he coveteth, so the neerer he is to his journeys end, the more provision he makes for it. Other vices are weakned with age and continuance, onely <hi>covetousness</hi> (and that odious sin of <hi>drunkenness)</hi> grows stronger. As the covetous wretch increaseth in yeers, so he increaseth in covetousness. What <hi>Pline</hi> writes of the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> is fitly appliable to the miserly muckworm: other creatures grow up to their height, and then decay and dye, onely the <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile grows to her last day.</hi> The aged worldling, though he have one foot in the grave, yet his appetite to, and persute of gain, are but new born. Yea, though he hath out-lived all the <hi>teeth</hi> in his <hi>gums,</hi> the <hi>hairs</hi> of his <hi>head,</hi> the <hi>sight</hi> of his <hi>eyes,</hi> the <hi>tast</hi> of his <hi>palate;</hi> have he never so much, yet he hath not enough, and therefore would live to get more, and <hi>covets,</hi> as if he had <hi>a thousand generations</hi> to provide for.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34603:12"/>
He so <hi>lives,</hi> as if he were <hi>never to dye;</hi> and so dyes, as if he were <hi>never to live again.</hi> He <hi>fears</hi> all things, like a <hi>mortal</hi> man, sayes <hi>Seneca,</hi> but he <hi>desires</hi> all things, as if he were <hi>immortal.</hi> Had it not been for <hi>sin, death</hi> had never <hi>entered into the world:</hi> and were it not for <hi>death, sin</hi> (especially the Misers. sin) would <hi>never go out of the world. Lust</hi> is commonly the disease of <hi>youth, ambition</hi> of <hi>middle age, covetousness</hi> of <hi>old age:</hi> And <hi>Plautus</hi> maketh it a wonder to see an old man benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But what saith <hi>By as,</hi> covetousness in old men is most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous: for what can be more foolish and ridiculous, then to provide more mony and victuals for our journey, when we are almost at our journyes end?</p>
               <p>Wherefore remember thou, O old man, yea O remember! that your <hi>Spring</hi> is <hi>past,</hi> your <hi>Summer over-past,</hi> and you are arrived at the <hi>fall of the leaf;</hi> yea <hi>winter colours</hi> have already stained your head with gray and <hi>hoary hairs.</hi> Remember also, that if <hi>God</hi> in justice did not <hi>leave you,</hi> and the <hi>Prince of darkness</hi> did not <hi>blinde you,</hi> and your own <hi>heart</hi> did not grosly <hi>deceive you;</hi> you could not possible be so senceless as you are in these three last mentioned miseries.</p>
               <p>Thus three of the covetous mans woes are past, but behold more are coming; for God inflicts more plagues upon him, then ever he did upon <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> I'le acquaint you only with seven more.</p>

               <p>FOurthly, his thoughts are so taken up with what he wants (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desires, for he wants nothing but wit, and a good heart) that he not once mindes or cares for what he hath, as you may see in <hi>Abab,</hi> 1Kings 21. 4. and <hi>Haman,</hi> Hester 5. 13. and <hi>Micha,</hi> Judges 18. 24.</p>
               <p>What the covetons man hath, he sees not; his eyes are so taken up with what he wants; yea the very desire of what he cannot get tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments him, and it is an heart-breaking to him, not to add every day somewhat to his estate: besides, not to improve it so many hundreds e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yeer, will disparage his wisdom more to the world, then any thing else he can do, as I have heard such an one allege, when I have told him my thoughts, about perplexing himself.</p>
               <p>But see the difference between him, and one that hath either wit or grace: whose manner it is, even in case of the greatest losses, to look both to <hi>what he hath lost,</hi> and to <hi>what he hath left;</hi> and instead of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining,</hi> to be thankful that he hath lost no more, having so much left that he might have been deprived of.

               <p>FIftly, the <hi>Devil,</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> just permission, prevails by his <hi>temptations,</hi> to make them think that the <hi>forbidden fruit</hi> is the <hi>sweetest</hi> of all fruits, as he did <hi>our first parents.</hi> Nor will any other content him; each thing pleaseth him better that is not his own.

               <p>
                  <hi>Plines Woolf</hi> is a true emblem of this avaritious beast: whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is when he is eating his prey, though never so hungry, if he sees another beast feeding, to forsake that which he is about, to take the prey from the other. <hi>Ahab</hi> was such a Wolf, who could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himself with his own, though he injoyed a whole <hi>kingdom,</hi> but he must wrest <hi>Naboths inheritance</hi> from him. The commandment is express, <hi>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbors house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife, servant, Ox, Asse, nor any thing that is thy neighbors,</hi> Exod. 20. 17. and all that fear <hi>God</hi> observe it; but nothing more cross to the grain of a wicked mans heart, to whom <hi>stoln waters are most sweet, and hid bread the most pleasant,</hi> Prov. 9. 17. For one so insatiably covets after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother mans <hi>estate</hi> or <hi>office,</hi> that he is never the better for his own Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther so loves his neighbors wife, that he even loaths and contemnes his own. <hi>Thy neighbors wife to thee, to him thines fairest,</hi> sayes the <hi>Poet.</hi> Hence hath that cursed speech issued from one too great to name, That he could love his wife above any other, if she were not his wife, a word sufficient to <hi>rot out the tongue</hi> that spake it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> was a wise man, and had tryed all things. Oh that men would be so wise as to take his counsel, and <hi>injoy their own with joy and gladness of heart; drink waters out of their own Cistern, and rejoyce with the wife of their youth, so as her brests may satisfie them at all times, and they be ravisht alwayes with her love,</hi> rather then deprive themselves of that happiness, by <hi>inbracing the bosom of a stranger,</hi> and coveting that which is anothers, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 15. to 21. Oh that thou wouldst be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, that thy present condition what ever it is, is the best for thee, hadst thou but the wit to see it; and that onely good use gives praise to earthly possessions: that there are no riches comparable to content (for this is the gift of <hi>God)</hi> then surely <hi>thou wilt not much remember the dayes of thy life, because God answereth the joy of thine heart,</hi> Eceles. 5. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>But no matter, they love misery (lose the comfort of their own brest, and all outward blessings, together with the tuition of <hi>God)</hi> and they shall have it; for he that makes his fire with hay, hath <hi>much smoak,</hi> and but a little heat, which leads me to the sixt particular.</p>

               <p>SIxthly, another sore judgement which God inflicts upon the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciless mnckworm, for his monstrous unthankfulness, is, he injoyes not a merry day, no not a pleasant hour in seven yeers, ye if you observe it, he resembles <hi>Agelaustus,</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Crassus,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver laughed in all his life, save once when he saw <hi>a mare eating of thistles:</hi> or rather <hi>Anaxagorus Clazoenius,</hi> who was never seen to laugh or smile from the day of his birth. Joyes never so much as look in at the door of his heart; <hi>worldly delights</hi> to him, are but like <hi>delicate meates</hi> to him that hath <hi>lost his tast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But O the <hi>cares, fears, anxieties, sighs, sorrows, suspitions, sad thoughts, restless desires,</hi> the <hi>horrors, troubles, tortures, torments, vexations, distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, griefs, girdes, gripes, grudgings, repinings, doubts, dolors, despera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that are the ordinary companions of the covetous. How is he hurried with <hi>desires</hi> to get, distracted with getting, vexed for what he cannot get, tortured for what he loseth, or another gaineth, troubled with fear of losing what he hath already gained? yea his labor to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riches is <hi>restless,</hi> his care to keep them <hi>boundless,</hi> his <hi>sorrow</hi> if he chance to lose them <hi>endless,</hi> and his fear lest he should hereafter lack <hi>cureless.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of all <hi>plagues</hi> sent into <hi>Egypt,</hi> that of the <hi>Flies</hi> was one of the most troublesome, for they <hi>never suffered men to rest,</hi> for the more they were beaten off, the more they came upon them: so of all miseries and vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations that <hi>God</hi> layes upon worldlings; this is not the least, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually vexed and tormented with cares, which they neither can (nor indeed would) beat off by any means they are able to devise; for they rush in upon them in the <hi>morning</hi> so soon as they <hi>awake,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them in the <hi>day,</hi> forsake them not at <hi>night,</hi> they follow them to <hi>bed,</hi> and will not suffer them to <hi>sleep:</hi> their thoughts will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to sleep, nor their sleep permit them to <hi>rest.</hi> They afflict them in their <hi>dreams,</hi> as giving them no quiet either by day, or night, as <hi>God</hi> threatneth to wicked men by the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 6. I could give you a large bill of particulars; but fear of cloying is alwayes at hand to curb me: wherefore take these few for a taste. Want does not break so many sleeps for provision the next day, as <hi>abundance</hi> does for increase. His <hi>nights</hi> are as troublesome and unquiet as his <hi>dayes;</hi> and his <hi>dayes</hi> as the <hi>dayes of Babylons downfall.</hi> Never is more <hi>watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> then where is most purpose of wickedness: see <hi>Micha</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 4. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 12. Twas <hi>Chilons</hi> sentence, <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Usury</hi> go commonly together.</p>
               <p>If his plot be crossed, and his hand cannot act that wickedness by day, which his head hath devised by night, he is taken with a fit of of melancholy, sick of the sullens, as was <hi>Ahab.</hi> He thinks it a death, that he cannot be suffered to dye; it is a <hi>hell</hi> to him, that the <hi>gates of hell</hi> are <hi>shut</hi> against him.</p>

                  <hi>Having ingrossed a commodity,</hi> if he cannot have his <hi>expected price</hi> for it, or prevail not in his sute, or cannot recover what he expected, or if any one breaks in his debt, or if he hear of a Taxe, or some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable payment, and an hundred the like, every of them adds to the care and grief of his heart, which was ready to burst with care and grief before; for he had rather be damned, then damnified; and in case he cannot have his will of another, he will be revenged of himself, like <hi>Nanplius</hi> King of <hi>Euboea,</hi> who when he could not revenge his sons death upon <hi>Ulysses,</hi> cast himself into the <hi>Sea.</hi> Yea in case he sustain any great loss, he is ready to make himself away: as <hi>Menip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> of <hi>Phenicia</hi> did, who having lost his goods, strangled himself. Or like <hi>Dinarcus Phidon,</hi> who at a certain loss, cut his own throat, to save the charge of a cord. At least he feels more <hi>sorrow in losing</hi> his mony, then ever he found <hi>pleasure in getting it:</hi> nor will any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition content him; for the <hi>lightness of his purse,</hi> gives him an <hi>heavy heart,</hi> which yet filled, doth fill him with more care. His <hi>medicin</hi> is his <hi>malady.</hi> These rich men, are no less troubled with that they possess (lest they should lose it) then poor men are for that they want. In the day time, he dares not go abroad for fear of robbing; nor stay at home for fear of killing. His thoughts are so troubled with <hi>fear of thieves,</hi> that he cannot, that he dares not <hi>sleep:</hi> yea he fears a <hi>thief</hi> worse then the <hi>devil,</hi> therefore will he be <hi>beholding to the devil</hi> for a <hi>spell</hi> to save him from the <hi>thief;</hi> which once obtained, a little <hi>Opium</hi> may <hi>rock his cares asleep,</hi> and help him to a golden dream; for all his minde and heart is to get mony; if waking, he <hi>talks</hi> of nothing but earth, if <hi>sleeping,</hi> he dreams of it. Lastly, as if all his delight were to vex himself, he pines himself away with distrustful fear of want, and projecting how he shall live hereafter, and when he is old: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling <hi>Ventidius</hi> the <hi>Poet,</hi> who would not be perswaded but he should dye a begger.

The which is notably illustrated <hi>Job</hi> 20. 12. to 20. which together with the whole Chapter, is marvellous good for cruel and unmerciful men to read; for I may not stand here to repeat it. <hi>Sweetness</hi> is <hi>promised</hi> in the <hi>bread of deceit,</hi> but men finde it as <hi>gravel, crashing between their teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will his troubled conscience suffer him to steal a sound sleep: yea he sleeps as unquietly, as if his <hi>pillow</hi> were <hi>stuft with Lawyers per-knives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may give ye a hint of these things from the word, but onely <hi>God</hi> and he can tell, how the remembrance of his forepast cozenages and oppression, occasions his guilty conscience many secret wrings and pinches, and gives his heart many a sore lash, to increase the fear and horror of his soul every time he calls the same to remembrance, which is not seldom: As, O <hi>poor wretches!</hi> what do they indure? how are they immerged in the horrors of a vulned conscience? there is more <hi>ease</hi> in a <hi>nest of Hornets,</hi> then under the sting of such a <hi>tormenting conscience.</hi> He that hath this plague, is like <hi>a man in debt,</hi> who suspecteth that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>bush</hi> he sees, is a <hi>Sergant</hi> to <hi>arest and carry him away to prison.</hi> It was <hi>Gods</hi> curse upon <hi>Cain,</hi> when he had slain his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> to suspect and fear, <hi>that every one he met would kill him:</hi> yea it makes him so afraid of every thing, that a very <hi>Maulking frights him,</hi> and it is much, that he dares trust his <hi>Barber to shave him. Dionysius</hi> was so troubled with fear and horror of conscience, that not daring to trust his best friends with a <hi>razor,</hi> he used to <hi>findge his beard with burning coals,</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords. He is much like a <hi>Malefactor in prison,</hi> who though he fare well, yet is tormented with the thought of ensuing judgement. It is the <hi>hand-writing on the wall,</hi> that prints bloody characters in <hi>Belshazzars heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that if any should deem a man <hi>the better,</hi> or happier, for being the <hi>richer,</hi> he is very shallow; as many looking on the outer face of things, or see but the one side (as they used to paint <hi>Antigonus,</hi> that they might conceal his deformity on the other side) see not how they smart in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, how their consciences gripe them. Nor does any one know, how the <hi>shoo wrings the foot,</hi> but he that wears the same.</p>
               <p>Or admit the best that can come, as suppose they <hi>can stop consciences mouth</hi> for a time, or <hi>with the musick of their mony play it asleep</hi> for the present; yet when they lye upon their death-beds, it will sting them to the quick. For when <hi>death hesiegeth the body, Satan</hi> will not fail to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagure the soul;</hi> yea then he will be sure to lay on load; for as <hi>all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34603:14"/>
humors, run to the diseased and bruised part of the body;</hi> so when conscience is once awakened, all former sins, and present crosses joyn together to make the bruise or sore more <hi>painful.</hi> As every <hi>Creditor</hi> falls upon the poor man, when he is once <hi>arested.</hi> Or let it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that his con<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cience never troubles him on <hi>his sick bed,</hi> and that he <hi>have no bonds in his death,</hi> as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.—but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts like a <hi>Lamb,</hi> which is not onely possible but probable; for more by many thousands go to hell like <hi>Naball,</hi> then like <hi>Judas;</hi> more dye like <hi>sots in security,</hi> then in <hi>despair</hi> of conscience: yet all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for the sting of conscience here, though it be intollerable, is but a <hi>flea-biting</hi> to that he shall endure hereafter, where <hi>the worm of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence dyeth not, and where the fire never goeth out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is part of <hi>sins wages,</hi> and <hi>Satans reward: We have sinned, therefore our hearts are heavy,</hi> Isa. 59. 11, 12. <hi>The sorrows of them that offer to another God</hi> (as do the covetous) <hi>shall be multiplyed, says holy David,</hi> Psal. 16. 4. Yea <hi>Seneca</hi> an <hi>heathen</hi> could say, that an evil life causeth an unquiet minde; so that <hi>Satans</hi> government, is rather a bondage then a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, unto which <hi>Christ</hi> giveth up those that shake off his own.</p>
               <p>What his government is, you may partly guess at by the servile sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries he puts his subjects upon. As O the many <hi>hard services</hi> which <hi>Satan</hi> puts his servants upon, and what a <hi>bad Master</hi> is he: when we read that <hi>Origen</hi> at his onely appointment, made himself an <hi>Eunuch. Democritus</hi> put out his own eyes, <hi>Crates</hi> cast his <hi>money</hi> into the <hi>Sea, Thracius</hi> cut down all the <hi>Vines,</hi> whereas <hi>David</hi> did none of these; <hi>Ahaz made his son to pass through the fire,</hi> Jephta <hi>sacrificed his onely daughter,</hi> as the text seems to import. Wicked men <hi>think they do God good service in putting his children to death:</hi> but where do we finde any Religious <hi>Israelite,</hi> or servant of <hi>God,</hi> at such cost? or when did <hi>God</hi> require this of his servants? The <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apostles</hi> never <hi>whipt</hi> nor <hi>lanced</hi> themselves, but <hi>Baals Priests</hi> did this and more. And so of the <hi>Papists,</hi> those <hi>hypocrites</hi> of late yeers, and the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old. How many sleepless nights, and restless dayes, and wretched shifts, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bloody plots and practises, does covetousness and ambition cost men? which the humble and contented <hi>Christian</hi> is unacquainted with. How does the covetous mans <hi>heart droop wish his Mammon?</hi> How does he turmoile and vex his spirit, torment his conscience, and make himself a very <hi>map of misery,</hi> and a <hi>sink of calamity?</hi> it is nothing so with Christs servants.</p>

               <p>I Have much more to enlarge of the miseries of unmerciful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate full Misers, but before I speak of them, I will give you the <hi>reasons</hi> and <hi>uses</hi> of these already dispatcht, wherein I will be as brief as may be.</p>
               <p>You see that God may give men <hi>riches in wrath;</hi> and so as they shall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34603:15"/>
be never the better for them, but the worse. Now that you may not think it any strange thing, observe the reasons why, and how justly they are so served.</p>
               <p>The first Reason is, the unmerciful Misers monstrous unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for those millions of mercies he hath received from God (of which I shall give you an account in the second part) this causes God either not at all to give him, or in giving him riches, to add this you have heard as a curse withall. He is unthankful for what he hath, therefore have he never so much, it shall not be worth thanks. He is cruel to the poor, therefore he shall be as cruel to himself. The poor shall have no comfort of what he hath, therefore himself shall have as little.</p>
               <p>The covetous are cozen Germans to the <hi>nine leapers,</hi> thankless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. They are so much for receiving, that they never mind what they have received. <hi>He deals with God, as a dog doth with his master, who as</hi> Austine <hi>observes, devoureth by and by whatever he can catch, and gapeth continually for more.</hi> Nor hath covetousness any thing so proper to it, as to be ingrateful. A greedy man is never but shamefully unthankful; for unless he have all, he hath nothing. He must have his will, or <hi>God</hi> shall not have a good look from him; yea, as the <hi>Mill,</hi> if it <hi>go empty,</hi> makes an <hi>unpleasant</hi> and <hi>odious noise,</hi> so the covetous man, if the Lord does not satisfie his desires in every thing, he will most wickedly murmur and blaspheme his providence; and if ever he sustaines losse, he will never forget it. He <hi>writes benefits received in water,</hi> but what he accounts <hi>injuries in marble.</hi> And for this his great ingratitude, <hi>God</hi> gives him riches, but withdraws his blessing. For as <hi>Jacob</hi> gave <hi>Ruben</hi> a <hi>blessing,</hi> but added, thou shalt <hi>not be excellent, Gen.</hi> 49. 4. so God gives the worldling riches, but sayes, thou shalt not be satisfied. <hi>He that loveth silver, shall not be satisfied with silver,</hi> Eccl. 5. 10. Yea no man more unsatisfied; for let him have what his heart can wish, he is not yet pleased, like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who <hi>murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> asmuch when they had <hi>Mannah,</hi> as when they had none.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the merciless Miser, never sued or sought to <hi>God</hi> for his riches; neither does he acknowledge them as sent of God, but as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the increase of his means to his <hi>wit</hi> and <hi>industry.</hi> Nay he <hi>dares not pray the Lords prayer, forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors,</hi> left he call for a curse upon himself. Nay if he be (as probably he is) an <hi>Usuerer,</hi> then in respect of other men, he hath no need to pray at all, for as one observes,
<q>
                     <l>Each man to heaven his hands for blessing reares;</l>
                     <l>Onely the Us'rer needs not say his prayers.</l>
                     <l>Blow the winde East or West, plenty or dearth,</l>
                     <l>Sickness or health, sit on the face of earth,</l>
                     <l>He cares not, time will bring his money in,</l>
                     <l>Each day augments his treasure, and his sin.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Or admit he ever calls upon God, his prayer is that some one may <hi>dye,</hi> that he may have his <hi>office,</hi> or break his day, that the beloved
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34603:15"/>
                  <hi>forfeiture</hi> may be obtained. His <hi>morning exercise</hi> being onely to peruse his <hi>bonds,</hi> look over his <hi>baggs,</hi> and to worship them, as <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> worshipped his <hi>grounds,</hi> desiring them to bring forth in abundance, and to keep his <hi>Cattel</hi> safe.</p>
               <p>And as touching hereafter, if he shall finde in his heart to pray, <hi>God</hi> will not hear him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked, is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 21. 27. <hi>What hope hath the hypocrite saith</hi> Job, <hi>when he hath heaped up riches; will God hear his cry when trouble com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon him?</hi> Job 27. 8, 9. <hi>When you shall stretch out your hands, saith God to such, I will hide mine eyes from you, and though you make many prayers, I will not hear,</hi> Isa. 1. 15. <hi>God</hi> will turn him off to his gold and silver for help, as he did <hi>Jehoram to the Prophets of his Father, and the Prophets of his Mother,</hi> 2 Kings 3. 13. And it is but just and equal, that those which we have made the comfort and stay of our peace, should be the relief and comfort of our extremity. If our prosperity hath made the <hi>world our God:</hi> how worthily shall our <hi>death-bed</hi> be choaked with such an exprobration?</p>
               <p>If <hi>God</hi> do answer such an ones prayers, it is as <hi>Archelaus</hi> answered the request of a covetous <hi>Courtier,</hi> who being importuned by him for <hi>a cup of gold,</hi> wherein he drank; gave it unto <hi>Euripides</hi> that stood by, saying, Thou art worthy to ask and be denied, but <hi>Euripides</hi> is worthy of gifts, although he ask not. And indeed good men many times receive gifts from <hi>God,</hi> that they never dreamt of, nor durst pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to begg, which others extreamly strive after and go without. As it is feigned of <hi>Pan,</hi> that it was his good hap to finde out <hi>Ceres,</hi> as he was hunting, little thinking of it, which none of the other <hi>gods</hi> could do, though they did nothing else but seek her, and that most industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously.</p>
               <p>Now, if he <hi>neither prayes to God</hi> for what he would have, <hi>nor gives him thanks</hi> for what he gives, <hi>nor desires a blessing</hi> upon what he <hi>receives, viz.</hi> that he may be content, and satisfied therewith, How should <hi>God</hi> bestow this great blessing of contentation upon him, and a true use of his riches?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he cares not for <hi>grace</hi> but for <hi>gold,</hi> therefore <hi>God</hi> gives him <hi>gold</hi> without <hi>grace.</hi> He longs not after <hi>righteousness,</hi> but <hi>riches,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he shall neither be <hi>satisfied</hi> nor <hi>blessed;</hi> whereas both are their portion that thirst after the former, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 6. He desires riches with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Gods blessing,</hi> he shall have it with a <hi>curse;</hi> he loves <hi>gold</hi> more then <hi>God,</hi> and desires it rather then his blessing upon it or grace, therefore he shall have it and want the other. Whereas if he did <hi>first seek the kingdom of heaven, all things else should be added thereunto,</hi> Mat. 6. 33. But this worldlings appetite stands not towards the things of a better life; he findes <hi>no tast in heavens treasure;</hi> let him but glut himself on the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>garbage of ill-gotten goods,</hi> he cares not for <hi>Manna.</hi> He sings the song of <hi>Curio, vincat utilitas,</hi> let gain prevail, he had rather be <hi>a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> then a <hi>begger.</hi> The <hi>Apostle</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> said, <hi>silver and gold have I
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34603:16"/>
none,</hi> Act. 3. 6. The devil says, <hi>all these are mine,</hi> Luk. 4. 6. The <hi>Rich man, I have much goods laid up for many years,</hi> Luk. 12. 19. Now ask the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous muckworm, whether had you rather lack with those Saints, or abound with the <hi>devil</hi> and the <hi>rich man?</hi> his heart will answer, give me money, which will do any thing, all things, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 19.</p>
               <p>Now if he prefers <hi>gold,</hi> before either <hi>God, grace,</hi> or <hi>glory,</hi> no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail if <hi>God</hi> grant him his desires to his hurt, as he did a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Quailes</hi> to the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

               <p>FOurthly, he puts his trust in his riches, &amp; not in God, loves &amp; serves <hi>Satan</hi> more then <hi>God;</hi> therefore he shall have his comfort, &amp; reward from them and not from <hi>God.</hi> Yea <hi>Satan</hi> shall have more service of him for <hi>an ounce of gold,</hi> then <hi>God</hi> shall have for the <hi>Kingdom of heaven,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he prefers a little base pelf before <hi>God</hi> and his own <hi>salvation. He loves God well,</hi> but his <hi>money better,</hi> for that is <hi>his summum bonum:</hi> yea he thinks him a fool that does otherwise. What part with a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> for an <hi>uncertainty?</hi> if he can keep both, well and good, if not, what ever betides he will keep his <hi>Mammon,</hi> his money, though he lose <hi>himself,</hi> his soul. And yet the Lord gives far better things for nothing, then <hi>Satan</hi> will sell us for our souls; had we the wit to consider it, as we may see, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Again he loves his children better then the <hi>Lord,</hi> oppressing Gods children to inrich his own, for so his young ones be warm in their nest, let Christs members shake with cold, he cares not. He loves the Lord, as <hi>Laban</hi> loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> onely to get riches by him, or as <hi>Saul</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Samuel,</hi> to get honor by him. He will walk with <hi>God,</hi> so long as <hi>plenty,</hi> or the like does walk with him, but no longer; he will <hi>leave Gods</hi> service rather <hi>then lose</hi> by it.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Mammonist</hi> loves not <hi>God,</hi> is evident; for <hi>if any man love the world, the love of God is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2. 15. yea the <hi>two poles</hi> shall sooner meet, then the love of God and the love of money.</p>
               <p>Nor is this all, for he not onely loves <hi>Mammon</hi> more then God, but he makes it his god, shrines it in his coffer, yea in his breast, and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth his heart to it; he puts his trust, and <hi>placeth his confidence in his riches,</hi> makes it his hope, attributing and ascribing all his successes thereunto, which is <hi>to deny God that is above,</hi> as we may plainly see <hi>Job</hi> 31. 24, 28. Nor ought covetous men to be admitted into <hi>Christian society.</hi> We have a great charge to <hi>separate</hi> from the covetous, <hi>Eat not with him,</hi> sayes the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. and also wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23. 7.</p>
               <p>Covetousness is flat <hi>idolatry,</hi> which makes it out of measure sinful, and more hanious then any other sin, as appears, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Job</hi> 31. 24, 28. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Fornication</hi> is a foul sin; but nothing to this, that pollutes the body, but covetousness defileth the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34603:16"/>
soul; and the like of other sins. Yea, it is such a sordid and damnable sin, that it ought <hi>not once to be named among Christians,</hi> but with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>It is a sound Conclusion in Divinity, That is our <hi>God,</hi> which we love best and esteem most; as <hi>gold</hi> is the covetous mans <hi>god,</hi> and <hi>belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chear,</hi> the voluptuous mans <hi>god,</hi> and <hi>honor</hi> the ambitious mans <hi>god:</hi> and for these they will do more, then they will for <hi>God.</hi> Yea all wicked men make <hi>the devil their god;</hi> for why does <hi>Saint</hi> Paul call <hi>the devil the god of this world?</hi> but because wordly men do believe him, trust him, and obey him above <hi>God,</hi> and against <hi>God;</hi> and do love his wayes and commandments better then the wayes and laws of God.</p>
               <p>We all say, that we serve the <hi>Lord,</hi> but as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speaks, <hi>other Lords rule us,</hi> and not the <hi>Lord of heaven</hi> and earth. The covetous Mammonist does insatiably thirst after riches, placing all his joyes, hopes, and delights thereon; does he not then make them his <hi>God?</hi> yea God sayes, lend, clothe, feed, harbor; The <hi>devil</hi> and <hi>Mammon,</hi> say, take, gather, extort, oppress, spoil; whether of these are our gods? but they that are most obeyed? <hi>Know ye not,</hi> saith, <hi>Saint</hi> Paul, <hi>that to whomso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye give your selves as servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey,</hi> Rom. 6. 16. the case is plain enough, that every wilful sinner makes the <hi>devil</hi> his <hi>god;</hi> he cannot deny it. I wish men would well waigh it. The <hi>goods</hi> of a worldling are his <hi>gods, Ye have taken away my gods,</hi> says <hi>Micha, and what have I more to lose,</hi> Jud. 18. 24. He makes <hi>Idols</hi> of his <hi>coyn,</hi> as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did of their treasure: <hi>They have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the truth of God into a lye, and worshipped and served the creature, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the Creator, which is blessed for ever, Amen,</hi> Rom. 1. 25.</p>
               <p>The greedy Wolfe, Mole, or Muckworm, who had rather be <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> then <hi>damnified,</hi> hath his <hi>Mammon</hi> in the place of God, loving it with all his <hi>heart,</hi> with all his <hi>soul,</hi> with all his <hi>minde,</hi> making gold his hope, and saying to the wedge of gold, Thou art my confidence; and yet of all men alive, he is least contented when he hath his hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, yea more then he knows what to do withall; the issue of a secret curse. For in outward appearance they are as happy as the world can make them, they have large possessions, goodly houses, beautiful spouses, hopeful children, full purses; yet their life is never the sweeter, nor their hearts ever the lighter, nor their meales the heartier, nor their nights the quieter, nor their cares the fewer; yea none more full of complaints among men. Oh cursed Ciatifs, how does the <hi>devil</hi> bewitch them! Generally, the <hi>poorer</hi> the <hi>merryer,</hi> because <hi>having food and raiment, they are therewith content,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8. They obey the rule, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 5. and <hi>God</hi> gives his blessing. But for those that make gold their god, how should not <hi>God</hi> either deny them riches, or deny his blessing upon them; and instead thereof, blast his blessings with a curse, and give them <hi>their riches in wrath,</hi> so that they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be without them.</p>
               <p>If we put our trust and confidence in God, he <hi>hath promised not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34603:17"/>
to fail nor forsake us,</hi> Heb. 13, 5. But <hi>this is the man that took not God for his strength; but trusted unto the multitude of his riches, and put his strength in his malice,</hi> Psal. 52. 7. Yea <hi>he saith in his heart, God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; he hideth away his face and will never see,</hi> Psal. 10. 11. He puts his <hi>certain</hi> trust in <hi>uncertain</hi> riches, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. And not for want of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, for to trust to <hi>God,</hi> and not to any creature or carnal policy is the greatest safty. A lesson yet to be learned of many, that do in a good measure trust in <hi>God</hi> (which this muckworme not so much as minds) But shall we <hi>trust God</hi> with <hi>our jewels, our souls,</hi> and not with <hi>the box, Mat.</hi> 6. 30? Take we heed, lest whiles he doth grant us that wherein we do not trust him (worldly riches) he take away that wherein we do trust him (everlasting joy and happiness.)</p>
               <p>Fiftly and lastly, let a <hi>graceless and ingrateful cormorant,</hi> an <hi>unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful miser</hi> have never so much. he neither intends to glorifie God, nor <hi>do good</hi> to others with his riches: he will not change <hi>a peece</hi> without profit, scarse let another <hi>light a torch</hi> at his <hi>candle.</hi> He will not lose a groat to gain a mans life, nor speak a sillable for <hi>God</hi> were it to save a soul.

               <p>ANd of these but a word. First for Information; let the premisses teach us this lesson, That whatsoever is given to any one, if <hi>Christ</hi> and a sanctified use thereof be not given withall, it can be no good thing to him. Did the <hi>stalled Ox</hi> know that his Master <hi>fatted</hi> him <hi>for the slaughter,</hi> he would not think his great plenty an argument of his masters greater love to him. The <hi>Physician</hi> setteth that <hi>sick person</hi> have what he will, of whose <hi>recovery</hi> he despaireth; but he restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him of many things, of whom he hath hope. We use to clip, and <hi>cut shorter the feathers</hi> of <hi>Birds</hi> or other fowle, when they begin to <hi>flye too high,</hi> or <hi>too far:</hi> So does God diminish the riches and honors of his children, and makes our condition so various, that we may not pass our bounds, or glory too much in these transitory things. As if we well observe it.</p>
               <p>First, some have the world and not <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>Nabal,</hi> who possessed a world of wealth, not a dram of grace or comfort.</p>
               <p>Secondly, some have God and not the world, as <hi>Lazarus:</hi> his heart was full of grace, and divine comfort, whiles his body lacked crumbes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34603:17"/>
Thirdly, some have <hi>neither God nor the world,</hi> nothing but misery here, nothing but torment her easter; for the <hi>poorest</hi> are not seldom <hi>the wickedest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, some have <hi>both God and the world,</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> who was rich while he lived on earth, and dying was glorious in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Yea often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they that are deerest to <hi>God,</hi> do with great difficulty work out those blessings, which even fall into the mouthes of the careless.</p>
               <p>That wise disposer of all things, knows it fit many times, to hold us short of those favors which we sue for, and would not benefit, but hurt us. Unlovely features, have more libertty to be good, because freer from Solicitors; and though it be not a curse, yet tis many times an unhappiness to be fair (aswell as to be strong and witty) <hi>Helena,</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Leda,</hi> for her excellent beauty, was ravished at the age of nine yeers, by <hi>Theseus;</hi> and once again by <hi>Paris,</hi> which caused the wars, and utter ruine of <hi>Troy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes, that <hi>Lisander</hi> did more hurt the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> in sending them store of riches and precious movables, then <hi>Sylla</hi> did the <hi>Romans</hi> in consuming the reveneues of their treasure. And as <hi>Sylvius</hi> relates, the liberallity of Princes, and especially of <hi>Metilda</hi> a <hi>Dutches of</hi> Italy, who at her death made the Pope her heir, begat ambition in the <hi>Bishops of Rome,</hi> and ambition destroyed Religion.
<q>
                     <l>These things are such as the possessors minde,</l>
                     <l>Good if well us'd, if ill, them ill we finde.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For even <hi>evil things</hi> work together for <hi>the good of the good;</hi> and even <hi>good things</hi> work together <hi>to the evil of the evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lucian</hi> feigneth, that riches being sent by <hi>Jupiter</hi> from heaven, come softly and slowly, but from the <hi>infernal god</hi> comes flying apace. And the other Poets feign <hi>Pluto</hi> to be the <hi>god of riches</hi> and of <hi>hell,</hi> as if hell and riches had both one master. And indeed he that resolves to be evil, making no conscience how he comes by it, may soon be rich, but the blessings of <hi>God</hi> in our ill getting, or unworthy carriage in their use, prove but the aggravations of sin, and additions to judgement. And let this serve for the first use.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Let what hath been delivered touching the miseries of an unmerciful, miserly, muckworme, serve to make us take heed and beware of all sin, but especially of the sin of covetousness; yea let us look to it, lest while we <hi>hunt after the worlds</hi> venison <hi>with Esau;</hi> we <hi>lose our Fathers blessing.</hi> Can we not warm us at the Sun, but we must make an Idoll of it to worship? must we needs either <hi>hide</hi> our <hi>faces,</hi> or <hi>bow our knees;</hi> either renounce all profits and pleasures, or be their slaves. This is a second use.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this, if we seriously consider it, may serve for a use of great comfort to the godly and conscientious: For if worldlings are so many wayes perplexed and distracted with cares and fears, about getting, and keeping, and losing their riches and great estates: how happy are the servants of <hi>God,</hi> that are not acquainted with any of them? <hi>No
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34603:18"/>
man, sayes the Apostle, that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, because he would please him that hath chosen him to be a souldier,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 4. They cast their care upon <hi>God,</hi> and he careth for them, who will see that they shall never want what is good and fit for them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 25, 30. But <hi>in the transgression of an evil man is his snare,</hi> sayes wise <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 29 6.</p>
               <p>But of this by the way onely, for there are other plagues yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, which <hi>God</hi> usually inflicts upon the merciless miser: nor would one of them be left unconsidered.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="16" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <p>THe eighth is the <hi>loss of his credit and good name,</hi> which he seldom or never scapes, which is not a light punishment, however he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems it. <hi>The memorial of the just shall be blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot,</hi> sayes <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 10. 7. Yea the cruel, and unmerciful mans name stinks worse then a new <hi>opened grave,</hi> His evil actions have been so many and notorious, that (like <hi>Vitellius)</hi> as he waxeth daily <hi>more mighty,</hi> so he grows daily <hi>more odious,</hi> so that in a few yeers, his credit proves a banckrupt with all men; for as the <hi>Eagle</hi> by losing a <hi>feather</hi> at every <hi>flight,</hi> hath never an one left by that she is old; so it fares with him touching his credit; When he dyes, he alwayes <hi>goes away in a stink,</hi> as is usually reported of the devil.</p>
               <p>Nor will this his infamy dye with him, for saith the Lord by his Prophet to such, <hi>I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al shame that shall never be forgotten,</hi> Jer 23. 40. It hath been proverbially spoken of him that would suddenly be rich, he must have <hi>much greedins, much diligence, little credit, and less conscience, blame</hi> enough he cannot miss of. For as <hi>shame</hi> is the fruit of <hi>sin,</hi> Rom. 6. 21. and <hi>distrust</hi> the just gain of <hi>unfaithfulness;</hi> so it is the just judgement of <hi>God,</hi> that this cruel and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted wretch should be <hi>marked as it were</hi> with the letter <hi>law,</hi> or <hi>Cains</hi> mark, to make him hateful. That as the fig-tree, because it had <hi>no fruit,</hi> was spoiled of his leaves: so thev who have made <hi>shipwrack of honesty,</hi> shall make <hi>shipwrack of credit</hi> too: that <hi>that which he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have, should be taken from him.</hi> His name shall go with a <hi>brand</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, like <hi>Cain the murtherer,</hi> Simon <hi>the sorcerer,</hi> Judas <hi>the traytor.</hi> Thus <hi>Demas had for</hi> his <hi>title, Demas that imbraced this present world.</hi> Thus <hi>Esau</hi> was called <hi>Edom,</hi> which signifieth <hi>red,</hi> to keep his wickedness in remembrance, because he had <hi>sold his birth right</hi> for a mess of red pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. And thus an <hi>extortioner</hi> shall not onely be dishonest and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted, but known to be so: like a <hi>rogue</hi> that is burned in the hand, or hath lost his ears; and he shall not be able to disguise himself so with the soberness of his countenance and smooth tongue, but as though his <hi>life</hi> were <hi>writ in his forehead,</hi> whereas he scarse thought he had been known to <hi>God,</hi> every one shall point at him as he goes in the street.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34603:18"/>
And not seldom, does some of his infamous <hi>actions</hi> stand upon <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eord</hi> to <hi>posterity:</hi> for as <hi>Christ</hi> promised that <hi>Maries good work, should be spoken of to the worlds end;</hi> so he hath caused <hi>Judasses evil work,</hi> and <hi>Achans</hi> evil work, and <hi>Absaloms</hi> evil work, and <hi>Jeroboams</hi> evil work, to be spoken of to the <hi>worlds end</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Yea <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>shame</hi> is so inseparable; and God is so severe in this case, that though a man hath repented him of the sin, yet some blemish sticks to his name, even as a <hi>scar</hi> still <hi>remaineth</hi> after the <hi>wound</hi> is <hi>healed. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> will ever be called, <hi>Matthew the publican,</hi> and <hi>Rahab, Rahab the harlot; Mary Magdalen</hi> will not longer be mentioned, then <hi>the devils</hi> which were <hi>cast out of her</hi> will be mentioned with her; and the like of others. How carefully then should we avoid those actions which may ever stain us?</p>
               <p>But all this he values not, for like that wretched worldling in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> he cares not what the people say, so his <hi>baggs</hi> be full. He drowns the noise of the peoples curses, with the musick of his money; as the <hi>Italians</hi> in a great thunder, ringe their bells, &amp; <hi>shoot off</hi> their <hi>Canons.</hi> Nor hath <hi>pride</hi> so great power over him as <hi>covetousness:</hi> He is not like <hi>Simon</hi> in <hi>Lucian,</hi> who having got a little wealth <hi>changed his name</hi> from <hi>Simon</hi> to <hi>Simonides,</hi> for that there were so many beggers of his kin, and set the <hi>house on fire</hi> wherin he was born, because no body should point at it.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, though he prefers gaine before an honest reputation; yet the word of God informs us, that gain got with an ill name is great loss; and certainly that man cannot be sparing in any thing that is commendable, who is prodigal of his reputation. But herein lies the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, gracious and tender hearts are galled with that, which the carnally-minded slight, and make nothing of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they are not wise enough to know what a singular bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it is to have a name spotless, a report unreprovable, and a fame for honesty and goodness, as it fared with <hi>Joseph,</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Ester,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and those <hi>wortbies</hi> mentioned in the eleventh to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who all <hi>obtained a good report,</hi> which proceeds of the Lord, and is bestowed as a great blessing upon such as he will honor, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 19, 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Ruth</hi> 2. and 3. Chapters; which makes wise <hi>Solomon</hi> say, that <hi>a good name is better then a good ointment; and to be chosen above great riches,</hi> Prov. 22. 1.</p>
               <p>I know well, that this miserly <hi>muckworm</hi> (this sor did pinchgut, the very basest of <hi>creatures</hi> that look upwards) does keep up his credit with some base &amp; ignoble persons, some <hi>blind Moales</hi> like himself, as being able to discern nothing but the barke or dregs of things. For they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of men, as we do of <hi>baggs of money,</hi> prize them best, that weigh <hi>heaviest;</hi> and measure out their love and respect by the Subsidy Book, for onely by their wealth they value themselves, and onely by their wealth (as Camels by their <hi>burthens)</hi> be they valued. If he have <hi>goods enough,</hi> he both thinks himself, and others think him <hi>good enough;</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:34603:19"/>
they think he is <hi>best</hi> that hath <hi>most,</hi> and repute him most <hi>worthy</hi> that is most <hi>wealthy,</hi> and <hi>naught is he be needy;</hi> accounting <hi>poverty</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>dishonesty.</hi> Yea as if <hi>credit</hi> and reputation were onely <hi>intailed</hi> on the <hi>rich,</hi> credit grows just as fast as <hi>wealth</hi> here in the <hi>City,</hi> and in the country, <hi>reputation</hi> is <hi>measured by the Aker;</hi> and the words weigh according to the purse.</p>
               <p>But others that are able to distinguish between good and evil, know, that either these are fools, or <hi>Solomon</hi> was not wise. Nor does he think himself more honorable, then wise and good men think him base. And certainly, if such muckworms were as odious to the rest as they are to me, they would appear in the street like Owls in the day time, with whom no honest man would converse. And why should I prefer him before a piece of copper, that prefers a piece of gold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maker?</p>
               <p>God commanded in the old Law, that whatsoever did <hi>go with his breast upon the ground,</hi> should be <hi>abomination</hi> to us: how much more should we abominate the man who is indued with <hi>reason</hi> and a <hi>soul,</hi> that hath glued his heart and soul unto a piece of earth? But of this enough.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVII:</head>
               <p>NInthly, the next is, That as the unmerciful Miser is <hi>all for sparing,</hi> so his heir shall be <hi>all for wasting.</hi> He <hi>lives poorly</hi> and penuriously all his life, that he may dye rich. <hi>He walks in a shaddow</hi> (saith the Psalmist) <hi>and disquieteth himself in vain, heaping up riches, not knowing who shall gather them,</hi> Psal. 39. 6. As he hath <hi>reapt</hi> that which another <hi>sowed,</hi> so another shall <hi>thrash</hi> that which he hath <hi>reaped. He hordes up, not knowing who shall injoy it;</hi> and commonly they injoy it who lay it out as fast. He takes onely the <hi>bitter,</hi> and <hi>leaves the sweet</hi> for others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps those that wish him hanged, upon condition they had his means the sooner.</p>
               <p>Or possible it is he may have <hi>children;</hi> which if he have, he <hi>loves</hi> them so much <hi>better then himself,</hi> that he will voluntarily be miserable here and hereafter, that they may be happy. He is willing to go in a thred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare coat, to starve his body, lose his credit, wound his conscience, torment his heart and minde with fears and cares; yea he can finde in his heart to damne his own soul and go to hell, that he may raise his house, leave his heir a great estate, as thinking his house and habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall continue for ever, even from generation to generation and call their lands by his name, as the Psalmist shews, <hi>Psalm</hi> 49. 11. He is careful to provide his <hi>children portions,</hi> while he provides <hi>no portion</hi> of comfort <hi>for his own welfare,</hi> either here or hereafter. He provides for his <hi>childrens bodies,</hi> not for their <hi>souls,</hi> to shew that he begat not their <hi>souls</hi> but their bodies. He leaves a fair estate for <hi>the worser part,</hi> nothing for the estate of the better part. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to leave his children <hi>great</hi> rather then good, and is more ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34603:19"/>
to have his sons <hi>Lords on earth,</hi> then <hi>Kings in heaven.</hi> But as <hi>he that provides not for their temporal estate, is worse then an infidel,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 8. So he that provides not for their <hi>eternal estate,</hi> is little better then <hi>a devil,</hi> which yet is the cace of <hi>nine parts</hi> of the <hi>parents</hi> throughout the <hi>Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But observe how his children requite him again, and how <hi>God</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites him in his <hi>children;</hi> for commonly they are such, as never give him thanks, nor in the least lament his loss; perhaps they <hi>mourn</hi> at his <hi>funeral,</hi> yet not for that he <hi>is dead,</hi> but because he <hi>died no sooner.</hi> Nor is it any rare thing for men to mourn for him <hi>dead,</hi> whom they would by no means have still to be alive. Yea for the most part, it is but a <hi>fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sorrow,</hi> which the son makes shew of at his <hi>fathers death;</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many <hi>a day</hi> wisht for that <hi>hour.</hi> A sorrow in shew onely, like that of <hi>Jacobs sons</hi> when they had <hi>sold their brother Joseph,</hi> who profest a great deal of <hi>grief</hi> for his loss, when inwardly they <hi>rejoyced.</hi> Have ye not heard of a <hi>prodigal</hi> young <hi>heir?</hi> that incouraged his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with come let us drink, revel, throw the house out at windows; the man in Scarlet will pay for all; meaning his <hi>father</hi> who was a <hi>Judge,</hi> but he <hi>adjudged</hi> the patrimony from him to one of his yonger sons more obedient; And good reason he had for it, for to give <hi>riches</hi> to the <hi>ryotous,</hi> is all one as to <hi>pour</hi> precious <hi>liquor into a seeve,</hi> that will hold <hi>no liquid</hi> substance; which occasioned the <hi>Rhodians,</hi> and <hi>Lydians,</hi> to enact several laws; that those <hi>sons</hi> which followed not their <hi>fathers</hi> in their <hi>vertues,</hi> but <hi>lived viciously,</hi> should be <hi>disinherited,</hi> and their <hi>lands given</hi> to the most <hi>vertuous</hi> of that <hi>race,</hi> not admiting any <hi>impious heir</hi> whatsoever, to <hi>inherit,</hi> as <hi>Varro</hi> well notes. But it is otherwise in this case, for (in regard of <hi>Gods curse</hi> upon this unmerciful Muckworm) if he have more <hi>sons</hi> then one, the <hi>eldest</hi> proves a <hi>prodigal,</hi> and he <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every mans own experience can tell him, that for the most part <hi>a scatterer succeeds a gatherer;</hi> one that wasts <hi>vertues</hi> faster then <hi>riches,</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> faster then any <hi>vertues</hi> can get them; one that is as excessive in <hi>spending,</hi> as the other was in <hi>scraping;</hi> for as the <hi>father</hi> choseth to <hi>fill his chests,</hi> so the <hi>son</hi> is given to <hi>satisfie his lusts.</hi> Nor could the one be more cunning at the <hi>rake,</hi> then the other will be at the <hi>pitchfork.</hi> The moneys which were formerly chested like <hi>caged birds,</hi> will wing it merrily when the young heir sets them flying. And as <hi>Cicero</hi> speaks, he <hi>roituously spends</hi> that which the father had <hi>wickedly gotten.</hi> The one would <hi>have all to keep,</hi> the other will <hi>keep nothing at all;</hi> the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer gets and spends not,</hi> the <hi>latter spends and gets not.</hi> Yea the <hi>son</hi> being as greedy of <hi>expence,</hi> as the <hi>father was in scraping;</hi> he <hi>reddeth</hi> that with a <hi>fork</hi> in <hi>one year,</hi> which was not <hi>gathered</hi> with a <hi>rake</hi> in twenty. Yea how oft is that <hi>spent</hi> upon <hi>one Christmas revelling</hi> by the <hi>son,</hi> which was <hi>fourty yeers</hi> a <hi>getting</hi> by the <hi>Father?</hi> Which <hi>Diogenes</hi> well considered, for whereas he would ask of a <hi>frugal Citizen</hi> but a <hi>penny,</hi> of a <hi>Prodigal</hi> he would beg a talent, and when the party asked him what he meant,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34603:20"/>
to desire so much of him and so little of others, his answer should be, <hi>Quoniam tu habes, illi habebunt;</hi> because <hi>thou hast,</hi> and <hi>they will have.</hi> I shall begg of thee but once, thy estate will so soon vanish, of them often, yea give me now <hi>a talent,</hi> I may live to give thee <hi>a groat.</hi> And at another time, hearing that the <hi>house</hi> of a certain <hi>Prodigal</hi> was offered to <hi>sale,</hi> he said, I knew well that <hi>house</hi> was so accustomed to <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feting,</hi> and <hi>drunkenness,</hi> that ere long it would <hi>spue</hi> out the <hi>master.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay in all likelihood he foresees it himself; and therefore as he makes short work with his <hi>estate,</hi> so not long with his <hi>life,</hi> as knowing, that if he should live long, he must be a begger.</p>
               <p>As seldom but he shortens his days some way; for he gives himself to all manner of <hi>vice, gluttony</hi> and <hi>drunkenness, chambering</hi> and <hi>wantonness, pride, riot, contention,</hi> &amp;c. He even banishes <hi>civility,</hi> and gives himself over to <hi>sensuality;</hi> and such a life seldom lasts long.</p>

               <p>Covetousnesse is not more <hi>the root of all evil,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> fitly stiles it, then it is <hi>the rot of all good,</hi> as is easie to prove; it is the <hi>root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> the <hi>mother and metropolis</hi> of all sins that can be named; for there is <hi>no sin</hi> whatsoever, <hi>but</hi> it hath <hi>sprung from this cursed root,</hi> whether it be <hi>lying,</hi> or <hi>swearing,</hi> or <hi>cursing,</hi> or <hi>slandering,</hi> or <hi>Sabbath-breaking,</hi> or <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness,</hi> or <hi>adultery,</hi> or <hi>bawdery;</hi> whether <hi>theft, murther, treason, cozening in bargains, breaking of promises, perfideous underminings, contempt of God and all goodness, persecuting the truth, opposing the Gospel, hatred of Gods Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, sleighting of his Ordinances, unbelief, idolatry, witch-craft, ante-Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanism, sacriledge, soul-murther,</hi> &amp;c. For whence <hi>spring</hi> all these, and what else can be named, but from <hi>covetousness?</hi> There is no <hi>evil</hi> that a covetous man will not put in practise, so <hi>goods</hi> may come of it; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not name the sin, but the Auaritions will <hi>swallow</hi> it, in the <hi>sweet broth of commodity.</hi>

his <hi>master,</hi> his <hi>Prince,</hi> his <hi>Countrey,</hi> his <hi>conscience;</hi> yea, with <hi>Ahab</hi> he will <hi>sell himself</hi> for money, as I might instance in a world of examples; yea, daily experience hath taught us, since our <hi>Civil Wars,</hi> that many to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage themselves <hi>five shillings,</hi> will indamage another <hi>five hundred pounds;</hi> and to gain <hi>five pounds,</hi> will indanger the losing of <hi>three whole Kingdoms;</hi> yea, when once men are bewitcht with the love of money, as <hi>Judas</hi> was, a small matter would hire them to <hi>sell Christ himself,</hi> were he now on the earth to be sold.</p>
               <p>A resolution to be rich, is the <hi>fountain of infinite evils;</hi> yea, <hi>Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> is the <hi>Index,</hi> or <hi>Epitomy</hi> of, or rather <hi>a Commentary upon all sin</hi> and wickedness. Name but covetousness, and that includes all the rest, as being a sin made up of many such bitter ingredients. <hi>All vices rule,</hi> where <hi>gold reigns,</hi> at least that heart which hath once inslaved it self to this sin, may be wrought by <hi>Satan</hi> to any thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Justice is the mistress of all vertues,</hi> and the <hi>truest tryal</hi> of a good man, but the <hi>covetous heart,</hi> is a <hi>very mint of fraud,</hi> and can readily <hi>coyne falsehoods</hi> for advantage, upon all occasions.</p>
               <p>And as it is the <hi>root or cause of all evil,</hi> so it is the <hi>rot or main hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all good;</hi> Covetousness is the <hi>grave of all goodness,</hi> it <hi>eats out the very heart of grace, by eating grace out of the heart,</hi> Rom. 1. 29. When <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi> once gets admission into the heart, it <hi>turns all grace quite out of doors;</hi> as where <hi>salt grows,</hi> it makes the <hi>ground</hi> so <hi>barren of all other things,</hi> that nothing else will breed therein; this is the <hi>cursed devil</hi> that mars all, Covetousness.</p>
               <p>No such impediment to <hi>conversion</hi> and <hi>salvation</hi> as it; as for instance, <hi>Ministers</hi> wonder that their <hi>Sermons</hi> take no better, that among <hi>so many arrows none should hit the mark:</hi> but <hi>God</hi> tells us the reason, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. <hi>they sit before thee, and hear thy words, but their hearts go after their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness,</hi> ver. 31. Whence is is, that you may see <hi>swearers, drunkards, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>weep at a sermon,</hi> where as you <hi>never</hi> saw the <hi>covetous shed a tear,</hi> be the Doctrine never so dreadful.</p>
               <p>Oh this <hi>golden devil,</hi> this <hi>Diana of the Ephesians,</hi> doth a world of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, it <hi>destroyes more souls then all other sins</hi> put together, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> intimates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10.

               <p>AND yet it is no wonder, if we consider the <hi>reasons.</hi> For, First, the coverous man is an <hi>Atheist,</hi> one that (like <hi>Davids fool) sayes in his heart there is no God;</hi> the <hi>Mamonist</hi> is like <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, <hi>Hildebrand</hi> the <hi>Magician, Alexander</hi> the sixth, and <hi>Julius</hi> the second, who were <hi>all meer Atheists,</hi> who thought whatsoever was said of <hi>Christ, Heaven, Hell,</hi> the <hi>day of judgement,</hi> the <hi>immortallity</hi> of the <hi>soul,</hi> &amp;c. to be but <hi>fables,</hi> and meer impostures, dreams, toys, and old wives fables; and being <hi>Atheists</hi> that beleeve not a <hi>Heaven, Hell,</hi> or <hi>day of judgement, when every man shall be rewarded according to his deeds, be they good or evil;</hi> what hope is there of their conversion or salvation? or how should they not preferre <hi>temporal</hi> things, before <hi>coelestial</hi> and <hi>eternal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As, what is the reason that there are few <hi>rich men</hi> that will not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offend the <hi>Divine Majesty,</hi> then the <hi>Temporal Authority?</hi> and few <hi>poor men</hi> that resemble not the <hi>poor Swedes</hi> in their serving of <hi>God,</hi> who always <hi>break the Sabbath,</hi> saying, it is only for rich men and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that have means, to keep that day; yea, that almost all men, rich and poor, are for matter of Religion, like Sir <hi>John Kennede,</hi> who in <hi>chusing</hi> of his <hi>wife,</hi> would have her <hi>well born</hi> and <hi>educated, fair, rich, wise, kind,</hi> with the like accomodations, but quite forgot to wish her <hi>good</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,</hi> and was accordingly blest in his choise; as King <hi>James</hi> (who made many such Matches) used the matter: the main reason of all is, men beleeve not a <hi>God,</hi> or a <hi>day of judgemert.</hi> Whence it is, that amongst <hi>all</hi> the desired <hi>priviledges</hi> of this life, men commonly leave out <hi>holinesse,</hi> which sufficiently argues their <hi>infidelity,</hi> which in these times is much propagated and strengthened; for the <hi>plurality of faiths</hi> among <hi>many,</hi> hath brought a <hi>nullity of faith</hi> in the <hi>most.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worldly minds,</hi> mind nothing but <hi>worldly things,</hi> their <hi>busines</hi> is thought upon, not <hi>God,</hi> nor their <hi>salvation,</hi> for they make that no part of their business; their <hi>business</hi> gives them no leave, or leisure, to think of their consciences, nor do they go to <hi>Church to serve God,</hi> but the <hi>State,</hi> which they use not as a means to <hi>save their souls,</hi> but <hi>charges.</hi> There is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in them but the love of money; most men have their <hi>souls</hi> as it were <hi>wrapt up</hi> in the <hi>port-mantua of their sences,</hi> and to them all <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, coelestial,</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> things seem <hi>incredible,</hi> because they are <hi>invisible. Machiavil</hi> thought all <hi>piety</hi> and religion, to be nothing but <hi>policy, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi> imputed mens <hi>worshiping of God, to idleness; They be idle, saith he, therefore they cry, let us go offer sacrifice unto our God,</hi> Exod. 5. 8.

Let the <hi>word</hi> or <hi>Minister</hi> tell them, (that prefer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit before honesty) that <hi>godliness is great gain, as having the promises of this life, and of that which is to come;</hi> yet their conclusion is, they cannot

                  <hi>live</hi> unless they <hi>deceive,</hi> they cannot <hi>please</hi> unless they <hi>flatter,</hi> they cannot be <hi>beleeved</hi> unless they <hi>swear,</hi> as <hi>Demetrius</hi> thought he should <hi>beg,</hi> unless he might sell <hi>Images,</hi> Act. 19. 27.</p>
               <p>Nothing will <hi>sink into their heads,</hi> that cannot be <hi>seen with their eys,</hi> or <hi>felt with their fingers:</hi> We hate the <hi>Turks</hi> for selling <hi>Christians</hi> for <hi>slaves,</hi> what do we think of those <hi>Christians</hi> that <hi>sell themselves,</hi> and how odious are they? the poorest <hi>cheat's soul</hi> (if ever he be saved) cost <hi>Christs precious blood,</hi> yet <hi>half a crown,</hi> yea <hi>six pence</hi> sometimes, will make him sell it, by <hi>forswearing himself.</hi>

               <p>SEcondly, another reason is, if a covetous man do repent, he must restore what he hath wrongfully gotten, which perhaps may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to half, or it may be three parts of his Estate at a clap: which to him is as hard, and harsh an injunction, as that of <hi>God</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 2. <hi>Sacrifise thy son, thine only son Isaac.</hi> Or as that of <hi>our Saviours to the young man,</hi> Luk. 18. 22. <hi>Sell all that ever thou hast, and distribute unto the poor:</hi> And is there any hope of his yeelding? No, <hi>Covetousness is idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> Eph. 5. 5. Col. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>And Gold is the covetous mans god, and will he part with his God, a certainty for an uncertainty? No, a godly man is content to be poor in outward things, because his purchase is all inward; but nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the assurance of heavenly things, can make us willing to part with earthly things; neither can he contemn this life, that knows not the other, and so long as he <hi>keeps</hi> the weapon (evil-gotten goods) <hi>in his wound,</hi> and resolves <hi>not to pluck it out</hi> by restoring) how is it possible he should be cured?</p>
               <p>Besides, as there are no <hi>colours</hi> so <hi>contrary</hi> as <hi>white and black,</hi> no <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> so <hi>disagreeing</hi> as <hi>fire and water,</hi> so there is nothing so opposit to <hi>grace</hi> and conversion, as <hi>covetousness;</hi> and as nothing so <hi>alienates</hi> a mans <hi>love</hi> from his <hi>vertuous spouse,</hi> as his <hi>inordinate affection to a filthy strumpet;</hi> so nothing does so far <hi>separate and diminish a mans love to God,</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things,</hi> as our inordinate <hi>affection</hi> to the <hi>world and earthly things;</hi> yea, there is an absolute contrariety between the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the <hi>love of money: no servant,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>can serve two masters, for either he shall hate the one, and love the other, or else he shall leane to the one and despise the other, ye cannot serve God and riches,</hi> Luk. 16. 13. Here we see, there is an absolute impossibility, and in the fourteenth Chapter and elsewhere, we have examples to confirm it, <hi>All those that doted upon pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases, and farms, and oxen, and wives, with one consent made light of it, when they were bid to the Lords Supper,</hi> Luk. 14, 15. to 23. <hi>The Gadarenes that so highly prised their hoggs, would not admit Christ within their bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> Luk. 8. <hi>Judas that was covetous, and loved money, could not love his Master, and therefore sold him.</hi>

               <p>FOurthly, another reason, (were there no other) why it is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to prevail with the covetous, is, they will never hear any thing that speaks against covetousness, (and their refusing to hear it, shews them to be such, for <hi>flight argues guiltiness always) Covetous men</hi> will <hi>never hear Sermons,</hi> or <hi>read Books</hi> that <hi>press to good Works,</hi> or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the necessity of <hi>restitution</hi> is urged; neither had <hi>Satan</hi> any brains, if he should suffer them so to do.

               <p>Fiftly, suppose he should be prevailed withall to hear me, alls one; even <hi>an ounce of gold</hi> with him, will <hi>weigh down</hi> whatsoever can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged from the <hi>Word,</hi> for though with that <hi>rich man,</hi> Luk. 10. he may have a good mind to <hi>heaven</hi> in <hi>reversion,</hi> yet for all that, he will not hear of parting with his <hi>heaven,</hi> whereof he hath <hi>present possession.</hi> He can like <hi>Canaan</hi> well enough so he may injoy his <hi>flesh-pots</hi> also, and could love <hi>the blessing,</hi> but he will not lose <hi>his pottage;</hi> and in case he <hi>cannot gain</hi> by being <hi>religious,</hi> his care shall be <hi>not to loose</hi> by it; and that <hi>Religion</hi> shall <hi>like him best, that is best cheap,</hi> and will cost <hi>him least;</hi> any Doctrine is welcome to him, but that which beats upon <hi>good works:</hi> Nor will he stick with the <hi>Sages, to fall down and worship Christ,</hi> but he cannot abide to <hi>present him with his gold;</hi> No, if another will be at the charges to serve <hi>God,</hi> he will cry out, <hi>why is this waste?</hi> as <hi>Judas</hi> did when <hi>Mary bestowed that precious oyntment upon her Saviour, which otherwise might have been sold, and so put into his bag.</hi> The <hi>love of money,</hi> and commings in of <hi>gain,</hi> is <hi>dearer and sweeter</hi> to the Muck-worm, then the <hi>saving of his soul,</hi> what possibility then of his being prevailed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>
               <p>To other sins <hi>Satan tempts</hi> a man often, but <hi>Covetousness is a fine and recovery upon the purchase,</hi> then he is sure of him; as when a <hi>Goaler</hi> hath <hi>locke up his prisoners</hi> safe in a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> he may go <hi>play.</hi>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34603:26"/>
he was never scorned, and mockt, but by them, when he preached a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst covetousness. <hi>Christianum dogma, vertitur in scomma,</hi> and whats the reason but this? rich worldlings think themselves <hi>so much the wiser, as they are the richer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things considered, no wonder that our <hi>Saviour</hi> expresly affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that <hi>it is easier for a camell to go through the eye of a needle, then for a rich man</hi> (that is a covetous rich man) <hi>to enter into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> as well knowing, that <hi>no Physick</hi> can be found <hi>strong enough</hi> to <hi>purg</hi> out this <hi>humor.</hi> Well may they <hi>gnaw their tongues for sorrow, when they shall be tormented with fire, and boyl with great heat, and blaspheme the God of Heaven for their pains, and for their soars, but repent of their works they will not,</hi> as it is <hi>Revel.</hi> 16. 8. to 12. only others may make some good use of that evil they see in them, at least learn to beware of covetousness.</p>
               <p>I grant, that to <hi>God</hi> (who hath commanded us to use the means) all things are possible, for he is <hi>able, even of stones, to raise up children unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Mat. 3. 9. but in respect of ordinary means, it is no more possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a <hi>covetous miserly muck-worm</hi> to be <hi>converted,</hi> then it is for <hi>a dead man to be raised.</hi> And therefore, though I had rather be a <hi>Toade</hi> then a <hi>Drunkard,</hi> yet had I rather be a <hi>Drunkard</hi> then a <hi>covetous Miser,</hi> and should somewhat the more hope to go to <hi>Heaven,</hi> Mat. 21. 31, 32.</p>

               <p>A competent measure of wealth to retain an honest reputation in the world, so that we neither need to <hi>flatter nor borrow,</hi> is sufficient: He is <hi>rich enough</hi> saith <hi>Jerom,</hi> that lacketh not bread, and <hi>high enough</hi> in dignity that is not forced to serve.

                     <l>This worlds wealth that men so much desire,</l>

               <p>It is a great <hi>skill</hi> to know what is enough, and greater <hi>wisedome</hi> to <hi>care</hi> for no more; if I have <hi>meat, drink,</hi> and <hi>apparrel,</hi> I will learn there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content; if I had the world full of wealth beside, I could injoy no more then I use, the rest could please me no otherwise then by looking upon, as wise <hi>Solomon</hi> shews, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 11. and why can I not thus solace my self while it is anothers? It was a dainty disposition of one that followed a <hi>great Lord,</hi> who was often heard to say, I bless God, I have as much in effect as my <hi>Lord</hi> himself, though I am owner of little or nothing, for I have the use of his <hi>Gardens</hi> and <hi>Galleries</hi> to <hi>walk</hi> in, I hear his <hi>Musick</hi> with as many ears, I <hi>hunt</hi> with him in his <hi>Parks, eat</hi> and <hi>drink of the same</hi> with him, though a little after, and so of other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights which my <hi>Lord</hi> enjoys.

of my mind, as preferring <hi>a retired life, spent in conversing with Authors,</hi> before all the <hi>honors, pleasures,</hi> and <hi>profits</hi> that others enjoy; <hi>This is the gift of God,</hi> (Eccl. 5. 15. to the end,) and not unmeet to <hi>be spoken in the great Congregation,</hi> Psal. 35. 18, and 119. 46. <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> are more in the <hi>heart</hi> then in the <hi>hand;</hi> we may be as happy and as warm in <hi>Country russet,</hi> as in <hi>Tissue;</hi> he is wealthy that is contented, and he poor that is not, were he as rich as <hi>Croesus,</hi> he only is rich and happy, in regard of outward things, who thinks himself so, and only the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and uncontented are poor and miserable.

               <p>TRue, this so transeends the condition, or indeed, the capacity of a Miser or Muck-worm, that he will count these but words, and meere bravadoes; but that those lovers of wisedom, were so contented with a little, that they desired no more, their practice did sufficiently prove For when <hi>Alexander</hi> bad <hi>Diogenes</hi> ask what he would, his answer was, Stand aside, and let the <hi>Sun shine</hi> upon me, take not that away which thou art not able to give; further avouching, that he was richer then himself; for I, quoth he, desire no more then what I enjoy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou, O <hi>Emperor,</hi> canst not content thy self with all the world, but daily hazardest thy life and fortunes, to augment thy Possessions.

to come to receive store of gold; sent him word, that a measure of flower was sold in <hi>Athens</hi> for a peny, and that water cost him nothing. <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles</hi> finding <hi>rich bracelets of Pearl and precious stones</hi> lie in his path: bade another take them up, saying, Thou art not <hi>Themistocles.

               <p>
                  <hi>Democritus</hi> the <hi>Philosopher</hi> of <hi>Abdera,</hi> having learned of the <hi>Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Astronomy,</hi> and of the <hi>Persians Geometry:</hi> returned to <hi>Athens,</hi> where he gave infinite wealth to the <hi>City,</hi> reserving only a little Garden to himself. <hi>Crates,</hi> to the end that he might more quietly study <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;</hi> threw his goods into the <hi>Sea.

(in comparison of what others have, and are not pleased with all) even just enough to make even at the years end, living frugally: yet are they so contented, that they desire no more, nor would they change their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and mean condition, with any men alive, be they never so rich, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great. Nor wouldst thou think it probable, their hearts should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, if thou knewest what offers they have refused. And I doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, but there are many such in the land.</p>
               <p>Nor can it be thought strange, that <hi>Gods</hi> children (whose affections are set upon heavenly things) should be so content with a little; that they desire no more; when we read of one <hi>Esau,</hi> that could say, <hi>I have enough my brother, keep that thou hast to thy self,</hi> Gen. 33. 9. Yea, if it fared so with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> for the love of that wisdome and vertue, which shall have no reward, because they wanted faith and saving knowledge, how much more should <hi>Christians?</hi> (who <hi>have a more sure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, then they had,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 19. <hi>with</hi> Mary <hi>make choice of that better part, which shall never be taken from them,</hi> Luke 10. 41, 42.</p>
               <p>True worldly mindes think, no man can be of any other then their own diet; and because they finde the respects of self-love, and private profit, so strongly prevail with themselves: they cannot conceive, how these should be capable of a repulse from others. Nature thinks it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, to contemn <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>wealth:</hi> and because so many souls are thus taken, cannot believe that any would escape. But let carnal hearts know there are those, that can spit the world in the face, and say, <hi>Thy gold and silver perish with thee,</hi> Acts 8. 20. That had rather be <hi>masters of themselves,</hi> then <hi>of the Indies:</hi> and that in comparison of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, can tread under foot with disdain, the worlds best proffers, like shadows as they are; and that can do <hi>as Balaam said, If Balack would give me his house-full of silver and gold; I cannot go beyond the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of the Lord,</hi> Numb. 24. 13.</p>

                  <hi>Elisha</hi> and <hi>Gehazi,</hi> looked not with the same eyes upon the <hi>Syrian</hi> treasure; but one with the <hi>eye of contempt,</hi> the other with the <hi>eye of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration</hi> and covetous desire.

               <p>NOw why are godly <hi>Christians</hi> so content with a little? that they desire no more: certainly they could be as rich as the richest, and as wise for earthly things, as they are for heavenly. (As when <hi>Thales</hi> was upbraided, that all his wisdome could not make him rich: set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but his minde to it, he saw by study, that there would be a great <hi>scarcity of oil,</hi> which in the time of plenty he took up upon credit, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34603:28"/>
when the want came, by his store he became exceeding rich as <hi>Laertius</hi> relates:) but they are better pleased with a <hi>competency</hi> then to trouble themselves to get, or indeed to desire an <hi>opulency.</hi> The <hi>Christians reasons</hi> are these.</p>
               <p>First, they consider, that as a <hi>shoe fit</hi> is <hi>better</hi> then one either <hi>too big,</hi> or <hi>too little;</hi> (for one <hi>too big</hi> sets the <hi>foot awry;</hi> and one <hi>too little hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the going)</hi> so a mean estate is best. <hi>Better is a little with the fear of the Lord, then great treasure and trouble therewith,</hi> Prov. 15. 16. <hi>A ship of great burthen,</hi> and <hi>heavy laden,</hi> comes with great labour and difficulty, and with much a doe is brought in; if it want <hi>ballast</hi> and <hi>lading,</hi> there is great <hi>danger of overturning;</hi> but a <hi>light Pinace indifferently fraight,</hi> comes along <hi>swiftly,</hi> and is brought to the <hi>harbour</hi> with much ease.</p>
               <p>Nor do the godly wise, desire more then they can wield, in which they resemble <hi>Aristippus,</hi> who when a <hi>servant</hi> in journeying with him, was <hi>ty red</hi> with the weight of the <hi>money</hi> which he carried; bid him cast out that which was too <hi>heavy</hi> and carry the rest: whereas the covetous man is like <hi>Arthipertus</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards;</hi> who flying from <hi>Asprandus</hi> his enemy, and being to <hi>swim over the River Tesino,</hi> to save his life, took so much <hi>gold</hi> with him, that he both <hi>drowned it, and himself with it.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, the poor and mean, have a deeper sense of <hi>Gods fatherly care</hi> and providence, in replenishing them, at all times of need, (even beyond imagination or expression) then others have, that know not what it is sometimes to want: whiles <hi>wicked mindes</hi> have their <hi>full scope,</hi> they never look up above themselves: but when once <hi>God crosseth</hi> them in their <hi>projects,</hi> their <hi>want of success,</hi> teaches them to <hi>give God his own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We should forget at whose cost we live, if we wanted nothing: And doubtless, one <hi>bit from the month of the Raven,</hi> was more pleasing to <hi>Elijah;</hi> then a whole <hi>Table</hi> full of <hi>Ahabs dainties.</hi> Nothing is more comfortable to <hi>Gods</hi> children, then to see the sensible demonstrations of the divine care and providence, as is promised, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>In all thy wayes acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy wayes.</hi> The godly man wearies not himself with <hi>cares</hi> &amp; <hi>fears,</hi> have he but from hand to mouth: (never so little) for he knows he lives not at his own cost. He considers what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, 1 Pet. 5. <hi>Cast your care upon the Lord, for he careth for you, verse</hi> 7. He remembers what our <hi>Saviour</hi> saith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the same, and never doubts of the performance; so he <hi>takes no thought for to morrow, what he shall eat, or what he shall drink, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he shall be clothed:</hi> but applauds his own happiness, knowing that <hi>he who feedeth the fowls of the Air, and arrayeth the Lillies of the field, will be sure to feed and clothe them that are his sons and houshold servants,</hi> Matth. 6. 25, to the end, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 22, to 33. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 3, to 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 55. 22.</p>

Besides, as there are intercourses of <hi>sleeping</hi> and <hi>waking,</hi> of <hi>night</hi> and <hi>day,</hi> of <hi>fair weather</hi> and <hi>foul,</hi> of <hi>war</hi> and <hi>peace,</hi> of <hi>labour</hi> and <hi>recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> that each may set off the other, so <hi>God</hi> findes it meet, by a sense of want to <hi>humble</hi> us; and by supplying our wants to <hi>fill us with joy</hi> and thankfulness.</p>
               <p>Ptolomie <hi>King of</hi> Egypt, going a <hi>hunting</hi> lost his way, and could get no better fare, then a course <hi>brown loaf in a Shepherds house:</hi> but this he said seemed <hi>sweeter and better</hi> to him; <hi>then all the delights</hi> that ever he ate or met with before. Content in want, is plenty with an over-plus.</p>
               <p>The giver of all things knows how to dispence his favours so, as that every one may have cause both of <hi>thankfulness</hi> and <hi>humiliation:</hi> whiles there is <hi>none</hi> that hath <hi>all,</hi> nor <hi>any</hi> one but hath <hi>some.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>God</hi> in mercy not seldome keeps his children from <hi>riches</hi> and abundance: lest they should choak and wound them; for they are <hi>snares and thorns,</hi> Matth. 13. 22.</p>
               <p>Indeed <hi>riches</hi> are a blessing, if we can so <hi>possess them;</hi> that they <hi>possess not us:</hi> There can be no danger, much benefit in abundance, all the <hi>good</hi> or <hi>ill,</hi> of <hi>wealth</hi> or <hi>poverty;</hi> is in the <hi>minde,</hi> in the <hi>use.</hi> But this is the misery, <hi>Plenty of goods,</hi> commonly occasions <hi>plenty of evils.</hi> How many had been <hi>good?</hi> had they not been <hi>great.</hi> Divers have changed their <hi>mindes</hi> with their <hi>means,</hi> neither hath <hi>God</hi> worse servants <hi>in the world,</hi> then are <hi>rich men of the world:</hi> if <hi>adversity</hi> hath slain her <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, prosperity hath slain her ten thousand.</hi> Commonly where is <hi>no want,</hi> is <hi>much wantonness:</hi> and as we grow <hi>rich in temporals,</hi> we grow <hi>poor in spirituals.</hi> Usually so much the more <hi>proud, secure, wanton, scornful, impenitent, &amp;c.</hi> by how much the more we are <hi>enriched, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi> and <hi>blessed.

riches comparable to a contented minde, <hi>as Plutarch</hi> is of opinion, That there are <hi>poor Kings,</hi> and <hi>rich Coblers,</hi> as wise <hi>Solon</hi> seemed to insinuate to the <hi>King,</hi> when he was vaunting of his greatness: For it was <hi>Iris a poor beggar,</hi> that he told <hi>Croesus</hi> was the <hi>happiest man in his Dominions.</hi> And when <hi>King Agis</hi> requested the <hi>Oracle of Apollo</hi> to tell him, who was the happiest man in the world? expecting to hear himself nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the answer was <hi>Aglaion,</hi> who was a <hi>poor Gardiner in Arcadia,</hi> that at sixty years of age, had never gone from home, but kept himself and his family with their labour, in a fruitful plot or garden, as <hi>Livius</hi> relates. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> opened himself to his friend <hi>Cineas,</hi> that he first intended a war upon <hi>Italy,</hi> and what then said <hi>Cineas?</hi> then we will attempt <hi>Cicile,</hi> and what then? then we may conquer <hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Affrica;</hi> and what then said <hi>Cineas?</hi> Why, then quoth <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> we may rest, and feast, and sacrifice, and make merry with our friends: to which <hi>Cineas</hi> replied, (as every servant of <hi>God</hi> would do in the like case) and may we not enjoy all this, sweetness now? and that without all this ado. But <hi>natural men</hi> are <hi>mad men.</hi> Yea, were <hi>great men,</hi> though <hi>good men,</hi> but asked the question; their consciences could not but acquaint us, if they would speak out; that <hi>true contentment seldom dwels high,</hi> whiles meaner men of humble spirits, enjoy both <hi>earth and heaven.</hi> However not a few of them have freely acknowledged it, as I have largely related in my <hi>second Part of Philarguromastix.</hi> Wherefore be pleased, ô <hi>God,</hi> to give me a contented minde: and then if I have but <hi>little in estate,</hi> I shall have <hi>much in possession.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, mean ones with their <hi>poverty, misery, ignominy,</hi> are often <hi>saved;</hi> whiles others with their <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>opulency go to hell. When we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord; that we may not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. <hi>Riches</hi> do so <hi>puff up</hi> some men, that they even think it <hi>a discredit to their great Worships, to worship God.</hi> Nothing feeds pride, nor keeps off repentance so much, as prosperous advantage. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> never thought of his <hi>father,</hi> till he <hi>wanted husks.</hi> We <hi>serve God,</hi> as our servants <hi>serve us:</hi> of whom many have <hi>too good clothes,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too <hi>much wages,</hi> or are too <hi>full fed</hi> to do work. As <hi>a woman</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that her <hi>hen laid</hi> her every day an <hi>egg;</hi> for all she was <hi>very lean,</hi> had a conceit, that if she were <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>lusty,</hi> she would lay twice a day; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon she fed and cram'd her thoroughly: but in a short space, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came so fat, that contrary to her expectation, she left laying altogether. <hi>Who so nourisheth his servant daintily from his childhood; shall after finde him stubbron,</hi> Prov. 29. 21.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, they fix their affections upon <hi>heavenly riches,</hi> and not upon the <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>transitory</hi> riches of this world: because in sicknesse, when they stand in the greatest need of all, they will not do them the least good, Your <hi>gold</hi> will not <hi>bribe a disease,</hi> your bags will not keep your

               </p>
               <p>Indeed the foolish <hi>Prior in Melancthon,</hi> rolled his <hi>hands</hi> up and down in a <hi>bason full of Angels;</hi> thinking by this means <hi>to cure his Gout:</hi> but it would not do. Yea, thou that placest thy happinesse, and puttest thy confidence in a little white and red earth; and dotest so upon the world, tell me? When the hand of <hi>God</hi> hath never so little touched thee, what good thy great wealth will do thee? Therefore, ô <hi>vain desires!</hi> and <hi>impotent contentments</hi> of men, that place their happinesse in these things: will not this your <hi>fair Herodias,</hi> appear as <hi>a stigmatized Gipsie?</hi> Will not all the toil and cost you haue been at to get riches, appear as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous; as if a <hi>countryman</hi> should <hi>anoint his axle-tree with Amber-greece?</hi> or as if a <hi>travaller,</hi> should <hi>liquour his boots with Balsamum.</hi> Yea, your <hi>wealth</hi> will not only not <hi>save you from evils,</hi> but help to <hi>make you more miserable,</hi> and not only <hi>here,</hi> but <hi>hereafter,</hi> Psal. 49. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Why then do you set so high a price upon them? and so shamefully undervalue the riches of the minde? which will much mitigate your <hi>grief,</hi> and <hi>increase your comfort,</hi> in what condition soever you are. But</p>
               <p>Seventhly, they little set by the wealth of this world; because their riches may soon leave them: When with the <hi>Spider</hi> we have <hi>exhausted our very bowels,</hi> to contrive a <hi>slender web</hi> of an uncertain inheritance: <hi>one puff of winde</hi> and blast blown upon it by the Almighty, <hi>carries all away.</hi> What sayes <hi>Solomon?</hi> Prov. 23. <hi>Cease from thy wisdome, wilt thou cast thine eyes upon that, which is nothing? for riches taketh her to her wings, as an Eagle, and flyeth away,</hi> Verse 4, 5. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 11. <hi>Isaiah</hi> 33. 1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 27. Yea, all riches are <hi>uncertain,</hi> but those that are evil gotten, are <hi>most uncertain:</hi> as <hi>examples of all ages</hi> witnesse. The first of these was verified in <hi>Job;</hi> who lived to see himself poor to a Proverb; and fell from the <hi>want of all misery,</hi> to the <hi>misery of all wants.</hi> And <hi>Dionysius,</hi> who fell from a <hi>Tyrant over men,</hi> to be a <hi>Tutor ever boyes,</hi> and so to get his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.

               <p>You see <hi>little children,</hi> what pains they take to rake and scrape <hi>snow</hi> together, to make <hi>a snow-ball:</hi> right so it fares with them, that scrape together the treasure of this world, they have but a <hi>snow-bal</hi> of it, for so soon as the <hi>Sun shineth;</hi> and <hi>God breatheth</hi> upon it, by and by it <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to nothing.</hi>

               <p>All <hi>worldly things</hi> are <hi>but lent us,</hi> our <hi>houses of stone</hi> wherein our <hi>bodies</hi> dwell, our <hi>houses of clay</hi> wherein our <hi>souls</hi> dwell, are but <hi>lent us: honours; pleasures, treasures, money, maintenance, wives, children, friends, &amp;c. but lent us:</hi> we may say of them all, as he said of the <hi>Ax-head when it fell into the water;</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Alass; they are but borrowed.</hi> Only spiritual <hi>graces are given;</hi> of those things there is only <hi>a true donation,</hi> whereof there is <hi>a true possession: worldly things</hi> are but as a <hi>Tabernacle;</hi> a <hi>moveable; heaven</hi> is a <hi>mansion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now put all these together, and they will sufficiently shew; that he is <hi>a fool or a mad man;</hi> that prefers not <hi>spiritual riches,</hi> (which are subject to none of these casualties) before <hi>temporal</hi> and <hi>transitory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so at lenght I have shewn you <hi>what it is not, and what it is to be rich.</hi> And I hope convinced the worldling, that the <hi>richest</hi> are not <hi>alwayes the happiest:</hi> Yea; that they are the most miserable; who swim in wealth, wanting grace and <hi>Gods</hi> blessing upon what they do possesse: while that man is incomparably happy; to whom <hi>God</hi> in his love and favour, giveth only a competency of earthly things, and the blessing of contentation withall; so as to be thankful for the same, and desire no more. I will now in discharge of my promise acquaint you; how of <hi>poor; melancholy</hi> and <hi>miserable;</hi> you may become <hi>rich, happy,</hi> and <hi>cheerful.</hi>

               <p>FIrst, if any of <hi>poor</hi> would become <hi>rich,</hi> let him become <hi>religious:</hi> for <hi>Godliness hath the promises of this life, as well as of the life to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 8. Yea, all temporall blessings that can be named, are promised to the godly, and their seed; and to them only as both the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> does plainly and plentifully prove. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 28th. <hi>God</hi> hath promised; that if we will <hi>hearken diligently unto his voice, observe and do all his Commandements, and walk in his wayes, we shall be blessed in the city, aand blessed in the field, blessed in our going forth, and in our comming home, blessed in the fruit of our bodies, and in the fruit of our ground, and in the fruit of our cattel, the increase of our kine, and the flocks of our sheep.</hi> That <hi>he will bless us in our store-houses, and in all that we set our hands unto; and make us plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in all good things:</hi> and that <hi>we shall have wherewith to lend unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not borrow,</hi> Verse 1, to 15th. and Chap. 7. 11, to 19th. To which may be added many the like places; As, <hi>Blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his commandements: wealth and riches shall be in his house,</hi> Psal. 112. Verse 1, to 4th. <hi>Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he will exalt thee to inherit the land,</hi> Psal. 37. 34. <hi>The Lord will with-hold no good thing from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psal. 84. 11. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord, and he shall give thee thine hearts desire, &amp;c.</hi> Psal. 37. 3, to 7. <hi>Fear ye the Lord, ye his Saints: for nothing wanteth to them that fear him. The Lions do lack, and suffer hunger, but they that seek the Lord, shall want nothing that is good,</hi> Psal. 34. 9, 10. <hi>Whatsoever we ask, we receive of him: because we keep his commandements, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight,</hi> 1 John 3. 12. What rare and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises are these? to which I might add very many of like nature. All which <hi>David</hi> had the <hi>experience of,</hi> who tels us that he <hi>greatly rejoyced in the strength and salvation of the Lord, and the Lord gave him his hearts desire, and did not with-hold the request of his lips:</hi> Yea, <hi>he prevented him with the blessings of goodness, and set a crown of gold upon his head,</hi> Psal. 21. 1, 2, 3, 4. And the like of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Let us <hi>first seek the Kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all other things shall be ministred unto us,</hi> or come in as it were upon the bargain, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath assured us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Talis est ille qui in Christo credit, die qua credidit, qualis ille qui universam legem implevit;</hi> saith <hi>Hierom,</hi> We have a <hi>livery and seisin,</hi> of all the precious promises, both in the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Gospel,</hi> in the first moment of our faith. Yea, even an earnest, and partly a possession of <hi>Heaven</hi> it self: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 6. Neither
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34603:33"/>
are these promises made only to the obedient themselves: but riches, and all earthly blessings are entailed upon their seed also, <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. <hi>His seed shall be mighty upon earth, the generation of the righteous shall be blessed, Verse</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Nor is riches, and outward prosperity promised to the godly, and their seed as others usually enjoy them, that is, single and barely, but they have a promise of them, with a supply and addition of all other good things, that may make them every way happy, as that their prosperity shall be <hi>durable and lasting.</hi> That with riches they shall have <hi>credit, honour, and promotion</hi> with <hi>long life added.</hi> That they shall be <hi>happy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper in all they have or do:</hi> as having <hi>God</hi> their <hi>Protector,</hi> who with mercy is said to <hi>compass them about on every side,</hi> Psal. 32. 10. That they shall be <hi>freed from</hi> all <hi>fears</hi> and <hi>dangers,</hi> and <hi>obtein victory over all their enemies;</hi> together with <hi>death, hell,</hi> and the <hi>devil.</hi> That they shall be freed from the <hi>Law,</hi> and likewise from <hi>sin,</hi> and the penalty thereof. That they shall have <hi>peace external, internal, eternal.</hi> And <hi>joy,</hi> even the <hi>joy of the holy Ghost:</hi> which is both <hi>glorious, and unspeakable.</hi> That they shall not only <hi>persevere,</hi> but also <hi>grow in grace, and true wisdom.</hi> That <hi>all things</hi> whatsoever, <hi>shall make for their good.</hi> That both their <hi>persons and performances</hi> shall be <hi>good and acceptable;</hi> which before were <hi>wicked and abominable.</hi> That by the <hi>prayer</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> they shall <hi>obtein of God, whatsoever they shall ask in Christs Name, and according to his Word.</hi> And in fine, <hi>all</hi> other <hi>good things,</hi> that can be named; whether <hi>temporal, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> or <hi>eternal:</hi> are by the promise of <hi>God entailed, upon them that love him, and keep his commandements, and upon their seed,</hi> as I could plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and most easily prove, were it pertinent to the matter in hand. Nor is all this, that <hi>God</hi> hath promised to those that serve him, so great a matter comparatively; as that we need wonder at it, or once question the same: For <hi>If he spared not his own Son, but delivered him to death for us; how shall he not with him freely, give us all things also?</hi> Rom. 8. 31, 32. It is the <hi>Apostles</hi> argument. Great, yea, too great things are they for us to receive; but not too great, for the great and good <hi>God of Heaven and earth</hi> to give: all the fear is on our part, whether we be such to whom the promise is made. For all <hi>Gods promises are conditional.</hi> And though of these outward good things, he hath promised abundance: yet it is upon the condition of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience:</hi> as appears by all the fore-mentioned places; so that if we be not wanting in our duty, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>God; God</hi> will not be wanting in any good thing to us: Nor can we look that <hi>God</hi> should make good his promises, if we make them void, by not observing the condition, as that we may do by our distrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. If we will not dare to trust <hi>God</hi> upon his promise so confidently as we would a friend, or some great man that is able and honest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:34603:33"/>
Besides, the <hi>Lord</hi> hath promised, that <hi>there shall be no want to them that fear him; and that no good thing will he with-hold, from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psal. 34. 9. &amp; 84. 11. Where observe two things, there shall be no want to such, and such shall want no good thing: so that he must be such an one, to whom the promise is made; and he must also be sure, that it is good for him, which is promised. But oftentimes it is not good, for a man to abound with earthly blessings: as <hi>strong drinke</hi> is not good for <hi>weake brains.</hi> Yea, if any thing be wanting to a good man, he may be sure it is not good for him: and then better that he doth want it, then that he did enjoy it, and what wise man will complain of the want of that, which if he had, would prove more hurtful then gainful to him? as <hi>a sword</hi> to a <hi>mad man,</hi> a <hi>knife</hi> to a <hi>childe, drinke</hi> to them that have a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> or the <hi>Dropsie. No good thing will God with-hold, &amp;c.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not wants themselves, which to many are also good, yea, very good things, as I could reckon up many: want sanctified, is a notable means to <hi>bring to repentance,</hi> to <hi>work</hi> in us <hi>amendment of life, it stirs up to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, it weans from the love of the world, it keeps us always prepared for the spiritual combate, discovers whether we be true believers or hypocrites, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents greater evils of sin and punishment to come; It makes us humble, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to Christ our head, increaseth our faith, our joy and thankfulnesse, our spiritual wisdom,</hi> and likewise <hi>our patience,</hi> as I have largely shewen in <hi>The Benefit of Affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To coonclude, All <hi>good things</hi> were created for the <hi>good,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called <hi>goods;</hi> because the <hi>good God</hi> created them for <hi>good men to do good withal.</hi> Therefore as Jacob <hi>got the blessing,</hi> so he gat the <hi>inheritance</hi> also: to shew that as the faithful have the <hi>inward blessing,</hi> so they have the <hi>outward blessing</hi> too; when they will do them good, and cause them to do good. Yea, in this case, even as the <hi>sheaffs</hi> fell before <hi>Ruth:</hi> so riches shall fall in our way, as they did to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Joseph,</hi> upon whom riches were cast they knew not how; but as if <hi>God</hi> had onely said, Be rich; and they were rich straight. But that this is the true and only way to wealth and happiness, needs no more proof then that which is recorded of <hi>Solomon</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 3. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. where the <hi>Lord appearing to him in a dream,</hi> said, <hi>Ask what I shall give thee.</hi> And he asking only <hi>an understanding heart, to discern between good and evil; that he might the better discharge that great place, whereunto God had called him;</hi> wherein <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and the <hi>peoples good,</hi> was his <hi>principal aime</hi> and end: Heare what the <hi>Lords</hi> answer is, <hi>Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge for thy self, that thou mightest judge my people, over whom I have made thee King: Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee riches, &amp; wealth and honour, such as none of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34603:34"/>
Kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the like, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, he was so surpassing rich, that he <hi>gave silver in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem as stones, and gave Cedars as the wilde fig-trees that grow abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly in the plain,</hi> 1. King. 10. 27. 2 Chron. 1. 7, to 13, 14, 15. Lo, the true <hi>way to Wealth, honour, and happiness,</hi> is; <hi>to desire grace,</hi> that we may <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God,</hi> and <hi>do good:</hi> for cleering whereof, I'le give you a similitude, <hi>A man</hi> spies a fair <hi>apple</hi> on a tree, hath a <hi>longing desire</hi> to it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he falls a <hi>shaking the tree</hi> with all his might: at length <hi>it</hi> not only <hi>comes down,</hi> but <hi>many other</hi> come down to him together <hi>with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so much to prove, that the way to become <hi>rich,</hi> is first to become <hi>godly.</hi> If any shall ask why the godly are not alwayes, nor oft rich, notwithstanding these promises? I answer, that <hi>God</hi> not seldom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds these outward blessings, from his own people in great love, only affording them all things that they have need of. <hi>Our heavenly Father,</hi> who <hi>knows us</hi> better then we <hi>know our selves,</hi> and what is good and fit for us, (even as the <hi>Nurse</hi> knows better then the <hi>childe,</hi> and the <hi>Physician</hi> better then the <hi>Patient;)</hi> knows too well, how apt we are to abuse these his mercies; and that we cannot <hi>abound</hi> with earthly blessings, but we <hi>grow proud and surfeit</hi> of them: as we see <hi>Solomon</hi> himself did, who was the <hi>wisest (next to</hi> Adam in his innocency) that ever lived: and likewise how happy it is for them, to be kept short. And when the <hi>All-wise God</hi> does fore-see, that men will serve him as the <hi>Prodigal son</hi> served his <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> who only <hi>prayed untill he had got his patrimony,</hi> and <hi>then forsook him,</hi> and spent the same in riot to the givers dishonour; even as the <hi>cloud</hi> that is lifted up, and <hi>advanced by the Sun obscures the Sun.</hi> In this case he either denies them riches in mercy, as he denied Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his suit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9. And our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 39. Or grants them their <hi>riches in wrath,</hi> Hosea 13. 11. Psal. 106. 15. of which I have largely spoken in the <hi>foregoing pages,</hi> where I have declared how miserable they are, who <hi>swim in wealth, wanting grace, and Gods blessing</hi> upon what they do possesse.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>first</hi> and main <hi>step to riches,</hi> and <hi>the next is like unto it,</hi> viz. <hi>bounty and liberality to the poor members of Jesus Christ.</hi> For,</p>

                  <hi>SEcondly,</hi> He that would <hi>be a rich man,</hi> let him <hi>be a merciful man,</hi> and do <hi>good</hi> with what <hi>God</hi> hath already given him, be it never so little. for there is not a more sure and infallible way, to increase and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply a mans outward estate, then in being charitable to the poor, if we will believe <hi>Gods Word.</hi> As what saith our <hi>Saviour? Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34603:34"/>
running over shall men give into your bosome,</hi> Luke 6. 38. Matth. 7. 2. Mark 4. 24. In which regard, it may be truly said: <hi>Eleëmosyna non est divitiarum dispendium, sed ditescendi potius compendium quaestusque o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnium uberrimus.</hi> And to this accords that place in the <hi>Proverbs, There is that scattereth, and is more increased: but he that spareth more then is right, shall surely come to poverty,</hi> Proverbs 11. 24. <hi>The liberal person shall have plenty, and he that watereth, shall also have rain,</hi> Verse 25. And the like in the <hi>Psalms, Wealth and riches shall be in the house of him, that hath compassion of, and giveth to the poor,</hi> Psal. 112. 3, to 10. See here how <hi>bounty</hi> is the best and surest way to <hi>plenty.</hi> But notable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is that, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 27. <hi>He that giveth to the poor, shall not lack.</hi> A rare and incomparable priviledge never to want. And yet this is a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain of Gods own making. Plenty shall furnish the table,</hi> where <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity takes away, and gives to the poor. He hath sparsed abroad,</hi> (sayes the <hi>Psalmist) and given to the poor, his benevolence remaineth for ever,</hi> Psal. 112. 9. He hath alwayes to give, that hath a free and bountiful heart to give, sayes Saint <hi>Bernard.</hi> And of this the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> does assure us, <hi>The liberal man</hi> (sayes he) <hi>deviseth liberal things; and by liberality he shall stand,</hi> Isaiah 32. 8. A man would think, he should rather <hi>fall</hi> by being so liberal &amp; bountiful: but this is the right course to <hi>thrive, and hold out.</hi> Nor was it ever known, that <hi>God</hi> suffered a merciful and bountiful man to want; <hi>ordering his affairs with discretion,</hi> Psal. 112. 5. But you have not heard a tithe of these promises: for the <hi>Scriptures</hi> no lesse <hi>abound</hi> in them, then <hi>silver</hi> did <hi>in the dayes of Solomon:</hi> of which only a few more, for I had rather <hi>press you with weight,</hi> then <hi>oppresse you with number</hi> of arguments. What saith the <hi>Wiseman?</hi> Prov. 3. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of all thine increase: so shall thy barns be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall burst with new wine,</hi> Verse 9, 10. In which regard, whhat is this way expended, may be likened to <hi>gold the best of metals:</hi> of which experience teacheth, that the <hi>third part of a grain, will gild a wyre of</hi> 134 <hi>foot long;</hi> Or rather to those <hi>loaves and fishes in the Gospel:</hi> for as they did <hi>increase and multiply,</hi> even while they were <hi>distributing:</hi> so do our riches (and indeed all other gifts.) Even out of that which the <hi>hand reacheth to the mouth,</hi> it self is <hi>nourished.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus you see, that (if either <hi>Old or New Testament</hi> be true) <hi>not getting,</hi> but <hi>giving</hi> is the true and ready <hi>way to abundance.</hi> That <hi>to give</hi> in this case, is <hi>the way to have;</hi> that <hi>parsimony,</hi> is <hi>no good husbandry:</hi> &amp; that we are the <hi>richer for disbursing.</hi> Which makes <hi>Chrysostome</hi> say, that <hi>the gainfullest Art is Almsgiving.</hi> And hence it is, that the <hi>Scripture</hi> compares <hi>Almsgiving, to sowing of seed,</hi> 2 Cor. 9. 6. <hi>he that soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, shall reap sparingly: but he that soweth bountifully, shall also reap bountifully.</hi> The <hi>Apostle compares giving to sowing,</hi> to note
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34603:35"/>
unto us the great gain, and advantage that commeth thereby, for who knoweth not what gain <hi>a good husbandman,</hi> hath by his <hi>sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> He <hi>casteth his seed into the ground,</hi> and only <hi>forbeareth</hi> it a few moneths, and when the season comes, he <hi>reaps a harvest of thirty, fourty</hi> or <hi>an hundred for one</hi> increase. And the like of <hi>lending</hi> or <hi>putting</hi> money <hi>to interest:</hi> to which the <hi>Scriptures</hi> also compare it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. <hi>He who hath pitty on the poor, lendeth unto the Lord: and that which he hath given, will he repay him again,</hi> Prov. 19. 17. <hi>The Lord</hi> is content, to <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge himself the charitable mans debtor.</hi> Yea, by our liberality to the poor, <hi>our most gracious Redeemer,</hi> acknowledgeth himself <hi>gratified and ingaged;</hi> as himself does most fteely and fully acknowledge, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. <hi>I was an hungry and ye gave me meat, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>for as much as ye have done it unto the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me,</hi> Verse 35, 36, 40. <hi>The poor mans hand, is Christs Treasury or Bank;</hi> as one fitly calls it, and by putting thereinto, a man becomes a <hi>Creditor</hi> to his <hi>Saviour.</hi> Neither will he pay or recompence us, as we do our creditors. For as <hi>Augustine</hi> well notes; what we receive, by way of <hi>return, is not ten for an hundred, or an hundred for ten, but an hundred for one,</hi> yea, a <hi>thousand thousand for one;</hi> an hundred for one here in this world, and <hi>in the world to come life everlasting,</hi> together with a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> even an immortal, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Kingdom of glory</hi> and happinesse in <hi>heaven,</hi> which is not to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued with ten thousand worlds.</p>
               <p>Ann why all this? but in recompence of <hi>feeding, clothing and visiting his poor brethren,</hi> and members, when they were destitute. Where note but the incomparable, and infinite <hi>difference,</hi> between the <hi>receit</hi> and the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn:</hi> as, ô the <hi>unmeasurable measure of our Saviours bounty!</hi> And how happy is that man, that may become <hi>a creditor to his Saviour! heaven</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> shall be <hi>empty,</hi> before he shall want a royal <hi>payment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore hearke n to this, all you self-lovers, that are only for your own ends: Do you indeed love your <hi>selves?</hi> and your <hi>souls?</hi> would you be <hi>rich</hi> indeed, and that both <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter?</hi> then be charitable to the poor, even to the utmost of your ability: for this <hi>giving</hi> is not only <hi>an act of charity,</hi> but also <hi>of Christian policie:</hi> since we shall not only receive our own again, but the same also with great increase: for as it fared with the <hi>widow of Sarepta. whose handfull of meal and cruse of oil with which she relieved the Prophet; the more she spent, the more it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,</hi> and <hi>the more she had;</hi> so shall this precious oil, bestowed on the poor for <hi>Christs</hi> sake, be returned upon our heads in great measure, as some that I could name can say, out of admirable experience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should finde, would they but <hi>so far forth believe the Lord, as to try him:</hi> Which makes Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> say, That the <hi>charitable man</hi> is <hi>the greatest usurer</hi> in the world.</p>
               <p>I know this is such a <hi>paradox</hi> to <hi>misers,</hi> and men of the world; that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34603:35"/>
nothing seems to them more absurd and ridiculous: what? perswade them that giving away their goods, is the way to increase them? You must make me a fool (will such an one say) before I can believe it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he speaks truer then he is aware of: for these are the very words of St. <hi>Paul; He that will be wise, let him become a fool that he may be wise,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18. <hi>The wisdom of God is foolishness with the world: and so is the wisdom of the world foolishness with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. &amp; 3. 19.</p>
               <p>To <hi>carnal reason</hi> it is as unlikely a thing, as that which <hi>Elisha</hi> told to the <hi>King of Israel,</hi> 2 Kings 7. that whereas the <hi>Famine</hi> was so great in <hi>Samaria one day</hi> that <hi>mothers aet their own children:</hi> yet <hi>the next day</hi> there should be <hi>such plenty,</hi> that a <hi>measure of fine flower should be sold for a sheckle, and two measures of barley for a sheckle.</hi> As improbable, as that <hi>Abraham</hi> should have <hi>a son, being almost an hundred years old; and</hi> Sarah <hi>past child-bearing.</hi> As impossible, as that <hi>Lazarus</hi> should again <hi>live,</hi> after he was <hi>stark dead, buried,</hi> and <hi>stanke</hi> again. Yet as unlikely, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, and impossible as they seemed to be: yet they came to pass, and <hi>God</hi> did not <hi>break his promise,</hi> nor <hi>disappoint the hopes</hi> of such as had the wit, and grace <hi>to conside in him:</hi> no more will he in this case, which is by far the easier to be performed. And what though carnall mindes (like that <hi>Noble-man, who was trodden to death in the gate of</hi> Samaria, <hi>for his incredulity)</hi> will not believe, yet <hi>truth is truth,</hi> as well <hi>when it is not acknowledged,</hi> as when it is.</p>
               <p>And I wish men would take heed of <hi>unbelief</hi> and <hi>giving God the lie:</hi> for, as there is nothing he so abhors, as that <hi>his own</hi> houshold ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants should <hi>not dare to trust him,</hi> as we may see in that example of the <hi>Noble man,</hi> 2 Kings 7. 17, 24. &amp; likewise in those <hi>Israelites,</hi> Psal. 78. when they said, <hi>Can God furnish a table in the Wilderness? He smote the Rock that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; but can be give bread also? Can he provide flesh for his people? Yes, he could and did it,</hi> to their small comfort that made the exception. For <hi>because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation, the fire of the Lord burnt among them, and consumed them. He gave them flesh, even quailes in his wrath, until they were choaked,</hi> Psal. 78. 10, to 38. and, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 33, 34. But admit <hi>God</hi> should not answer thy greedy desire, in multiplying thy estate: yet if he do that which is better for thee, <hi>viz.</hi> give thee <hi>a competency</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>with a more contented minde</hi> then now thou hast, or ever wouldst have, wert thou as rich as <hi>Crassus:</hi> would it be ever the worse, or hadst thou any cause to complain? no, but greatly to rejoyce, as I have shewn in the foregoing part.</p>
               <p>Wherefore trust <hi>God</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> who <hi>above hope believed under hope,</hi> Rom. 4. 18, to 22. For <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>to God,</hi> as <hi>Bathsheba</hi> was to <hi>Solomon,</hi> so <hi>in favour,</hi> that the <hi>King</hi> will <hi>deny her nothing</hi> that good is.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>second means,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath appointed for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34603:36"/>
of our outward estates: or the <hi>second step to riches and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward prosperity,</hi> viz. <hi>bounty and liberality to the poor.</hi>

               <p>THe <hi>third and fourth</hi> are <hi>thankfulness, and humility;</hi> which are no way inferiour to the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thankfulness and humility</hi> are the only means to <hi>enrich us</hi> with <hi>Gods</hi> blessings: but <hi>pride and unthankfulness,</hi> is the only way to <hi>make God withdraw,</hi> and take from us both <hi>himself, and his blessings. Because the King of</hi> Assyria <hi>said, By the power of mine arme have I done it, and by my wisdom, for I am prudent: therefore, saith the Lord, I have removed the borders of the people, and have spoiled their treasures, and have pulled down the Inhabitants like a valiant man,</hi> Isay 10. 13. <hi>AEsops Crow</hi> not content with her own likenesse, <hi>borrowed a feather of every bird;</hi> and she became so <hi>proud,</hi> that she <hi>scorned</hi> them all: which the birds observing, they came and <hi>pluckt each one their feather back,</hi> and so left her <hi>naked:</hi> even so does <hi>God</hi> deal with all proud and ingrateful persons.</p>
               <p>There is nothing more pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> nor <hi>profitable to us;</hi> both for the <hi>procuring of the good we want,</hi> or <hi>continuing the good we have;</hi> then <hi>humility and thankfulness:</hi> Yea, to the humble and thankful soul, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall be wanting. <hi>God will sowe there, and there only, plenty of his blessings; where he is sure to reap plenty of thanks and service:</hi> but who will <hi>sowe those barren sands,</hi> where they are sure not only to be without all hope of a good <hi>harvest,</hi> but are sure to <hi>lose both their seed and labour.</hi> Yet fools as we are, we <hi>forfeit</hi> many of <hi>Gods favours, for not paying that easie quit-rent of thankfulness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ingratitude forfeits mercies, as Merchants do all to the King, by not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of custome. Because</hi> Pharaoh <hi>saith, The River is mine own, therefore God saith, I will dry up the River,</hi> Ezek. 29. 3, to 13. Isaiah 19. 5, 6. Deut. 11. 9, 10. <hi>Tamberlain</hi> having overcome <hi>Bajazet,</hi> he asked him whether he had ever given <hi>God</hi> thanks, for making him so great an <hi>Emperour?</hi> he confest ingenuously, he had never thought of it; to whom <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> replyed, that it was no marvel so ingrateful a man, should be made such a spectacle of misery. <hi>When the people sought themselves only, and how to have their houses ceiled and sumptuous, neglecting the house of God and his honour, thus it fared with them: Ye have sowen much, and have reaped little; and he that earneth wages, carneth wages to put it into a bag with holes. Ye looked for much, and lo it came to little: and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. I called for a drought upon the land, and upon all that it bringeth forth; and upon all the labour of the hands, &amp;c.</hi> Again, when they sought <hi>Gods glory,</hi> and were thankful,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34603:36"/>
mark the difference: <hi>even from this very day will I bless you, saith God,</hi> Hag. 1. 4. to 12 &amp; 2, 18, 19. He that is unthankful for a <hi>little,</hi> is worthy of <hi>nothing:</hi> whereas thanks for one good turn, is the best introduction to another. Holy <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>man after Gods own heart,</hi> and therefore he ever mixeth with his <hi>prayers praises. Bless the Lord, ô my soul,</hi> sayes he, <hi>and forget not all his benefits,</hi> Psal. 103. 2. And being of <hi>a publick spirit, he discovers the secrets of this skill,</hi> as when he saith, <hi>Let the people praise thee, ô God, let all the people praise thee: then shall the earth bring forth her increase, and God, even our God, shall give us his blessing,</hi> Psal. 67. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Wherefore be not like the <hi>Swine,</hi> that <hi>feeds</hi> upon the <hi>Acorns,</hi> without ever <hi>looking</hi> to the <hi>Oake;</hi> from whence they fall. Or the <hi>Horse,</hi> that <hi>drinks</hi> of the <hi>Brook,</hi> and never thinks of the <hi>Spring.</hi> Yea, since <hi>God</hi> is <hi>the fountain,</hi> from which all <hi>our enjoyments flow;</hi> let this be our continual determination: He hath <hi>given</hi> us all the <hi>grace, good,</hi> and <hi>happiness we have;</hi> and we will <hi>give him all the possible thanks,</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> we <hi>can.</hi> Yea, teach us, <hi>ô Lord,</hi> to receive the benefit of thy merciful favour, and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> thee <hi>the thanks,</hi> and <hi>the glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like of <hi>Humility, Blessed are the meek</hi> (saith our <hi>Saviour) for they shall inherit the earth,</hi> Matth. 5. 5. <hi>The reward of humility, and the fear of God, is riches, and honour, and life,</hi> Prov. 22, 4. If there <hi>be a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in a valley lower</hi> then another, thither the <hi>waters gather;</hi> And the <hi>more lowly</hi> we are in <hi>our own eyes,</hi> the more lovely we are in <hi>Gods: the more despicable in our selves, the more acceptable in him,</hi> as is seen in the example of the <hi>Publican,</hi> Luke 18. 13, 14. And the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> Luke 15. 18, 19, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor can any thing make us more acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> then the conscience of our own unworthiness: when with <hi>Jacob</hi> we can say, <hi>O Lord, I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant: For with my staff I passed over this Jordane, and now I am become two bands,</hi> Gen. 32. 10. When with the <hi>Publican</hi> we can confesse, <hi>I am not worthy to lift up mine eyes to heaven,</hi> Luke 18. 13, 14. And with the <hi>Prodigal, I am not worthy to be called thy son,</hi> Luke 15. And with the <hi>Centurion, I am not worthy thou shouldest come under my roof,</hi> Luke 7. 6. And with <hi>John Baptist,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the like, <hi>I am not worthy, I am not worthy.</hi> This is the way to obtein what we would have at the hands of <hi>God: who resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam. 4. 6, 10. Prov. 29. 23. &amp; 15. 33. &amp; 18. 12. <hi>Unto him will I look,</hi> saith the <hi>Lord, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite spirit; and that trembleth at my words,</hi> Isaiah 57. 15. He <hi>hath fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the hungry with good things, but the rich he hath sent empty away,</hi> Luke 1. 52, 53.</p>
               <p>So that if thou expectest to have <hi>God</hi> bless and prosper thee, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thou forgettest not, at whose cost thou livest: <hi>Beware, lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34603:37"/>
and thy silver, and thy gold is increased, and all that thou hast is inlarged; thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God; and thou say in thine heart, My power, and the might of mine hand hath got me this wealth:</hi> but on the contrary, <hi>Remember that it is the Lord thy God, that hath given thee power to get wealth, and that it is only his blessing that makes rich.</hi> This is Gods own counsel set home with a very strict charge to all that have not a minde to perish, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 10, to 20.</p>
               <p>Many are the examples I might give you, of such as have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by their pride. <hi>While</hi> Saul <hi>was little in his own eyes, God made him head over the twelve Tribes of Israel, and gave him abundance; but when out of his greatness, he abused his place and gifts, God took them all away again.</hi> And so it had like to have fared with <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when he but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be puffed up with the wealth, and precious things that <hi>God</hi> had given him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 12, to 19. But most remarkable is the example of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> who when he ascribed all to himself, saying, <hi>Is not this great</hi> Babel <hi>which I have built, with the might of my power, and for the glory of my majesty?</hi> was presently deprived of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all that he had, and sent <hi>to graze with the beasts:</hi> but when he was humbled to the very ground, acknowledged the Author, and ascribed all to the <hi>God of heaven,</hi> he had his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all else <hi>restored unto him,</hi> Dan. 4. The way to obtein any benefit, is to acknowledge the Authour, and devote it in our hearts to the glory of that <hi>God,</hi> of whom we receive all: For by this means shall <hi>God</hi> both <hi>pleasure his servants, and honour himself.</hi> And indeed, that he may be honoured by our <hi>wisdom, riches, graces;</hi> is the only end, for which he gives us to be <hi>wise, rich, gracious.</hi> And who hath more <hi>interest in the grape,</hi> then he <hi>that planted the Vine?</hi> Who more <hi>right to the crop,</hi> then he that <hi>oweth the ground, and soweth the seed?</hi> Therefore, <hi>Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man in his strength, nor the rich man in his riches,</hi> Jer. 9. 23. For we have not only <hi>received our talents from God,</hi> but the <hi>improvement also</hi> is his meer bounty. <hi>Of him, and through him, and for him, are all things: to whom be glory, for ever,</hi> Amen. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 35, 36.</p>
               <p>And so much of the <hi>fourth means to grow rich.</hi>

                  <hi>FIfthly,</hi> the next <hi>means,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Word</hi> hath appointed to this <hi>end,</hi> is <hi>labour and industry</hi> in some lawful calling: for it is the <hi>beating of the brain,</hi> or the <hi>sweating of the brow,</hi> not the <hi>bare talk of the lips,</hi> or <hi>desire of the heart,</hi> that makes rich, according to the common Proverb, <hi>Wishers and woulders are seldom or never good housholders.

upon him, as an armed man; but the hand of the diligent maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10. 4. &amp; 12, 27. The <hi>Greeks</hi> have a saying, That <hi>plentifulness</hi> follows <hi>painfulness,</hi> and that <hi>all things</hi> are made <hi>servants to care, and industry. Caius Furius,</hi> by his painful dexterity, and unwearied labour, got more means out of <hi>one small field,</hi> then his <hi>neigbours</hi> out of <hi>many great ones:</hi> whereupon he was accused to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as if by <hi>witchcraft,</hi> he had conveyed the <hi>corn of other mens ground,</hi> into <hi>his own;</hi> but he came with all his goodly <hi>rustical instruments,</hi> with his <hi>strong and lusty daughter,</hi> and his <hi>well fed Oxen,</hi> and spake thus to the <hi>Judges:</hi> See, my <hi>Lords,</hi> these be <hi>my witchcrafts and sorceries;</hi> but I cannot shew you my <hi>watchings and sweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> which being done and spoken, he was presently <hi>absolved</hi> by the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>all.</hi> Whence the <hi>Apostle</hi> exhorts the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> to <hi>labour</hi> in their several <hi>callings,</hi> if they would have sufficient for themselves, and wherewith to help others. And this makes <hi>Solomon,</hi> in praising the <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman for her bounty,</hi> note that <hi>she works willingly with her hands, and that her candle was not put out by night,</hi> Prov. 31. 10, to 31.

               <p>And what but <hi>Idleness</hi> makes so many <hi>beggers,</hi> and base persons? It is the <hi>most corrupting Fly,</hi> that <hi>can blow in any humane minde:</hi> We learn to do <hi>ill,</hi> by doing what is <hi>next it, nothing.</hi> Whence it is that <hi>vice</hi> so fructifies, in our <hi>Gentry and Servingmen:</hi> who have nothing to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in, for they only <hi>sit to eat and drink, lie down to sleep, and rise up to play;</hi> this is all their business, and this brings thousands of them to beggery or worse.</p>
               <p>Be therefore <hi>painful,</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in thy <hi>calling:</hi> and <hi>God</hi> will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly prosper and replenish thee, with the good things of this life. This is another step.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>SIxthly,</hi> if thou wouldest thrive and grow rich, then be <hi>frugal and thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in spending:</hi> For thrift (which is a due saving from sinful, and needless expences) and a wary husbanding of what we get, hath made as many rich men, as painful getting.</p>
               <p>It is our <hi>Saviours rule,</hi> so to dispose of that plenty which <hi>God</hi> in his goodness hath bestowed upon us, that <hi>nothing be lost.</hi> John 6. 12. And it is a rule, which all good men will be sure to observe: For
<q>
                     <l>He who gets what he hath justly,</l>
                     <l>Payes what he owes duly,</l>
                     <l>Requites favours received thankfully,</l>
                     <l>Considers the case of the poor cordially,</l>
                     <l>Will not, yea dares not spend prodigally,</l>
                     <l>Let means come in never so plentifully.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34603:38"/>
And yet he of all men, is <hi>sure of a lasting competency,</hi> Prov. 28. 27. Jam. 4. 2, to 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Frugality,</hi> sayes <hi>Justine,</hi> is the <hi>mother of vertues.</hi> But an expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive man (whatsoever his gettings be) by wasting, and overlashing of his estate is sure not to thrive. As it fared with <hi>that Captain in</hi> Tully; who was not a peny the richer, for <hi>that huge summe of money given him,</hi> because he had done with it, as <hi>a naked man</hi> would do with the <hi>Nuts</hi> that he <hi>gathers; carry them all</hi> away <hi>in his belly,</hi> for lack of <hi>pockets.</hi> And this the <hi>Poets</hi> insinuate, by their lusty <hi>Giant Briarius:</hi> who had nothing to shew, of all his comings in; because his <hi>fifty bellies</hi> did <hi>consume the gettings of his hundred hands. All the labour</hi> of that man or <hi>Monster,</hi> was <hi>for his mouth;</hi> and did <hi>slide through his throat.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>Devorat os oris, quicquid lucratur os ossis.</l>

               <p>A <hi>poor man hath no riches, a prodigal shall have none.</hi> The <hi>Vessel</hi> that <hi>runneth</hi> out unduly, will be <hi>empty,</hi> when men come to <hi>draw out</hi> of it: so will the state be, if we let it <hi>leak like a crackt vessel:</hi> But what the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is, betwixt a wise and prudent <hi>frugality,</hi> and a vain <hi>expence</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> benefits, we may learn from, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42, &amp;c. where notwithstanding the <hi>seven years of famine,</hi> Egypt <hi>had corn enough,</hi> when <hi>all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys</hi> were <hi>without,</hi> and the people ready to famish: which needed not have been, if they had been more sparing in <hi>the seven plentiful years:</hi> for those years of plenty, were not confined to <hi>Egypt: other Countreys</hi> adjoyning, were no less fruitful, as the <hi>Learned</hi> aver. But that <hi>Prodigality</hi> hath brought many <hi>rich men</hi> to poverty, and <hi>poor men</hi> to <hi>beggery,</hi> I have sufficiently shewn in the 17th. Chapter. And so much of the means, whereby of <hi>poor</hi> a man may become rich: I come in the last place to shew you, how you may be <hi>happy, as well as rich,</hi> and <hi>cured of</hi> all your <hi>care, misery,</hi> and <hi>melancholy:</hi> which is the principal thing I desire to pleasure you withall. For <hi>millions</hi> there are that are mighty <hi>rich,</hi> and yet are the <hi>most miserable, melancholy,</hi> and <hi>discontented</hi> men alive.</p>

            <p>ACcording to my skill, I have taught you to <hi>improve your estates:</hi> but as to <hi>profit your soules,</hi> would more <hi>please me</hi> and <hi>pleasure you;</hi> so I have to that end, taken the greater pains, in providing <hi>proper remedies</hi> (of the same alloy) for each <hi>soul seduced,</hi> or <hi>afflicted.</hi> If such as they concern, shall be pleased to make use of them; they may (with <hi>Gods</hi> blessing) not only have their <hi>vices lessened,</hi> their <hi>knowledge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,</hi> and their <hi>mindes cheared</hi> and comforted: but probably they shall find in them, the <hi>flower, cream,</hi> or <hi>quintessence,</hi> of what would otherwise cost them <hi>twenty years reading</hi> to extract.</p>
