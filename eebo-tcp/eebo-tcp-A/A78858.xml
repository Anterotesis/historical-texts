            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIS Majeſty perceiving the manifold diſtractions which now are in this Kingdome. which cannot but bring great inconvenience, and miſchief to this whole Government; In which, as His Majeſty is moſt chiefly intereſted, ſo he holds himſelfe by many Reaſons, moſt obliged to do what in him lyes, for the preventing thereof; Though he might juſtly expect (as moſt proper for the duty of Subjects) that Propoſitions for the remedies of theſe Evils, ought rather to come to him, then from him; yet his Fatherly care of all his people being ſuch, That he will rather lay by any particular reſpect of his owne dignity, then that any time ſhould be loſt, for prevention of theſe threatning Evils, which cannot admit the delayes of the ordinary proceedings in Parliament; Doth think fit to make this enſuing propoſitions to both Houſes of Parliament</p>
            <p>That they will with all ſpeed fall into a ſerious conſideration of all choſe particulars, which they ſhall hold neceſſary, as well for the upholding and maintaining of his Majeſties juſt and Regall Authoritie, and for the ſetling of his Revenue; As for the preſent and future eſtabliſhing of their priviledges, the free and quiet enjoying of their Eſtates and Fortunes, the liberties of their perſons, the Securitie of the true Religion now profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the ſetling of Ceremonies in ſuch a manner, as may take away all juſt offence: Which when they ſhall have digeſted, and compoſed into one entire bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that ſo his Majeſtie and themſelves may be able to make the more cleare judgement of them: It ſhall then appeare by what his Majeſty ſhall do, how farre he hath been from intending or deſigning any of thoſe things, which the too great feares and jealouſies of ſome perſons ſeeme to apprehend: And how ready he will be to equall and exceed the greateſt examples of the moſt indulgent <hi>Princes</hi> in their Acts of Grace and Favour to their people.</p>
            <p>So that if all theſe preſent diſtractions (which ſo apparantly threaten the ruine of this Kingdome) do not (by the bleſſing of Almighty God) end in an happy and bleſſed Accommodation, his Majeſty will then be ready to call Heaven and Earth, God and Man to Witneſſe, that it hath not failed on his part.</p>
