            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>HAuing lately ſpoken of theſe
wordes; <hi>In all thinges giue
thankes, and quench not the
Spirite:</hi> Touching the firſt,
I ſhewed you, that it is an eaſier
thing to obtaine of God, than to bee
thankfull to him; for moe haue gone
away ſpeeders,<note place="margin">Luke 17, 17.</note> than haue gone away
thankers. Then howe the wicked are
beholding to God aſwell as the iuſt,
and therefore it is ſaide, that <hi>the ſunne
dooth ſhine vppon the iuſt and vniuſt.</hi>
Then howe Iaacob came not ſo bare
to Laban,<note place="margin">Gen 19, 30.</note> (when he brought nothing
with him but his ſtaffe in his hande)
as man commeth into this worlde,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13811:3"/>
without ſtrenght or ſtaffe to ſuſtain
him, which made the Apoſtle to
aske:<note place="margin">1 Cor 4, 7.</note> 
               <hi>What haue you which you haue
not receiued?</hi> Therefore, to teach
man to bee thankefull vnto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
he was not made in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> the
place of ioye and happineſſe; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> hee was
brought into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 2, 8.</note> to ſhew how
all his ioy and happineſſe came from
God, and not from Nature, that hee
might knowe where to beſtowe hys
thankes. Therfore Dauid to perſwad
all men vnto thankfulneſſe, ſaith: <hi>It
is a good thing and pleaſant to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal 147, 1.</note>
If hee had ſaide, no more but
<hi>good,</hi> all which loue goodneſſe were
bounde to be thankfull, but when he
ſaith not onely <hi>good,</hi> but <hi>pleaſant</hi> too,
all which loue pleaſure are bounde
to bee thankefull: and therefore, as
Peters Mother in lawe,<note place="margin">Math 8,</note> ſo ſoone as
Chriſt had healed her of a feuer, roſe
vp immediatly to miniſter vnto him:
So we ſo ſoone as Chriſt hath doone
any thing for vs, ſhoulde riſe vp im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13811:3"/>
to ſerue him.<note place="margin">1 Sam 1.</note> As Annah
when ſhe had receiued a ſonne from
God, did conſecrate him to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
ſo what ſoeuer we receiue of
God, we muſt giue it to God againe;
that is, vſe it to his glory, and make it
one of our meanes to ſerue him, for
all things which wee receiue in this
life, are giuen vnto vs, leaſt we ſhould
want any meanes to ſerue God.</p>
            <p>Then becauſe the Apoſtle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<hi>thankes</hi> for <hi>all thinges,</hi> I ſhewed
you, that hee is not thankfull before
God, which thanks him only for his
benefites, but hee is thankefull in
deede, which thankes him for his
chaſtiſement. It may bee while the
Lord giueth, many will ſay: <hi>Bleſſed be
the name of the Lord:</hi> but when the
Lord taketh away,<note place="margin">Iob 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> who will ſay <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
be the name of the Lorde.</hi> There is
one example the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Paules doctrine,
which is: <hi>in all things to giue thankes.</hi>
There is an other example of Paules
doctrine, which gaue <hi>thankes</hi> to
GOD for his <hi>rodde:</hi> for an obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="tcp:13811:4"/>
childe dooth not onely kiſſe the
hand which giueth, but the rod that
beateth.</p>
            <p>After, ſpeaking of theſe wordes,
<hi>Quench not the Spirite;</hi> I ſhewed you
that the <hi>Spirite,</hi> doth ſignifie the gifts
of the Spirite: the <hi>Spirite</hi> in the third
of Mathewe,<note place="margin">Math 3,</note> is likened to <hi>fire,</hi> and
therefore Paule ſaieth well, <hi>Quench
not the Spirite,</hi> becauſe fire may bee
quenched.</p>
            <p>Heere I tooke occaſion to ſpeake
of <hi>zeale,</hi> which is the fire of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite;</hi>
ſhewing you that GOD is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with <hi>zeale,</hi> as men are pleaſed
with <hi>loue.</hi> But as Chriſt did baptiſe
with <hi>fire;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math 3, 11.</note> ſo Iohn did baptiſe with
<hi>water:</hi> And, as the holie Ghoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
with <hi>fire;</hi> ſo hee did deſcend
with a <hi>winde</hi> that cooleth <hi>fire:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 2,</note> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that our <hi>zeale</hi> ſhould bee a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<hi>zeale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſay 58, 2,</note> as our Maſters was. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah</hi>
was commaunded to <hi>crye,</hi> but
not to <hi>roare.</hi> The Iewes might not
gather too much <hi>Manna,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exo 16, 18.</note> no more
than they might gather too little: as
<pb facs="tcp:13811:4"/>
there is a meaſure in <hi>knowledge,</hi> ſo
there is a meaſure in <hi>zeale;</hi> that is, be
zealous according to diſcretion, as
Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom 12, 3.</note> 
               <hi>Bee wiſe according to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie.</hi>
The Diſciples were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for their <hi>zeale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math 10, 28.</note> when they
left all to followe Chriſt: but Chriſt
reprooued them for their <hi>zeale,</hi>
when they woulde pray for fire from<note place="margin">Luke 9, 55.</note>
heauen to conſume the Samaritanes.
Therefore <hi>zeale</hi> and <hi>diſcreation</hi> vnited
togeather, are like the two Lyons
which ſupported the throne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;<note place="margin">1 Reg 10, 20.</note>
and hee which hath them
both, is like Moiſes for his mildnes,
and like Phineas for his feruencie:
therefore, as wine is tempered
with water, ſo let <hi>diſcretion</hi> temper
<hi>zeale.</hi> But I neede not bring water, to
quenche that fire which is out alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
I would rather I could ſay of you,
you are too zealous, as Paule tolde
the Athenians they were <hi>too ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 17. 22.</note>
But our ſickneſſe is not a hot
ſickneſſe, but a colde ſickneſſe; the
hotte bodie is diſtempered, but the
<pb facs="tcp:13811:5"/>
colde bodie is dead.</p>
            <p>Then I ſhewed you, howe <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
is quenched,</hi> as a man dooth
quench his reaſon with ouer much
wine: and therefore wee ſaye, when
the wine is in, the wit is out; becauſe
before hee ſeemes to haue reaſon,
and nowe hee ſeemes to haue none:
So our <hi>zeale,</hi> and our <hi>Faith,</hi> and our
<hi>loue,</hi> are quenched with ſinne. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vaine thought, and euery idle
worde, and euerie wicked deede, is
like ſo many droppes to <hi>quench the
Spirite</hi> of GOD. Some <hi>quench</hi> it
with the buſineſſe of this worlde:
ſome <hi>quench</hi> it with the luſtes of the
fleſh: Some <hi>quench</hi> it with the cares
of the minde: Some <hi>quench</hi> it with
long delaies: that is, not plying the
motion when it commeth, but croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the good thought with badde
thoughtes, and doing a thing when
the Spirite ſaith <hi>doe it not:</hi> as Acbab
went to battaile after hee had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with the Prophet: therefore
Paule ſaith;<note place="margin">Eph 4, 30.</note> 
               <hi>Grieue not the Spirite:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13811:5"/>
ſhewwing that the Spirite is often
grieued before it be quenched, and
this is principaly to bee remembred
that when a man beginnes to grieue
and checke, and perſecute the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
lightly hee neuer ceaſeth vntill
hee hath quenched it; that is, vntill
he ſeeme to haue no ſpirite at all, but
walketh like a lumpe of fleſh.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Quench not the Spirite,</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
<hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying:</hi> In
the ende of this Epiſtle, Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
like a Father which is come to
the ende of his life, who becauſe hee
hath but a while to ſpeake, heapeth
his leſſons together, which he would
haue his ſonnes remember when hee
is gone: ſo Paule, as though he were
ſet to giue good counſaile, and had
no leyſure to ſpeake that he woulde,
ſendeth the Theſſalonians a briefe of
his minde, which their meditation
ſhould after amplifie and expounde
vnto them: His firſt aduiſe is, <hi>quench
not the Spirite:</hi> that <hi>is,</hi> when a
good motion commeth, welcome it
<pb facs="tcp:13811:6"/>
like a friende, and croſſe it not with
thy luſtes: for luſtes are enemies to
the benefite of the Soule.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Admonition teacheth
how the firſt ſhould be kept, <hi>Despiſe
not</hi> prophecying, and <hi>the Spirite</hi> will
not <hi>quench,</hi> becauſe <hi>prophecying</hi> dooth
kindle it.</p>
            <p>The thirde Admonition teacheth
howe to make fruite of the ſecond,
<hi>Try the doctrines</hi> of them which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie,
&amp; thou ſhalt not beleeue er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
for trueth, but holde the beſt.</p>
            <p>The fourth Admonition is the
ſumme of all, and it commeth laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is longeſt in learning; that is,
<hi>Abſtaine from all apparance of euill.</hi>
This is the ſumme of al, for he which
can <hi>abſtaine</hi> not onely <hi>from euill,</hi> but
from the <hi>apparance of euill,</hi> is ſo perfect
a man, as can bee found in this ſinfull
life.</p>
            <p>Place all theſe together, and it is
as if Paule ſhould ſay, <hi>Quench not
the Spirite by despiſing of Prophecying,
neither despiſe Prophecying, becauſe all
<pb facs="tcp:13811:6"/>
doe not Prophecie alike;</hi> but rather
when you heare ſome preach one
way, and ſome an other; when you
ſee ſome follow him, and others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
him, doe you trye the doctrines
by the Scripturs,<note place="margin">Acts 17, 11.</note> as the men of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roea</hi>
did, and chooſe that which is
beſt, and ſoundeſt, and trueſt, hauing
alwaies ſuch an eye to the <hi>Trueth,</hi>
that you <hi>abſtaine from all apparance of
errour;</hi> ſo iealous the Holy Ghoſt
would haue vs of our <hi>faith,</hi> that wee
ſet no Article vpon our <hi>Religion,</hi> but
that which is an vndoubted truth; as
Moyſes did nothing in the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
but that which was ſhewed in the
patterne ſet downe before him.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of theſe Leſſons,
ſeemes to come of this; that there
were ſome among the Theſſalonians
as there bee among vs, which did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
all Religion, becauſe the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
did not agree, or becauſe the
liues of Profeſſors gaue ſome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
therefore Paule ſheweth that
there is no cauſe, why they ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:13811:7"/>
miſlike the Word for the Preacher;
or why they ſhoulde deſpiſe <hi>Religion</hi>
for the Profeſſour, becauſe the <hi>Word</hi>
&amp; the <hi>Religion</hi> is not theirs: for they
can no more bee polluted by them
than God. Then he concludeth, that
feeing it is neceſſarie, that there ſhall
be alwaies errours and hereſies, to
<hi>trye</hi> vs; we ſhould alſo <hi>trye</hi> them, and
thereby bee prouoked ſo much the
more from errour or hereſie, that we

this is the ſcope of theſe wordes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Despiſe not Prophecying.</hi> This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
is (as it were) the keeper of
the former: for by <hi>prophecying the
ſpirite</hi> is kindled, and without <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying,
the ſpirite</hi> is quenched; and
therefore after <hi>Quench not the ſpirite,</hi>
Paule ſayth, <hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying:</hi>
ſhewing, that as our ſin dooth <hi>quench
the ſpirite,</hi> ſo <hi>Prophecying</hi> doth kindle
it. This you may ſee in the Diſciples
that went to <hi>Emaus:</hi> of whome it is
ſayde, when Chriſt preached vnto
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13811:7"/>
them out of the Lawe and Prophets,
<hi>their Spirite was ſo kindled with his
prophecying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 24, 32,</note> 
               <hi>that theier heartes waxed
hot within them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This you may ſee againe in Saules
Meſſengers, which were ſent for
Dauid,<note place="margin">1 Sam 19, 20.</note> when they came among the
Prophets, and hearde them prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
their Spirite was ſo kindled, that
they coulde not chooſe but prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
alſo: in ſo much, that when Saule
came after himſelfe, and hearing
the Prophets, as they did, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
came vpon him likewiſe, and hee
prophecied too, where-vpon it was
ſaid:<note place="margin">1 Sam 19, 23. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Is</hi> Saul <hi>alſo among the Prophets?</hi>
This is no maruell that the Spirite of
man ſhoulde bee ſo kindled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued,
and refreſhed with the <hi>word,</hi>
for the <hi>word</hi> is called <hi>the foode of the
ſoule:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 5.</note> take away the worde from the
ſoule, and it hath no foode to eate,
as if you ſhould take foode from the
bodie, the bodie woulde pine: And
therefore Salomon ſaith, <hi>without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
the people perriſh:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.</note> that is, without
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13811:8"/>
out <hi>Prophecying</hi> the people famiſh.
Therfore, he which loueth his ſoule,
had not neede to <hi>despiſe Prophecying,</hi>
for if hee <hi>deſpiſe Prophecying,</hi> then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
he famiſheth his owne Soule, and
is guiltie of her death.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle might haue ſaid, <hi>Loue
Prophecying,</hi> or <hi>honour Prophecying:</hi>
But why dooth he forbid, to <hi>deſpiſe
Prophecying?</hi> Why did Chriſt ſay,
<hi>The poore receiue the Goſpell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 11, 5.</note> but to
ſhewe that the rich did contemne it?
Why dooth Paule ſay, <hi>I am not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the Gospell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 1, 16.</note> but to ſhewe that
manie are aſhamed of it? Euen ſo he
ſaith, <hi>deſpiſe not Prophecying</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the greateſt honour we giue
to Prophets, is not to deſpiſe them:
and the greateſt loue which we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the Worde, is not to loath it. If
wee doe not deſpiſe the Preachers,
then we thinke that we honor them
enough; and if we doe not loath the
Worde, then we thinke that we loue
it enough: therefore the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe not Prophecying,</hi> for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13811:8"/>
Prophecying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prophecying</hi> heere dooth ſignifie
Preaching,<note place="margin">Rom 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> as it dooth in <hi>Rom</hi> 1, 14.
Will you knowe why Preaching is
called <hi>Prophecying?</hi> To adde more
honour and renowne to the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of the Word; to make you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
them like Prophets, and then
Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat 10, 41.</note> you ſhall haue a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
rewarde: that is, not ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
as you giue, but ſuch a rewarde
as God giueth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if you marke, Paule ſayth
not <hi>Deſpiſe not</hi> Prophets, but <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying;</hi>
ſignifying, that from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Prophets, at laſt wee
come to <hi>deſpiſe Prophecying</hi> too, lyke
the Iewes, when they were offended
with the Prophet, charged him to
<hi>prophecie no more.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere 11, 21.</note> Therfore as Chriſt
warned his Diſciples, to heare the
Scribes and Phariſies,<note place="margin">Mat 23, 3.</note> although they
did not as they taught, ſo Paule war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Theſſalonians, that if any
Prophets among them, do not as they
teach, and therefore ſeeme worthie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13811:9"/>
to bee deſpiſed like the Scribes and
Phariſes: yet that they take heede,
that they doe not <hi>deſpiſe Prophecying,</hi>
for the Prophets.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Preachers are deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
before the worde bee deſpiſed;
therefore we will ſpeake firſt of their
contempt. Chriſt asked his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<hi>what they thought of him?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 16, 13.</note> So I
woulde aske you, what you thinke of
Preachers? Is he a contemptible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which bringeth the Embaſſage
of God?<note place="margin">2 Cor 5, 20,</note> which hath the name of an
Angell,<note place="margin">Reu 1 20,</note> and all his wordes are Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of life? is he a contemptible
perſon? Prophets are of ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with GOD, that it is ſayde:
<hi>God will doe nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amos 7, 3.</note> 
               <hi>before hee reueale
it vnto his Prophets:</hi> ſo Prophets are
as it were GODS Counſellers. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
<hi>Kinges, Prieſtes,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi>
were figures of Chriſt: all theſe
three were annointed with Oyle,<note place="margin">1 Kings 13, 1,</note> to
ſhewe that they had greater graces
than the reſt, but ſpecially the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
are called <hi>men of God,</hi> to ſhewe
<pb facs="tcp:13811:9"/>
that all which are of God, will make
much of Prophets for Gods ſake:
therefore,<note place="margin">1 Cor 14, 34.</note> women are forbidden to
take vppon them to prophecie, leaſt
that noble calling ſhoulde become
vile and deſpiſed, by ſuch vnskilfull
handlers of it. Therefore when the
Prophet Eliſha, would ſend for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman
the leaper, to come vnto him,
theſe were his words:<note place="margin">2 King 5, 8.</note> Naaman <hi>ſhall
knowe that there is a Prophet in Iſraell:</hi>
as though all the glorie of Iſraell
were chiefely in this, that <hi>they</hi> had
Prophets and <hi>other</hi> had none. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
when this Prophet was dead,
Ioaſh the King came vnto his corſe,
and wept ouer his face, and cryed:
<hi>O my Father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King 13, 14.</note> 
               <hi>my Father, the Charet of
Iſraell and horſemen of the ſame:</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that the Chariots and horſes, and
Souldiours doe not ſo ſafegard a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as the Prophets which teach it,
and pray for it. Howe ioyfull and
glad was Lydea, when ſhee coulde
drawe Paule and Silas to her houſe:
<hi>If you thinke me to be faithfull come to</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 16. 15.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:13811:10"/>
               <hi>my houſe:</hi> ſhewing, that neuer any
gueſts were ſo welcome to her houſe
before. Howe tender was the Shuna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite
ouer Eliſha, that ſhee built an
houſe to welcome him, and to keepe
him with her, thinkes all the places
in her houſe too bad for him, ſhee
built him a newe roome, and made
him ſtay.</p>
            <p>Howe much did the Galathians
make of Paule,<note place="margin">Gal 4, 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note> that hee ſaith, <hi>They
woulde pull out their owne eyes to doe

like a Prophet, and hath
hee bidde you deſpiſe them nowe,
which bad you to honour them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
No, Paule chargeth vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
our teachers, as hee was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himſelfe: ſaying, <hi>Hee which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
in the Word is worthy of double
honour:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim 5, 14.</note> That is, the preachers (after

the Ruler.</p>
            <p>Aaron and Moyſes were brethren.

the rodde did compell.</p>
            <p>As Paule ſheweth the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,
howe the Preachers of the

the Phillippians how to honor
their teachers,<note place="margin">Phil 2, 29.</note> ſaying: <hi>Receiue him in

themſelues to giue light to

               <note place="margin">Exo 13, 20.</note> becauſe they are like Moiſes,

               <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 14,</note> ſo they call you to

we make of <hi>prophecying?</hi> If we ſhould
loue our inſtructers, howe much
ſhould we loue inſtruction?</p>
            <p>Simeon keeping in the Temple
met with Chriſt,<note place="margin">Luke 2, 28.</note> ſo, many hearing the
Worde haue met with knowledge;
haue met with comfort; haue mette
with peace; haue met with ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but without the Word neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
was conuerted to God: therefore,
whenſoeuer the word is preached, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one may ſay to himſelfe, as the
Diſciples ſaide to the blinde man;
<hi>Be of good comfort,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mar 10, 49.</note> 
               <hi>he calleth thee:</hi> Be

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery man may ſay to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<hi>Beware the deuill calleth thee.</hi>
When the Prophets went from Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,
then ſworde, and famine, and
peſtilence, and all the plagues of
God rayned vpon them, euen as the

            <p>There be two trades in this lande,
without which the Realme can not
ſtand; and one is the Queenes ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours,
and the other is the Lordes
ſouldiours, and the Lordes ſouldiers
are hardly vſed, like the Queenes
ſouldiers; for from the Marchant to
the Porter, no calling is ſo deſpiſed,
ſo contemned, ſo deryded, that they
may beg for their ſeruice: for their
liuing is turned to an almes; one
ſaith, Moyſes is <hi>quis:</hi> that is, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate

<hi>quaſi quis:</hi> that is, the Miniſter is no

like him. <hi>Receiue a Prophet in the

Prophet in the name of an enemie,
<pb facs="tcp:13811:12"/>
as Achab receiued Eliah, <hi>Art thou

               <note place="margin">1 King 21, 20.</note> If Paule had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

ſhoulde haue ſeene, not onely deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers
of the Prophets, but mockers of

of them; not only ſlaunderers,
but hunters, biters, and ſmiters of

ſweetly,</hi> let his ſong be neuer ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
yet many Adders are readie to

their Seruants beggars. Once Paule
ſaide to Timothie,<note place="margin">1 Tim 4, 12.</note> 
               <hi>Let no man despiſe

with great contempt.</p>
            <p>Howe is the <hi>double honour</hi> turned

Dooth not the contempt of

            <p>When the Meſſengers which were

            </p>
            <p>The meaning of this Parable is
this, that when the Preachers and

<pb facs="tcp:13811:13"/>
his Church for fruits, are abuſed and
perſecuted, or contemned and ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

Theerfore what may thoſe feare

Ieruſalem is left without

            <p>The time came when Saul ſought

hee had deſpiſed his Prophets

a Prophet was amongſt vs, but

are wee not come from deſpiſing of

            <p>The beaſtes came to the Arke to<note place="margin">Gen 7. 9.</note>

come to the Church to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
But we maye crye vnto them

mocked him for it, and thought that
hee knewe a better way than that

<pb facs="tcp:13811:14"/>
But they muſt remember that Paule

               <hi>GOD hath choſen the fooliſh to

thinke themſelues wiſe, let them
thinke vs thoſe fooles whome God

firſt in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> prieſts,<note place="margin">1 King 15. 26.</note> it is ſaid that
<hi>Jeroboam made Iſraell to ſinne,</hi> that is,
<pb facs="tcp:13811:15"/>
               <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made <hi>Iſraell</hi> to contemne
Religion, becauſe <hi>hee made Prieſtes of
the baſeſt of the people:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 King 13, 33.</note> therefore, they
which make Prieſtes like Ieroboams
Prieſtes, make the people contemne
the Prieſts and Religion too.</p>
            <p>Why might none carrie the Arke

none ſhoulde meddle with the

they which are fit, leaſt they make it

            <p>The ſecond thing which makes
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Prophecying despiſed,</hi> is,
the rudenes and negligence of them,
which are able to doe well in theyr

It is ſaide of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam 2, 17.</note> that

ſo, many by their ſlubbering of

doe make men thinke that
there is no more wiſedome in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13811:15"/>
Worde of GOD, than they ſhewe

vnder the name of the ſimple
kinde of teaching, like thee Papiſts
Prieſtes, which make <hi>Ignoraunce</hi> the

preach ſimply, is not to preach rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
nor vnlearnedly, nor confuſedly;
but to preach plainely, and perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
that the ſimplyeſt that dooth
hear, may vnderſtand what is taught,
as if hee did heare his name. But if
you will knowe what makes many
Preachers, preach ſo barely, and looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſimply? It is your owne ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
which makes them thinke,
that if they go on, and ſay ſomething,
all is one, and no fault will be founde,
becauſe you are not to iudge in nor
out: and ſo, becauſe wee giue no
attendaunce to doctrine as Paule
teacheth vs.<note place="margin">Math 4.</note> Yea, it is almoſt come to

In the 48. of Ieremie, there is a curſe
vpon them which doe the buſines of

Theſe would not haue Prophets and
prophecying deſpiſed, and yet they
are meanes to make both deſpiſed
themſelues.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing which makes Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

diuerſitie of minds, while one holds
one way, and an other an other way,
ſome leaue all and will bee of no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
vntill both parties agree; as if
a patient ſhould pine himſelfe &amp; eat
no meate at all, becauſe one Phiſitian

and an other ſayth, that that meate
wil hurt him: theſe are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the three

That is, though wee bring him word

This made Chriſt warne his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to beware of the leauen of the
Phariſies,<note place="margin">Mar 8, 25.</note> that is, of their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
This made Iohn ſay, <hi>Trie

               <note place="margin">1 Iohn 4, 1.</note> and therefore wee reade
in the 17. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> howe the men

doctrine before they had tried it,<note place="margin">Acts 17, 11,</note> and
how did they trye it? It is ſayde that

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:13811:17"/>
way which Paul would teach you to
trye other, euen as he was tryed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:
wherby you may ſee, that if you

bee able to <hi>trie all doctrines,</hi> for <hi>the

ſo is the Scripture to decide all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions;
euery doubt muſt come to the
worde, and all controuerſies muſt be
ended at this tribunall: the Scripture
muſt ſpeake, which is right, and
which is wrong: which is truth, and
which is error: and all tongues muſt
keepe ſilence to heare it. So GOD
hath appointed that the iudge of
our controuerſies, which he ſaith in
the 12. of Iohn,<note place="margin">Iohn 12. 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> 
               <hi>ſhall iudge vs in the laſt

            </p>
            <p>Heere a man may aske, if it be ſo,
that God would haue vs trye all our
Religion by the Scripture, and not
by Fathers, nor by Doctors, nor by
Counſels, nor by Angell, nor by
Pope: how then doe the Papiſts ſay,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:13811:18"/>
we muſt beleeue as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth,
and neuer looke into the
Scripture whether our teachers ſaye
as God ſaith, but take it vpon theyr
credite, as a blinde man eateth his
meate: a man tryeth his horſe which
muſt beare him, and ſhall he not trye
his faith which muſt ſaue him?</p>
            <p>Peter ſaith: <hi>Let euerie one bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to giue a reaſon of his faith.</hi> Is this a
reaſon to ſaye, I beleeue ſo, becauſe
Rome beleeueth ſo; or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Worde of GOD dooth
teach me ſo? It will not bee an auail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
aunſwere for them which dye
in hereſie, ſuperſtition, or blindneſſe,
to ſaye, the Prieſtes taught vs ſo: no
more than it ſerued the firſt woman

ſo: for GOD ſaith, <hi>Bee not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,</hi>
neither by Serpent, nor by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
nor by Angell: Therefore I
conclude with the Apoſtle Paule,
<hi>Despiſe not Prophecying,</hi> leaſt the
Goſpell bee taken away from you;
and yet <hi>trie Prophecying,</hi> leaſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13811:18"/>
errour for trueth, and mens
dreames for doctrine.</p>
            <p>As wee are to trye doctrines, ſo
Paule woulde haue vs to <hi>trie our
thoughts,</hi> and <hi>ſpeeches,</hi> and our <hi>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi>
therefore hee ſayth, <hi>Trye all
thinges.</hi> Hee dooth not bid vs take a
taſte of all ſinnes and vanities, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
did, to trye them, for they are
tryed alreadie: but that we ſhoulde
ſet the Worde of GOD alway be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vs like a rule, and beleeue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but that alone which it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
loue nothing but that which it
preſcribeth, hate nothing but that
which it forbiddeth, and doe nothing
but that which it commaundeth:
and then wee <hi>Trie all thinges</hi> by the
<hi>Worde of GOD.</hi> As the <hi>Eunuch</hi>
ſayde,<note place="margin">Acts 8. 31.</note> 
               <hi>Howe ſhoulde I vnderſtande
without an Interpreter?</hi> ſo thou maiſt
ſay, howe ſhall I <hi>trie</hi> without the
<hi>Worde,</hi> which is, <hi>the touchſtone of good
and euill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe, when wee haue tryed by
the Worde of God, which is trueth,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13811:19"/>
and which is errour: which is light,
and which is darknes: what ſhoulde
we doe then? <hi>Keepe that which is beſt:</hi>
That is, ſtay at the trueth, ſtay at the
light, as the wiſe men that followed
the conduction of the bright ſhining
ſtarre from the Eaſt,<note place="margin">Math 2.</note> ſtayed when
they came to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We muſt keepe and holde faſt
the trueth, euen as a man gripeth a
thing ſtrongly with both his hands:
that is, defend it with thy tongue:
maintaine it with thy purſe: further
it with thy labour, in daunger, and
trouble, and loſſe, and diſpleaſure:
come life, come death; think alwaies,
as Chriſt did ſeale the trueth of his
promiſe with his blood moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſo thou muſt ſeale the trueth of
thy profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thy deereſt blood;
elſe is it apparant thou dooſt not
keepe it but let it goe. Well therfore
dooth Paul put <hi>trye</hi> before <hi>chooſe;</hi> for
he which in choiſe of all things firſt
tryeth, may after his tryall chooſe the
beſt. But hee which chooſeth before
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13811:19"/>
he trye, takes oftentimes the worſt
ſooner than he dooth the beſt.</p>
            <p>And in this was exceedingly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
the notable deceit of ſathan
by his inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts the popiſh Prieſts
in the dayes of ignorance; who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the people ſhould take ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition
before Religion, would neuer
let them haue <hi>the touchſtone of the
Word to trye</hi> their doctrines, but kept
them from the Scripture, and lockt
it vp from their vnderſtanding, in an
vnknowne tongue, which they could
not skill of, leaſt they ſhoulde trye
their teaching,<note place="margin">Acts 17,</note> as the men of <hi>Beroea</hi>
tryed the wholſome doctrine of S.
Paule: and by their ſleights making
all their Religion a craft, as men call
their trades; for in no deceiuable
trade (howe full of falſhood ſoeuer)
could more deceit be harboured than
in theirs. Therefore as Ioſiah reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in his time, that <hi>the booke of GOD
was ſound againe:</hi> ſo we may reioyce
in theſe dayes, that the booke of God
is found againe; for when the people
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13811:20"/>
might not read it nor heare it, it was
all one to them, as if they had (for ſo
long time) vtterly loſt it.</p>
            <p>After this precept of the Apoſtle,
<hi>Trye all things and keepe the beſt:</hi> hee
addeth: <hi>Abſtaine from all appearance
of euill:</hi> as if hee ſhoulde ſay, that is
like to bee beſt, which is ſo farre
deuided from euill, that it hath not
ſo much as the <hi>appearance of euill:</hi>
and that is like to bee trueth, which
is ſo farre from errour, that it hath
not the ſhewe of errour: whereby
hee ſheweth, that nothing ſhould
bee brought into the Church, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in matters of faith and doctrine
to our Religion, but that which is
agreeable and conſonant to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
trueth, and vtterly without
ſuſpicion of errour. It is not inough
to bee perſwaded of our faith, but
wee muſt be aſſured of it; for our
Religion is not built vppon waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and inconſtant doubtes, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
moſt aſſured &amp; certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13811:20"/>
Heere we may maruaile why Paul
biddeth vs, <hi>Abſtaine from all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of euill,</hi> becauſe it is apparant,
that ſinne, and hereſie, and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are hypocrites: and common
experience approoueth, that ſinne
hath the appearance of vertue, &amp; he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
hath the appearance of Trueth,
&amp; Superſtition hath the appearance
of Religion: but let our wonder
heerein be thus aunſwered. By this,
the Apoſtle dooth note, that there is
no ſinne, nor hereſie, nor ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but if the viſour or vaile bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued,
or rather taken away from
it, which maketh it ſeeme vertue, or
trueth, or Religion, it will appeare
in the right nature to be a ſinne, and
hereſie, and ſuperſtition, though at
the firſt ſight, the maske or viſour
doe make it ſeeme none: becauſe it
couers the euill, like a painted Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
vpon rotten bones.</p>
            <p>Heereby we are taught, prudently
to iudge of all thinges as they are,
and not as in outward appearance
<pb facs="tcp:13811:21"/>
they ſeeme to bee; and as wee drawe
aſide the curtaine, before we beholde
the picture: ſo we muſt remooue (to
auoyde our owne preiudice) all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and ſurmiſes, and then behold
the thing naked as it is, if wee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to knowe it indeede: for trueth
needes no collours to make it glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
            <p>Heere I might admoniſh them
which ſeperate themſelues from our
Church, in ſuch manner as S. Paule
admoniſheth all men, when he ſaith:
<hi>Examine whether you be in the faith;</hi>
ſo, examine whether you haue the
ſhewe of errour. Hath it not the
ſhewe of errour, to broach a Religion
which was neuer hearde of before
theſe late yeeres?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour,
to retaine an errour, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
himſelfe hath voluntarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted;
euen as yee would ſucke vp
with greedines the dogs vomite?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
affirme that thoſe Preachers may in
<pb facs="tcp:13811:21"/>
no wiſe be hearde, which (by their
owne confeſſions) haue firſt conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and painfully brought them to
the knowledge of God, and daylie
conuerteth others.</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
affirme, that the Lordes Prayer may
not bee vſed as a lawfull Prayer:
which for the excellencie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
peticion, and without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie
(for any thing that wee or
they can read) was ſo vſed from the
beginning?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
ſay, that no man may vſe any ſet prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
ſeing there be many Prayers, and
Pſalmes, and bleſſings, and thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuings
in the Scripture, which were
vſed in that fourme.</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
affirme, that wee haue no Church,
and yet to graunt that our Martyrs
which dyed in the bloody perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of tyrannous poperie, were true
members of the Catholike Church?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
<pb facs="tcp:13811:22"/>
affirme, that two or three may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
all the reſt without a
Miniſterie, ſeeing the Paſtor is the
mouth of the Church?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour,
to affirme, that the Church of Chriſt
was neuer inuiſible before this age,
and that it is ſuch a ſmall flocke, as
their number is: and that it hath ſet
foote no where but in England?</p>
            <p>Hath it not the ſhewe of errour, to
holde that for ſound and good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which is altered euerie day; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and detracting, as though a man
ſhould make a Religion of his owne
inuentions, changing and altering ſo
faſt as newe conceits come into his
idle braine?</p>
            <p>Let them thinke that Paule ſaith
vnto them:<note place="margin">Rom 12, 3,</note> 
               <hi>Be wiſe vnto ſobrietie,</hi>
and ſuſpect that conſtruction which
your ſelues deuiſed: for Salomon
ſaith,<note place="margin">Pro, 4, 27.</note> 
               <hi>There is an errour vppon the
right hande as well as vpon the left,</hi>
that is, as I may call it: The zealous
errour. And if this be not that errour
<pb facs="tcp:13811:22"/>
of zeale, I knowe none at all in this
lande.</p>
            <p>Yet ſhall not I ſay, that wee haue
not the ſhewe of euill too? Naye, I
would that we were but in the ſhewe
thereof. I may not call euill good, no
more than I may call good euill, and
therefore let vs pull the Beame out
of our owne eyes, as we woulde pull
out the moate out of other mens. Let
vs amend our ſinnes, and then boldly
reprooue others.</p>
            <p>If Paule woulde haue vs abſtaine
from euerie appearance of euill, ſure
he would haue vs abſtaine frome he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
and hypocriſie. and not to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
with the bleſſings of peace, and
then ſaye: it was neuer merry world
ſince this newe Religion came vp;
not to pretende conſcience in not
comming to Church, and haue no
conſcience in oppreſſing the poore,
and vndooing the Fatherleſſe and
widdowes.</p>
            <p>Antechriſt and all his ſhauelings,
(thankes bee to GOD) are meetly
<pb facs="tcp:13811:23"/>
well rooted out from amongſt vs, yet
his taile (I feare me) remaines behind
in the hearts of a number, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
amongſt vs like men of another
Nation,<note place="margin">Num. 33, 55,</note> are an ill ſauour vnto vs, as
the remnant of the Cananites were
vnto the Iewes. GOD charged his
people of Iſraell, to roote out all the
inhabitants of Canaan; yet they
ſpared ſome, as Saul (diſobaying the
voice of the Prophet) ſpared Agag,
but that remnant hindered their
peace, and neuer ſuffered them to
be in quiet; for they were goades in
their ſides, &amp; prickes in their eyes: it
is with vs likewiſe to bee feared, that
the remnant of Canaan, which nowe
contemne Prophets, will be a meane
to pull downe <hi>Prophecying.</hi> But let
vs apply this doctrine of the Apoſtle
to the kindling of the Spirite in all
feruencie of zeale, and mildeneſſe of
loue: not deferring to imbrace grace
when it is offered, leaſt by delay the

and ſoundeſt, and not to be mooued:
