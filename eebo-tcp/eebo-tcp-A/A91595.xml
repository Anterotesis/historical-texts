            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Querees, to find out who it is that
holds out in Armes againſt the State of <hi>England.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>SEing the King is our priſoner, as in the Scottiſh Army, who by contract are our ſervants
and our Army, and therefore not to do what they liſt, but what we command them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they receive pay from us as meer mercinaries, and ſerve not freely as brethren; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if our State repreſentative, the choſen Commons of England aſſembled in Parliament,
ſhall give Order to the State of Scotland for the King preſently to disband all his Forces in
England, Ireland or elſe-where, and to deliver up all Townes and Garriſons unto our States
hand,—Quere; I ſay if it be not done thereupon, if wee may not conclude, that it is the Scots
hold up Armes againſt out State, for the King being our Priſoner, and in their power (our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants)
hath no power, but muſt do as they will, and they will do as they liſt for him.</p>
            <p>For if they of themſelves can proſtrate their owne oppoſite armes of Montroſſe, &amp;c.—and
put his name thereto for a cullour, as if done by him, or inforce him to doe it, to cullour their
doing, why not the ſame forme upon order from our State aforeſaid,—Why, oh Engliſh
States, is not this aſſayd, to diſcover who it is that holds up armes againſt you?—for what
power hath one man that is in the power of others? And if our State will not give order for
the ſame what may we not conclude there of? muſt the lives and eſtates of multitudes of men
be ſacrificed to the wilfulneſſe of any? But our State performing their parts, we ſhall apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſee where it reſts, for how can the King hinder what they pleaſe to doe?</p>
            <p>Do not theſe that are called the French and Spaniſh States, what them pleaſe—&amp; put—or their King muſt put their names thereto, to culour it, that the State may not bee ſeene in
it, but it may paſſe as if their Kings act, not theirs—Can any be ſo ſimple to think their Kings
may or can rule a State—which is as much as the wiſeſt State can doe—In ſhort it is the
States doe all, and ſo doe the Scot, and ſo ought our State—and not let the weale, ſafety,
happineſſe, proſperitie and being of a Kingdome or Kingdomes, and Millions of lives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
lye at the will, or the wilfulneſſe, folly, or madneſſe of one man, whom they call their
King, though the Parliament of England in their late letter to him when hee was at Oxford,
doe tell him plainly, that he is guilty of all the innocent blood which hath beene now ſhed
in all the three Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Oh therefore, let not the world jeer us, that our priſoner can uſe his keepers as his priſoners,
&amp;c.—Who hath ſtood it out in open Hoſtility as long as poſſible he could, againſt his Earthly
Soveraigne, Lord, King and Creator, the ſtate Vniverſall; Whoſe legall and formall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative,
the Parliament, (he hath unnaturally, wickedly, unjuſtly, and irrationally) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Traytors and Rebels for doing their duty in endeavouring the preſervation of thoſe
that truſted them, from the ruine and diſtruction endeavoured and intended to them by him,
their rebellious ſervant.</p>
            <p>How can it be properly ſaid, that the Engliſh Creator, the State of England, can commit
Treaſon againſt it's own meere creature, the King? If it be treaſon to aſſiſt the King with men
monies, armes and horſes in this his unnaturall Warre and Rebellion againſt the Parliament
and people of England, as the Parliament hath often declared, then is it not the height of
Treaſon for any of the Parliaments Armies privately to treat with him, and to receive him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Army, and there protect him (from thoſe who requite him and have right to him)
and to diſpoſe of him, yea, and afford him elbow room and libertie to ſend Meſſages and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſages
to Denmark, Holland, France, Spain and Ireland, or whether he pleaſeth, that ſo he
may lay new deſignes for the utter ſubverſion and deſtruction of the State and Kingdome:
Oh the hght of—&amp;c. no longer to be put up, borne, or ſuffered by truſtees that deſire to
approve themſelves faithfull to their truſters.</p>
