         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE condition of thoſe in the
Text, both for what they had
been once, and for what they
now were, that is, for their <hi>ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>returning</hi> again, looks ſo
like our caſe of late, (who, if ever any, had err'd
and ſtray'd from all the ways of duty both to
God and man, but are now happily returned
to the Shepherds and Biſhops of our Souls)
you may perhaps imagine this Text to be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
of purpoſe to purſue thoſe two <hi>Blown Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49996:4"/>
And therefore before I proceed farther, it
will be neceſſary to deliver you from thoſe
thoughts, and perhaps that fear. For though the
miſchiefs in the one, and Bleſſings in the other
be ſuch, as deſerve never to be forgotten; yet
poſſibly may not endure a perpetual importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Remembrancer.</p>
                  <p>And the truth is, the very words and phraſe
of the text, which only at the firſt bluſh carries
us upon thoſe thoughts, will leave us, if we
look a little nearer to them. For the Straying
here will prove to be of another kind, and
the Return will be found to be to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Biſhop. The ſtraying here was of ſuch as
had err'd like <hi>Sheep,</hi> whereas ours had little or
nothing of the Sheep in it, ſave the Sheeps
clothing; for dreſſ'd up they were with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſes
as ſoft as wool, <hi>Gods glory, Purity</hi> of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
Chriſtian liberty,</hi> nothing worſe then theſe,
and ſo indeed they err'd like Sheep, as if they
had been ſuch; but the truth is, it was liker
the ranging of Wolves, tearing and devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then the ſtraying of weak and ſilly Sheep.
And for the returning likewiſe here, though
it was to a Biſhop, yet I dare not be ſo bold
with him that bears that name in the text,
directly to apply it to our Biſhops, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
our return to this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49996:4"/>
The Biſhop here was no doubt our bleſſed
<hi>Lord</hi> and Saviour, whom God himſelf had
conſecrated and ordained to that office;
but our Biſhops are not otherwiſe concerned
here then as they can make their title from
and under him; but if that may be done
hereafter, I truſt you will not be againſt it.
In the mean time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if there were no more in
it, me thinks this ſhould be enough to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to the name of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
which our Saviour himſelf hath vouchſafed
to take upon him. But having laid aſide that
argument, which the words at firſt ſight
ſeem'd to offer, I beſpeak your attention to
one of a more common intereſt, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
all that would be Chriſtians, whoſe
character it is. Who from the ways of ſin
and error, are return'd to the faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who to reduce
us from thoſe ways hath taken upon him to
be our Shepherd and Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The main point is,</hi> That God of his mercy
complying with the neceſsities and infirmities of nature,
hath erected an <hi>Office</hi> of truſt and confidence in
his Church, under the quality of a Shepherd and
Biſhop, to direct and guide us, who otherwiſe would
erre and ſtray like ſheep, and ſo be loſt for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49996:5"/>
THe particulars incident to this are, <hi>firſt.</hi>
The <hi>neceſsity</hi> of it, impli'd in our <hi>natural
condition,</hi> who like Sheep are of themſelves apt
to erre and go aſtray. 2. The <hi>accommodation</hi> we
have for it. For what ſhould they do which
are out of the way, but return? and to
whom ſhould Sheep return but to a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd?
and loſt Sheep, but to him that came
<hi>to ſeek and ſave that which was loſt?</hi> and where
ſhould they find ſo ſafe and ſure a retreat,
as in him who purchas'd them with his own
blood? All theſe are accompliſhed in our
bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whom we ſhall
conſider, firſt in his <hi>office</hi> of Shepherd or
Biſhop; then in his Flock or <hi>Dioceſs;</hi> the
Souls of men. <hi>We are returned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> THe firſt thing we meet with in the text,
is our <hi>natural condition.</hi> That we were
as Sheep that had gone aſtray. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of this is the firſt thing we meet with
in our Liturgy. <hi>We have erred and ſtray'd like
loſt Sheep.</hi> And though it were fit and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
it ſhould be there, for, ſure I am,
we never err'd worſe then ſince we laid that
by; yet here we look upon it in another relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and uſe; it is the firſt ſtone to be laid in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49996:5"/>
this building, in the erection of the office of
a Shepherd and Biſhop. The infirmities of
the Sheep are the ground of the neceſſity
of a Shepherd.</p>
                  <p>But now that while we are ſpeaking of our
errors, we do not commit one, we muſt
know, firſt what <hi>kind</hi> of erring this is, and
then how we fell into the fatal neceſſity of it.
What it is, the Biſhop that muſt lead us out
of it, will tell us; for he is the Biſhop of our
ſouls: and therefore our Straying here muſt
be that of the Soul. For though our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
infirmities do expoſe us to error in many
things elſe, yea almoſt in all other things,
even thoſe that are within the reach of ſenſe
and reaſon: there is not any thing in <hi>Nature,</hi>
in <hi>Art,</hi> in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> though commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
for truth, which of late time is not
charged with error, and it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
not without cauſe; yet without any
great regard here, if the Sould be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>
                  <p>Now if we be ſo liable to error in the things
of this life, where both the end and the way
to them are within the compaſs of the eye,
in which we erre, as it were, in our own
Countrey, where we are bred and born; we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49996:6"/>
muſt certainly loſe our way, where we
are ſtrangers, being Citizens of another
Countrey, as thoſe bleſſed Saints, who beſt
knew the ways of the ſoul, confeſſed, that
they were <hi>ſtrangers and pilgrims</hi> here. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.
14. And <hi>they which ſay ſo, ſhew plainly that
they ſeek a Countrey,</hi> and <hi>that a better, that is,
a heavenly,</hi> where <hi>God hath prepared for them
a City.</hi> They muſt needs be diſappointed
that ſeek for Heaven upon earth, where
there is nothing ſitted and proportion'd to
the Soul, either for the <hi>nature</hi> or the <hi>deſires</hi>
of it. The Soul is immortal, and cannot
be provided for, where all things are liable
to change and mortality; for when it ſhall
ſurvive them, it will be at a loſs, till it find
a Countrey like it ſelf, that is everlaſting and
immortal.</p>
                  <p>And as the <hi>nature,</hi> ſo the <hi>deſires</hi> of the
Soul are unſatisfied here; the eye is not
ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the ear with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor the underſtanding with knowledg,
nor the heart with the beſt and choiceſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of it. We are ſoon wearied and tir'd
with what we have, and are as thirſty of that
we have not. In our plenty as craving, as
others in their greateſt wants. The goods of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49996:6"/>
this world are Hydropick all, <hi>quo plus bibuntar
plus ſitiuntur.</hi> They that have the greateſt
ſhare and portion in them, of Wealth, of
Honour, of Power, do not ſleep the better,
nor are their bodies leſs comber'd with diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
nor their minds freer from vexations and
troubles. And therefore as the Saints I
nam'd before, did by what they willingly
ſuffer'd here, ſhew plainly that they ſought
another Countrey; ſo by this is ſhewn as
plainly, that they had cauſe to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Now here lies the fatal neceſſity of erring,
they ſeek a Countrey and City that is inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and unknown to nature, either what the
<hi>ſtate</hi> of that Countrey is, or by what <hi>laws</hi>
the Citizens thereof are to be govern'd. And
when we walk in the dark it is not ſtrange
we ſhould loſe our way.</p>
                  <p>A chief part of that way lies, <hi>firſt</hi> in the
knowledg and <hi>worſhip</hi> of that God, who
had prepar'd for them a City, by what Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
Rites and Ceremonies he will be
ſerv'd. How much of that may be had by
<hi>nature,</hi> we learn by thoſe, who were moſt
likely to know, but did not, who were the

Lord Jeſus Chriſt, a perſon every way fitted
for the purpoſe, both for his skill, and good
will; He knew beſt the Heavenly Countrey,
whither we are going, and the way to it; for
he came from thence, from the boſom of
his Father. And for his good will to his own,
we cannot doubt they are the Sheep which
he had purchaſed with his blood, and by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49996:8"/>
that had a juſt title to govern in what Lordly
way of Secular domination he pleaſed; yet
choſe that eaſie gentle way as Shepherds uſe
to lead their Sheep. And ſuch he profeſſed
himſelf to be.<note place="margin">John 10. 11</note> 
                     <hi>I am the good Shepherd: the
good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep,</hi> and He
made it good in every point while he was
upon earth; He went about doing good,
preaching the Goſpel, healing the diſeaſes of
the Sheep, forgiving their ſins, till he came
to the laſt and hardeſt work of a good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd,
He laid down his life for his Sheep.</p>
                  <p>Yet his Paſtoral care died not with him.
As he was a Prieſt for ever; ſo he was a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
for ever; for after he had in perſon aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into Heaven, he took care for his flock that
he left behind Him, that they might not be as
Sheep without a Shepherd. And from
thence <hi>gave gifts unto men, ſome Apoſtles, ſome

S. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he judg'd the inceſtuous

                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:49996:9"/>
To the Apoſtles it may be all this was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
but not therefore to all other Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
after. Yes, to all that can rightly claim
from Him.<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20</note> His promiſe was to be with
them to the end of the world, that is, longer
then any Apoſtle could live. I am ſure the
neceſſities of the Sheep will be the ſame for
ever; for Sheep we ſhall be ſtill whereſoever
we are. When God diſtributed to the
Church the ſeveral parts of the Paſtoral
charge,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Paſtors
and Teachers,</hi> he adds, that it was, <hi>ad conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mationem
Sanctorum, &amp; adificationem corporis
Chriſti;</hi> that is, ſo long as there ſhould be
Saints to be perfected, and ſo long as Chriſt
ſhould have a Church, a body upon earth,
and that is ſo long as there ſhould be Sheep
Chriſt had provided there ſhould be Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
And theſe he hath taken to that near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and conjunction, that the obedience or
contempt done to them, he takes it as done
to himſelf. <hi>Qui vos audit me audit, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The benefits and advantages we have by
this are many; firſt, it is an <hi>honour</hi> and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the Shepherds, that the work
they do is Chriſts, who will bear them out
in what they do according to their duty,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49996:10"/>
and reward them for what they ſuffer for it.</p>
                  <p>2. It removes all <hi>diſcouragement</hi> from the
Sheep, that make a ſtand at the infirmities
and frailities of their Shepherds, that they
look through and beyond all them at the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Chriſt under whom they ſerve.</p>
                  <p>3. Another great benefit it is, that in all
doubtful and <hi>difficult</hi> caſes we may ſecure our
ſelves upon the conduct of Chriſt in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
For if poſſibly men ſhould be miſled
by them into error, when in ſimplicity of
heart, not knowing any thing to the contrary,
they ſhall ſubmit to them; I dare promiſe
them at leaſt a favourable hearing from him
that commanded the obedience.</p>
                  <p>But I dare not, nor can ſay that for all
Shepherds; for every congregational herd
hath their Shepherd too; but ſuch as have no
part in that power, which is derived from
Chriſt and his miſſion; that gave it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the Apoſtles only.<note place="margin">Joh. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Sicut miſit me
Pater, ſic, &amp;c.</hi> And all others that have it
muſt receive it from them, or from ſuch as
derive it from them by ſucceſſion. It is but
reaſon that Chriſt ſhould have the choice of
his own Miniſters. The Sheep that belong
to thoſe other Shepherds, can plead nothing
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49996:10"/>
for their obedience to them.<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17</note> S. <hi>PAULS
obedite praepoſitis,</hi> belongs not to them, they
obey not thoſe that are ſet over them, but
either thoſe that ſet themſelves over the flock,
or the flock themſelves ſet them, and that not
of neceſſity, which ſome vainly plead for
them; but as neceſſary, profeſſing there is
no lawful calling for a Miniſter, <hi>quem non miſit
populus,</hi> where the Shepherd is not choſen by
the Sheep. If theſe fall into an error by the
miſguidance of their Shepherds, they are in
a ſad and worſe condition, which admits no
plea of excuſe or extenuation from the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd.
They muſt bear their own faults, and
the miſguiding of the Shepherds, which they
make their own by chooſing them. In a
word, the favour that Chriſt doth is to his
own, not the peoples Shepherds.</p>
                  <p>THe next thing that falls into our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
is our <hi>Duty.</hi> To return to
Chriſt the Shepherd and Biſhop of our Souls.
And that is to ſubmit our ſelves to be led and
guided by him. To turn to Chriſt is in effect
to turn Chriſtian. We are no leſs concerned
here. And that muſt be in two reſpects:
in his <hi>office</hi> of Shepherd and Biſhop, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49996:11"/>
in the <hi>execution</hi> of it by Shepherds and Biſhops.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> For firſt, we can not be ſaid to return to
him as a Shepherd, if we refuſe him in any
part of his office. <hi>The good Sheep</hi> ſaith our
Saviour <hi>John</hi> 10.<note place="margin">Joh. 10. 27.</note> 27. <hi>hear the voice of the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
and they follow him.</hi> If they turn their
ears only to him, and hear him, and not follow
him, they turn ſhort, for follow him they
muſt through all the parts of his office. 'Tis
ſo with us, who for the moſt part like nothing
in the Shepherd but his pipe, and a pleaſant
tune. His rod and his ſtaffe we can ſpare.
The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribes us right, <hi>chap.</hi> 33.
an old humour it ſeems it was.<note place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>They come unto

us down as the Lords people to hear his word.
But what follows in the next verſe?<note place="margin">Verſe 32.</note> 
                     <hi>And loe
thou art unto them as a very lovely ſong of one that
hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for they hear thy words, but do them not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And what will come of this at the laſt, our
Saviour tells us in the Parable, where ſome
had the boldneſs to plead for their entrance,
that they had <hi>eat and drunk in his preſence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 26</note> and
had <hi>heard him in their ſtreets. Citizens</hi> it ſeems
they were by the <hi>ſtreets,</hi> and by their <hi>devotions,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49996:11"/>
a <hi>Sermon and a Dinner,</hi> they eat with him,
and they heard him. But what came of
it? by hearing him 'tis like they knew him
well; for all that, he tells them plainly, He
knew not them. If the Sheep wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but knowledg, I ſhould pardon them
if they deſired nothing of the Shepherd but
a Sermon. But this is not that which I prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
intended here.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> That our turning to Chriſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
be in the full execution of his office, as in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſo by commiſſion. Princes, as well they
may, think themſelves contemned in their
Embaſſadors and Miniſters. And ſo doth
our Saviour for his Shepherds, who are his
Miniſters and Embaſſadors too. <hi>Qui vos ſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
me ſpernit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall not incloſe this power or favour to
Biſhops only, becauſe I find that name in the
text; but lay it in common to all ſuch to whom
Chriſt hath committed under him the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church and the cure of Souls;
ſo as <hi>Presbyterians</hi> may have a ſhare here, when
they can prove their Ordination and Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>This part of our duty to obey Chriſt in his
Miniſters is with many of very hard digeſtion,
who not regarding the <hi>neceſsity</hi> there is of it,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49996:12"/>
nor the <hi>benefit</hi> we have by it, nor the <hi>authority</hi>
and commiſſion we have for it, nor the <hi>gentle</hi>
conduct we have in it, lay it aſide as a thing
of no uſe, and that God hath provided other
means to lead us many and more certain then
any Shepherds can be. We have firſt our
own <hi>Reaſon</hi> to lead us. 2. We have <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
a ſurer guide then that. 3. We have the
<hi>Spirit</hi> beſides,<note place="margin">Joh. 16. 13.</note> and that <hi>will lead us into all truth.</hi>
Laſtly, we have our own <hi>Conſciences,</hi> which
in the commiſſion of Leading is of the <hi>Quorum,</hi>
nothing can be done without it.</p>
                  <p>We cannot deny but that all theſe have a
part and ſhare in the guiding of our ſouls.
But as no one of them doth exclude or bar
the other; ſo nor do all of them the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds.
For allowing to every of theſe that
which is peculiar to them, there will be ſtill
found ſomething to remain, which is proper
for the Shepherds to do.</p>
                  <p>I am now, I confeſs, in a diſcourſe not ſo
ſmooth and eaſie as beſt befits popular Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons;
yet becauſe many whom it concerns
to weaken the hands and power of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governors,
do with their importunate cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
fill the Pulpit, you will be pleaſed to
allow of a ſhort Anſwer from thence too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49996:12"/>
AND <hi>firſt</hi> for REASON; It is not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
to be denied, that it ought to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
even in matters of Religion, where it hath
leaſt to do; for Religion is the object and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
of Faith, and not of <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> and
yet naturally no man will believe any thing
unleſs he ſees Reaſon for it. But how? not
a Reaſon of the thing that he believes; for
that works <hi>Knowledge,</hi> not <hi>Faith;</hi> but yet a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of believing it, for the credit of the <hi>Author</hi>
that relates it; for nothing can be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
then not to believe God that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ly. But to admit reaſon in matters of
Faith for any other uſe then that, is to ſet up
a Religion without Faith, which would be as
ſtrange a thing as to have a Religion with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe.</p>
                  <p>There are in Religion ſome things to be
known as well as believed, and to theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Diſcourſe is proper; for though the
Articles of Faith, and whatſoever ſhall appear
to be contained in Scripture are without all
doubt and reaſoning to be received, becauſe
God hath revealed them; yet that <hi>this</hi> or that
<hi>Article</hi> or Propoſition is contained in Scripture,
is a thing to be known, and lyes within the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49996:13"/>
compaſs of ſenſe, we may ſee whether it be
there or no, that is, for the words. And
for the meaning of thoſe words we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the language in which they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
the proper import and idiom of the
phraſe, the force and conſequence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
the coherence and conſent it hath
with other points better known. We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
diſcover the fallacies and inconſequences
of thoſe that would obtrude a different ſenſe
from that we receive. All theſe difficulties,
though in matter of Religion, are within the
conduct of Reaſon; but it is Reaſon ſo <hi>exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
with skill of Arts and Languages, with
Prudence and Diligence, that we ſhall be
forced to find work for the Shepherds too.
The greateſt part of Chriſts flock, I am ſure,
muſt periſh if they may not truſt others in
thoſe things, to which their natural inabilities
or courſe of life hath made them incapable.
And for the beſt of the flock, whom both
Nature and Art hath fitted to maſter the
greateſt difficulties of themſelves; if they ſhall
ſeriouſly conſider how much and how oft
Prejudice, Education, Cuſtom, Paſſion and
Intereſt doth corrupt our Reaſon, we would
in prudence ſometimes ſuſpect our own, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49996:13"/>
ſeek better ſecurity from the <hi>Church;</hi> where
though we ſhall not infallibly find the truth,
we may alwayes ſafely preſume it. This
will ſerve to reconcile our obedience with
Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>next</hi> pretender againſt the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
leading is the SCRIPTURE.
I confeſs the <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a ſurer guide then
Reaſon, for the <hi>Authors</hi> ſake; and yet, by
what ye heard even now, it works little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, but yet ſurer for all that. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

Gods <hi>Word is a lantern to our feet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 105.</note> 
                     <hi>and a light unto
our paths.</hi> We cannot ſay too much of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and benefit of it. It is a perfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of all that concerns Heaven, or the way
to it. It hath all the perfections that a <hi>law</hi> or
rule can have to guide us; yet thoſe perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are confin'd within the limits and nature of
a law, to do no more then is proper for a law
to do, which is very little without a <hi>Judge</hi> to
apply it. Though the rule be ſufficiently
ſtraight &amp; perfect, yet it meaſures nothing out
of the hand of him that hath skill to uſe it.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49996:14"/>
Bring what controverſy you will to the laws,
they pronounce nothing either for the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi>
or <hi>Defendant.</hi> This is the true reaſon why,
though all ſects pretend to Scripture, there
is yet no end of controverſies, becauſe there
is no common <hi>Judge</hi> to end them. And the
reaſon why every ſect for all that ſeems to reſt
ſatisfied, they are guided by the <hi>Scripture;</hi> is
becauſe they carry their Judge a-long with
them, themſelves.</p>
                  <p>So as if together with the Scriptures there
be not a Shepherd too, or ſome as little to be
truſted, our ſelves I mean, it cannot lead at
all.<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> It is indeed a <hi>two-edged ſword,</hi> but cuts
nothing, but in the hand of him that uſeth

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> A <hi>Third</hi> pretender to avoid the Shepherds
is the SPIRIT. That without

the manner of the <hi>Spirits</hi> leading, the Scripture
points out two wayes, The one <hi>Divines</hi> call
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the other may be call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> as it led the Prophets of old, by
revealing to them the truth and matter of the
Propheſy, the object. And by this way it
led all the Apoſtles, to whom the whole
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49996:14"/>
doctrine of the Goſpel, and myſtery of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Chriſt was reveal'd.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> And thus <hi>holy
men of God ſpake as they were moved by the
Holy Ghoſt.</hi> To this way of leading none can
pretend, that doth not prove his commiſſion
from God by a <hi>miracle,</hi> who ſends none of
ſuch an errand that cannot make it appear
ſome way, that he came from him. If the
<hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> would have his dreams believed
to be the dictates and revelations of the <hi>Spirit,</hi>
let him ſhew his letters of Credence from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſeal'd with a <hi>miracle,</hi> and I ſhall not doubt
to ſet him above all the Doctors and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
of the Church. Otherwiſe he may deceive
himſelf by his ſpirit, he ſhall not deceive me.</p>
                  <p>The other way of the <hi>Spirits</hi> leading is
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> not by <hi>revealing</hi> any thing to
us, but by <hi>co-operating</hi> with us, by fortifying
the ſoul and the faculties of it, to all ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
actions, by aſſiſtance of grace to inlighten
the underſtanding to comprehend divine
truth, to inflame the affections with the love
of it, to ſupport our endeavours in all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
and temptations. To this aſſiſtance
of the Spirit all the faithful have a right. And
though in this way the Spirit cannot deceive
us, yet we may be deceived in it, becauſe it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49996:15"/>
never works but with us; if we fail in what
we are to do, then that fails us.</p>
                  <p>And by this way not only private perſons,
but <hi>publick Councels</hi> are governed. To whom
the Spirit doth not reveal the matter of their
Decrees <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but by way of <hi>co-operation</hi>
aſſiſts their indeavours to find out the
truth from the proper Topicks of it, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Antiquity; for ſo all the force of
their decrees depends upon the reaſon and
grounds upon which they are made. For if
any Councel might pretend to that other way
of revelation, ſure that firſt famous <hi>Apoſtolical</hi>
Councel might, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. But that did not

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> THE <hi>fourth</hi> and laſt leader which is
brought in to avoid the Shepherds, is
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49996:15"/>
the CONSCIENCE. This is the
<hi>Presbyterians</hi> ſtrongeſt fort againſt Obedience.
If he can get his Conſcience about him, he
thinks himſelf ſo ſafe that he may bid defiance
to all Authority.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Commiſsion</hi> of leaders, I confeſs, as I
ſaid, the Conſcience to be of the <hi>Quorum.</hi> We
are to do nothing without it, and much leſs
againſt it. But then we muſt be ſure we
miſtake not ſomewhat elſe for the Conſcience.
Every diſeaſe and diſtemper of the mind,
cauſleſs ſcruple, ſlight perſwaſion, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
fear is not the Conſcience, againſt which
we are bound not to act.</p>
                  <p>The tender <hi>Conſcience,</hi> for which ſo much
favour is pleaded, may prove in ſome no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a diſeaſe of the Soul, a ſpiritual <hi>Splene.</hi>
For though it be good to be tender of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God in any thing where it proceeds from
the good temper and conſtitution of the ſoul,
which is the ſame conſtantly in all caſes, and
is not affected or taken up for a purpoſe, as
the ſturdy begger carries his arm in a ſtring,
that it may be a Patent to beg and be idle.</p>
                  <p>You may know it certainly to be a diſeaſe
if it comes upon us by fits and ſtarts, as to be
<hi>tender</hi> of offending God when we obey men,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49996:16"/>
and <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>tender</hi> of offending God when
we diſobey them. If they be not as tender
of one ſide as of another, as I never find them
to be, it is but a <hi>Paralitick</hi> Conſcience that is
dead of one ſide. For tell him the Church
commands it, he preſently ſhrinks and ſtartles
at it; and well ſo, for poſſibly he may ſin
againſt God. But tell him on the other ſide
that God commands obedience to thoſe that
rule over us, it moves him not at all, you may
thruſt a needle into his ſide and he feels it not.
It ſhews plainly the Conſcience hath a dead
Palſy on that ſide.</p>
                  <p>But a right and ſound Conſcience againſt
which certainly we ought not to act, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
and well governed judgment; for not
to amuſe you as the manner is with frivolous
diſtinctions and <hi>definitions</hi> of Conſcience, in
this caſe the Conſcience is nothing but every
mans <hi>private</hi> judgment; for he ought not to
attempt the doing of any thing, till he hath
framed this judgment to himſelf, that it is
lawful for him to do it. Now ſeeing our
private judgment hath ſo great power and
influence as to interrupt the courſe of publick,
it had need be a true and regular judgment.
As firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49996:16"/>
It muſt not be <hi>arbitrary,</hi> for that we think <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
we have reaſon to decline in the publick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
to govern by Will and not by Law.
Many a Conſcience if it were well examined,
will prove to be nothing but will, not judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Every good judgment is upon a <hi>full</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
of the cauſe of both ſides, all evidences
duly weighed and examined, then reſolves;
this is a Conſcience againſt which we ought
not to act, though poſſibly it might prove to
be erroneous; yet for all that we muſt know
that it doth not ſet us free from the guilt of
diſobeying our Governors. And then this is
all the benefit our Conſcience will do us in
caſe of error, that it caſts us into a <hi>neceſsity</hi> of
ſinning, by obeying againſt our ſelves, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying
againſt our Governors. We ſhall
do well therefore to take care, that we make
not every ſlight perſwaſion, doubt or ſcruple,
a Conſcience, truſting to be diſcharged of
our obedience by that, which indeed binds it
faſter upon us, for that is the very end and
benefit for which is inſtituted the Paſtoral
charge, that when we are ſo weak we can
not ſafely truſt our ſelves, we may rely upon
that: unleſs we think it a good plea, I am
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49996:17"/>
blind and therefore I will <hi>not</hi> be led. I am
weak and ſickly, and therefore I will <hi>not</hi> be
rul'd by the Phyſitian.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſum up all, if not <hi>Reaſon,</hi> nor
<hi>Scripture,</hi> nor the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor <hi>Conſcience</hi> will
diſcharge us of the duty we owe to the
Church, in the name of God, let us not raſhly
fling away ſo great a bleſſing, that in all our
doubts and fears, for our quiet and ſecurity,
we may have recourſe to the Shepherds and
Biſhops of our Souls.</p>
                  <p>THis is the <hi>laſt</hi> point, the Shepherds Flock
or the Biſhops <hi>Dioceſs:</hi> the Souls of
men. And here we meet with another quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
from the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> That they may be
ſure to ſpoil the Biſhops of all authority, they
take away their Dioceſs, the cure of Souls,
that they may be Biſhops <hi>ſine titulo;</hi> for Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
they are not either of our bodies or
eſtates. And why not of our Souls? Chriſt
indeed the great Shepherd that purchaſed
them may rule them, but they are too preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for any other Shepherds to Lord over:
which they ſay is done by binding the Souls
with <hi>Church-laws</hi> and cenſures, which Chriſt
hath ſet at liberty. And thus they ſet up
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49996:17"/>
Chriſt <hi>againſt</hi> himſelf, and Chriſtian liberty
againſt Chriſtian duty.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> I confeſs doth earneſtly preſs this
point of liberty,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Stand faſt in the liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
Chriſt hath made us free, and be not intangled
again with the yoak of bondage.</hi> But what liberty?
It is not ſimply from obedience either to men
or Laws, for that were deſtructive to Humane
Society as well as Religion. What then is
it? It is no more then that Chriſtians have a
liberty <hi>not</hi> to be Jews. I dare be bold to ſay,
this is all that can be made of it. And the
reaſon why S. <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo earneſtly preſs it is
evident. The Jews that were willing enough
to entertain the doctrine of Chriſt, yet were
not ſo eaſily drawn to aprt with thoſe Rites
and Ceremonies, to which they had been ſo
long accuſtomed, and upon ſo good authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To humour theſe <hi>Simon Magus</hi> and his
Diſciples ſet up a medly of both Religions,
that they might be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Diſciples and <hi>Moſes</hi>
too. Againſt this doctrine S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
eſpecially in his Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
and <hi>Galatians.</hi> If they have taken upon them
to be Chriſtians let them ſtand to that, and
not look back again to the fleſh <hi>having begun in
the Spirit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3. 3.</note> For behold, I <hi>Paul ſay unto you, if
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49996:18"/>
ye be circumciſed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> To
claim from hence liberty from any other men
or laws then the Jews, they might as well ſay
Chriſt hath here given them liberty not to be
Chriſtians. For Chriſtians we cannot be,
unleſs we obey the Laws and Government of
thoſe that Chriſt hath ſet over us. To uſe
our liberty in this caſe our Apoſtle in the 16.
<hi>verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chap.</hi> hath adjudged it to be no
better then a <hi>cloak of malitiouſneſs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for thoſe Conſciences which are ſo
tender that every Church-law pinches and
galls them, they do without reluctance <hi>bind</hi>
their own Souls. Every private man can do that
which we will not indure the Church ſhould
do. He that promiſeth any thing is bound in
conſcience to perform it, though before he took
that bond upon him, he had his Chriſtian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
not to do it. Before <hi>Ananias</hi> promiſed
to ſell his eſtate, and give it to the Church,
he was free, S. <hi>Peter</hi> told him ſo; <hi>Was it not
in thine own power?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5. 4.</note> Yet after that it was not in
his power to make uſe of that liberty; for his
conſcience was bound. And if a promiſe
may do this, much more a vow or an oath.
<hi>If a man vow a vow unto the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 30. 2</note> 
                     <hi>or ſwear an oath
to bind his Soul,</hi> Numb. 30. 2. (the Soul
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49996:18"/>
may be bound) <hi>he ſhall not break his word, he
ſhall do according to all that proceedeth out of his
mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a man ſhould be ſo unreaſonable as to
ſay, his conſcience may be bound by himſelf,
but not by any elſe. Do not they themſelves,
as their manner is in their Sermons, <hi>bind</hi> over
their hearers to anſwer for them at the day of
judgment? and what a heap and load of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
muſt then ly upon their Conſciences?
though the truth is, they bind none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and that to repent for corrupting Gods
Word, and miſleading the people into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Sedition and Diſobedience, to ſay no
worſe.</p>
                  <p>Let us ſeriouſly conſider and <hi>compare</hi> that
which they would avoid, with that which
they indeavour to ſet up in the room of it.
They would avoid <hi>firſt</hi> the power of the
Church in her Laws and Cenſures as a domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neering
over mens conſciences, and a lording
it over Gods inheritance. But if they look
upon it with an impartial eye, they ſhall find
all contrary, nothing but moderation; as
firſt in the very ſtile of the Church, that there
might be no <hi>harſh</hi> words. The laws by which
they govern, are not call'd laws but <hi>canons,</hi>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49996:19"/>
that is, rules to guide, rather then force.
2. Church-puniſhments are not call'd <hi>poenae</hi>
but <hi>cenſurae,</hi> not that they are ſweetned with
good words only, but with real benefit; for they
are not as temporal puniſhments <hi>ad vindictam</hi> but
<hi>ad diſciplinam,</hi> for the amendment, not revenge
of ſin. 3. The temporal judge, if not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
<hi>[cannot</hi> pardon the <hi>felony</hi> though
he would. The Eccleſiaſtical judge cannot
<hi>but pardon</hi> though he would not. <hi>Eccleſia non
claudit gremium redeuntibus,</hi> is a rule in the Court
Chriſtian. The Church refuſeth none that
will return and repent. There is <hi>no</hi> ſuch rule
in ſecular Courts, that the thief or murtherer
upon repentance may be pardoned. And by
<hi>Church-Canons</hi> in elder times it was deemed an
irregularity to be preſent at a ſentence of
blood. Not that it is a crime to be ſo, but
as the Canon ſpeaks, <hi>propter defectum lenitatis,</hi>
that nothing in them might ſeem to be of
harſhneſs or cruelty. The higheſt and moſt
terrible of all Church-cenſures, of which men
ſeem to be moſt impatient, how harmleſs and
gentle is it, <hi>Excommunication?</hi> If he be not
guilty, <hi>clavibus errantibus,</hi> he is never the worſe
for it; the bonds fall off themſelves; if he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49996:19"/>
be guilty, he may be the better for it if he will.
When S.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> judged the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi>
to be delivered unto Satan, and this was
thought to be Excommunication and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more; yet this was for his benefit, for
<hi>the deſtruction of the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 5.</note> 
                     <hi>that the ſpirit might be
ſaved in the day of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> verſe 5.
What is there in all this that ſhould fright us
from our obedience?</p>
                  <p>But now let us ſee what on the other ſide
they would ſet up in the room of this. A <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> forſooth, from the fetters of
laws, that they might not ſerve God in bonds
like ſlaves, but freely. That they may preach
what they will, and as long as they will. That
they may pray how they will, and faſt when
they will. That they may ſtand and kneel
where and when they will. Indeed a true
arbitrary <hi>Will-worſhip;</hi> inſtead of a lawful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
ſerving of God, a confuſion of all.</p>
                  <p>But they hold themſelves wrong'd to be
charged with will-worſhip, for that they do
all by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
Yet for all that pretenſe they are ſtill under
that charge; becauſe all theſe are at their own
wills; what ſectary is there that with a wet
finger cannot, nay doth not challenge Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49996:20"/>
the Scripture, the Spirit and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to be for him, when <hi>he will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And why do they allow theſe to guide
them and not the Shepherds, but becauſe
theſe are at their beck and <hi>will,</hi> but the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
are not? And therefore becauſe they
cannot command them, they would be rid of
them, that ſo they might without control,
Lord it as they will.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall trouble you no longer with our
<hi>Shepherds</hi> or their <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> but for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
and caution reflect upon our ſelves:
for though Chriſt hath committed the cure
of our ſouls to others, he hath not taken it
from our ſelves. The Shepherds were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for a help to eaſe us in it, not to eaſe us
of it. Every one may and muſt be by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
care a Shepherd and Biſhop to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and then here I ſhall take leave only to
put you in mind of your Dioceſs, your <hi>Souls,</hi>
that ye be not our Apoſtles <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
in this Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 15</note> that we miſtake not our Cure;
for there be other things we have as great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for as our Souls, I wiſh we had not.
The rich glutton in the Goſpel, when he ſaid
to his Soul,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 19</note> 
                     <hi>Soul take thine eaſe, thou haſt much
goods laid up for thee, &amp;c.</hi> ſure he miſtook his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49996:20"/>
body for his Soul, for there was nothing in
his barns that could feed that. This is no
greater an error and miſtake then we dayly
commit our ſelves; to go no farther then
this preſent time. <hi>Lent,</hi> if there were any
thing left of it among us but the name, charges
the ſoul by prayer and faſting to fit and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
it ſelf to meet our Lord at the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When we plead our conſtitution and
health againſt it, it ſhews we are no ill <hi>Curates</hi>
of our bodies, whatſoever we be of our
fouls.</p>
                  <p>Yea that which hath a better title to be our
ſouls will not lie within this Cure; the <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi>
and principal part of the ſoul, and the
inriching it with the knowledge of Arts and
Sciences, ſpeculative and practick, by which
all our affairs and the greateſt of all the affairs
of the world are governed, which employ the
ſouls beſt vertues and indowments, and for
which none but great and noble ſouls, are fit.
Yet this is not the ſoul for which Chriſt died,
and is to be our Cure. For when we have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this and all the world beſides we may <hi>loſe
our ſouls.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt takes no other notice
of theſe then as if they were but bodies, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49996:21"/>
indeed for their continuance they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for they periſh with our bodies; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<hi>wits</hi> and wiſeſt <hi>conduct</hi> lie buried in their
duſt with them, nor will they appear again
for us in that world where the ſoul is moſt
concern'd. In a word, the Scripture owns
no loſing or ſaving to the ſoul but in that
condition which muſt live and continue for
ever. Nothing is worthy that name that
is not immortal. Yet I muſt recal my ſelf
when I ſaid theſe mortal ſouls, that is,
in their temporal condition, are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our Cure; to get, it may be not,
but to uſe they are. The meaneſt of them
all our Saviour expreſly commits to our
charge,<note place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Make you friends of unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that they may receive you into everlaſting
habitations.</hi> Things everlaſting are proper
for the ſoul. And if you ſhall make you
friends likewiſe of your <hi>honours, powers,</hi> and
<hi>knowledge,</hi> for the advantage of Gods honour
and ſervice, certainly they will do as much
for you as <hi>Mammon</hi> can. For thus theſe
mortals do put on immortality,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 54.</note> theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibles
do put on incorruption. You
may in this ſenſe make a ſoul out of your
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49996:21"/>
bodies by the chaſt, ſober and temperate
uſe of them. And ſo our bodies and all
elſe become the proper Cure of our ſouls,
and in the diſcharge of that care, we may
expect the bleſſing of good Shepherds as
well as that of good Sheep.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 4.</note> And <hi>when
the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, ye ſhall receive
a crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have an <hi>Altar</hi> in the Tenth

a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> But what Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
and what Sacrifice?
for they are ſcandalous
words. For the Altar, let
that fall, if the Sacrifice cannot ſupport it: But
for the Sacrifice, whereof we are now to treat,
it, is, I confeſs, a word of offence, becauſe there
goes under the name of a Chriſtian Sacrifice,
that which our Church calls a <hi>blaſphemous fable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Art. 31.</note>
and <hi>dangerous deceit.</hi> Should I leave you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49996:24"/>
any Caution upon that fear and danger
in Sacrificing, it would be to little purpoſe to
offer at the commending of any: For we are
too often troubled more with words, than
what they ſignifie. And therefore as the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
adviſeth, when ſuch a caſe ſhall happen <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigandas
eſſe prius aures;</hi> ſomewhat muſt be ſaid
beforehand to remove a prejudice that will fall
upon all that ſhall be ſaid after. That which
the <hi>Article</hi> ſpeaks of is the Sacrifice of the Maſs,
wherein the Prieſts of that Sacrifice ſay, <hi>That
Chriſt himſelf is really ſacrificed for the quick and
dead:</hi> And for want of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Church is not
by them allowed to have either Prieſt or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, we pretend not to that Myſtical
Art and Chymiſtry, to turn the Elements of
Bread and Wine into the Natural Body and
Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which alone they make
themſelves Prieſts, and <hi>Him</hi> the Sacrifice. I
put in no <hi>claim</hi> therefore from this Text, either
to that Prieſt, or this Sacrifice, but yet to a
right in both, but both of another kinde:
For the Sacrifice, the Text is clear, and the
Prieſt follows of courſe; there can be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
without him. And it is as clear too,
That it is not the Sacrifice of the Maſs, though
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49996:24"/>
                     <hi>Chriſt himſelf</hi> be in it; for 'tis <hi>he</hi> whom we firſt
meet with in the Text, <hi>By him.</hi> Here indeed
<hi>he</hi> is, but not in the quality of a Sacrifice to be
offered, as in the Maſs, whereof <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
but as a <hi>Mediator</hi> only. It is not <hi>Him,</hi> but
<hi>By him</hi> we are to offer.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing we may be ſecure, it is not <hi>that</hi>
we might poſſibly fear; let us ſee what it is
we may ſafely, and muſt neceſſarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
                  <p>We are firſt to <hi>offer</hi> a Sacrifice <hi>to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That for the <hi>kind,</hi> is <hi>Euchariſtical,</hi> not
Propitiatory.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Matter</hi> of it is to be, not the <hi>Fruit</hi> of
our Fields, or of our Flocks, but of <hi>our Lips.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Not every fruit that grows upon the lips,
but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> lips <hi>Confeſsing to his (i. e.
Gods) Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. This confeſſing here is not <hi>of him,</hi> (though
that be otherwiſe neceſſary; for he that denies
him, ſhall be denied by him) but <hi>To him,</hi> and
that makes it a Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p>6. It muſt be <hi>to Him,</hi> and not to any <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Saint,</hi> or <hi>Angel.</hi> Praiſe them we may,
but offer a Sacrifice of praiſe, we muſt not.</p>
                  <p>7. It is not a Sacrifice to be done at ſtarts, and
upon occaſions, but <hi>continually, a daily Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49996:25"/>
8. It is to be <hi>offered by Him,</hi> that is, by <hi>Chriſts
merits and mediation.</hi> 'Tis that which gives power
and efficacy to this and all our ſervices, which
would be nothing worth, if we came in our
own names.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, You have the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> why all
this, <hi>Therefore;</hi> and that ſends us back to the
Twelfth Verſe, <hi>Wherefore Jeſus, that he might
ſanctifie the people by his Blood, ſuffered without the
Gate.</hi> That he ſuffered for us, and that he
ſuffered without the Gate, are the reaſons, why
<hi>by him,</hi> and why <hi>of us. By him,</hi> becauſe by the
ſacrificing of himſelf, he made our peace with
God. <hi>By him therefore let us offer the ſacrifice of
praiſe to God for it.</hi> And why of <hi>us?</hi> Becauſe <hi>he
ſuffered without the Gate;</hi> whither the <hi>Jews</hi> that
were within the Gate muſt go out and follow
him, in the next Verſe, leaving their <hi>City</hi> and
<hi>Sanctuary.</hi> And we the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Gate already, may find him in our
own Territories that ſo both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> joyntly together, as the word
imports, <hi>May confeſs to the honour of his
Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Therefore</hi> carries in it the reaſon of
our duty, ſo it doth in that ſame accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it hath to the time: For this is <hi>Paſsion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49996:25"/>
Sunday;</hi> and why ſo called, we learn from <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus</hi>
and others, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> on this day
met together, to conſult of and contrive the
death of <hi>our Lord;</hi> which, not many days after,
they effected.</p>
                  <p>It will not be fit (I confeſs) for that reaſon,
to anticipate the <hi>Meditations</hi> proper to that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.
Yet as now the <hi>Paſsion</hi> was in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
and conception by them, it will be
ſo far a keeping of time with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we alſo now
ſhall prepare a Sacrifice of praiſe for it, that
we may be fit then to honor God by confeſſing
to his Name, the wonderful mercies and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable
benefits we receive by the <hi>Paſsion</hi>
and <hi>Reſurrection of our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By him therefore let us offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe
to God continually, that is, the Fruit of our lips, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
to his Name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And that we may the better perform our</hi>
Sacrifice of Praiſe, Let us by him alſo offer a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Prayer, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THat we are to <hi>offer</hi> a SACRIFICE <hi>to
God,</hi> is here ſo plainly enjoyned, and ſo
punctually deſcribed, both for <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
in every <hi>circumſtance,</hi> that one would think
it ſtrange it ſhould be neglected, and more
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49996:26"/>
ſtrange it ſhould be contemned by any. But
for our ſelves, if we would be clear in this <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
(as every good man ſhould deſire to be) it
is fit we call our ſelves to account when, and
how we perform it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Primitive Church</hi> (of whom
this may beſt be learned) did, in conſcience of
their duty herein, compoſe ſeveral <hi>Liturgies,</hi> that
by them they might have a <hi>Publick daily Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
for the honor and worſhip of <hi>God;</hi> as that
of St. <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> St. <hi>Marks</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria;</hi>
after that, St. <hi>Chryſoſtoms</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> St.
<hi>Baſils</hi> at <hi>Caeſaria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> St. <hi>Gregories</hi> at <hi>Rome;</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there was no Church without one. They
that wrote <hi>Apologies</hi> for the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> being of
the <hi>Heathen</hi> accuſed of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> becauſe they
were never ſeen to offer ſacrifice to the Gods
for anſwer to <hi>that,</hi> had recourſe to this <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Praiſe</hi> in the Text.</p>
                  <p>The Copies of thoſe <hi>Ancient Liturgies,</hi> as
they come now to our hands, have no doubt
ſuffered the fate of time, that is, ſome changes,
by which the prepoſterous zeal of ſome hath
overcharged them with numerous, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſuperſtitious <hi>Additions;</hi> yet the ſubſtance
and intendment of them was to perform this
duty. And therefore <hi>our Church,</hi> that never
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49996:26"/>
was of the mind to fling away Chaff and
Corn, both at once, That they might not
want what all Churches ever had; ſo ordered
our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> that by it we might with ſafety
and true devotion, daily <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to the praiſe
and honor of God. Wherein they have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
not only the <hi>Precept,</hi> but <hi>Patern</hi> alſo
from this Text, as by a ſhort parallel between
them, may viſibly appear; as firſt,</p>
                  <p>The Text calls us to a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgie</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
is that <hi>Sacrifice. Antioch</hi> was the place
where <hi>Chriſts Diſciples</hi> were firſt called <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
and <hi>Antioch</hi> is the place where the <hi>Chriſtian
Service</hi> is firſt called a <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> We find the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
met together at their <hi>Liturgie.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 2.</note> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate,
<hi>Faſting and Miniſtring to the Lord;</hi> for <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
properly ſignifies a <hi>Publick Miniſtration;</hi> to
which, the word uſed by the <hi>Church,</hi> fits well,
calling it <hi>Common Prayer;</hi> and is ſo expounded
by St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf in the next Verſe,<note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> 
                     <hi>VVhen they
had Faſted and Prayed.</hi> This <hi>Liturgie</hi> or <hi>Miniſtring
to God,</hi> muſt needs be in ſomething for <hi>His honor
and ſervice,</hi> which is properly a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it is a Sacrifice to <hi>God,</hi> ſo to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
none but <hi>God:</hi> We call it <hi>Divine, Service,</hi> and
ſo we uſe it. No <hi>Creature, Saint,</hi> or <hi>Angel,</hi> hath
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49996:27"/>
any part in it, as in ſome they have. <hi>Praiſe</hi>
them we may for the good ſervice they have
done the <hi>Church;</hi> but offer a <hi>Sacrifice of Praiſe</hi>
we may not. It was never heard, ſaith St.
<hi>Auguſtine, Offero tibi Sacrificium, Petre,</hi> or <hi>Paule,</hi>
or <hi>Cypriane.</hi> And though the invocation of
them ſimply be not a Sacrifice, yet it is ſuch,
when uſed in <hi>Divine Service</hi> in the place of one.
And that it is not heard in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> it is no
doubt, with their good leave and liking too.
The <hi>Angel, Rev.</hi> 19. will anſwer for <hi>that</hi> Order:
When St. <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipp'd him,
<hi>Do it not</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I am your fellow ſervant.</hi> And
the Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for <hi>their</hi> Order,
when the men of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> would have ſacrificed
to them, they cried out, <hi>Sirs, why do you theſe
things?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>we alſo are men of the like Paſsions with you.</hi>
That they are <hi>Gods</hi> friends, intitles them to no
more than a place in his Court to <hi>do him ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
not in his Throne to <hi>receive</hi> any. And
therefore that honor which <hi>God</hi> hath not given
to another, we have not given to them in our
<hi>Liturgie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, The Sacrifice of the Text is <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſtical,</hi>
a <hi>Sacrifice of Praiſe,</hi> and ſo is our
<hi>Liturgie.</hi> We pretend to no expiation or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
for ſins, either of quick or dead:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49996:27"/>
We owe <hi>that</hi> to a better Sacrifice. The price of
<hi>Redemption</hi> is greater than any ſervice we can
do: It coſt more to redeem our ſouls, we
muſt let that alone for ever; and therefore in
the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> our Sacrifice is ſet to no higher
key<note place="margin">Pſal. 49.</note> than, <hi>VVe praiſe thee, O God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In every Sacrifice there muſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
ſomething offered, and that in the Text is <hi>the
fruit of our Lips:</hi> For though the Root of this
and every good ſervice, muſt be in the <hi>heart,</hi>
yet the fruit muſt ſprout outwardly in the
<hi>lips.</hi> For though a <hi>vertue</hi> may ſometimes be
accompliſhed in the heart only, yet neither
this nor <hi>Prayer</hi> it ſelf, if private or mental on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(though otherwiſe of excellent uſe) will
amount to a Sacrifice, till it come into the
lips; for no proper Sacrifice is inviſible: And
therefore in our <hi>Liturgie,</hi> as we pray, that <hi>God</hi>
would <hi>open our lips;</hi> ſo we practiſe when we
joyn with the Prieſt in the <hi>Confeſsions</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi>
and in ſuch things where he alone is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is not every fruit that grows <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
upon the lips, is fit to make a Sacrifice, but
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>lips that confeſs to his Name.</hi> But
how comes confeſſing more than any thing
elſe, to relate to a Sacrifice? It is thus. The end
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49996:28"/>
and import of every thing offered to <hi>God</hi> in
Sacrifice <hi>Euchariſtical,</hi> is a Profeſſion and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of <hi>ſome bleſsing</hi> beſtowed upon
the Sacrificer; and ſo either expreſly or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely
is joyned with it. As for inſtance;
At the offering of the <hi>firſt-fruits,</hi> they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to make a <hi>Confeſsion</hi> in this form.
<hi>Thou ſhalt go unto the Prieſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 26. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſay thus unto him,
I confeſs this day unto the Lord thy God, that I am
come into the Country which the Lord ſware unto our
Fathers to give us;</hi> That is, in the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> they
confeſs the Land that bore them to be of
<hi>Gods</hi> gift. Now of ſuch confeſſions as theſe,
the whole body and matter of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> is
framed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Our firſt addreſs and approach into <hi>Gods</hi>
preſence is, by a <hi>Confeſsion of our ſins,</hi> which is
a putting off our ſhooes with the defilements
we have contracted in our ways; for the place
and preſence is holy. And by this we make
Profeſſion and Acknowledgment of <hi>Gods</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
purity and holineſs, in that we preſume
not to come into his preſence, till we firſt put
off our uncleanneſs.</p>

uſe the miniſtry of ſinful man, to confer it

                  <p>Then we have the <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
is a third Confeſſion to his Name, whereby we
do with chearful and thankful hearts, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him to be the <hi>Author</hi> of all the good we

                  <p>For <hi>Leſſons</hi> we have the Scriptures read, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
they are written for our learning: In that we
confeſs, <hi>God</hi> to be our <hi>infallible Teacher,</hi> to
whoſe <hi>Oracles</hi> we ſubmit to be guided, both in

                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Rules</hi> of both lie diffuſed
through the whole body of Scripture, we have
them ſumm'd up in the <hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Decalogue.</hi>
In the <hi>Creeds</hi> we acknowledge our faith in his

the means and way of our Salvation, before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to Men and Angels: And in the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>

But the chief of all the Confeſſions is that,
for which our <hi>Saviour</hi> inſtituted a Sacrament.
<hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> that is, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
and Acknowledgment of what
he by his blood hath purchaſed for us: For
we muſt not think, as ſome do, that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhould be inſtituted for relief only of a
bad memory, like a thred tied about the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but ſolemnly to celebrate the memory of
the greateſt of bleſſings that <hi>God</hi> ever beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon men; the <hi>Redemption</hi> of our Souls by
the blood of his dear <hi>Son:</hi> And therefore this
Confeſsion carries away from all the reſt, the
name of an <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> a Sacrifice of Praiſe and
Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>By this we ſee the <hi>matter</hi> of the Sacrifice of
the Text fulfilled in the <hi>Liturgie</hi> by <hi>Confeſsing to
his Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> The next thing to be obſerved is, <hi>the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of time</hi> when this Sacrifice is to be offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that is <hi>continually.</hi> In conformity to
this, our Service is a continual daily ſacrifice,
a <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening Prayer.</hi> And though the
greateſt benefit of this belongs to thoſe that
daily attend it; yet becauſe it is the <hi>Publick
Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> all that are Members of
<hi>that</hi> have their part and intereſt in it, though
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49996:29"/>
they be abſent, yet not in equal meaſure. The
<hi>preſent</hi> are intitled to the benefit as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
offered <hi>by them;</hi> the <hi>abſent</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> offered
<hi>for them.</hi> For this is our <hi>juge Sacrificium</hi> that
is perpetually burning upon the Altar, for
the ſervice of <hi>God,</hi> and in behalf of every
member of the Church, that doth not <hi>ponere
obicem,</hi> ſet a bar upon himſelf by his wilful
neglect of it, and oppoſition to it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>By him</hi> we are to offer; 'Tis his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
and mediation that crowns the <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
In vain ſhould ſinful man approach ſo great a
<hi>Majeſty</hi> in his own Name; but <hi>by him who
hath made our peace with God, and ſanctified us by
his blood,</hi> we may find acceſs to him. This
<hi>by him</hi> gives the Characteriſtical difference of
the <hi>Chriſtian ſacrifice</hi> from all others; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the <hi>Sacrifice of Praiſe</hi> was common to all
times <hi>before,</hi> and <hi>under</hi> the Law. You find
in many <hi>Pſalms</hi> a Sacrifice of Praiſe and
Thankſgiving, but in none of them <hi>by him,</hi> in

                     <hi>Hitherto ye have asked nothing in

an <hi>Advocate</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> our Prayers and

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49996:30"/>
his Name, concluding always, <hi>By the merits of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THus you ſee the Text exemplified
throughout in the <hi>Liturgy;</hi> and the <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
therefore warranted by the Text. I could
not promiſe my ſelf time enough to take a
view of all the particulars, I have therefore
reduced that I have to ſay at this time, to this
one Obſervation in groſs.</p>
                  <p>That our Liturgie or Common Prayer
is a true Sacrifice to God, for the praiſe
and honor of His Name.</p>
                  <p>And to this I ſhall not <hi>beg</hi> the aſſent of
thoſe that like it not, but <hi>require it;</hi> and by
the authority of the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in another
place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 8. where we read. That <hi>Jeſus
Chriſt was a Miniſter of the Circumciſion for the truth
of God, to confirm the promiſe made unto the Fathers.</hi>
Now what that promiſe was, he tells us in
the next verſe. <hi>That the Gentiles might glorifie
God for his mercy, as it is written, For this cauſe I
will confeſs to thee among the Gentiles, and ſing
praiſes unto thy Name.</hi> Here are Confeſſions,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49996:30"/>
and praiſes, and Singing, by which <hi>God</hi> is to
be glorified among the Gentiles: They that
will be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon other terms, do in effect
make <hi>God</hi> a lier, who promiſed it ſhould be
ſo.</p>
                  <p>And yet they that would not have it ſo,
are very many, and of many ſorts; and though
I cannot think the worſe of it, that it lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a popular diſlike; yet becauſe it is no ill
way of learning our duties by the folly of thoſe
that oppoſe it, I ſhall give you a ſhort account
of them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ATHEIST</hi> firſt charges it with ſuch <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
weapons as he hath, <hi>ſcorn</hi> and <hi>drollery:</hi> That
theſe <hi>Forms,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and <hi>Pageantry</hi> of
worſhipping <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Liturgies,</hi> is but a trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> to get their living, and
according to the priviledge of <hi>Inventors,</hi> they
claim a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> that they only may have the
<hi>offering</hi> of that <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not ſtrange, that they <hi>who have not God
in their hearts,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of
thoſe fools, ſhould have any ſacrifice in their
<hi>lips for him.</hi> In this only, I confeſs, they are
no fools. If there be no God, we need not
trouble our ſelves about a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> but if
there be a God, let them take the <hi>fool</hi> again;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49996:31"/>
for <hi>Sacrifice</hi> is his due. Never was any Nation
ſo barbarous, that fancied a <hi>Deity,</hi> but thought
it neceſſary to make ſome teſtification and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
of it by <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> To theſe we may joyn the whole <hi>Herd</hi> of
<hi>SECTARIES,</hi> who are but a kind of
<hi>godly Atheiſts.</hi> When the late ſtorm that raged
amongſt us, brought with it thoſe <hi>Locuſts</hi> that
over-ſpread the Nation; though their whole
buſineſs was to deſtroy, yet of all moſt viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
the <hi>Publick Service</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And
hence it is, that in the practice of their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
you ſhall find nothing that looks like the
<hi>offering</hi> of a <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe for the honor of God:</hi>
But their meeting together, is only to tell one
another their dreams and ridiculous phanſies,
belying the <hi>holy Spirit</hi> an hour or two, and
then depart. And ſo I leave them.</p>
                  <p>And come to another ſort of enemies, whom
I intend more particularly to call to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and the rather, becauſe they ſeem to
allow of a <hi>Publick Sacrifice of praiſe,</hi> as far as a

                  <p>All this dirt and filth they caſt upon it, is
eaſily wiped off with a right underſtanding
of this only general Doctrine of the Text,
<hi>That it is a ſacrifice of praiſe to God for the honour of

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, They ſay it is a <hi>polluted unclean thing,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
taken out of the <hi>Popiſh Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Breviary:</hi>
But if it be truly according to the patern in
the Text, as ye have heard, a <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe
to God,</hi> we need not be troubled through
what hands it paſſed before it came to us: For
as we are not aſhamed to confeſs that our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>
is not a <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>Reform'd Religion;</hi> ſo,
nor need we be aſhamed to ſay, We worſhip
<hi>God,</hi> not by a <hi>new,</hi> but <hi>Reform'd Liturgie:</hi> And
ſo our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> are both of a piece, and
both as old as the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49996:32"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, They ſay it is a <hi>dead Sacrifice,</hi>
made up of empty <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies;</hi> void
of that life and affection which is neceſſary in
<hi>Gods ſervice.</hi> If there be that want of affection
in our Prayers, it is a fault, lie where it may:
But certainly the <hi>Forms</hi> are not guilty of it. It
is injuſtice to require that in a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which
belongs only to him that <hi>offers</hi> it. The
<hi>Church</hi> that compoſed the <hi>Forms</hi> cannot create
<hi>affection.</hi> If we come to this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and leave
our hearts behind us, I know where the blame
muſt lie.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, you do not accuſe <hi>Set
Forms,</hi> for want of life in themſelves, but that
by the continual repetition of the ſame things,
they be-dead <hi>affection</hi> in thoſe that ſhould have
it. And how, I pray, ſhould that be? If the
ſenſe of <hi>real wants</hi> and <hi>bleſsings,</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the ſame, cannot keep up our <hi>affections,</hi>
how ſhould a new ſet of words do it? Can
we imagine that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be taken with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
and ſhift of phraſes, or that the <hi>affection</hi>
that takes heat from them, will render the <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi>
more acceptable to <hi>God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore, when they complain that
their devotion is tired with nothing but <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and moſt merciful Father,</hi> in the <hi>Morning;</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49996:32"/>
and <hi>Almighty and moſt merciful Father,</hi> in the <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
and the ſame over and over again every
day: That complaint did never lie againſt the
<hi>Jews</hi> daily Sacrifice, which was a type of ours;
that there was a <hi>Lamb</hi> in the <hi>morning,</hi> and a
<hi>Lamb</hi> again at <hi>evening;</hi> and the ſame over again
every day in the year. When our <hi>Saviour</hi> at his
laſt agony in the <hi>Garden,</hi> three times retired
himſelf from his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to pray, he uſed ſtill
the ſame form of words without any change,
St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 44. And who dares ſay he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>ability</hi> to vary <hi>his prayer,</hi> or can ſay, he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>affection,</hi> though he did not?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>St.</hi> Luke 22. 44.</note> For as St. <hi>Luke</hi>
relates it, <hi>He prayed ſo earneſtly, that his ſwet was
as it were great drops of blood falling down to the
ground;</hi> and then ſure there was no want of
<hi>affection;</hi> for when our zeal is at the hotteſt, we
do not uſe to ſwet at our prayers.</p>
                  <p>I go on to a third charge; That Set forms,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
inſtead of helping us, <hi>hinder the Spirit</hi> by
which we ſhould pray. The truth is, Such
as the Spirit may be, and too often uſeth to be,
it ought rather to be bound with chains, than
left at liberty; under a Form of Praying, to
<hi>Libel</hi> their Governors, or whom, or what they
pleaſe to bring into hatred with the people:
But for the true Spirit of Prayer, that cannot
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49996:33"/>
be tyed with words: For they are utterly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
that think the Spirit of Prayer, ſupplies
any defect of words or phraſes; for that very
Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whereon they ground it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes
them; <hi>Rom. 8. 26. The Spirit helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi>
But in what? not in words; for
what the Spirit ſupplies are there ſaid to be
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>not ſpoken at all;</hi> or, as we tranſlate it,
<hi>which cannot be uttered.</hi> What then doth it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply?
<hi>It maketh interceſsion for us with groans, which
cannot be uttered.</hi> The true Spirit of Prayer
conſiſts in groans, in zeal, and fervency; and
that, where it is, will animate and put life
into any Form of Prayer. They who call
Forms of their own making, or borrowing,
con'd without Book, Praying by the Spirit,
do both cheat the people, and blaſpheme the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> A Fourth Objection is, That it is but a
Book-Sacrifice, a <hi>Reading-Service,</hi> which
<hi>any child</hi> may do. They complain it ſeems
of eaſe: If <hi>God</hi> ſhould require a harder thing
of us, as no doubt there are many harder
things to be done, do them we muſt. The
eaſineſs lays the greater obligation upon us:
How ridiculous would this exception appear
againſt the <hi>Legal Sacrifices!</hi> A Butcher could
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49996:33"/>
kill and dreſs a <hi>Lamb,</hi> as well as a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> This
is a falſe, deceitful weight. <hi>Gods ſervice</hi> is not
to be weighed by <hi>the labor</hi> of doing, but by
<hi>the relation</hi> to him, for whom it is done: And
therefore King <hi>Solomon,</hi> when, by the advice of
his Father upon his death-bed, he call'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
the chief Leaders in the rebellion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doniah,</hi>
as <hi>Joab</hi> that commanded in chief, and
<hi>Abiathar</hi> the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> made no queſtion of
putting <hi>Adoniah</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi> to death; but for
<hi>Abiathar,</hi> though he deprived him of his office,
yet he ſpared his life. And why? he gives
no other reaſon but this, <hi>Becauſe he bore the Ark
before his Father David.</hi> But was that a work of
ſuch merit and difficulty? Could not any
Porter do as much? it was but carrying of a
Cheſt. <hi>Solomon</hi> did not take his meaſure by
that. That <hi>Sacred Cheſt,</hi> the <hi>Ark,</hi> was a <hi>Symbol</hi>
of <hi>Gods</hi> preſence; it had relation to his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
and that he preferred before his own;
for <hi>Adoniah</hi> was his Brother of the half-blood,
and <hi>Joab</hi> his coſin-german.</p>
                  <p>You that are the <hi>Kings ſervants</hi> here in Court,
do not weigh the merit and honor of your
places, which you juſtly have, by the pains
and difficulty of your ſervice, which we know
in many is little enough, but by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49996:34"/>
of the <hi>Maſter</hi> for whom you do it. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

Now there can be no communication of men

while we, in obedience to that, pray <hi>God to open

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> They ſay it is an <hi>improper</hi> and impertinent
<hi>Service:</hi> We uſe ſuch <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Pſalms</hi> for
our <hi>Praiſes</hi> and <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> as are not proper

For anſwer to this, and the reſt of that
kind: It is but turning to the Doctrine of the
Text, as we have done in all the reſt. The

and in that we are not only to give thanks for

                  <p>They are offended with the length of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
Service, which makes it not only <hi>tedious</hi> in
it ſelf, but injurious alſo by hindring the
<hi>Sermon.</hi> To meaſure the length firſt: If we
lay our line to it, you will not find it ſo. It
takes up but a very ſhort part of the whole
time which <hi>God</hi> has beſtowed upon us; of
which enough we have, and too much we
take many times for our reſt and ſleep; enough
for our own neceſſary buſineſs, and a good
<hi>portion</hi> beſides for our pleaſures and lawful <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi>
Can we think an hour or two ſpared
out of all this, too long for <hi>Gods ſervice?</hi> or a
<hi>Lamb</hi> too much for him, who has beſtowed
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49996:35"/>
the <hi>whole flock</hi> upon us? The tediouſneſs which
is cauſed by the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Service,</hi> is cured
by the <hi>end.</hi> It muſt needs be a leſs trouble to
us, if we conſider it to be <hi>an honor for God.</hi> To
ſay no more, How can we think thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi>
too long, in which we our ſelves ſue for <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, if the <hi>length</hi> of the <hi>Liturgie</hi>
ſhould, as they ſay, prove a hinderance to
<hi>Preaching,</hi> I had ſo much the leſs to ſay for it:
But how that ſhould be, I underſtand not.
The <hi>Wiſe man</hi> aſſures us, <hi>there is a time for all
things,</hi> and ſure then there is a time for <hi>two</hi>
things, <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Preaching</hi> both. But poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
we may be ſo ſurpriſed, that there is not
time for both; The <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> here will
be, which of them may beſt be ſpared. The
<hi>Prayers</hi> are to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Sermons</hi> to us; the <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
for <hi>Gods honor,</hi> the <hi>Sermons</hi> for our profit.
In this caſe, I think I may ſafely leave every
man to be his own Caſuiſt, and go on to the
next.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VIII"/> It is <hi>defective,</hi> and ſo a lame Sacrifice. How
inconſiſtent are their complaints, and how
hard are they to be pleaſed? It is both too long
and too ſhort. They mean it is too long in
the whole, and too ſhort in the parts. In the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49996:35"/>
                     <hi>Confeſsion of ſins,</hi> in the <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> in the
<hi>Collects,</hi> many material things omitted. The
Scriptures read in broken pieces, and not in
order.</p>
                  <p>Theſe would not be counted <hi>defects,</hi> if we
conſider their <hi>end</hi> and <hi>uſe</hi> in the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which
is to be a <hi>Sacrifice of praiſe to God,</hi> for that is
ſufficiently attained by them as they are there
uſed.</p>
                  <p>It is true, if we reſpect theſe <hi>duties</hi> in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their immediate <hi>proper effects,</hi> the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Forms</hi> are <hi>inſufficient;</hi> for no man may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
of <hi>Remiſsion of ſins,</hi> unleſs he confeſs to

Nor can be <hi>truly thankful</hi> to him for the <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi>
whereof he makes no particular acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment:
Nor can attain to a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>clear
knowledge</hi> of the Scriptures, that reads not <hi>all,</hi>
and in <hi>order.</hi> All this is eaſily granted.</p>
                  <p>But they are utterly miſtaken in the uſe of a
<hi>Liturgie,</hi> that would have it to be a <hi>common ſtore</hi>
to furniſh out every <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than to ſerve for the publick honoring,
and praiſing of <hi>God:</hi> For if particulars ſhould
be named, wherein all are not concerned,
how can they truly and heartily ſay <hi>Amen?</hi>
And likewiſe, when ſome <hi>portions</hi> only of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49996:36"/>
Scripture are read, it is to ſuit the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
and ſolemnity. And for particular <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsions</hi>
and <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> if men were ſo <hi>well-affected,</hi>
and ſo <hi>well-acquainted</hi> with their own
Souls, as they ſhould be; when <hi>general words</hi>
are uſed, they may if they pleaſe, reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their own particulars; and ſo render the

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/> I will add but one exception more. They
ſay it is a blind Sacrifice, and <hi>edifies not.</hi>
To edifie is to contribute to the building of us
up in <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>godlineſs;</hi> and then <hi>not edifying,</hi> the
meaning muſt be, that it is good for nothing.
And truly, if it be ſo, it is but reaſon we
ſhould part with it.</p>
                  <p>But poſſibly when they ſay, <hi>It doth not edifie,</hi>
it may have ſome other meaning in it. They
may ſay <hi>it edifies not,</hi> becauſe they like it not,
or are not pleaſed and ſatisfied with the <hi>uſe</hi> of
it; or, which is nearer the true meaning of
the word, there is nothing of <hi>inſtruction</hi> in it,
which they have not heard a thouſand times
before.</p>
                  <p>They who come to <hi>Prayers</hi> for theſe <hi>ends,</hi>
may indeed be diſappointed, becauſe they
come without their errant. This is a <hi>Sacrifice
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49996:36"/>
for the praiſe and honor of God;</hi> if it edifies <hi>that,</hi>
we have no cauſe to complain. A <hi>Sermon,</hi> I
confeſs, may fit our turns better in both theſe
reſpects, if it be as it ſhould be: It is no doubt
a more pleaſing entertainment of the time,
if it be to edifie our liking; and fitter for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
if it be to edifie <hi>our learning.</hi> But
then to ſay, <hi>Divine Service</hi> doth not thus edifie,
is to blame the <hi>Prayers,</hi> becauſe they are not a
<hi>Sermon.</hi> You would take it ill, as well you
might, if I ſhould except againſt <hi>Sermons,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are not <hi>Prayers, i. e.</hi> a Sacrifice of
praiſe for the worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> as certainly
they are not. But let both have their <hi>dues,</hi>
and they are both good <hi>edifiers;</hi> The <hi>Sermon</hi>
of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> the other of the <hi>Praiſe</hi>
and <hi>Worſhip of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, that part, which, of all the reſt, ſeems
leaſt to edifie, The <hi>Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and
<hi>Anthems</hi> with Muſick, edifie the praiſe of <hi>God.
I will praiſe the name of God with a ſong, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
it with thankſgiving, Pſal.</hi> 69. 30. Yea, the
very <hi>inſtruments</hi> themſelves have their part in
praiſing <hi>God. Therefore will I praiſe thee, and
thy faithfulneſs, O God, playing upon an Inſtrument
of Muſick. Unto Thee will I ſing upon the Harp, O

may be allowed to <hi>David,</hi> to uſe the Art
wherein he excelled, and may agree with the

St.<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> in the place I named before, aſſures
us, That it was a promiſe made to the <hi>Fathers,</hi>
that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould ſo glorifie <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing
to Him,</hi> and <hi>Singing to His Name,</hi> the
very <hi>Singing</hi> is not omitted; and that not <hi>of
Him</hi> only, but <hi>to Him;</hi> which ſeems ſo ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
to ſome, to ſing <hi>our Prayers,</hi> or any
thing that is offered to <hi>God:</hi> But it did not ſo
to him that knew it better, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 33.
<hi>I will ſing unto the Lord, as long as I live; I will
ſing praiſes unto my God, while I have my being.</hi>
What ever others think, he was reſolved to
live and die in it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall trouble you with no more of their
<hi>Objections:</hi> Theſe only I have taken out of a
greater heap, becauſe they are ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
the <hi>Plain Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Text,</hi>
and are the moſt <hi>popular inſinuations</hi> wherewith
unwary people have been deluded.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, though we ſee no reaſon
to <hi>approve</hi> of theſe men, yet have we not reaſon
to <hi>pity</hi> them? For they are content to loſe
their <hi>Livings</hi> for their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> What they
loſe, I cannot ſay; but for <hi>pitying</hi> them, I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49996:37"/>
ſhould be apt enough, if I did not ſee ſome
Gallants venture more for a young wanton
Miſtreſs, than others for a chaſt and ſober
wiſe. If they be ſo fond of their <hi>new Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
and <hi>Covenant,</hi> as young lovers are in the firſt
heat of their <hi>affection,</hi> who ſay, That they had
rather beg together, than part; who can
help it? Yet I will hope that a little more
time, and a little leſs Indulgence, which uſes
to make the one, will make the other wiſer
too.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I leave them, and come to <hi>Our
ſelves,</hi> whoſe Judgments have not been ſo far
corrupted as to be enemies to the <hi>Liturgie;</hi> yet,
I know not how, ſomething hath ſo poiſoned
our Affections, that we are not ſo good friends
to it as might be wiſhed. We care but little
to come to it, and have as little reſpect when
we are at it; we ſit it out, or talk it out, ſo
as nothing ſeems to be more impertinent, and
wherein we are leſs concerned, than in this
Service. Why will you go to Church? ſay
they; there's nothing but Prayers. That is in
words at length, There's nothing but praiſing
and honouring God.</p>
                  <p>It is not poſſible, that any could be thus
bold with their Creator, if they did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49996:38"/>
themſelves with a perſwaſion that a full
amends may be made him another way.
That obedience to Gods Commands, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and godly life is the beſt Sacrifice. <hi>He
that keepeth the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccluſ. 35. 1.</note> ſaith the Son of <hi>Sirach,

                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 4. 5.</note> And <hi>David,</hi> an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of more credit, tells us of a <hi>Sacrifice of
Righteouſneſs.</hi> And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<hi>To do good and to communicate forget not, for
with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 16.</note> Theſe are,
and every other act of Vertue, may be a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
and God honoured by them: But yet not
ſuch as will ſerve to ſatisfie the Duty of the
Text. The Sacrifice of obedience is <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
i. e. God</hi> accepts it as well as if it had
been a Sacrifice, that is, ſomething given to
himſelf. But the Sacrifice of praiſe is <hi>proper</hi>
without a <hi>Metaphor.</hi> The original word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I confeſs, imports ſomething to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
but that is meer accidental to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Sacrifice. It doth diſtinguiſh the <hi>kind,</hi>
but not conſtitute the <hi>nature</hi> of it, which is
accompliſhed by offering ſomething to God
in acknowledgment of him. And for this
uſe, <hi>the fruit of our lips</hi> is as proper, as the
fruit of our flocks, or of our fields, ever
were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:49996:38"/>
So likewiſe the honor which God receives
from our <hi>obedience,</hi> differs from that of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;</hi>
for <hi>that</hi> is only of <hi>conſequence,</hi> and
by argumentation, <hi>i. e.</hi> It ſuits with the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>will</hi> of God; as we ſay, Good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
are an <hi>honor</hi> to their Maſters, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection:
But the honor by Sacrifice is of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi>
and ſpecial <hi>intendment,</hi> it hath no other
uſe, and is a diſtinct vertue from all other
acts of <hi>obedience,</hi> and of a different obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould not trouble you with theſe nice
diſtinctions, if they did not carry with them
matter of important conſequence; leaſt a
<hi>neceſſary ſervice</hi> ſhould be ſhuffled up, and
quite loſt in the croud of other duties. For,
though God hath the <hi>honor of obedience</hi> and a
<hi>vertuous life,</hi> if we deny him the honor of a
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> beſides, we rob him of his due;
and a greater Sacriledge we cannot commit:
For that which goes upon the <hi>common account</hi>
of Sacriledge, robs God only of things dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
for <hi>his ſervice;</hi> (and yet that crime hath
fired the neſts of thoſe, that took <hi>Coals from
the Altar,</hi> to warm their own <hi>harths)</hi> but this is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49996:39"/>
the robbing God of the <hi>Service</hi> it ſelf, to which
the other is but an <hi>acceſſory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a fallacy, and piece of practick ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
that cozens the world, for men to think
themſelves diſcharged of one duty by the zeal
they bear to another; as if God were not rob'd
ſo long as we leave him any thing.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it is well worth our care, that <hi>this</hi>
Service be not loſt in the crowd of other <hi>duties,</hi>
ſo will it be much more, that it be not loſt
in worſe company, in a throng of <hi>Vices.</hi>
And loſt it will be, when the vertue of it is
gone.<note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>A fruitful land is made barren by the ſins of
them that dwell therein.</hi> The ſame cauſe will
make our Prayers as fruitleſs as our fields. To
honour God with our <hi>lips,</hi> and diſhonour
him with our <hi>lives;</hi> to be ſtrict at Prayers,
and looſe to all diſorders; The <hi>Presbyterian</hi>
pretenſions cannot make our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
as our ſins can: They make God
complain of that which he himſelf command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Iſai. 1. 11. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of
your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord; I am full
with the burnt offerings of Rams, and the fat of fed
Beaſts.</hi> And again, <hi>Bring no more vain Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49996:39"/>
Incenſe is an abomination unto me:</hi> So it was
with the Jews Sacrifice; and the Chriſtians
will fare no better, ver. 15. <hi>When ye ſpread forth
your hands I will hide mine eyes from you: yea, and
when ye make many Prayers I will not hear:</hi>
Whence grows the diſpleaſure that God takes
againſt his own Service, but from this?
<hi>Your hands are full of blood.</hi> He will accept no
<hi>Sacrifice</hi> from polluted hands. And therefore,
to reconcile him to his own Service, he puts us
into this courſe, verſe 16. <hi>VVaſh ye, make ye
clean, put away the evil of your doings from before
mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek
Judgement, relieve the oppreſſed, plead for the
widow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we come thus minded and prepared to
Gods Altar, and offer the Sacrifice of Praiſe
to the honour of his Name, we may with
confidence expect, what God in the ſame caſe
promiſed, 1 Sam. 2. 30. <hi>Them that honour me, I
will honour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude. All that I have ſaid hitherto
is only to vindicate <hi>Gods Service</hi> from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,

ſhould be greater. <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi>
This is the Argument whereof with Gods
bleſſing we are now to treat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49996:42"/>
COncerning our care about hearing, it
will not be amiſs to beſtow the firſt
part of it about the meaning of the Words.
St. <hi>Luke</hi> relates the ſame paſſage with ſome
difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tade heed</hi> how <hi>your hear.</hi> That which is
<hi>quid</hi> here, is <hi>quomodo</hi> there. The difficulty
will be, Whether St. <hi>Mark</hi> ſhould expound
St. <hi>Luke,</hi> or St. <hi>Luke</hi> St. <hi>Mark?</hi> for in relating
matter of fact, the truth muſt be one, though
the words differ: And yet the words do not
ſo differ, but that in Scripture the one is
ſometimes taken for the other, <hi>quid</hi> for <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo,</hi>
and <hi>quomodo</hi> for <hi>quid:</hi> Gen. 2. 19. <hi>God
brought all the beaſts of the field and fouls of
the air to</hi> Adam, <hi>to ſee what he would call them.
What,</hi> that is <hi>How;</hi> there is <hi>quid</hi> for <hi>quomodo.</hi>
On the other ſide, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 26. we have <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo</hi>
for <hi>quid: VVhat is written in the Law?
how readeſt thou? How,</hi> that is, <hi>VVhat readeſt
thou?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though this promiſcuous uſe of the phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
will ſerve to reconcile the Evangeliſts, that
they might mean the ſame thing in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
words; yet will it not ſerve to find out
which that meaning ſhould be. It will be a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49996:42"/>
ſafe courſe therefore to take both in; for
though <hi>vi verborum</hi> we can not, yet, which is
lawful in a Preacher, <hi>vi conſequentiae</hi> we may;
for they are ſo cloſe woven together, that one
cannot well go without the other. It will be
to no purpoſe how we hear, unleſs we hear
what we ſhould: and it will be to as little to
hear what we ſhould, if we care not how we
hear it. If we take them both in, they will
compleat our care in the two parts of it, and
alſo make two Points of the Sermon, <hi>VVhat</hi>
we hear, and <hi>How</hi> we hear.</p>
                  <q>1. Take heed what—</q>
                  <p>But how can that be given in caution to
the Hearer which is not in his power? for
it is wholly at the choice of the Speaker
what we hear: When the Ear is open it
muſt hear what is ſpoken, whether it be good
or bad. True, if the Precept had been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the Ear, ſo it muſt be; but it is given
to the Hearer, to him that hath an <hi>Imperium</hi>
and ruling of that and all the other ſenſes. If
the reaſon or will ſhall command, the Ear
will open or ſhut, like or diſlike. It is not
ſimple hearing, the Senſe it ſelf is not capable
of advice,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 2.</note> but mix'd. St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the
reaſon why the Goſpel being preach'd to the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49996:43"/>
Jews did not profit them, <hi>becauſe not mix'd
with Faith in them that heard it.</hi> It is not ſimple
hearing, but mix'd with a more noble part
of the Soul that guides it. And ſo to take
heed what you hear, is in effect to take heed
what Faith and Credit you give to that you
hear; for ſo it follows in the Verſe, <hi>VVith
what meaſure you mete it ſhall be meaſur'd to you,</hi>
the benefit will anſwer to the care, meaſure
for meaſure. But what different meaſure
can there be of that which differs not? Gods
Word is from everlaſting unchangeable. <hi>The
graſs may wither, and the flower thereof may
fade away,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter, but the word of the
Lord endureth for ever;</hi> and this is the word
which <hi>by the Goſpel is preached unto you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. ult.</note> 1 Pet.
1. ult.</p>
                  <p>Though Gods word be one in it ſelf, yet
that one hath been made known to the world
in different ways and Degrees, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a hearing proportionable to them.
<hi>God who at ſundry times,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
ſpake in times paſt to the Fathers by the
Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken by his
Son.</hi> And likewiſe that which the Son ſpake
in thoſe laſt days, the days of the Goſpel, was
in divers manners. For firſt he ſpake by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:49996:43"/>
in perſon,<note place="margin">Luke 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon
me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the
Goſpel to the poor.</hi> That which he preached
was certainly Gods word. And when he left
the world to go to his Father, he ſent the
Holy Ghoſt from Heaven, who in the mouth
of the Apoſtles preached the ſame Goſpel; for
thoſe holy men ſpake not by the will of man,
but as they were mov'd by the Holy Ghoſt.
And therefore this alſo was truly the word of
God.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 24.</note> And when the <hi>Church</hi> was thus found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the preaching of the Holy Ghoſt, for
the propagation of it to all times after, it
pleaſed God to give it in <hi>VVriting,</hi> in a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and that by inſpiration of the ſame
Spirit which before preached it. So as now
we need not aſcend to Heaven to fetch Chriſt
down, nor the Holy Ghoſt, as ſome pretend
to do to know Gods will, but to receive it
only from that Scripture. Thus far we have
the Word of God in <hi>Proper, (i. e.)</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
out of the mouth of God, and our
hearing muſt be abſolute for the matter, we
muſt ſay with <hi>Samuel, Speak Lord, for thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
heareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when it pleaſed God to commit the
diſpenſing of that word to the Paſtors of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49996:44"/>
Church, <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, for the
work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of
Chriſt, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 12. Now the word of God
was come into the hands of men ſubject to
infirmities and error, who may both deceive
themſelves and others. And here our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
advice comes in ſeaſon, <hi>Take heed what you
hear.</hi> Before, Gods word was in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
but here only in the Tranſcript, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py;
and ſome Copyings are more happy than
others, and come nearer the Original, and
therefore not all of the ſame value and eſteem.
All Preachers are not to be heard alike, nor
all Sermons. The word of God in them is
ſo the water of Life, that it often taſtes of the
<hi>mineral,</hi> through which it runs, and hath a
tincture from the earthen Veſſel that brings it,
and therefore not to be receiv'd with that
meaſure of truſt which belongs to the pure
and proper word of God. For, take a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
at the beſt, the moſt you can make of it
is, that it is Gods word only in a qualified
ſenſe, becauſe the Church intends it ſhould
be ſo; and it is the Preachers judgment and
opinion that it is ſo; and poſſibly it may be ſo
indeed. But then becauſe poſſibly it may not
be ſo, we had need <hi>take heed what we hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49996:44"/>
We learn from St. <hi>Paul</hi> that it was more
than poſſible, it was truly ſo then; for he
warns <hi>Timothy</hi> of Preachers <hi>that will ſtrive
about words to no purpoſe, but to the ſubverſion of the
hearers, 2 Tim.</hi> 2. 14. And verſe 16. <hi>By pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
and vain bablings do increaſe to more ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
And verſe 17. <hi>Their word will eat as doth
a Canker, or a Gangrain;</hi> for ſo the Greek word
is; and that's a dangerous Diſeaſe, and by all
means poſſible to be avoided, and eſpecially
to be taken heed of. Thus it was in the early
times of the Church, we have reaſon then to
look for worſe after, and ſo we of late times
found it by ſad experience: Not only profane
and vain bablings, but Sedition, Treaſon,
Rebellion were dreſt up and appear'd in the
likeneſs of Sermons. It is too plain, we
have but too much need of caution to take
heed.</p>
                  <p>But alas! what ſhould <hi>private men</hi> do?
muſt they, or can they call all Preachers and
Doctrines to account? The Scriptures indeed
which are the undoubted Word of God
would do it if well manag'd, but how can
that be hoped from every hand? wherein
wiſe, that is, learned men, are miſtaken, and
from whence every Sect ſeeks Patronage, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49996:45"/>
perſwades it ſelf to have it. What means is
there then left by the help whereof we may
take heed what we hear. Truly none that I
know, but this ſtill, the Scriptures are the only
inſallible rule.</p>
                  <p>But how! Not left looſe to the prejudices
and fancies of every man; for then it will
fall out, as with thoſe that look in a <hi>Glaſs,</hi>
in which every one ſees his own face, though
not anothers; the reaſon is becauſe he brings
his face to the Glaſs, not becauſe it was there
before. So every <hi>Sect</hi> ſees the face of his
own Religion in the Scripture, not becauſe
it was there before, but becauſe his ſtrong
fancy and prejudice brought it thither; he
thinks he ſees that in the Scripture, which in
truth is only in his own imagination.</p>
                  <p>But how then can we have any help from
the Scriptures to take heed what we hear?
Not as Gods word lies diffus'd through the
whole body of them; but as prepar'd and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itted up in a ſummary and ſhort <hi>form of
wholſom words</hi> by ſuch to whom the care of the
Church is committed.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall think this a humane invention
derogatory to the ſufficiency of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
Let him implead St. <hi>Paul</hi> firſt, who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49996:45"/>
made the ſame uſe of it, finding what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
falſe Teachers had done, charges <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>

to his truſt, and for that very purpoſe that he
might avoid profane and vain bablings, and
oppoſitions of Science falſly ſo called; and
that is plainly, that they might <hi>take heed what
they hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame courſe was taken by the whole
Church after conſidering how hard, or rather
impoſſible it was for every one out of the
Scriptures to work out to himſelf an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the knowledge of as much as was
neceſſary to ſalvation, and with that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
with the reſt of the faithful, who are
commanded to ſpeak and think the ſame
things, which cannot be done but in a certain
form of words.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> Such a form, if not the ſame
with S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, was the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi>
the uſe whereof hath ever ſince continued in
the Church to be a help to take heed what we
believe.</p>
                  <p>The ſame courſe was of later times held by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49996:46"/>
divers particular National Churches, who
weary with the inſolence and domineering of
their Siſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> did <hi>ſuo jure uti,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for themſelves, which fell out in a time
when the world was filled with Controverſies
and Diſputes of Religion. That the people
might not <hi>be carried about with every wind of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
that blew from all corners, it was their
care, and wiſdom to compoſe a form of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
words in their ſeveral <hi>Confeſsions,</hi> to be a
rule what to hear.</p>
                  <p>Now following our Saviours advice, you
have reaſon to ask, With what meaſure of
Faith are theſe confeſſions to be received;
for, <hi>Quis cuſtodiet ipſum cuſtodem?</hi> What cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
muſt be given to that which muſt be a rule
how far we credit others? That we miſtake
not, They are not to be received with that
faith which is due to Gods word, or any thing
out of it as neceſſary to ſalvation; but with
ſuch as wiſe men would give to the means of
ſetling unity and conſent in matters contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
as the title of <hi>our</hi> Confeſſion imports;
that is, That they are Articles of <hi>Peace</hi> not
Articles of Faith. They make no new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
or new Faith.</p>
                  <p>This, by the way, gives an eaſie Anſwer
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49996:46"/>
to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hard Queſtion, as they think;
<hi>Where was your Religion before</hi> Luther? <hi>Where
was your Church before the 39. Articles?</hi> We
do not date our Religion from thoſe Articles.
The Church of <hi>England</hi> (I grant) is call'd ſo
from their Confeſſion, but by an <hi>accidental</hi>
denomination; <hi>i. e.</hi> It is that Church which
for preſervation of unity and peace in it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
nothing to be taught or heard for
God's Word which is repugnant to them in
the particulars there mentioned. But for the
<hi>eſſential</hi> denomination of our Faith, whereon
Salvation depends, it is the Faith of God's
Word, ſumm'd up in the ancient Catholick
and Apoſtolick Forms; as is evident from
our <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> and Practice. For when
any is received as a Member into the Church
by <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the Laver of Regeneration, no
other Faith is required but that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
in the Apoſtles Creed. And when by
a confeſſion of our Faith and Sins, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
to receive the <hi>other</hi> Sacrament of the
Body and Blood of our Lord, our Faith is
that according to the ancient <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed.
And in the Office of <hi>Viſiting</hi> the Sick, the
Abſolution (a comfort at all times, and moſt
of all when we give up our Souls into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49996:47"/>
Hands of God) is not to be adminiſtred but
to thoſe that make confeſſion as well of their
Faith as of their Sins; and that Faith is only
according to the <hi>Apoſtles Creed.</hi> Thus are
we born, nouriſh'd, and diſſolv'd by the ſame
Faith, according to the ancient Catholick and
Apoſtolick Forms. A Faith of this age nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ought they to reproach, nor we to be
aſham'd of.</p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>our</hi> particular Church <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion;</hi>
it hath another end and uſe; they are
<hi>Articles</hi> of peace and conſent in certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
to inſtruct and help us to take heed
what we hear.</p>
                  <p>But it will not be ſo taken by all; for the
Churches. Remedy is the Sectaries Diſeaſe,
who complain, That by this means the <hi>liberty
of the Spirit</hi> and of the <hi>Conſcience</hi> are penn'd
up in thoſe Forms; and, which is a worſe
miſchief, if it were true, a binding of
God's Word, which ought to be free: But
for that God's Word neither is nor can be
bound. The Forms are no more but the
gathering together ſome of thoſe Waters
which flow all over the Scriptures, into a
ſtream, to fit them for the eaſe and uſe of all.
But they ſay, they take a better courſe to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49996:47"/>
fetch all from the Fountain. The Fountain
indeed is purer; but I ſee no reaſon why the
Water ſhould be purer in their <hi>Pitchers</hi> than in
the Churches <hi>Stream,</hi> ſeeing both claim imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the ſame Fountain.</p>
                  <p>They ſay again, That theſe Forms are no
better than <hi>ſnares,</hi> to hinder many a painful
Preacher of the Goſpel. They would ſeem
careful to unbind God's Word; but I ſee it
is to ſet themſelves at liberty. As for painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in Preaching, if it be not to ſome good
purpoſe, I ſhall not much reckon upon.</p>
                  <p>The Phariſees <hi>compaſſed Sea and Land,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 13.</note> but it
was to make Phariſees, Proſelytes of their
Faction, not of Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay, but they preach the</hi> Goſpel. <hi>The
Goſpel is a glorious Word; but what Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel?
A Goſpel you may perhaps have
enough of,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and too much: S.</hi> Paul <hi>informs</hi>
Timothy of perilous times to come, <hi>when</hi> men will
be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters,
proud, blaſphemers, without natural affection, truce-breakers,
falſe accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers
of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>How think you comes it to paſs that there
ſhould be ſuch a general Apoſtacy? was it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49996:48"/>
not for want of preaching? They had no
Sermons, or perhaps no great affection for
them; they were ſome cold hearers, that
were content with one Sermon a day. No,
that was not the matter; if we read on to the
next Chapter we ſhall find they had hearing
enough; for they were ſuch as <hi>heap'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Teachers,</hi> and ſo had heaps of Sermons,
and affection for them too; for they had itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ears. What was it then? They could
not away with <hi>ſound Doctrine,</hi> but would have
Teachers after their own luſts; they had the
Goſpel in plenty, but it was <hi>Evangelium</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     </gap>; after their own luſts, not
of <hi>ſound Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is ſound Doctrine? S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth
not ſay here, becauſe a little before he had
given <hi>Timothy</hi> a form of it, <hi>Keep the Form
of ſound words which thou haſt heard from me;</hi>
and becauſe their Goſpel did not agree
to that, he chargeth him to <hi>avoid it.</hi> So
ſhould we do too with ſuch a Goſpel as will
not ſtand within our form of wholeſom
words: Or if it be ſuch as was preached here
for twenty years together, we have little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be fond of it, or any pains that is
taken about it. If they will not hear the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49996:48"/>
Churches Goſpel, what reaſon hath the
Church to hear theirs?</p>
                  <p>To end my firſt point, If it was wiſdom in
St. <hi>Paul</hi> to commend a form of words, and in
the whole Catholick Church to uſe one; if
the ſame was practis'd by every reformed
Church, and all that people might with peace
and ſecurity know what to hear: I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
what wiſdom it can be to lay all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
again for any mans pleaſure; for this is
to <hi>legitimate</hi> Schiſm, and entail diviſion to the
Church for ever. As you love your ſelves,
your quiet, and look to receive benefit by the
immortal ſeed of Gods Word, if you would
be good Chriſtians, that is, be adviſed by
Chriſt, and in that way which all Chriſtians
have uſed, to <hi>Take heed what you hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE come now to the ſecond point of
our care, <hi>Take heed how you hear,</hi> and
this no leſs neceſſary than the former; for
when we have provided for the Matter what
we hear, we may yet offend in the Manner
<hi>how;</hi> and ſo loſe the benefit of both.</p>
                  <p>That which is here ſet down in proper
words, is by our Saviour illuſtrated in a Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
<hi>verſe 21. Is a candle brought to be put
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49996:49"/>
under a buſhel, or under a bed, and not to be ſet on a
Candleſtick?</hi> that is, and ſo St. <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſes
it, A candle is not brought to be put under
a Buſhel, but to be ſet on a Candleſtick.
This makes two points in the manner of
our hearing, one <hi>negative,</hi> that we do not ſo
hear Gods Word that we put it under a
Buſhel, another <hi>affirmative,</hi> that we ſet it on
a Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> Gods Word is a light, we
can do nothing more contrary to light than to
hide it, to put it under a Buſhel, <hi>i. e.</hi> to do any
thing that will intercept the light and benefit
of it. Now this may be done ſeveral ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By perverting the proper end and
uſe of hearing. Hearing Gods word is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a good point of Religion; for it is a
duty commanded, <hi>verſe 23. If any man have
ears to hear let him hear;</hi> yet if he hear as he
ſhould, he muſt not miſtake one kind of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for another. Duties are of divers kinds,
ſome <hi>eſſential</hi> parts of Religion, ſome <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,</hi>
and ſome <hi>both.</hi> The two chief du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this time, faſting and hearing, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
onely. That Faſting is ſo, we
learn from St. <hi>Paul. The Kingdom of Heaven
is not meat and drink,</hi> i. e. conſiſts not in it;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49996:49"/>
yet if well uſed is a help to it. <hi>Inſtrumenti vis
in uſu conſiſtit.</hi> If faſting attains not the end
and uſe of it, it is good for nothing, not to be
reckon'd in the order of Religious duties.
So hearing Gods Word, if it work no
amendment in us, is but a Cypher alone that
ſtands for nothing, no better than a Candle
under a Buſhel.</p>
                  <p>When hearing is not it ſelf, doth not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
own duty, we are extreamly miſtaken if we
make it ſerve for any other. Hearing doth
edifie, help to the building, but as an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
not as Stone and Timber, the <hi>eſſential</hi>
parts of it. The Ax and the Hammer, the
Square and the Level, are inſtruments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there can be no building: but we
would think him mad that ſhould therefore
lay them in the Walls or the Foundation:
They are as much guilty of folly, who make
their <hi>ordinary,</hi> worſhip of God to be nothing
but to go hear the Sermon; yea, and the
<hi>extraordinary,</hi> a ſolemn Faſt and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to hear a Sermon, A publick Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
to hear a Sermon, and that is all. If
any buſineſs extraordinary fall out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we think fit by our Devotion to ingage
Gods bleſſing and protection, all we do for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49996:50"/>
his ſake we ſit and hear a Sermon. If the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
doth the work of an inſtrument it is well,
to fit and enable us to perform thoſe duties,
it ſelf is neither ſtick nor ſtone in the Building.
We muſt not think all is done when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is done.</p>
                  <p>Inſtruments are of an <hi>indifferent nature,</hi>
may be well or ill uſed; ſo are not eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
as Faith, Repentance, and Charity, are
conſtantly the ſame. Faſting, I ſaid was an
inſtrumental duty, and ſo was as well us'd
for ſtrife and debate, as for Humiliation and
Repentance. We may remember many of
thoſe fighting Faſts.<note place="margin">Pſal. 74.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hew'd Timber be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
out of the thick Trees was known to bring it to an
excellent work; but now they break down all the
carved works thereof with Axes and Hammers,</hi>
that is, with the ſame tools that built it.
As Sermons are inſtruments to build up, at
another time they pull down as faſt. It is
therefore very neceſſary we take heed how we
hear them.</p>
                  <p>As we muſt not miſtake in the kind of the
duty, an inſtrumental for an eſſential; ſo nor
in the kind of the Inſtrument: for ſome are
<hi>natural,</hi> as the eye is of ſeeing, the ear of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
theſe naturally do their work. Others
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49996:50"/>
                     <hi>poſitive</hi> of Divine Inſtitution, which have no
vertue or power but from that; and ſuch are
the Sacraments. I confeſs I never heard any
ſay, that hearing of Gods Word was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Faith: yet I know there is more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
aſcrib'd to it than natural, and by ſome
more than Sacramental; for no Sacrament
they think effectual without a Sermon.</p>
                  <p>If there be a miſtake in the manner and <hi>kind</hi>
of operation in the Inſtrument, it will prove
another putting the Candle under a Buſhel.
I hope you will not think it a fruitleſs curioſity
to enquire a little farther into it.</p>
                  <p>Hearing and Preaching both, for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
go together, are ſo proper to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
that by them it is diſtinguiſhed from the
Law; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> arguing for the Chriſtian
Faith againſt the Jewiſh, calls it the Hearing
of Faith, <hi>Gal. 3. 2. He that miniſtreth to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and worketh miracles among you, doth he it
by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of
Faith?</hi> The like propriety in the Goſpel hath
preaching; for whatſoever way the wiſdom
of the world may take, <hi>It pleaſed God by the
fooliſhneſs of preaching to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. And thus by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
the Goſpel is call'd <hi>the miniſtration
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49996:51"/>
of the Spirit,</hi> becauſe preached by inſpiration
of the Spirit, and the Law the miniſtration of
the Letter, becauſe given in writing, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.
6. <hi>Who hath made us Miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, not of the
Letter, but of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But was there then no hearing nor preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Law? That cannot be ſaid nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>They have Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives, let them hear them.</hi> And
the <hi>Prieſt's lips</hi> could not <hi>preſerve knowledge</hi>
unleſs it were received from his mouth by
hearing. It was commonly practiſed in the
Synagogues after the reading of the Law in
the time of the Apoſtles to exhort the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
When St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his company went
into the Synagogue at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Piſidia,</hi> they
were deſired to give the people <hi>a word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 13. 15.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>How then comes it to paſs that by hearing
and preaching, the Chriſtian Religion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
from the Jews, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both? And why is the Law call'd the
miniſtration of the <hi>Letter,</hi> by way of diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſeeing the Goſpel is <hi>written</hi> as well as the
Law?</p>
                  <p>'Tis plain that theſe things are ſpoken, not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49996:51"/>
                     <hi>ſimply,</hi> and univerſally of either, but in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to their beginning and <hi>firſt</hi> publiſhing to
the world. Becauſe the Law was then gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by writing, though afterwards preached;
it is called the miniſtration of the Letter: So
the Goſpel, though afterwards written, yet
becauſe it was then only preached by revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Holy Ghoſt, it is call'd the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>That likewiſe which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the
<hi>hearing of Faith,</hi> and of ſaving men by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs
of preaching hath a peculiar relation to
Chriſtianity in the manner of founding it at
firſt. For certainly Preaching in it ſelf was
not in the eye of humane wiſdom a fooliſh
way to perſwade, but ſuch as the wiſeſt of
them all uſed: when they would perſwade the
people any thing, they did it by orations and
ſpeeches, which are of the ſame kind with
preaching.</p>
                  <p>But if we look at that preaching by which
the Chriſtian Religion was at firſt introduced,
it had in the eye of humane wiſdom ſomething
of folly in it. For to introduce a Law or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
to any people, theſe <hi>two</hi> things among
others are neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>That they give it in <hi>Writing,</hi> that they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49996:52"/>
might more certainly know what they had to
do, and that it be by ſuch as have <hi>authority</hi> and
power. And this way God himſelf took in
giving the Jews a Law: for <hi>firſt,</hi> he wrote it
with his own fingers, and then publiſhed it by
the Miniſtry of <hi>Moſes</hi> who was their leader
and governour.</p>
                  <p>But for the introduction of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> it
pleaſed God to take a far different courſe,
that is, to commit all to the preaching of a
few poor deſpicable Fiſher-men, who were
only private men, of no authority; and of
whoſe Goſpel they had no knowledge, but
from what was to be taken from their mouths.
And that when firſt preached, was by ſome
eſteemed no better than a diſtemper, yea,
plain drunkenneſs: yet, thus it pleaſed God
to put the words of eternal life into theſe
earthen veſſels, and by that means to make his
own power known, and by that folly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the wiſdom of the world.</p>
                  <p>But for <hi>our</hi> preaching, though it may have
many times too good a title to fooliſhneſs in
preaching, yet not to the fooliſhneſs of
preaching: for, thoſe obſtacles remov'd, it is
the ordinary way by which all knowledge,
humane as well as divine is communicated:
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:49996:52"/>
My meaning is, that <hi>hearing</hi> now is to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as the common <hi>natural</hi> inſtrument to
receive inſtruction, and therefore no benefit
to be reckon'd on from it, but what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all other learning and knowledge,
that is, by ſerious ſtudying, and diligently
pondering the things we hear; for if we truſt
to any ſecret, ſacramental, myſtical vertue in
hearing: that profit we ſhould get by the
Word we may loſe by the Hearing. Therefore
<hi>take heed</hi> how <hi>you hear;</hi> for this is a ſecond way
of putting Gods word under a Buſhel.</p>
                  <p>There is another way, which in part at leaſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
puts under the Buſhel too, when we <hi>confine</hi>
it to the <hi>Sermon:</hi> whereas that is of little uſe,
if Gods word be not in it; they ſay, The word
is of as little, if it be not in a Sermon, which
is a derogation to the goodneſs and bounty of
Almighty God, who hath diſpenſed his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Truth ſo many ways beſides: as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt by <hi>Reading;</hi> for though when Gods
Word was preached only, it could be only
heard; yet when it was a Scripture, it might
be known, as all other Writings, by reading
alſo:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13.</note> for this reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets <hi>Timothy</hi> to
his Book, <hi>Till I come give attendance to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
Search the Scriptures, for therein you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:49996:53"/>
think you have eternal life;</hi> and ſearch we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
unleſs we read them, that by reading we
may find the way to eternal life: yea, though
all were to be done by preaching, Reading is
that too: <hi>For Moſes had in old time them that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, being read in the Synagogues every Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
Acts 15. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By <hi>writing,</hi> Gods Word works
Faith in us, if S. <hi>John</hi> was not miſtaken when
he ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Theſe things have I written unto you, that
ye may know ye have eternal life, and that ye may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in the name of the Son of God.</hi> Good wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are in their kind good Preachers. Why
then ſhould any be ſcandalized at the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that looks upon his Book where his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is written. Indeed, if men now were
to ſpeak as the Apoſtles did, <hi>as the Spirit gave
them utterance,</hi> it were a great miſtake to look
for him in a Book: But if we, as all muſt take
Gods Word out of the Scripture; and every
Preacher, if he be not too bold with God and
his Auditors, that he may ſpeak from thence
what is both true and ſeaſonable, prepares by
writing that which he is to preach; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
is the ſame in the Pulpit that it was in the
ſtudy, and though the Preacher that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> looks in
his Book be the worſe, the Sermon I am ſure
is not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:49996:53"/>
Thirdly, We may receive the fruit of
God's Word in the virtuous life and <hi>example</hi> of
others; for this St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>holding forth
the VVord of Life,</hi> Phil. 2. 16. <hi>That ye may be
blameleſs, the Sons of God, without rebuke, holding
forth the VVord of Life; i. e.</hi> it is viſible and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
in all our actions and demeanour. Thus
a Man may be a Preacher of God's Word,
though he be not in Orders: Yea, Women,
that are forbidden to ſpeak in the Church,
may thus convert their Husbands at home.
<hi>Likewiſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>ye VVives be in ſubjection to your Husbands,
that if any obey not the Word</hi> (that is, when it is
preached) <hi>they alſo may without the Word be won
by the converſation of the Wife.</hi> So power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and effectual is God's Word, that it
works by example, though in the weakeſt
Veſſels.</p>
                  <p>There be divers ways of preaching in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
more proper ſenſe, beſides the Sermon; for
preaching is either <hi>publick</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> as we
learn from St. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20. 20. where he
gives account to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> of
himſelf, <hi>That he had taught them publickly,
and from houſe to houſe.</hi> Sure he did not
make a formal Sermon in every houſe he
came into, but as occaſion and opportunity
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49996:54"/>
was given, by Conference he made known to
them the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> Again, Publick preaching is not all of a
kind; for that may be, either by <hi>laying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> as
the Apoſtle calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1. which we
call Catechizing. If this be not Preaching,
if <hi>laying the Foundation</hi> be not edifying, we ſhall
make but a ſorry Building. If this Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Faith be not well laid, every new wind
of Doctrine that riſes blows it ſtraight down
again.</p>
                  <p>In theſe ſeveral ways, beſides the Sermon,
is God's Word effectual. Now if we put all
theſe under the buſhel, and ſet up the Sermon
only, we had need take heed how we hear
that; for if that wherein all our hope and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
lies ſhould go under the buſhel too, we
are in a ſad caſe.</p>
                  <p>It will therefore neerly concern us to take
heed, That God's Word be not loſt in the
Sermon, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the <hi>power</hi> of it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the evident conviction of truth; be not
loſt in formalities and impertinences, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
us'd in Sermons.</p>
                  <p>As when little regard is given by ſome to
God's Word, unleſs the Sermon preſents it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49996:54"/>
ſelf dreſs'd up with all the curioſities of Art,
Language, and Phanſie too; which ſometimes
ſo diſguiſes it, as it can hardly be known from
a <hi>Poem.</hi> But for the true uſe of Ornaments
of Art and Speech, if they make us love our
duties the more, as they make us more in love
with hearing, I ſhould think it well beſtow'd.
But if painted Sermons be like painted Glaſs,
that makes a Room beautiful, but intercepts
too much the light, it may well go in the
rank too of thoſe things which put God's
Word under the buſhel.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is done too with a courſer ſort of
Forms, which have no title to be <hi>divine,</hi> but
that they <hi>want humane</hi> Learning. And yet if
God's Word be not in that jejune formal dreſs,
it will not be ſo kindly received by thoſe who
out of a ſeeming tenderneſs of the liberty of
God's Word, are afraid that the Churches
Form ſhould bind it, and ſpare not to fetter
it in cold formalities of their own, in which it
languiſheth to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Again, God's Word muſt needs be put
under a buſhel, when it is put <hi>into</hi> the buſhel;
I mean, when it is heard by <hi>Meaſure:</hi> I do
not mean the meaſure of Faith here in the
Text, the meaſure of the Sanctuary; but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49996:55"/>
the common Market-meaſure; as when we
muſt have an Hour-glaſs full at leaſt, and
ſomwhat running over, to make a juſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
though the particulars be as incoherent
both with the Text and themſelves, as the
<hi>ſand</hi> that meaſures them; yet if it runs on
ſmoothly, and fills up the time, all is well.</p>
                  <p>There is as little good from Sermons when
they are heard by <hi>Tale;</hi> if we have not our
full number, as well as our full meaſure, two
at the leaſt a day, the poor people are ſtarv'd.</p>
                  <p>They would pity my ſimplicity, if I ſhould
take upon me to confute it out of vain Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
and tell them out of it, That <hi>quantitatis
nulla eſt efficacia:</hi> I ſhall, with their good
leaves,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 1.</note> from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (out of the place I na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before) to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſhew them, That
there is no efficacy in <hi>quantity:</hi> What a bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll
of ſins doth he lay at their doors that heap
to themſelves Teachers? There was a heap
of ſins under a heap of Sermons. And no
wonder; for being after their own luſt, the
more commonly the worſe.</p>
                  <p>There be many other things to be taken
heed of in hearing, which intercept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the light of God's Word: But becauſe
the time wears away, I will add but one
more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:49996:55"/>
That out of ignorance or ill will we do <hi>not
miſconſtrue</hi> what we hear; as St. <hi>Peter</hi> obſerv'd
ſome to do with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which
they <hi>wreſted to their own deſtruction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this I rather add in my own defence,
leſt that which is ſpoken in favour of hearing,
ſhould be interpreted a diſcouragement to it;
becauſe people generally are not ſo well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as they ſhould be to ſo good a duty, who
had more need of fire to heat them, than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to cool them.</p>
                  <p>It had been to better purpoſe, you will ſay,
if I had taken my Text out of St. <hi>James; Be
ſwift to hear.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I beſeech you not to be miſtaken.
That which hath been ſaid doth not take us
off our ſpeed: We may be ſtill as ſwift to hear
as our Zeal can carry us. It puts us only in
our right way, that we <hi>do not run in vain.</hi> It is
only to take God's Word from under the
buſhel, where it doth no good; that we may
ſet it on the candleſtick, from whence we may
receive the light of it, and in that the benefit
of our Saviour's advice, to <hi>take heed how we
hear;</hi> which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of our care in
the affirmative, by ſetting Gods VVord on
the candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:49996:56"/>
TO ſet God's VVord on the Candleſtick,
is to ſet it where we may receive the
light of it; and that is, firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> By a <hi>particular</hi> uſe and application of it to our
ſelves that hear; for though Preachers have
commonly theſe words in their Sermons,
Uſes, and Application, and they know beſt
why they uſe them, I do not; for ſure I am,
they are more proper to the Hearers. The
Preacher gives the Doctrine, but the Hearers
muſt make the Uſe and Application. No
Preacher can ſay, as <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art
the Man;</hi> unleſs he have a ſpecial Commiſſion,
as he had from God. No Preacher hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
to our Conſciences; at that Bar every man
muſt be his own Judge and VVitneſs, and as
there ſhall be cauſe, pronounce Sentence
againſt himſelf, <hi>Thou art the Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we ſit at the Sermon as men unconcern'd
for any thing but the hearing of it, to us it is all
one as if it had been ſtill under the Buſhel, and
not upon the Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>If we hear, and make no uſe of it, we leave
out the beſt part of the Sermon; for the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
make bad Sermons, as well as Preachers.</p>
                  <p>But when a fault or error is reprehended,
muſt every Hearer pronounce himſelf guilty!
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49996:56"/>
Certainly No; for that were injuſtice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the innocent. Though the Sermon
condemns not every man that hears it, yet it
puts every man upon his trial, to let the light
into his own boſom, to ſee whether he be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or not. If guilty, let him do as guilty men
do, ſue for mercy, and pardon, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
If not guilty, let him enjoy the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
of that, <hi>If our heart condemns us not, then have
we confidence towards God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 21. And
<hi>happy is he that condemneth not himſelf,</hi> Rom. 14.
22. Guilty, or not guilty, we have benefit by
the light that actually ſhines upon us; for ſo
it doth in the Candleſtick.</p>
                  <p>A light in a Candleſtick <hi>inlightens</hi> every one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                     <hi>alike</hi> that comes into the room. If a light be
brought to us which none can ſee but he that
brings it, it may very well be ſuſpected to be
none of God's Lights, becauſe it will not
ſtand in a Candleſtick, ſo as to be ſeen by
others. And many ſuch there be, who muſt
be allowed to hold ſpecial intelligence with
God, and by private illumination from the
Spirit, ſee clearer and farther into the darkeſt
Myſteries than any of the Doctors or <hi>Rabbies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They put me in mind of ſome, though not
the beſt ſort of Creatures, yet in the dark ſee
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49996:57"/>
better than others; as the <hi>Owle,</hi> the Cat, and
the Bat: of which I have known <hi>Philoſophers</hi>
give this reaſon: That rays of light do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſtream from their eyes, by which the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
and Air about is inlightned; This at beſt,
if there be any ſuch, is a light which none ſees
but themſelves. Now if thoſe illuminated
ſeers be ſuch that their light is not where Gods
Word ſhould be in a Candleſtick, where it
may be ſeen of all, it is indeed no better than
<hi>Owles light</hi> that ſhines only out of their own
eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> A light in a Candleſtick doth not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
all the <hi>perſons,</hi> but all the <hi>parts</hi> alſo of the
room, every corner, the darkeſt and moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
places: it ſhines not only upon our
cloaths and faces, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> our outward faſhion
and demeanor, but as God requireth <hi>truth in
the inwards parts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 6.</note> thither muſt the light go too,
to the moſt retired Cloſets and Cabinets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
to the very thoughts and intentions of the
heart. <hi>It is ſharper than any two-edged Sword that
enters between the joynt and the marrow.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 12.</note> Light
will pierce through where no Sword can go,
at the leaſt hole and creviſe. If all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of greateſt ſecrecy receive not light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from Gods Word, we do not ſet it in
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49996:57"/>
a Candleſtick, for there nothing is hid from
the light thereof.</p>
                  <p>A Candle in a Candleſtick, as it gives light <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/>
to every part of the room, ſo it doth to <hi>all</hi> the
<hi>work</hi> and buſineſs in it. It ſhews not only the
end of all eternal reſt and happineſs, but is a
light unto the paths that lead to it. It holds
us not only upon the gaze of the glory and joys
of Heaven, but carries us through the darker
myſteries of faith, and the more unpleaſing
ways of Repentance and Mortification. The
Goſpel is not <hi>the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> unleſs
it be alſo the power of God upon all the ſteps
and degrees to it. In a Candleſtick it is a light
all over, from one ſide of the room to the other.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, From Gods Word in a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
we do <hi>Totam lucem recipere,</hi> take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the whole light in all the effects and
operations of it. It is a word of inſtruction,
a word of exhortation, a word of comfort, a
word of reproof, a word of promiſe, and a
word of command, and ſo ſerves us in all our
neceſſities. It inſtructs the ignorant, corrects
the obſtinate, comforts the dejected, dejects
the proud, quiets the paſſions, invites by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
binds by commands.</p>
                  <p>If we pick and chuſe, lay hold on the word
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49996:58"/>
of conſolation, not of correction; of promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
not of commands. We take the light as
men do out of a <hi>dark</hi> Lanthorn, from one ſide
only, no more than looks towards our private
ends and intereſt. But in a Candleſtick the
light dilates it ſelf impartially in all the ſeveral
powers of it; there is no parcelling or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in that, all or none; we muſt <hi>totam lucem
recipere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much difference we ſee there is between
Gods Word in a Candleſtick, and under a
Buſhel; and how much benefit comes by the
one, and how little by the other. If we take
not heed to this, we fall into the common, but
dangerous error. That when we have heard
the Sermon; we have done our duty for that
time, though we neither heed what or how
we hear. And yet according to that only,
Sermons are, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of them in the
perſon of the Preacher, <hi>A ſavour of life,</hi> or <hi>a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of death.</hi> As the <hi>evil ſervant</hi> was judg'd out
of his own mouth, ſo ſhall the careleſs hearer
out of his own ears. And more I could not
ſay, if I had more time. It is that whereon
life or death depends; therefore <hi>Take heed what
you hear.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>ND] is a word that takes hold
of ſomething that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
without which the ſenſe
of that which follows is not
full. That which went next
before is, <hi>We beſeech you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
more and more. We beſeech you,</hi> is that we
are to take into the Text, and then it runs
thus, <hi>We beſeech you to ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But all the uſe I ſhall make of it, now we
have it here, is but to give you a taſte before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
of the nature and quality of this duty,
That it is no trivial thing little to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that which obliged S. <hi>Paul, Sylvanus,</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49996:60"/>
and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> for they all joyn'd in it, to be
ſo earneſt, as to beſeech them to ſtudy to be
quiet. 2. And that which commends this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the more is, (as we uſe to ſay, Men are beſt
known by the company they keep) <hi>And]</hi>
brings in this Duty in the company of the beſt
of Vertues, Charity, for that place S. <hi>Paul</hi>
gives it above all;<note place="margin">Col. 3. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Above all things put on Charity,
which is the bond of perfection.</hi> To ſtudy to be
quiet, and to increaſe in brotherly love and
charity, for that led the way before, are two
duties bound together in the ſame Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
3. Quiet is not only a fit companion for
Charity, but an Allie to it, and grows out of
it, as the branch out of the ſtock; for where
brotherly love is, there will be alwayes quiet
too. 4. To make all ſuit the better with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
the Exhortation is advanced by a Dialect
of Love, <hi>VVe beſeech you. Paul, Sylvanus,</hi> and
<hi>Timotheus,</hi> were all Apoſtolical men, and might
command, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> of himſelf in another
caſe to <hi>Philemon, Though I might be bold to enjoyn
thee, yet for loves ſake I rather beſeech you.</hi> And
laſtly, that which might very well ſet this
edge upon their affections, was, that which
happened to the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> at their firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion;
for this Epiſtle was written imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49996:60"/>
after. The ſtory we have in the 17.
<hi>chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts:</hi> When S. <hi>Paul</hi> had preach'd
the Goſpel to them, and with good ſucceſs;
for <hi>v. 4. Some of them believed, and conſorted with</hi>
Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas, <hi>and of the devout Greeks a great
multitude, and of the chief women not a few,</hi> But
<hi>v. 5. The Jews who believed not, moved with envy,
took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baſer ſort,
and gathered a company, and ſet all the City in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar,
and aſſaulted the houſe of</hi> Jaſon, <hi>and ſought to
bring them out to the people;</hi> mad enough of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but the more to ferment and enrage
them, they charge the Apoſtles with the fault
that they themſelves were acting; <hi>Theſe are
they that turn the world upſide-down.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eſcaped this fury by going to <hi>Athens,</hi> and
there conſidering in what a caſe he left his
new Converts, both them and their Doctrine;
them in a furious tumult, and their Doctrine
under the reproach of troubling the world;
out of a zeal, no doubt, and deſire to remove
that ſcandal from the Faith, of all things begs
and beſeecheth them to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how will this concern us? I wiſh we
never had, and had not ſtill the ſame occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
It is not ſo long ſince, that we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
how our late troubles firſt brake in upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49996:61"/>
our quiet: We had unbelieving Jews then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us too, and ſome, as was thought,
in the literal ſenſe; who moved with envy
of the times, took unto them likewiſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of lewd fellows of the baſer ſort, ſet the
City in an uproar; and we may remember
whoſe houſes they beſet (as the Jews did <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons)</hi>
none of the meaneſt, and cried out for
that juſtice which themſelves deſerved. And
there were Religions in the world then too
many, to the ſcandal of the true, who led on,
and blew up thoſe tumults: And even now,
though (God be thanked) they dare not be
ſo bold to aſſault us in the ſtreets, and beſet
our houſes as they did then; yet ſtill keep their
quarters and leaguers within doors, with more
ſecreſie, but no leſs danger.</p>
                  <p>It will not therefore be unſeaſonable for us
now, who have the ſame cauſe the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi>
had, with the ſame affection the Apoſtle did,
to beſeech you to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet.</hi> We have
all need of quiet, and quiet it ſeems hath need
of ſtudy, and ſtudy hath need of Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and therefore before we proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Let us pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:49996:61"/>
THe parts of the Text are two; <hi>VVhat</hi> we
are to ſtudy, And <hi>That</hi> we are to ſtudy.
Firſt, What? <hi>That ye ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Quiet is here commended under the notion
and quality of an Art or Science; for we are
injoyned to ſtudy it. And in them we are to
look, firſt, to the object, the nature and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it; and then to the Principles and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems</hi>
whereon the Art is grounded.</p>
                  <p>1. For the nature and kind of this Quiet
firſt: For there be many things lay claim to
this word, which are either unfit for our ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or improper to this place. As firſt, there
is a quiet from all motion or action that is good
or uſeful; to do nothing but eat and drink
and ſleep, or worſe; Away with that quiet;
it neither deſerves our ſtudy, nor needs it.
This is <hi>Negotioſa quies;</hi> we are commanded in
the words following to be buſie as well as qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et;
we are both to ſtudy to be quiet, and to
do our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>2. There is a Quiet, not ſimply from all,
but <hi>publick</hi> buſineſs; when men retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
for private ſtudy or devotion. This may
be allowed, and commended too, when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities
of their Countries requires them not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:49996:62"/>
But becauſe publick imployments are ſeldome
forced upon any, nor need to be; for no mans
parts or abilities are ſo great, which may not
truly, and certainly will be thought ſuch as
can very well be ſpared. They therefore who
affect that privacy, may be ſecure from that
neceſſity; they who have a will to be quiet
for devotion or ſtudy, need not ſtudy to be
quiet, the acceſs to that is eaſie enough.</p>
                  <p>3. There is another Quiet, more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
in its ſelf, and needs our ſtudy too;
To compoſe our unruly and diſordered <hi>paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
and affections, which raiſe tumults and
commotions within us, that will not ſuffer us
to be at reſt or quiet day or night. In the midſt
therefore of all the temptations of good, or
ſtorms of ill fortune to reſt ſecurely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly,
whatſoever happens to our private,
is certainly an admirable temper, and well
worthy our beſt care and ſtudy; and was that
which S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf it ſeems ſtudied, for he
ſaid he learned it;<note place="margin">Phil. 4. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>I have learned in what eſtate
ſoever I am, therewith to be content.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the quiet we are here to ſtudy is not
properly within us, but without us; it is not
ſimply a quiet from motion, but commotion,
a troubling of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:49996:62"/>
4. And that I may contract my argument
and bring it into as narrow a compaſs as may
be, I ſhall not take in every of the diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
of the quiet of others: No not that which
is the greateſt of all, and moſt contrary to
peace and quiet, <hi>Civil Wars</hi> and broils. The
miſchiefs of that we have learned ſo lately to
our coſt, and ſo perfectly, that I hope we need
not be ſet to ſtudy that now: when every
good man was put to his ſtudy how to live,
and when vile and contemptible wretches
ranted in plenty and power.</p>
                  <p>The horrid fruits and conſequences of that
great diſturber of quiet, <hi>War,</hi> have induc'd
ſome learned men as well as others to think
all wars unlawful; I ſhould have been much
inclined to that opinion upon the ſtricteſt rules
of Chriſtianity, if War were not ſometimes
neceſſary to Peace. A <hi>foreign</hi> War for that
reaſon may be lawful, but a <hi>civil</hi> and domeſtick
never. And the reaſon of this difference is,
becauſe for the compoſing of all quarrels that
may ariſe between ſubjects, God hath by his
Ordinance provided a remedy in <hi>Princes</hi> and
Magiſtrates, from whom alone we are to ſeek
for revenge or defence. But for ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
as ariſe between free Princes and States,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49996:63"/>
becauſe there is no Judg on earth, to whom
they may have recourſe for their relief, being
deſtitute of the common remedy, they may,
without queſtion, make uſe of that ſword
which God hath put into their hands to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſfnd
their ſubjects from the iniuries as well of
ſtrangers as their own. Nor are they in this
Judges in their own cauſe, which hath ſome
appearance of injuſtice; for a foreign War,
for defect of a competent Judg on Earth, is
but an <hi>appeal</hi> to the ſupreme Judg of Heaven
and Earth. And when they go into the Field,
it is but to plead their cauſe before God, with
whom are the iſſues of War. Only they had
need be careful, that the cauſe they bring be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him be good; For <hi>ſhall not the Judg of all
the world do right?</hi> But we muſt leave this to
Princes and their Miniſters, who are the only
proper ſtudents of that quiet, which is diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
by War, and come to that which may and
muſt be the ſtudy of us all: That is, <hi>a quiet
from troubles that ariſe from different judgments and
perſwaſions in matters of Religion,</hi> which cauſe
ſects and diviſions in it, though they break
not out into an open War. Not that War
be quite left out of the Sectaries reckoning.
For though Civil Wars and Rebellions have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49996:63"/>
their beginning for the moſt part from the
ambition or diſcontent of a few, yet becauſe
the people, who are the neceſſary inſtruments
of that miſchief, be not apt to ſerve the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of others, if it comes bare-faced to them,
the mask of Religion is always put on, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
all people are concerned, which makes it a
common and popular intereſt. And therefore
you ſhall ſcarce hear of a Rebellion of late
times, in which Religion did not carry the
<hi>Colours</hi> at leaſt, it not command in chief.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall nevertheleſs at this time forbear
to make that any part of the Schiſmaticks
charge, but treat them upon their own terms,
that they are as great enemies to War as any
that object it to them: Yet I muſt charge
them all to be guilty of the breach of peace and
quiet in the Church, and that not accidentally,
which may ſometimes bear excuſe, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily;
it is connatural and incident to the
very nature of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is a rent or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
ſo the word ſignifies. It is the worſt
diſturbance that can be to any body, to be
torn in pieces. It diſſolves the bonds by which
the parts are joyned together, eſpecially that
which unites them to the Head; for <hi>ſchiſm</hi> in
the Churches notion is properly a ſeparation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49996:64"/>
from the Head and authority, and is the ſame
in the Church that Rebellion or Treaſon is in
the State. Now as every diſobedience to the
King and the Law is not Treaſon, though
againſt the King, but the diſclaiming the <hi>right</hi>
and power the King hath to govern, and the
practice of ſuch things, by which his <hi>Regalia</hi>
and rights are uſurpt by others, as to make
War, to make Laws, to thruſt Officers upon
him, to order the Coin, theſe and of the like
kind are only Treaſon. So every error or
diſobedience in Religion makes not a ſchiſm,
but the diſclaiming the right and power the
Church hath to govern them, and a uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a right to themſelves, to order and
frame points of Belief, and Forms how to
ſerve and worſhip God, apart from the
Church, for ſo went the ſtyle of the ancient
Church for Schiſm, <hi>altare contra altare,</hi> which
in our modern dialect is a <hi>Conventicle</hi> againſt
the <hi>Church.</hi> For though Schiſm be formally
a ſeparation from the Head, yet conſequently
it works upon the members; for that which
was at firſt but difference of opinion, ſoon
begets a diſaffection, and from that grows to
hatred and contempt, and ſo falls into the
practice of ſuch things as deſtroy the very
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49996:64"/>
being and power of Religion, which conſiſts
in the mutual offices of Charity; and though
this miſchief breaks not out into an actual
War, yet is always accompanied with moſt
unnatural and unchriſtian practices, as S.
<hi>James</hi> long ſince obſerved, <hi>Jam. 3. 16. Where
envy and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil
work.</hi> Now to avoid all this, it will highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
us to <hi>ſtudy to be quiet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having cleared the firſt Point, the Object
of our ſtudy, <hi>Quiet,</hi> and wherein the <hi>formalis
ratio</hi> of it conſiſts, and how it comes to be
diſturbed by Schiſm: The next Point is, to
enquire into the <hi>Principles</hi> whereon we are to
ground our ſtudy; for if there ſhould be an
errour or miſtake in them, all our labour and
ſtudy is loſt, or worſe; for an inveterate,
grounded, ſtudied errour is ſo much the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to be reclaimed. It was no unreaſonable
demand therefore of the Philoſopher, who
asked a double reward for thoſe Scholars that
had been already entred into the ſtudy of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
becauſe his pains would be double
with them, to undo firſt, and caſt out thoſe falſe
prejudices which they had already learned.</p>
                  <p>Now if it ſhould happen, that they which
are otherwiſe ſtudious and deſirous of peace,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49996:65"/>
ſhould not do <hi>the things that make for peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> as the
Apoſtle requires, our ſtudy will grow upon
us, firſt to unlearn thoſe falſe deceitful princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of peace, before we enquire into the true:
Of ſome of the chief of theſe therefore I ſhall
give you an account in the firſt place. It will
conduce much to the peace of the Church,
they ſay, Firſt,</p>
                  <p>1. If Religion were free, and all <hi>compulſory</hi>
means forborne.</p>
                  <p>2. If meer Errours in Judgment howſoever were

                  <p>3. Or if that, yet <hi>(Thirdly)</hi> That omiſsion of
<hi>Forms</hi> and Ceremonies were not more ſeverely and
frequently puniſhed, than notorious and <hi>ſcandalous</hi>
crimes.</p>
                  <p>4. If fewer Articles and Points of Religion were
<hi>defined,</hi> it would make more room in the Church for
thoſe that diſſent.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Another is,</hi> If men of <hi>moderate</hi> Opinions

                  <p>6. The <hi>laſt,</hi> and moſt importunate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender

                  </p>
                  <p>But that none of all theſe are things that
make for peace, I ſhall ſhew with as much
brevity as the matter is capable of; as firſt,</p>

                     </gap>. Not the <hi>forbearance of all compulſory means</hi>
by puniſhments, which, they ſay, is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to that freeneſs with which Religion
ſhould be entertained, and only forces men to
an hypocritical obedience to that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which in
in their judgments they deteſt.</p>
                  <p>Religion, I grant, ſhould be free; it is no
Religion which is not ſo; But it is as true,
that every other act of vertue, and obedience
to the Laws ſhould be free likewiſe; but
therefore not to puniſh them that tranſgreſs,
were to proclaim a perpetual <hi>Jubile,</hi> and ſet
open all priſon doors; God would never have
enjoyned the Magiſtrate to puniſh temporally,
nor himſelf threatned to puniſh eternally, if
the fear of that did corrupt our obedience:
For our Saviour in the <hi>Parable,</hi> when the
gueſts came not to the <hi>banquet</hi> at his invitation,<note place="margin">Luk. 14. 23</note>
commanded his ſervants to <hi>compel them to come in.</hi>
And where they ſay, the fruit of that is but
hypocriſie; Hypocrites they are like enough
to be, but from a worſe cauſe, not from the
puniſhment, but their own frailties, becauſe
they prefer their temporal ſafety before the
eternal bleſſing which Chriſt hath promiſed
to all that ſuffer for his ſake and the truth. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
It is true, that puniſhments reach not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49996:66"/>
directly the inward man, nor do they teach or
inform the Judgment, that is, they do not
perfect the work; but are nevertheleſs a good
beginning to it: For, <hi>Fear is the beginning of
VViſdom,</hi> which <hi>Love</hi> muſt <hi>perfect.</hi> Though
the <hi>Needle</hi> ſtays not in the Garment, yet it muſt
lead the Thred that makes it up. The Rod
indeed doth not teach the child, yet ſcares him
to his book where he may learn: So though
puniſhments do not perfect and accompliſh
our duty, yet they ſet us to our ſtudies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that we do not raſhly caſt our ſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
danger, which otherwiſe poſſibly we would
never think off, but run on whither our wild
vain fancies and groundleſs perſwaſions led
us: For <hi>Spes impunitatis eſt illecebra peccandi.</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
therefore are both juſtified for the
good they do, and are abſolved from the evil
they are pretended to do; and therefore
wholly to forbear them in matters of Religion
is no good principle whereon to ground the
Churches peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
                     <hi>The next is,</hi> That howſoever it be in other matters
of Religion, it would make much for the quiet of the
Church, if Errors in Judgment were not puniſhed as
crimes, becauſe no man can be abler and wiſer than
God hath made him.</p>

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:49996:66"/>
It is true, that an Error, ſo long as it ſtays
in the Underſtanding, and goes no further is
not properly a ſin; for the Underſtanding is
not <hi>agens liberum,</hi> but paſſive. In that the eye
of the mind is as the eye of the body; if that
be naturally ſhort-ſighted, it is no fault that it
ſees not ſo far as another: But if the weakneſs
of the Underſtanding participate with the
Will, which is <hi>agens liberum,</hi> and ſo the Error
comes within our power, then it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
a ſin. This is the caſe of all that diſſent
in <hi>Sects;</hi> for though in <hi>ſpeculation</hi> the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is diſtinct from the Will, yet in <hi>prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi>
they are ſeldom ſevered. For it is morally
impoſſible, that after a man hath conceived an
opinion, he ſhould not be well pleaſed with it,
and have a will as occaſion is to defend and
propagate it too. And when it is <hi>Voluntarium,</hi>
no doubt but it is <hi>Peccatum,</hi> and when error
grows to be a ſin, I know no reaſon why it
may not be puniſhed; for <hi>intereſt reipublicae pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata
puniri.</hi> But for all that it is, they ſay, a
great diſturbance of quiet to be tied to aſſent
to that we cannot know nor comprehend.
That's a great miſtake. I know there is much
exception taken to the too punctual <hi>definitions</hi>
of ſome myſteries of the faith, and particularly
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49996:67"/>
in the Creed commonly called by <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>
where there are many particulars which they
cannot know nor comprehend. Whereas in
truth it is not required of them, they are not
bound to <hi>know</hi> them, but to <hi>believe</hi> them; for
it is the mercy of God, that the defect of our
knowledg may be ſupplyed by the knowledg
of others; for to believe is to ſee with other
mens eyes, as knowledg is with our own.</p>
                  <p>But may we ſafely <hi>truſt</hi> others in that
which ſo neerly concerns as a <hi>Creed?</hi> Yes ſure,
and it is as well the mercy, as the command of
God, that we ſhould truſt thoſe that watch
over our ſouls; yet ſtill that muſt be to ſupply
the defect of our knowledg, not otherwiſe;
for the Church is not Lord of our Faith, but
helper of our Ignorance. It ſupplies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of our ſight, it doth not put it out: for if a
man knows the contrary, he is not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
others; for if he can ſee with his own eyes,
why ſhall he be tied to ſee with other mens?</p>
                  <p>But then we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt not
knowing the <hi>negative,</hi> and a <hi>poſitive</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the contrary: for if we refuſe to believe
meerly becauſe we do not know or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
we leave no place for Faith at all, which
is the benefit to ſee by others. And for that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49996:67"/>
poſitive knowledg which diſcharges us of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
others that we be not miſtaken, it is not
every conjectural or probable perſwaſion will
do it, but certain knowledg: and when that
is, we may ſafely learn from the Schools; <hi>Ubi
non eſt formido contrarii,</hi> after diligent ſearch and
enquiry, when there remains no ſcruple, doubt,
or fear of the contrary, when the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is fixed, we are ſaid to be certain.</p>
                  <p>If this knowledge will ſerve to diſcharge us
of believing others, every one that diſſents will
ſay he knows the contrary, yea, and if need be
will ſwear to it too; for that's an expedient
lately found out to obtain that <hi>liberty,</hi> That
they may be admitted to ſwear they know the
contrary to that which is commanded. Truly,
if they will ſay it, and think ſo too, whether
they ſwear it or no, I think we may ſafely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
them from the guilt of diſobedience: but
that muſt be <hi>in foro Conſcientiae</hi> only, and let
them make the beſt uſe they can of that; yet
<hi>in foro externo</hi> we cannot; for there the Judge
muſt give ſentence according to <hi>his</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and not according to the knowledge of
the <hi>party,</hi> if he will do juſtice. And that courſe
can be no good friend to Peace, which is an
enemy to Juſtice.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, That they who
object this, are not to be truſted with the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance

went for them when they held the Scale: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the King and the Laws, and ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God according to them, were the great
ſcandalous crimes.</p>
                  <p>2. Allowing it to be true as they ſay, That
omiſſion of Forms and Ceremonies is by the
Church more frequently and ſeverely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then <hi>greater</hi> faults. But how greater? It
may be in their <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> guilt and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity,
according to which ſentence ſhall be
given at the day of Judgment, and to death
eternal. But our earthly Tribunals are not
erected to anticipate the day of Judgment, to
bring all ſinners to trial for whatſoever they
have committed in the fleſh, and according
to the proper <hi>meaſure</hi> of their guilt; but for
a particular end and <hi>uſe;</hi> that people, while
they live here in the world, and in ſociety,
may be kept in good order and quiet, from
doing or receiving injuries. And to this end
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49996:68"/>
is the degree of their puniſhments commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate:
Treaſon and Rebellion are more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
puniſhed in the State then many other
hainous crimes, becauſe they deſtroy the very
foundation of government and Society. And
for the ſame reaſon, a ſchiſmatical diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
though but in matters of Form and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
is purſued with more care and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
becauſe it deſtroys the very end for which
the power is given the Church to puniſh,
which is, the preſervation of peace and unity.</p>
                  <p>For though the Paſtors of the Church may
and muſt by way of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> the better to
prepare us for our account at the great and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Judgment, give every ſin the proper
weight and meaſure of guilt, that is by way of
<hi>Inſtruction:</hi> But by way of <hi>Correction</hi> the Church
is bound up to certain cauſes, and if they keep
not their bounds, they ſhall be ſure to hear of
a <hi>prohibition;</hi> and thoſe cauſes are eſpecially
ſuch, for which the power is only given,
That the peaceable orderly Worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God be not diſturbed.</p>
                  <p>For though they are ever telling us, it is
for trifles, ceremonies, or <hi>indifferent</hi> things,
it is but the ſame quarrel the <hi>Atheiſts</hi> have

for an <hi>Apple,</hi> a trifle which ſcarce any

both in effect. In that forbidden fruit, Gods
authority in commanding, and <hi>Adams</hi> duty in
obeying, were <hi>ſymbolically</hi> engaged for him
and his, and there was venome enough in that
to infect both. The Rites and Ceremonies of
the Church, in like manner, though not in

as the <hi>paring</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> apple, yet
when diſcord and diſobedience is found with
them, there is poyſon enough in that for the
ſtrongeſt antidote the Church doth at any
time make uſe of. Let not that therefore miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead

look at as another Expedient for Peace, <hi>If

that ſo the Church-door may be wider open
to let in thoſe whoſe diſſent now troubles the
peace of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It is fit, I grant, the Church-door ſhould
ſtand always open, but for ſuch as ſhall be fit
to enter; for it would be a dangerous thing to
ſet any door ſo wide open to let in an enemy

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49996:69"/>
the Church-door ſo wide, when the Gate of
Heaven is ſtrait? why ſhould they be taken
in here, if they ſhall be turned back there?
The Church is a City, as <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a City that
is at unity in it ſelf; ſo it is a City too that hath
gates and walls to ſhut out others.</p>
                  <p>He that came to a <hi>little</hi> City, where there
was a great Gate, merrily warned the Citizens
to take heed leſt their City went not out at the
Gate, may ſoberly be ſaid to thoſe that would
have the Church-door ſo wide to let in all
Sects, to take heed leſt the Church gets not
out at the door: For where ſo many Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are, it may be feared, that ſoon there will be
none at all. If we be not, as the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
built up in the ſame Faith, it will avail
us little to be found within the ſame walls.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore a perverſe remedy for peace,
to abate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or diminiſh the <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>definitions</hi>
of the Church, which were made of purpoſe to

backward, if he ſeek for peace from hence. We
might as well ſay, all the world would be

                     <hi>Moderation,</hi> I confeſs, is an excellent vertue,
and much to be deſired; <hi>Let your moderation be
known unto all men,</hi> Phil. 4. 5. But then it muſt
be in a ſubject capable of it, wherein there are
extremes and exceſſes to be moderated, as
there is certainly in our paſſions, there it is
proper. S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it for a Leſſon to all
Students in Religion, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 31. Let all bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs,
and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil
ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and
be ye kind one to another, and tender-hearted, forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one another, even as God for Chriſts ſake hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
you.</hi> This no doubt is a very fit temper
for quiet, and none more unfit then angry,
waſpiſh, and domineering ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Only this caution is to be obſerved in lenity,
That it be ſuch as may win men into the
Church, not ſuch as may ſecure and encourage
them to ſtay without. Yet lenity and gentleneſs
is ſo good a Vertue, that I am loth to caſt water
upon it, or ſeem to temper it.</p>
                  <p>But for men of moderate opinions, I am
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49996:70"/>
at a loſs to know what they ſhould be; for
moderation there cannot be, but between ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams:
Now what extreams are there of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
in a ſetled Church, unleſs the <hi>Church</hi>
be one extream, and the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> another?
and then the man of moderate opinions is he
that is part Church-man, and part Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
I hope none are ſo unkind to their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Church, to charge extremities upon
her Doctrine or Laws. If there be any ſuch,
they are but <hi>Hybrides</hi> in Religion, and make a
new ſect in the Church, as pernicious to the
peace of it as any of the reſt. The truth is,
moderate opinions are a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a phanſie;
either nothing, or ſomewhat worſe then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
for poſſibly they may beſtow that good
word (Moderation) upon ſuch as care little
either to obſerve the <hi>Law</hi> themſelves, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it of others. If theſe be the men of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
opinions, I wonder how they will be
able to give account of their juſtice and fidelity
to the <hi>truſt</hi> committed to them. Yes, they
ſay, very well; It is rather prudence then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
to mitigate and ſweeten the ſharpneſs
and rigour of the Law. But if the Law it ſelf
be too rigorous, in God's name let it be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and not left to the arbitrary power of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49996:71"/>
others to do it, for that's known to be a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ten times worſe then the diſeaſe. It is ſaid
in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> I know not how truly, that an
error in the firſt concoction, is not mended in
the ſecond: It is certainly true here, an error
or exceſs in the Law, which is the firſt conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of juſtice, will be ill cured afterward by
an arbitrary partiality in the execution. I
hope therefore no wiſe Student of quiet, will
take ſuch Moderators for the beſt Miniſters of
peace. But I leave them, and come to the
moſt popular, and therefore moſt dangerous
principle in the ſtudy of quiet; that is, <hi>Liberty
of Conſcience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/> I have ſpoken to this point heretofore in
this place; yet becauſe of late our <hi>New Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical</hi>
Divines, as well as others, preſs hard
for it, knowing without a free Market, they
cannot vend their new bold ſpeculations; I
ſhall reſume the point again a little more
largely, yet within the compaſs of theſe two
particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there is a great deal of reaſon
to <hi>reſtrain</hi> the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and Secondly, That
there is no reaſon to give it <hi>liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. There is reaſon enough to <hi>reſtrain the
Conſcience,</hi> for the miſchief it doth to Quiet
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:49996:71"/>
when it is at liberty; for all the diſcord and
diviſions of the Church grow from hence, and
that is a miſchief we have reaſon to avoid.
<hi>Mark them</hi> (ſaith S.<note place="margin">Rom. 16. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul) which cauſe diviſions
among you, and avoid them.</hi> There is reaſon then
to mark that which cauſeth them to make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
and that's the <hi>Conſcience.</hi> It is no quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Common-wealth, where it deſtroys
the very Foundation of Government, and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
the Ordinance of God for it in Princes
and Magiſtrates; for what is left for them to
do, if every one muſt follow the dictate of his
own Conſcience, that is, in plain terms, be
bound only to obey himſelf.</p>
                  <p>This is no ſlander to the <hi>pretenders</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi>
they will ſay as much themſelves, if
ye ask them. Ask the <hi>Schiſmatick</hi> why he
joyns not with the congregation of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
and he will tell you, His <hi>Conſcience</hi> will
not ſuffer him. Ask the <hi>Rebel</hi> in the State,
why he takes up Arms to the ruine of his King
and Countrey? and his <hi>Conſcience</hi> will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
for him, That it is Gods cauſe, and it is to
do him ſervice. Ask him again, why he doth
not <hi>repent</hi> of the miſchief done by it? (for that
they ſeldom do) and the Conſcience will
ſerve that turn too, It is Gods cauſe, and the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49996:72"/>
                     <hi>Conſcience</hi> will not ſuffer them to repent of that.
Thus we ſee, the Conſcience, as it is uſed, doth
not only open a door to ſin, but ſhuts the very
door to mercy, that is Repentance.</p>
                  <p>If S. <hi>John</hi> ſaid true, as no doubt he did,
<hi>That there were many Antichriſts,</hi> then poſſibly the
<hi>Conſcience</hi> thus improved may be one of them.
For, it ſets it ſelf in the Church above all that
is called God, yea, and God himſelf too, in
a ſenſe; for his Laws are not to be obeyed,
unleſs the <hi>Conſcience</hi> firſt allows them to be his:
and thus all is reſolved into the <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as the
<hi>dernier reſort</hi> and laſt appeal.</p>
                  <p>While the King and the Pope are contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>Supremacy,</hi> the Conſcience without
ſcruple puts in for it againſt both, and takes it
for her right to be ſupreme in all cauſes as well
Eccleſiaſtical as Civil. There is great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
in the world of domineering over the
Conſcience; but have we not rather cauſe to
complain of the domineering of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
And if any liſt to ſee the Conſcience
acting all this, we need go no further then
our late times, when the Conſcience was looſe
for a while; one would think Hell had broke
looſe, ſo fill'd was on a ſudden the Church
with ſects, and the Common-wealth with
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49996:72"/>
confuſion. There is reaſon enough therefore
to reſtrain the Conſcience that acts all this, if
we knew how.</p>
                  <p>The next thing I undertook to ſhew, is,
That there is <hi>no reaſon</hi> why it <hi>ſhould have liberty;</hi>
and particularly, not that which gives the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
colour to it: Neither the duty we owe to
<hi>Truth,</hi> which ſeems to have ſome right to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
nor that we owe to the <hi>Will of God,</hi> that
nothing be done againſt the Conſcience. For
the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Truth is that (I confeſs) which no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of peace may warrant us to deſert;
for I could never be of that opinion, That
Truth in ſmaller matters may for Peace ſake
be either denied or prejudiced. <hi>Magna eſt veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
etiam in minimis;</hi> in Gods name let it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over all. But then it muſt be <hi>Veritas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
not <hi>Veritas in intellectu.</hi> For though Truth
be defined to be a conformity of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
to <hi>the thing</hi> as it is indeed, yet takes
the name from both; from the thing where
Truth <hi>is originally,</hi> and from the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where it is <hi>only repreſented.</hi> Truth in that
firſt reference to the thing, admits no qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
things muſt be taken as they are, be
they never ſo ſmall: but as the things come to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49996:73"/>
be repreſented to, and entertained by the
Underſtanding, by reaſon of the miſtakes and
errours that may happen in that, though
Truth it ſelf, or Truth in the thing cannot,
yet my apprehenſion of it may both yield to
better, and may ſometimes be waved for
peace ſake. To argue from Truth in the
thing, to Truth in the apprehenſion only, is
a fallacy againſt the Rules of Reaſoning, we
call it <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> or a begging of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If a Sectary ſhould beg an alms, I wiſh
he may have it; but he ſhall beg long ere it be
granted him, that he hath the Truth. How
then can he preſume upon that truth, to which
he hath no other title but his own perſwaſion,
which can be no better then any mans elſe,
who is as ſtrongly perſwaded to the contrary?
And this is all the ſervice that Truth can do
the Conſcience for liberty.</p>
                  <p>2. The ſecond thing whereupon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
eſpecially bears it ſelf ſo high, is the
<hi>Will of God</hi> that nothing be done againſt the
Conſcience. That no doubt is a great offence,
and made ſo by the greateſt Authority: Yet
the ſame God that requires our obedience to
the Conſcience, commands us likewiſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
our Parents, our <hi>Princes</hi> and Governours,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49996:73"/>
and all theſe ſtand upon as good authority as
the Conſcience. If we cannot reconcile our
obedience to that with our obedience to theſe,
we may ſin againſt God, when we do not ſin
againſt the Conſcience. For though God hath
erected a Tribunal in every mans breaſt, and
there ſet the Conſcience to be a Judg of all
our actions, there be other Tribunals of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
beſides, of Gods erection too, and to
which he hath ſubjected the very Conſcience.
<hi>Ye muſt needs be ſubject</hi> (Rom. 13.) <hi>not only for
wrath, but alſo for conſcience.</hi> And after both
theſe, there is another Tribunal in Heaven,
to which all Judges, Conſcience and all muſt
give an account one day. For the Conſcience
is no Court of Record; the Decrees and Acts
paſſed there, will be no good evidence at that
Bar; there all muſt be re-examined, and tried
over again. <hi>Though I know nothing by my ſelf,</hi>
(ſaith S. <hi>Paul) yet am I not thereby juſtified.</hi>
Though he could not charge his Conſcience
with any offence, he knew a further trial
muſt paſs upon him before he could be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.
My Conſcience indeed may be
pleaded there in evidence againſt me as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to condemn me, but not as a Judg to
abſolve me. It is a great miſtake in the power
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:49996:74"/>
and operation of the Conſcience: That it will
condemn us, if we do any thing againſt it,
the Text is clear for that; but that it will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
us for that we do according to it, there
is no Text, I am ſure, for that. We muſt
then be tried by the Law, and not by the
Conſcience: For how the proceedings will
be at that Bar, we have a record, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 31.
<hi>When the Son of Man ſhall come in his glory, and
all the holy Angels with him; Then ſhall he ſit upon
the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
all nations.</hi> When the Court was ſet, the
Charge was given to thoſe on the left hand;
<hi>I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; I was
athirſt, and ye gave me no drink; I was a ſtranger,
and ye took me not in; naked, and ye cloathed me
not; ſick and in priſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Charge the Conſcience (no doubt
confidently enough) pleaded <hi>Not guilty; Lord,
when ſaw wee thee an hungred, or athirſt, or a
ſtranger, or naked, or ſick, or in priſon, and did
not miniſter unto thee?</hi> Their Conſcience could
accuſe them of none of theſe things; for all
that, the Sentence went againſt them upon a
point of Law and Equity; <hi>In that ye did it not to
theſe</hi> (ſaith the Judg) <hi>ye did it not to me.</hi> And for
this they were condemned to eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:49996:74"/>
If they that ſtand ſo much upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
did ſeriouſly conſider this, they would
find as little cauſe to deſire that <hi>liberty,</hi> as
there is to grant it, ſeeing it ſtands them in
ſo little ſtead when they have moſt need of
it; for when they think their conſcience
ſhall anſwer for them, they muſt then anſwer
for their conſcience, and upon trial, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
may prove the great offender. Thus
have I hitherto given you an account of ſome
of the vulgar miſtaken principles of Quiet,
which our Student is firſt to unlearn; which
are all but the patching up of a falſe deceitful
peace, condemned in the Politicks under the
name of a <hi>Syncretiſmus,</hi> when all the Factions
in <hi>Crete</hi> joyn'd together in a common danger,
which laſted no longer then the cauſe of it:
like the bonds of a hard Froſt, that binds
Earth and Water, Sticks and Stones all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
till the Sun comes to ſhine upon them,
and then they all preſently return to their
proper place and nature again.</p>
                  <p>But I fear I have run out all my time almoſt
in theſe miſtaken ways of peace: I preſume
it will be a greater offence to leave you here
now, then to beg a little more time to ſet
you in the right way, though I ſhall not go
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49996:75"/>
beyond the office of a <hi>Mercury,</hi> to point the
hand where it lies.</p>
                  <p>There is the Kings high-way to peace, and
the Students private way, and both good in
their kind. With the Kings way I ſhall not
meddle, as being fitter matter for our thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
then inſtruction, who hath already
paved the way for us by wholſom Laws for
that purpoſe. But becauſe oft-times <hi>Vitia ſunt
remediis fortiora,</hi> the compulſory way by Law,
though always neceſſary, is not always ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual;
to the Kings way we muſt add the
Students alſo: That every one in his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
makes it his care and buſineſs to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to it, that it be an artificial ſtudied peace,
to which not Fear only, but Conſcience of
Duty and Religion obligeth us.</p>
                  <p>Now every good Student of any Science
ſearches into the true and proper cauſe of
things; for, <hi>Scire eſt per cauſas cognoſcere.</hi> If
the cauſe of all diviſion in the Church, be
differing in judgment, nothing can cure that
but a conſent. S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore preſcribes
that for the remedy, 1 <hi>Cor. 5. 10. That there
be no diviſions among you;</hi> how may that be
helped? It follows, <hi>But that ye be perfectly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49996:75"/>
This is the true Apoſtolical Principle,
whereon we are to ground our Study of Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et:
For all the fine things and ſentences that
are ſpoken for peace and quiet, will little
move thoſe that are, and may very well be
confident, they ought not howſoever have
peace with Sin, or Error. Unleſs therefore
we can be firſt perſwaded that we ought not
to charge the Church with either, we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
for Peace, This I confeſs is the great
difficulty, yet if this be not done, there can
be no hope of Peace.</p>
                  <p>And to do this, I ſhall not ſend our Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to the Polemick School, to convince
him out of <hi>ſpeculative</hi> Principles of Reaſon
and Divinity; for to that ſtudy, ſome have
not capacity, others not leiſure: I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commend to him ſome <hi>practical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Religion, obvious to all, and denied
by none, that out of them he may learn not
to diſſent from, or condemn the Church of
Error.</p>
                  <p>To prevent the paſſing that ſentence, let
the Student, 1. <hi>Study himſelf,</hi> his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
2. Let him <hi>Study the Church</hi> againſt
which he paſſeth ſentence. 3. Let him ſtudy
the <hi>nature and quality</hi> of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49996:76"/>
judgment is given. 4. Let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
well the <hi>manner of proceeding in judgment.</hi>
In all which we ſhall find ſome known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Religion to direct us.</p>
                  <p>1. Firſt, In the <hi>ſtudy of our ſelves,</hi> and our
own condition: Religion teacheth us to
have an humble, lowly, mean opinion of
our ſelves; and not without cauſe, whether
we reſpect our Underſtandings, or our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections:
Our Underſtandings are naturally
weak, imperfect, ſhort-ſighted, we know but
in part, the beſt of us; and our Affections
too are diſloyal to our Underſtandings, <hi>The
heart of man,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>is deceitful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things,</hi> We have little reaſon then to
truſt our ſelves much in either. He that is
truly conſcious of his own weakneſs or lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
will be content to be ſupported by others.
If we ſtudy this point well, our own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
we ſhould learn more willingly to aſſent
to, and take ſupport from the Church.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, if in the ſecond place, we ſtudy
that too whoſe Governors Religion likewiſe
teaches us to obey, <hi>For they watch over our ſouls,</hi>
Heb. 13. 17. If it be a good point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>in lowlineſs of mind to eſteem others better then
our ſelves,</hi> Phil. 2. 3. it is Religion and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:49996:76"/>
both, to think our Governors wiſer too;
for there is a preſumption always in favour of
them. S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives it for a rule to <hi>Timothy,
Not to receive an accuſation againſt an Elder,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>but
before two or three witneſſes,</hi> becauſe it is to be
preſum'd on the part of Age and Authority,
to know more, and offend leſs. But when
it comes to be the whole Elderſhip, all our
Governors joyntly, the preſumption is ſo
much the ſtronger. If we add this ſtudy to
the former, how little reaſon we have to truſt
our ſelves, and how much we have to truſt
our Governors, we will not raſhly paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
againſt them, if we have either Reaſon
or Religion in us.</p>
                  <p>3. And yet we have more work for our
Student; Let him, in the third place, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>nature and quality</hi> of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
judgment is given, how apt they are
to deceive us. Truth is many times ſo like
an Error, and Error comes ſo near to Truth,
that he had need be careful and circumſpect
that ſhall diſtinguiſh them in ſome caſes. And
in others again, Truth lies hid under many
folds, eſpecially <hi>ambiguity</hi> of words, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
cheat of all Students, who are more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
deceiv'd into opinions then convinc'd. It
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49996:77"/>
is not ſtrange to ſee ſo many go aſtray from
the Church, to whom the things of it are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
under the covert of falſe names,
when they hear the Government of it called
Tyranny; obedience, ſlavery; contempt,
courage; licence, liberty; frenzy, zeal; order,
ſuperſtition. How eaſily thus may ſimple
people miſtake their way, and fall into the pit
that's cover'd over with ſhadows and falſe
names of things? When he hath ſtudied this
point well.</p>
                  <p>4. Let him, in the fourth place, be well
adviſed in what <hi>manner he proceeds in judgment,</hi>
and upon what evidence: For, allowing the
Conſcience to be a Judg, it muſt not treſpaſs
upon the Rules of good Judicature, as, both
ſides muſt be heard impartially, which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
done; the <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt not be miſ-led
no more then other Judges, by prejudice,
paſſion, or favour; for what can that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
be worth which is perverted by any of
theſe. Now if we examine how moſt men
come to paſs ſentence againſt the Church, we
ſhall find it to be upon very ſlight evidence:
It may be their Education, they have been
always brought up that way; for Sects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
run in a blood, in a family: Or they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49996:77"/>
have been ſo taught, they ſay, by good men;
that indeed is the ſum and upſhot of the Faith
of moſt that diſſent, the credit given to ſome
weak, private, ignorant Inſtructer, whoſe
perſon they have in admiration, without
any great cauſe, God knows; whereas their
private judgments, becauſe they are parties,
ought always to be ſuſpected, if we be wiſe;
and becauſe againſt their Governors, to be
contemn'd, if we be obedient.</p>
                  <p>All theſe well ſtudied, may make for peace
when poſſibly Arguments, and Diſputes, and
Puniſhments too will not do it. And yet if
ſtill none of theſe will make our Student
quiet,</p>
                  <p>Let him, in the laſt place, make trial of a
common remedy that prevails in all caſes of
difficulty: Let him but <hi>ſtudy his own ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
the ſafeſt courſe, and he ſhall find that
better provided for in the Churches judgment,
then in his own; for, if he ſhould erre in
following the Church, or his Governors, for
that is poſſible, the greateſt part of that guilt,
ſome ſay all, I ſay only the greateſt part,
muſt lie at their door that command that
which is unlawful: But if they ſhould erre
in following their own judgment, or a Judge
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49996:78"/>
of their own chooſing, for that makes it their
own too, and that is more then poſſible, all
the blame and guilt then muſt of neceſſity
and inexcuſably fall upon themſelves. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe principles, ſetting aſide all thoſe that
may convince our judgments in particulars,
from theſe alone, I ſay, we ſee how ſafe, how
prudent, how religious a thing it is to ſubmit
our private judgments to the publick, for the
<hi>peace</hi> of the Church.</p>
                  <p>It remains only now, that we imploy our
beſt endeavour and ſtudy for it, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
part of the Text, and the laſt thing to be
conſidered,
<q>That ye ſtudy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>STudy is an earneſt <hi>intention of the mind,</hi>
by diligent ſearch and enquiry. Wiſhing
well to Quiet, or ſpeaking well of it, will
not ſerve; the greateſt diſturbers of Peace
will do that many times, give it a good word,
when they will not part with the phanſie for
it. And yet Quiet is a thing that requires
care and pains ſomewhat more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
For when S. <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe ſpeaks of
peace, it is in the words of the ſame import,
<hi>Seek peace,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>and enſue it.</hi> If it be hidden, ſeek
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49996:78"/>
it out; if it flies from you, purſue after it.
It is a buſie thing to be quiet. The word
here tranſlated, <hi>Study,</hi> is in the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>Be ambitious of it;</hi> that is, purſue and
ſtudy it as you would do Honour and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And that, I think, is as much as
can be deſired; and yet no more then Quiet
both deſerves and needs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It deſerves it.</hi> For though quiet be
rather <hi>Status vitae,</hi> then <hi>Virtus;</hi> it is no Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
it ſelf, yet the beſt ſoil to plant Vertue in.
<hi>The fruits of righteouſneſs are ſown in peace,</hi> Jam.
3. 18. So are all the fruits of Induſtry; Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Arts, Sciences, Traffick, Commerce,
flouriſh moſt in the calm temperate clime;
but in troubles and diſſentions every good
thing goes backward, only miſchief thrives.
It fares with troubled times, as in troubled
waters; all the filth, dirt and mire, in the
bottom gets them up to the top. We ſaw as
much when our waters were lately troubled;
what a deal of filth, dirt and mire, what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
ſtuff was then got up to the top and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
place of rule and command? So much
are we the more oblig'd to ſtudy that peace
and quiet, which hath ſunk them to their
proper place again, the bottom: And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49996:79"/>
there let them lie, if you would be quiet.</p>
                  <p>2. As it deſerves therefore our ſtudy, ſo it
<hi>needs it too;</hi> for it is a difficult thing to be
quiet, the way to it lies through ſo many
parts and duties of Religion, and not the eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of them neither: To deny our ſelves,
by humility and lowlineſs of mind to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our own weakneſs and frailty, to
ſubmit our judgments to others, as better
and wiſer then our ſelves; to ſubdue our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and luſts, from whence the Apoſtle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
<hi>Wars and Contentions</hi> to come, <hi>from our
Luſts;</hi> and to all theſe the Fleſh hath natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
a reluctance. Our Student therefore hath
need to contend with himſelf to be at peace
with others.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> was at <hi>Athens</hi> when he wrote this
Epiſtle, a famous Univerſity for the ſtudy of
all liberal Arts and Sciences. I cannot ſay
he had theſe in his thought, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
this ſtudy to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as an
Art of more uſe then any he found at <hi>Athens:</hi>
Yet when I ſee him ſo paſſionately earneſt
for it, to beſeech them to ſtudy, we have
reaſon to value it as an Art well worthy of
<hi>Schools,</hi> and Profeſſors, and Students. And
they would make <hi>a Royal Society,</hi> whereof the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49996:79"/>
King himſelf is Maſter, who is our Peace-maker
by office, and by a care equal to that,
hath by Law provided,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 2.</note> that <hi>under Him we may
live a peaceable and quiet life in all godlineſs and
honeſty.</hi> He hath little ſenſe of Honour, that
will not enter himſelf a Student under that
conduct. The very word for <hi>Study,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
, carries Honour with it.</p>
                  <p>And yet I can tell them of a higher School
for it then this, and wherein Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are content to be Students. Our Lord
Chriſt, the great Mediator of our eternal
peace with Heaven, would not be brought
into the world without a <hi>Song</hi> of Peace on
Earth,<note place="margin">S. Joh. 14. 27.</note> by Angels: And when he left the
World, bequeathed it as a <hi>Legacy</hi> after him,
<hi>My peace I leave with you.</hi> And when he comes
again to judge the world, we have reaſon to
look that he will call us to a reckoning how
we uſe his Legacy. And ſo he will too; for
he is <hi>That Lord, Matth.</hi> 24. that when he came
and found ſome <hi>ſmiting their fellow ſervants,</hi>
commanding them to be <hi>cut aſunder, and have
their portion with hypocrites:</hi> A puniſhment
well fitted to the offence; there was a ſchiſm
in the fault, and there ſhall be another ſchiſm
in the puniſhment; they who ſundred and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49996:80"/>
divided from their Brethren, ſhould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs
be cut aſunder, and have their portion
with hypocrites. But for the Peace-makers,
when he comes, he will provide better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
for <hi>they ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matt. 5. 9.</note>
Bleſſed are they then whom the Lord when
he comes ſhall find at their ſtudies of that
Quiet, which gives them ſo fair a Title to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Reſt and Peace in Heaven with Chriſt,
and all the Children of God.</p>

Doctrine; and what ſhould that do here
in <hi>Court?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not to leave my ſelf and the Text under
this prejudice; That I ſought no farther for
it, was not of eaſineſs or neglect, but Choice;
Becauſe I found it not only in conjunction
and company with the excellent Study of
<hi>Quiet,</hi> to which any kind of <hi>retainer</hi> at large
might deſerve reſpect; but alſo, Becauſe I ſaw
it ſet by the Apoſtle, in a place of near and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
relation, a <hi>Principle</hi> and Foundation to
it. The next way to be <hi>quiet</hi> abroad, is to be
<hi>buſie</hi> at home. And though it be but plain Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
'tis never the worſe for that uſe; for
<hi>Foundations</hi> are beſt, when plaineſt. It is noted as
a cauſe why men make little proficiency in
Arts and Sciences, that the <hi>Principles</hi> and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are not ſo well ſtudied as they ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49996:81"/>
And the reaſon why <hi>they</hi> fall under that neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
is, Becauſe none of the great things which
the Art it ſelf promiſes, are ſeen in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
at firſt. And therefore <hi>Quintilian,</hi> that the
Schollars of his Art might not be diſcouraged
with the meanneſs of his Firſt Elements, tells
them, that <hi>Latent Fundamenta, conſpiciuntur aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia;</hi>
there is little to be ſeen in the Foundation,
that lies hid under ground; all the beauty and
luſter is in the Superſtruction. This doing <hi>our
own buſineſs,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is a practical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
whereupon depends much of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of our whole lives, and ſo hath the fate of
other foundations, to be little ſeen and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
It lies low under ground, and we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
it, as a thing not worthy any mans
thought or care. But to give it the due, we
muſt not look upon what it is in <hi>Sight,</hi> but what
it is in <hi>vertue;</hi> a Principle and Foundation
whereupon is built that, which is the deſire of
all good men, the publick peace and quiet of
the Church and Kingdom. And then we may
allow it to be good Doctrine which hath ſo
good a Uſe. It is a good tree that brings forth
good fruit.</p>
                  <p>But then you will ſay, It muſt be in <hi>ſeaſon</hi>
too.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3. 9.</note> Now the wiſe man tells us, <hi>There is a time
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:49996:82"/>
for war,</hi> as well <hi>as a time for peace.</hi> And can it
then be ſeaſonable again and again thus to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
the ſtudy of ſuch things as make for
peace, at a time when we are all, and have
cauſe to be in preparation for <hi>war?</hi> Indeed if
it were ſuch a peace, as would weaken the
hands of any in the purſuit of that Juſt, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
and <hi>Royal Expedition,</hi> it were a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable
Soleciſm: But we muſt know, As
there is a War that makes for Peace, ſo there is
a Peace that makes for War. Unity among our
ſelves, binds us cloſe together; we are the
ſtronger for it. <hi>Vis unita fortior;</hi> in diviſions and
diſcord, ſtrength is diſtracted and ſcattered;
<hi>Dum ſinguli pugnant, omnes vincuntur.</hi> Domeſtick
Peace then, though it comes not out of the
<hi>Artillery,</hi> is good Ammunition for War: And
it falls in well too, with the expreſs Letter and
Doctrine of the Text, It is <hi>our own buſineſs.</hi> As
it is the proper buſineſs of a <hi>King</hi> to protect
His Subjects from the Inſolencies and Injuries
of proud inſulting Neighbours; ſo it is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of every good Subject too, to aſſiſt Him
in it with their Lives and Fortunes. Whether
therefore we ſeek for Peace at home, or have
cauſe of War abroad, the duty of the Text is
for us. We are doing our own buſineſs. But
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49996:82"/>
though it be a good Foundation to build on
every way; yet, <hi>except the Lord build the houſe,
their labour is but loſt that build.</hi> Let us therefore
before we go farther in the work, go to him
for a bleſſing upon it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>That ye ſtudy to do your own buſineſs.</q>
                  <p>I Take in the word <hi>(ſtudy,)</hi> being forc'd by
the neceſſary conſtruction of Grammar
and Reaſon. For an <hi>object</hi> without an <hi>act,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
nothing: to do our own buſineſs, may
be as well a fault, as a duty; but if <hi>ſtudy</hi> be
taken in, the ſenſe is certain and perfect, it is
that wherein we ſhall do well to imploy our
ſtudy. As <hi>we are to ſtudy to be quiet,</hi> ſo we are
to <hi>ſtudy</hi> alſo <hi>to do our own buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words will bear two ſenſes; as there are
two ſorts of offenders about buſineſs, <hi>nihil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes,</hi>
and <hi>aliud agentes,</hi> And in the words of the
Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 11.</note> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>,
the <hi>idle that work not at all,</hi> and <hi>the buſie-bodies;</hi> ſo
we tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: The Text will
reach them both, for either it ſets every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
to find himſelf ſome buſineſs, or it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
and confines him to that which is his
own.</p>
                  <p>The former againſt <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> is a good leſſon,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49996:83"/>
that, to awaken the lazy ſluggard out of his
dead ſleep, for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of
his idle want on widows,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>dead while they live.</hi>
There is no more life in an idle man, then in
an <hi>Idol-god, that hath eyes and ſee not, ears and hear
not;</hi> but the <hi>other</hi> ſenſe ſeems to agree better
with the ſcope of the place, and will afford
work enough for this time; the Apoſtle ſeems
to have obſerved ſome among them too much
buſied in matters that brought trouble and
diſquiet to themſelves and others; for remedie
whereof he enjoyns them to look to their own
buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>But how their own? For it may be a fault,
and a great one too, ſo to do our own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as not to regard what becomes of others;
that if our own turns be ſervd, and we get,
no matter who loſes. This is deſervedly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by our Apoſtle himſelf to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
chap. 2. ver. 4. Look not every man on his own
things, but every man alſo on the things of others.</hi>
And in the 21. <hi>v.</hi> complains of it too, that
every one ſeeks <hi>his own,</hi> and not the things
which are <hi>Jeſus Chriſts.</hi> But our own <hi>here,</hi> and
our own <hi>there,</hi> are two different things: That
which he blames there, is our own of <hi>intereſt;
there</hi> may be too much of our own in that: but
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49996:83"/>
that which he commands here, is our own of
<hi>duty</hi> and office. In this it muſt be ſo much
our own, that it muſt be none but our own.
Having reduced the words to their proper
genuine ſenſe, in this Leſſon there will fall to
be learned theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. That, there is and ought to be a <hi>propriety
in buſineſs;</hi> that to every one there belongs
ſomething that he may properly call his own.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Obligation</hi> of Duty and Religion to
confine himſelf to that which is his own.</p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Operation</hi> it hath had in the World
upon our Quiet or Diſquiet.</p>
                  <p>4. From theſe is inferr'd a <hi>Neceſsity</hi> to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
it; <hi>That ye ſtudy to do your own buſineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is a <hi>Propriety</hi> in Buſineſs.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
This muſt be laid for a ground; all the reſt
elſe will fall to nothing. It will be no Religion
to keep it; no Sin to break it; no need to
Study it.</p>
                  <p>That which S, <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of the Doctrine
of the Goſpel in general at <hi>Epheſus, A great
door,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>and effectual was opened to him, and there
were many Adverſaries;</hi> is true alſo of this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Doctrine of Propriety, It is a door open
to all wiſe and ſober men; yet it hath many
Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:49996:84"/>
There is a buſie humour in the world, to
<hi>lay all common;</hi> and it is grown to be a <hi>Sect</hi> of
Religion; yea, more than one; as many as
there are kinds of Propriety, ſo many Sects
endeavour to fling down the Incloſures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As firſt, There is a <hi>Propriety in Goods and
Poſſeſsions;</hi> and againſt this, there riſes a Sect
of <hi>Levellers,</hi> who tell us from the Pſalmiſt,
<hi>The Heavens are the Lords;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>but the Earth hath he
given to the Children of men:</hi> That to which every
man hath a Right by the Gift of God, the
Pride and Covetouſneſs of a few have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs'd,
and made their own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> There is a Right and <hi>Propriety of Reſpect
and Honour</hi> due to ſome above others. Againſt
this ariſes another <hi>Sect</hi> of Levellers they call
<hi>Quakers,</hi> who refuſe to <hi>give Honour to whom
Honour belongs:</hi> Though this looks like a
Religion againſt good manners only, or were
but ſome Quarrel with the <hi>Grammarians</hi>
againſt proper Names; the Miſchief of it
lies deeper, and is of the ſpirit of <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi>
who oppoſe the very Powers and Dignities
themſelves, which they deſpiſe in their Titles;
for they cannot be ſo fooliſh, though ſimple
enough, as to make a Religion of Names
only. Theſe are dangerous Sects of Levellers
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49996:84"/>
both; but they lie not in our way. The Text
toucheth only <hi>Levellers of Buſineſs,</hi> who think
they are not to be barr'd the liberty of doing
any thing that is good; <hi>bonum quo communius eomelius,</hi>
and ought not to be impropriate to any.
But that there is a Title and Propriety in
ſome to buſineſs, wherein it is not permitted
to every one to interpoſe, a neceſſity in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
requires, The World is repleniſhed with
infinite variety of things, and a great deal of
work is to be done to make them uſeful and
ſerviceable to us. Now it is not poſſible for
every one to do all, and hardly all, in any one
thing, to gain the full uſe and benefit of it.
But when the works are diſtributed ſeverally
to ſome, the benefit may redound to all.</p>
                  <p>All the buſineſs of the world refers either
to a <hi>Spiritual</hi> End, the good of the ſoul; or to
a <hi>Temporal</hi> and Civil, our well-being while
we live here upon earth: And to both theſe
Ends God hath appointed and aſſigned parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
perſons; he did not leave them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.
In the Temporal there is private buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and publick. For private uſe, as in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
there is the buſineſs of the Husband
and Wife, the Parent and Children, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
and Servants: And out of Families, for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:49996:85"/>
private uſe likewiſe, there is the buſineſs of
Phyſicians and Advocates, Husbandmen,
Merchants and Mariners, Mechanicks and
Labourers; and all theſe are of private nature,
though of common benefit. Then is there
the publick buſineſs, by whith all theſe are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and governed,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 13.</note> and they are by S. <hi>Peter</hi>
diſtinguiſhed to our hands, as that of the <hi>King
as Supreme,</hi> and of <hi>Governors ſent by him;</hi> and
they are Magiſtrates and Judges for Peace,
Captains and Commanders for War, And
beſides theſe, there is the buſineſs of Miniſters
and Aſſiſtants to the Supreme Power, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,
Lawyers, Officers and Servants; and
all theſe are for that temporal end.</p>
                  <p>And for the Spiritual, whoſe buſineſs refers
to the ſoul there is likewiſe a Propriety; as in
<hi>Biſhops</hi> to <hi>Ordain,</hi> Inſtitute and Order the reſt
of the Clergy ſpecially, and of the whole Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
occaſionally, as the neceſſity of it ſhall
require. Then is there the buſineſs of the
<hi>Presbyters,</hi> in the ſeveral parts of the Dioceſs,
in a more particular and immediate Cure and
Charge, to be directed by, and accountable to
the Biſhop. There be others <hi>Diaconal</hi> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
to both. And all together, Temporal
and Spiritual, as ſeveral Members, make one
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49996:85"/>
Body; <hi>and every Member,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>hath not the ſame office,</hi> Rom. 12. 4. God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
his Gifts <hi>to every one ſeverally as He will,</hi>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. he did not ſcatter them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but divide them, and all hold in ſeveralty.</p>
                  <p>And as that Severance and Propriety
ſtands upon good Authority; ſo <hi>Authority</hi> was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
no doubt, induc't upon reaſon of Profit and
Intereſt. It conduceth more to the common
good, than Community it ſelf could.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It brings <hi>Order</hi> into the common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
buſineſs of the world, and that takes away
confuſion, which never did any thing well.
<hi>To avoid fornication,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 2. <hi>let every man
have his own wife.</hi> Upon the ſame Equity, to
avoid the promiſcuous luſt and curioſity men
have to mingle with any buſineſs, Let every
man likewiſe have his own.</p>
                  <p>2. In reaſon all buſineſs will be beſt done <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
too, by thoſe to whom they are <hi>peculiar</hi> and
proper. <hi>Artifici in ſua arte credendum.</hi> Men are
moſt truſted in their own Trades. We truſt
the Lawyer with our Eſtates, the Phyſician
with our Bodies. I ſay nothing of our Souls;
we are ſo wiſe at that work, as to truſt none
but our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>3. Yet thirdly, The <hi>nature</hi> and condition of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:49996:86"/>
the buſineſs it ſelf, may require it: Some are
ſo difficult, that every one cannot do, though
he would; and ſome are ſo mean, that every
one would not do, though he could: and all
are ſuch, as through the mercy of God we
need not do if we will, unleſs it be our own
buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>We are now faln upon the <hi>Second</hi> Part, that
as every one hath ſome buſineſs that is his own,
ſo <hi>Duty</hi> and Religion <hi>obligeth</hi> him to take upon
him <hi>no buſineſs but his own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> THis Leſſon will not be ſo eaſily learned,
as the former: all confinement of it ſelf
ſeems uneaſie. He that hath no mind to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
would not be tied to ſtay at home. And
he that cares for no buſineſs, will take it ill to
be barr'd any. But this confinement beſides,
nips the growth and encreaſe of good, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they think, more would be done if every
one have free liberty to do it; and therefore
it is juſt and reaſonable to allow any one a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current</hi>
juriſdiction with others in any thing
that is otherwiſe good, though that be to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
with the <hi>King,</hi> to pray and preach, or
what they pleaſe, with the <hi>Prieſt.</hi> And they
have as much of propriety as any can have to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49996:86"/>
buſineſs; yet even to theſe, they think any
man may make a ſufficient title, that hath <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi>
to know what is to be done, as well
as any other, and <hi>affection</hi> to do it, perhaps
more then others. And all have <hi>right</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the publick, eſpecially that wherein
Religion and the ſoul is concerned; how God
may be beſt ſerved, and wherein His <hi>glory</hi>
may be moſt promoted. Will not all theſe
make a <hi>Title</hi> good enough to any buſineſs?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Glory</hi> of GOD, indeed, is a high and
over-ruling Title; if we do not ſet it on our
own heads, as the manner is, to make Gods
glory ſerve our own. Otherwiſe that, and
the reſt are ſuch things, as all men of wiſdom
or conſcience ſhould have regard to, in any
buſineſs they undertake; provided yet it be
their own. In that every one hath liberty to
improve his underſtanding and knowledg for
the beſt, as well for his own ſoul as the publick
good: In that let the glory of God be the <hi>Star</hi>
to guide him. But all <hi>theſe</hi> do not make the
buſineſs ours; they are a good qualification
in any for buſineſs, yet give no <hi>right</hi> or <hi>Title</hi> to
it. Great knowledg and skill in the <hi>Laws</hi> will
not ſet a man upon the Bench; nor of <hi>Divinity,</hi>
in the Biſhops Chair; nor will the dexterous
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:49996:87"/>
glib-gifted tongue put a man into the Pulpit.
There muſt be beſides a Title and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to make them ours.</p>
                  <p>But muſt all the obligations we have to the
<hi>Publick good,</hi> and to <hi>Gods honour,</hi> ſtoop to <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misſions,
Titles</hi> and <hi>proprieties,</hi> which are but the
creatures and conſtitutions of men?</p>
                  <p>To this queſtion, I anſwer in the words of
<hi>Job, 13. 7. Will you ſpeak wickedly for God, and talk
deceitfully for him?</hi> It is deceitful talking, to plead
for God againſt himſelf; for though it ſhould
be granted, that the ſorting of ſeveral employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and functions have ſomething of <hi>man</hi> in
them; yet the confirmation and approbation
of <hi>God</hi> makes it <hi>his,</hi> and ſo divine: for as God
hath founded a divine <hi>Moral</hi> law, upon the
propriety of goods and poſſeſſions, <hi>Thou ſhalt
not ſteal;</hi> yea; <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet</hi> that which is
anothers; and yet it comes not to be anothers,
but by <hi>humane Laws:</hi> So though different ſtates
of life and employments have ſomewhat in
them by diſpoſition of <hi>Law,</hi> or our own choice;
yet upon them is alſo founded this moral duty,
to keep within thoſe bounds: For though
men laid the <hi>Land-marks,</hi> yet God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>They ſhould not be removed, Deut.</hi> 19. 15.</p>
                  <p>It is a kind of <hi>Burglary</hi> to break into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49996:87"/>
mans buſineſs, as well as into another
mans houſe: or if you will not allow it to be
theft to have anothers buſineſs found with
you, as it is to have anothers goods; it is as ill
as theft in S. <hi>Peter's</hi> opinion. <hi>The Murtherer, the
Thief, the Evil-doer, the Buſie-body;</hi> there's a <hi>Meſſe</hi>
of them, he puts them all alike together,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this point, If the <hi>glory of God,</hi>
and the <hi>publick Good,</hi> and ſuch like fair preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
might let us looſe upon one anothers bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
it would quickly bring us round, where
we were, to that confuſion and diſorder, for
remedy whereof, the Apoſtle added this Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to the former. We ſhall never learn to
be quiet well, unleſs we learn alſo to keep
within our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet I deny not, but that Diſcord and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention
have other cauſes beſides; for, of <hi>Pride
cometh contention,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 13. 10. And
<hi>from covetouſneſs,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>James, they deſire, and
have not, James</hi> 4. 2. It is true of other Luſts,
Wrath, Revenge, Envy, Slander, and Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
too, break the peace too often, and had
need be bound to their good behaviour all:
Yet we may obſerve it, That none of all theſe
do actually any great miſchief that way, till
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49996:88"/>
they firſt bring it to this, till it draws us from
our own ſtation, and fling us upon ſome

not our own.</p>
                  <p>To arraign all that are guilty of breaking
this Rule in ſeveral kinds, would ask a long

here of the attempts upon <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
by thoſe whoſe buſineſs it was not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the moſt and greateſt tempeſts and

                  <p>The Wars and Combuſtions over all <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> in the time of the Emperor,
<hi>HENRY</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> had their beginning
from hence. Pope <hi>Hildebrand, GREG.</hi> vij.
not content with that which his Charge and
Office of Biſhop allow'd him, began to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:49996:88"/>
out to himſelf a Greatneſs equal to the
<hi>City</hi> he ſerv'd in, which had been <hi>Domicilium
Imperii;</hi> firſt brake in upon the Temporal
Power, not heard of before in the <hi>Church,</hi>
though then a Thouſand years old: Where,
for the better ſupport of his Greatneſs, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to get into his Diſpoſing, all
Church-Promotions; and for that end, call'd
a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> of a few Biſhops for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and there <hi>Decreed</hi> all <hi>Patronages</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi>
by Lay-men, <hi>Princes</hi> not excepted, to be
void, and of no effect in Law. What could be
expected from ſo Unjuſt a Decree, but vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Oppoſition, and a bloody Diſpute?
What troubles the ſame <hi>Patronage</hi> and <hi>Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of <hi>Biſhops</hi> brought preſently after into this
Kingdom, our Stories are full of. But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
Pope, when he ſaw he could not quietly
enjoy the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Crown, falls fiercely
upon the <hi>Crown</hi> it ſelf, and would be Maſter
of that too; and then he thought he ſhould
Rule to purpoſe for the Catholick Cauſe. And
for an Eſſay of this bold Uſurp'd Power, fairly
<hi>Depoſed</hi> the Emperor, and <hi>abſolv'd</hi> his Subjects
of their Obedience. This was certainly no
Biſhops buſineſs. He may bleſs the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not diſpoſe of the Crown. He may pray
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49996:89"/>
for a Godly and Peaceable Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, not make a prey of it. To abſolve Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents
of their Sins, is a Biſhops work; not
of their Duties; that is not to remit their Sins,
but to make them Sinners. Now what was
likely to be the effect of all this, but that which
hapned, <hi>Wars</hi> and Combuſtions over the whole
<hi>Empire?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though that Pope did not long out-live
that <hi>Feite</hi> of his, yet his Succeſſors and their
Paraſites have ſo ply'd the Cauſe ever ſince
that time, ſome directly, ſome indirectly, that
the fire is not yet extinguiſhed. Now if the
Pope met with ſome <hi>Princes</hi> that would not
endure his <hi>Ranging</hi> thus in their Dominions,
but thought it high time to quit his Miter, to
ſecure their Crowns, he may thank himſelf
for it. They may call it a <hi>Schiſm,</hi> if they pleaſe;
but it is a Schiſm without a Sin. That word

We were in a ſad caſe not long ſince

in this Kingdom by a <hi>Civil War.</hi> I meddle
not with the fault, let that ſleep under the <hi>Act</hi>
of <hi>Oblivion.</hi> We may, I truſt, without offence,
enquire into the cauſe of it. What were they
doing that gave us that diſquiet? Look upon
the <hi>Standard</hi> ſet up for the War; I mean, the
moſt Execrable COVENANT, <hi>Quomodo legis?</hi>
how read you there? was it not medling with
buſineſs was none of their own? They <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted</hi>
firſt to extirpate the Government of the
Church eſtabliſhed by Law, That Law, with
hands lifted up to Heaven, they <hi>ſwore</hi> they
would aboliſh. The <hi>Legiſlative Power</hi> we know
in whom it is, to make or mend Laws; it was
none of their buſineſs. In this they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
too bold with the Kings <hi>Scepter.</hi> At the
next turn they take hold of his <hi>Sword</hi> too, and
engage themſelves to a mutual Defence againſt
all Oppoſition. This alſo was none of their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
For though a <hi>Self-defence</hi> may be allow'd
as natural to all; it is againſt private, not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Oppoſition; and then too, as Divines
generally reſolve, <hi>Cum moderamine inculpatae Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telae;</hi>
never to the hurt of others; that is,
Every man may defend himſelf <hi>clypeo,</hi> but not

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> This was <hi>tranſient:</hi> But there ſtill remains
a <hi>permanent</hi> and habitual Diſturbance of our

                  <p>But can we charge them with doing a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs

                  </p>
                  <p>They are miſtaken that think the <hi>Charge</hi>
lies upon this iſſue, what every man may do
for himſelf and his own ſalvation. He may
without queſtion do very much, for he may
keep all Gods Commandments, if he can;
and when he cannot, he may be truly contrite
and penitent for breaking them; and then he

Chriſt. And again, He may ſerve and
worſhip God with as much fervency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
as he can and will; he may abound in
Charity, Meekneſs, Humility, Patience and
Temperance, and all other Chriſtian vertues:
And <hi>ſo long as ye thus follow that which is good,</hi> ſaith
S. <hi>Peter, who will harm you?</hi> And I may ſay too,
who can hinder you in all this?<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 13.</note> but if he
makes himſelf a party in a <hi>Sect,</hi> if there be
aſſembling together in companies, gather
Congregations, incorporate in a Body, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule
Churches, give Laws of Doctrine and
Worſhip, ſet up Teachers and Leaders of their
own; to all this they have as little Right, as
they have need. A man may go far, ye ſee, in
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49996:91"/>
Religion, without troubling any; and if then
they fall into ſome Error or Misbelief in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
they ought not to be ſeverely handled;
but when they betake themſelves to a <hi>Sect,</hi> that
alters the caſe, it will then be compaſſion mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.
A <hi>Locuſt</hi> alone is no ſuch perilous
beaſt to be fear'd or regarded by any; but
when they come in ſhoals and ſwarms, and
cover the face of the earth, they are a plague
to the Countrey where they light. So to look
upon a <hi>Sectary</hi> ſingle, who out of ſimplicity
and good meaning follows his Conſcience,
our hearts ſhould be every whit as tender for
them, as their Conſciences are. But if we look
upon them in <hi>Company,</hi> they are as ill and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as the company they are found in; and
the danger of all popular Meetings, and Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations
to a State, makes it the proper buſineſs
of a King and his Miniſters to look to it, and
to provide againſt it; wherein the care hath
been taken, deſerves a juſt commendation.</p>
                  <p>And yet when I aſſert and refer this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the KING, I look to be call'd to an
account for that; For they take the boldneſs
by way of recrimination, to trun the Text
upon the King himſelf, <hi>That His Power is
Civil, and Matters of the Church and Religion
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:49996:91"/>
are Eccleſiaſtical,</hi> and ſo none of his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>This is, I confeſs, too weighty a matter to
be here thruſt into the corner of a Sermon;
yet it will be neceſſary to ſay ſo much as may
ſomewhat lay that loud clamour againſt it:
For the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> both, how ill
ſoever they may agree in other matters, hunt
in couples againſt the Kings Power and <hi>SU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PREMACY.</hi>
But as we denie not all to others
in their places; ſo we claim not all for the
King. If I ſhall but only now ſet out <hi>His</hi>
Part in matters of the Church, it will appear
ſufficiently, that he is <hi>Rectus in Curia,</hi> ſtands
right in the Text, and takes not upon him
buſineſs which is not his own.</p>
                  <p>We acknowledge the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi>
to be two diſtinct Powers; and though they
may be both in one Perſon, and were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
ſo; yet by the Divine, <hi>poſitive</hi> Laws both
of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> they were ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
that though one perſon were capable
of both, yet not without a lawful <hi>Title</hi> and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture
to either. I cannot therefore think,
That the King is an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, who
was never Ordained or Conſecrated to be ſo.
Therefore when ſome Learned in our Laws
affirm, That the <hi>KING</hi> is Supreme Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:49996:92"/>
and <hi>mixta perſona,</hi> it muſt be underſtood
in ſome other ſenſe, and for ſome other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for we do not find that he attempts the
doing any thing that is the proper act of an
Eccleſiaſtical Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Yes, they ſay, he claims by his Title of
<hi>Supremacy,</hi> To govern <hi>all perſons in all cauſes, as
well Eccleſiaſtical as Civil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We acknowledg this to be his juſt Title;
but deny, that he doth any thing by it, which
is not properly his <hi>own</hi> buſineſs, and in <hi>Right</hi>
of his Crown. That he is the Fountain alſo
of all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, though it be
not expreſly in his Title, we acknowledge to
be in his Power. But here I muſt crave leave
to ſay ſomething of the nature and notion of
JURISDICTION, though it ſhall taſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
of the race and harſhneſs of the School;
yet much of the <hi>Caſe</hi> depends upon it, and no
little miſtakes there are about it.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed generally, That there is in the
Church a Power of <hi>Orders,</hi> and a Power of
<hi>Juriſdiction</hi> diſtinct; that is, for the <hi>Power,</hi>
though not diſtinct in the <hi>object</hi> and matter of
that power; for that is the ſame in both: As,
preaching Gods Word, adminiſtring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
or the Cenſures of the Church, are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49996:92"/>
of the power of <hi>Orders.</hi> And the putting all,
or any of theſe in execution, is by a power of
<hi>Juriſdiction.</hi> The former, as Divines diſtinguiſh,
is a power in <hi>habitu,</hi> the other in <hi>actu.</hi> So that
<hi>Juriſdiction</hi> is nothing elſe, <hi>but a power to do actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
what was potentially or habitually receiv'd in
Orders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not here take <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> in the ſtrict
vulgar ſenſe, to be a power <hi>jus dicendi inter partes
litigantes</hi> only, as the word imports; but more
largely, as it reacheth to any act of Order,
without which it cannot lawfully be put in
execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the Queſtion here will be,</hi> How a
King can be the Fountain of the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
us'd in his Dominions, who neither givs Orders
himſelf, not executes any; that is, hath neither power
of Orders, nor Power of Juriſdiction?</p>
                  <p>My Anſwer to this Queſtion, is, That the
Kings Power lies without both theſe, and is
that which gives Commiſſion and Faculty to
perſons ordained to execute their Orders
within his Dominions. And the Reaſon,
Ground and Neceſſity of that is, Becauſe the
Eccleſiaſtical Function cannot be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
but by ſuch ways and means as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
and originally in the King, and in <hi>Right
of</hi> his Crown. As <hi>firſt,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:49996:93"/>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There muſt be ſome <hi>Subjects</hi> upon whom
they may <hi>execute</hi> their Eccleſiaſtical Orders;
now all the Subjects within his Dominions,
are the Kings, who muſt of neceſſity loſe ſo
much of the Right he had in them, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
aſſumes without Him. From hence
grows his Right to <hi>order</hi> and conſtitute <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes</hi>
and Pariſhes, and to ſet them their bounds
and limits; that is, upon which of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and how far he will allow them reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to execute their Orders; for without
thoſe bounds, it is not, nor is us'd to be taken

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When they are met together, there muſt be

Sedition; who by ſlandering the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

people to Rebellion? We have known
ſuch things done. It is therefore neceſſary,
that none be allow'd that liberty to ſpeak to
Multitudes aſſembled together, but ſuch with
whom a King may ſafely truſt his people. And
this gives him a <hi>Right</hi> and Capacity of <hi>Partro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage</hi>
and Nomination to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Charges?</p>
                  <p>Leſt the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they teach the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
people, ſhould be ſuch as would amuſe them
with Novelties, or occaſion Alterations, and
foment Diviſions, or any way diſturb the
Peace of the Kingdom; it is juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that the King ſhould confine them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compaſs of certain <hi>Articles</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of <hi>Religion,</hi> which gives Him a Right
to that, which in other reſpects, no doubt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the care of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But beſides the <hi>Articles of Peace,</hi> we find <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
that the King in His Laws <hi>declares</hi> what is
<hi>Hereſie:</hi> That, if any thing, ſeems to be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
work of the Eccleſiaſtical Power; yet even
in that he is not out at his own Civil buſineſs.
For ſeeing meer Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures are
found not to be of ſufficient force to ſuppreſs
dangerous and Heretical Opinions, without
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49996:94"/>
the uſe of the <hi>temporal</hi> Sword: Out of the care
the King hath of the Lives and Eſtates of His
Subjects, he will not let His <hi>Sword</hi> looſe to the
will of others, who by declaring what they
pleaſe to be Hereſie, may bring them in peril;
He therefore confines them to ſuch caſes <hi>only,</hi>
wherein He is content His Sword ſhould be
made uſe of. This is all, and is that which
muſt be allowed to be the <hi>proper</hi> buſineſs of the
King to aſſign, how <hi>far,</hi> and in <hi>what</hi> caſes His
Temporal Power and Sword ſhall be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd,
and can be no invading the Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> But laſtly, Is not this the ſame wrong and
illuſion we charge the <hi>Pope</hi> with, who in <hi>order</hi>
to his Spiritual End, Uſurps the Temporal
Power; ſo the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>order</hi> to his Temporal
Government, invades the Eccleſiaſtical?</p>
                  <p>No, the caſe is far different; If the Pope
did order temporals by ſpiritual means only,
<hi>i. e. Eccleſiaſtice,</hi> we had the leſs to ſay againſt
him; he is not out of the way of a Biſhops
power, though he ſhould abuſe it. But he for
his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and, uſurps <hi>temporal</hi> means, and takes
upon him to diſpoſe of temporal Eſtates, that is
none of his buſineſs. But the <hi>King</hi> in ordering
Eccleſiaſtical things to His <hi>temporal</hi> end, uſes
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49996:94"/>
                     <hi>no</hi> Eccleſiaſtical means, but temporal <hi>only,</hi>
which are his proper buſineſs, He doth not
excommunicate the Pope out of the Church,
as the Pope would do him out of his temporal
Dominions. But the King, if he ſee cauſe,
may baniſh him and his Emiſſaries out of his
Kingdom. That cannot be deny'd to be the
proper buſineſs of a King to ſecure and free his
Kingdom from any thing that is deſtructive
to it. Now if in all this the King moves not out

                  <p>What then is to be done with them? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

he takes in hand any matter of importance, to

it, it is reſolved we will have a better Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and a more pure and reformed Church.
That is commonly concluded, before this be
diſputed. No good <hi>Student</hi> will do ſo, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
without premiſes. We muſt ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be our own buſineſs firſt, how we can
<hi>derive a Title</hi> to it.</p>
                  <p>We know, that <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> come
both originally from God; to which none can
have Right, but they to whom God hath ſet
over, and entruſted the Care and Charge of
either; Our part is to ſee by what <hi>mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance</hi>
it comes from them to us. If we have
nothing to ſhew that either of them have
been particularly committed to us, we may
ſafely and certainly conclude, it is none of our
buſineſs.</p>

Every Student muſt obſerve a good <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in his ſtudy; whereof one Rule is, To
proceed <hi>a manifeſtis ad obſcuriora:</hi> Let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
at that which is without queſtion his own
buſineſs. Hath he done all that belongs to his
proper place and Function, which is certainly
his own? Or hath he a Family at home to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,
that no doubt is his too? Are his Wife,
and Children, and Servants well ordered, all
as they ſhould be? S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a charge to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> not to ſet a Biſhop over the Church,
who hath <hi>not governed his own Family well.</hi>
Though ſome have not a Family without, yet
every one hath a Family within, and a large
one too: To rule his paſſions and inordinate
deſires only, ask a world of work, and they
will find it ſo, when ever they ſet themſelves
upon it.</p>
                  <p>What a <hi>prepoſterous</hi> method and courſe is
it to hunt eagerly after <hi>Liberty</hi> from ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
Preſſure in Government, or ſome poor
Ceremony in the Church, while in the mean
time we are true <hi>ſlaves</hi> to ſome baſe, vile luſt
within us. Here we ſhould begin to ſet our
ſelves at liberty from our ſelves. And this the
method of <hi>Charity</hi> requires, as well as the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of <hi>Art.</hi> Charity begins always at home, at
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49996:96"/>
our own buſineſs. <hi>Tantumne ab re tua otii eſt tibi,</hi>
was well ſaid in the Comedy, <hi>Aliena ut Cures.</hi>
True Charity will find no leiſure for other's
work, till her own be done. If this method
were carefully obſerv'd, the world would be
a great deal quieter then it is.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Study</hi> will be therefore needful in this caſe,
becauſe otherwiſe unconſidering men are apt
to be carried away with the fair ſhew of Zeal
and <hi>Religion</hi> in reforming others; they take it
for a wrong from any that think not ſo of it:
But by conſidering well, they will find they
are diſappointed of that hope; for whatſoever
ſets them on work, it cannot be true Religion,
that is not contrary to it ſelf. All Students
know, that <hi>One</hi> truth is not repugnant to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
nor <hi>one</hi> vertue to another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Religion doth not make men <hi>fools,</hi> to employ
themſelves in that whereof there <hi>comes no good.</hi>
All we do in other mens buſineſs, runs waſt.
S. <hi>Paul, 2 Theſſ.</hi> 3. 11. calls it <hi>idleneſs;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

,working not at
all; but are <hi>buſie-bodies;</hi> buſie, and yet not work
at all. He ſays the ſame of his <hi>Widows</hi> of pleaſure,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 3. That they were <gap reason="foreign">

,idle, and buſie-bodies both. He thinks that not
worthy to be call'd buſineſs, which is not
our own.</p>

And yet, Secondly, There is a worſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in it than idleneſs. It <hi>charges</hi> our <hi>account</hi>
more than needs; and there is no Wiſdom in
that; for when the Conſcience brings us in
more work than either God or Man particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
requires, though it be not our own of
<hi>Duty</hi> here, it will be our own in <hi>Account</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
For the conſcience of doing it, makes
it ours howſoever; and ſo guilty both of it,
and all the miſcheif that comes by it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis againſt <hi>Juſtice:</hi> That doth <hi>ſuum cuique <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
tribuere.</hi> Juſtice lets every man enjoy his own.
He that takes upon him another mans buſineſs,
becauſe he can do it better, (for that's the great
pretence, to do that which is <hi>beſt)</hi> may as well
take another mans Purſe, becauſe he will ſpend
the money <hi>better.</hi> I think we will hardly allow
of that Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>'Tis againſt <hi>Hope,</hi> that Chriſtian hope which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
ſupports us in all our Sufferings and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Whereof, when S. <hi>Peter, 1 Ep. 4. c.</hi> had
for the conſolation of his Countrey-men, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
abroad, pour'd out a plentiful meaſure,
<hi>v. 13. 14. Rejoice, in as much ye are partakers of
Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd,
ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy.</hi> Ver. 14.
<hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49996:97"/>
ye; for the Spirit of Glory, and of God reſteth upon
you.</hi> But preſently in the very next words,
<hi>ver.</hi> 15. he puts in an exception to buſie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
they have no part or ſhare in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation:
<hi>Let none of you ſuffer as a Murtherer, or
a Thief, or a Buſie-body.</hi> They have as little right
to the comfort in ſuffering, as they had to the
buſineſs for which they ſuffer.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, As it diſappoints them of the hope
of that Mercy from God; ſo it caſts them <hi>into
the ſnare of the Devil.</hi> It was ſafe and wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
the Apoſtle gives, <hi>Eph. 4. 27. Not to give
place to the Devil.</hi> He whoſe buſie thoughts car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
him abroad, to pry into, and meddle in
others buſineſs, gives place to the Devil in the
mean time to enter in, ranſack and diſorder all
at home, where there is none to reſiſt him:
There is no better ſence againſt the Devil, than
this, <hi>ſi invenerit occupatos,</hi> if he finds us diligently
employ'd at home in our own buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>If for all this, the <hi>medling</hi> Reformers of
others would be thought the men of Religion,
and of the <hi>firſt rate</hi> too; Let them know, That
it is of ſuch a Religion as hath neither <hi>Prudence</hi>
in it, nor <hi>Charity,</hi> nor <hi>Juſtice,</hi> nor <hi>Hope,</hi> nor <hi>Safety.</hi>
And when he hath weigh'd all theſe miſchiefs
that follow the breaking this Rule;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:49996:97"/>
Let him in the next place, conſider the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi>
that comes by keeping it. At that I began,
and with that I will conclude. This Leſſon
was ſet us of purpoſe by the Apoſtle to ſecond
and enforce the other of Peace and <hi>Quiet.</hi> The
beſt way to be <hi>quiet</hi> with others, is to be buſie
with our ſelves. It is the natural and genuine
effect of it. All diſcord and diſſention muſt be
between two, either perſons or parties; and
that which commonly kindles the fire, is envy,
or ſome ſuppoſed injury; now he that intends
his own buſineſs only, can give no occaſion to
others, of either envy or complaint; and ſo in
recompence of keeping to his own buſineſs,
he ſhall quietly ſit under his own Vine, and
under his own Fig tree; he ſhall have own
for own.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Beſides this outward quiet with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it will produce another within us, the
<hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>tranquillity of the Conſcience,</hi> without
which outward peace may prove to ſome but
a quiet paſſage here, to eternal miſery hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
But this makes it a thorough quiet, both
ſides alike, within and without; for it layes
thoſe buſie, unſatisfied thoughts within us,
which otherwiſe gives trouble both to our
ſelves and others: That when we ſee not, or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49996:98" rendition="simple:additions"/>
think we ſee not all things ſo well carried in
the Church and Government, as we could
wiſh; yet having gone as far to mend it, as
the <hi>line</hi> of our own buſineſs will reach, and the
fartheſt end of that is, having peaceably mov'd
for it, and heartily pray'd for it, we may with
a ſafe and quiet Conſcience, leave the reſt to
God, and thoſe to whom he hath committed
that Care and Charge, whoſe <hi>proper</hi> buſineſs
it is. And <hi>as many as walk according to this Rule,
Peace be on them,</hi> and Mercy from the God of
Peace and Mercy; To whom be all honour,
glory and praiſe, for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
