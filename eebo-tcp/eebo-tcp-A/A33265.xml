            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>VVE whoſe Names are under-witten, do certifie the truth of a Miraculous Cure of a Girl of this Town of about Twenty years Age by Name <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth Parcet,</hi> a poor Widows Daughter, who hath anguiſhed under the ſad affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Diſtemper of the Kings Evil, Termed the <hi>Joint Evil,</hi> being ſaid to be the worſt Evil for about Ten or Eleven years time, ſhe had in her right hand Four runing wounds, <hi>viz.</hi> One in the inſide, and three on the Back of her hand, and two more in the ſame arm, one above her handwreſt, the other above the bending of her Arm, She had betwixt her Arm-pit and Breſt, (a bunch) which the Docters ſaid fed thoſe ſix ſeveral Runing Wounds; the ſaid Diſtemper was likewiſe on her Left eye, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſhe was almoſt blind; her Mother deſpairing for the preſerving her ſight, and being not of ability to ſend her to London, to be touched by the King, being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Poor having many ſmall Children, and this Girl not being able to work, her Mother deſirous to have her Daughter cured, ſaught to the Chirurgions for help who tamper'd with it for a time, but could do no good; went likewiſe 10 or 11 Miles, to a Seventh Son, but all in vain; no viſible hopes of a Cure remained, and expected nothing but the Grave.</p>

But now, in this the Girls great extremity.

Her ſix running wounds in her hand and arm, in four or five days were dried up, the bunch in her breſt was diſſolved in eight or ten days, of which now is no ſign: her eye that was given for loſt, is now perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well, and the Girl in good health; the marks of her ſeveral wounds are yet viſible in her hand and arm, all which has been diſcovered to us both by Mother and Daughter, and Neighbours that know her.</p>
