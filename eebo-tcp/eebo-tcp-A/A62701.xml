            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE hope it is not unknown unto your Excellency, neither unto theſe Nations for whom we ſerved as Members in that Parliament interupted by <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates in the year 1648. That it was by them forceably done, that we might not in a Parliamentary way diſcharge our conſciences and Truſt repoſed in us by the people, whereby the Nations would through the bleſſings of God have been ſetled. And upon thoſe Conceſſions from his Majeſty at the Iſle of <hi>Whites</hi> Treaty, which we found to be a ſufficient ground, we did reſolve, after ſome further Treaty, to conclude a Peace, and thereby prevent the efuſion of more Chriſtian blood, ſecure the people from further Calamities, and preſerve their rights and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome intire from any inſolent or Arbitrary powers whatſoever: But being hitherto by violence kept out, and ſometimes impriſoned, we cannot poſſibly act: Therefore we deſire your Excellency to remove that force which thus obſtructs the peoples Rights and our freedome in Parliament, by which you will certainly open a door to the future ſafety and Tranquility of theſe Kingdomes, and we can further aſſure your Lordſhip, That in this the people will reſt ſatisfied, otherwiſe we can never expect a laſting peace; for when they are limited and tyed to ſuch qualifications, as we underſtand are intended in their Elections, it ſignifies the ſame with what they already have, and do now ſo grievouſly complain and petition againſt; from hence we have ſeriouſly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the evils and great troubles growing upon us, And unleſs we can prevail with your Excellency-unto whom we make this our humble Addreſs in their behalf, That we may be admitted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe Addreſſes of the Gentry of <hi>Devon,</hi> and other parts, The Nation is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in a loſt condition, as a ſhort time will diſcover: all which we leave to your Lordſhips con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and as we expect this liberty from you, we are reſolved to leſſen the preſent burthens of the people, by taking off all Taxes, Exciſe, Oppreſſions and grievances whatſoever.</p>
