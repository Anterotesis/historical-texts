            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIS Maiestie vpon the report
made, expressed great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that it gaue him; not valewing
the Money giuen, comparable to the
hearts shewed in the way of the Guift:
For although his great occasions of
State did require more Money then at
this time was giuen; yet now he made
account he could not lacke since he had
their loues; and that this day, he
thought that he had gayned more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
in <hi>Christendome,</hi> then if
he had wonne many Battailes; Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
further, (according to his Speech
the first day of the Parliament,) That
they might easily make him in loue
<pb facs="tcp:14280:2"/>
with Parliaments, (now he professed
he was so:) And that we should finde
the fruits of it by calling vs often to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and to secure further feares,
and create future confidence, he assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vs that we should enioy as great
imunitie and freedom in his time, as
euer we possessed or had vnder the
Reigne of any the best Kings of this
Realme.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MEE thinkes I now behold
you a great <hi>King;</hi> For loue
is greater then Maiestie. <hi>Opinion</hi>
that your People loued you not
had almost lost you in the opinion
of the <hi>World:</hi> but this day makes
you appeare as you are, <hi>A glorious
King loued at home, and now to bee
feared abroad.</hi> This falling out so
happily, I beseech you giue mee
leaue to bee an humble Sutor vnto
your <hi>Maiestie.</hi> First, for my selfe,
that I who haue had the honour to
be your <hi>Fauourite,</hi> may now giue
<pb facs="tcp:14280:3"/>
vp my title vnto them, they to bee
your <hi>Fauourite,</hi> and I to bee your
Seruant. My second sute is, that
they hauing all done so well, you
will account of them all as one, a
Body of many members, but all of
one Heart. <hi>Opinion</hi> might haue
made them differ, but <hi>Affection</hi> did
moue them all to ioyne with
like loue in this great <hi>Guift:</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
it being lesse then your oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
may aske, yet it is more then
euer Subiects did giue in so short a
time: Nor am I perswaded it will
rest there, for this is but as an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of their affections, to let you
see, and the world know what <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects</hi>
you haue, that when your <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
and the good of the <hi>State</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
and <hi>Ayde</hi> asked in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of Parliament, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:14280:3"/>
want. This is not a gift of fiue
Subsidies alone, but the opening of
a Mine of Subsidies which lyeth in
their hearts. This good beginning
hath wrought already these ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
they haue taken your heart,
drawne from you a declaration that
you will loue Parliaments. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
this will be mett, I make no
question, with such respect, that
their demands will be iust, dutifull
and moderate: For they that know
thus to giue, knowe what is fit to
aske: then cannot your Maiestie
do lesse then outgoe their demands
or else you doe lesse then your selfe,
or them: For your Message begat
trust, their trust and your promise
must then beget performance. This
being done, then shall I with a glad
heart hold this worke as well ended
<pb facs="tcp:14280:4"/>
as now begun, and then shall I hope
that Parliaments shalbe made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
so frequent, by the effects and
good vse of them, as shall haue this
further benefit, to deterre from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
your eares those <hi>Proiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi>
&amp; <hi>Inducers</hi> of Innouation, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers
both of <hi>Church</hi> &amp; <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
Now <hi>Sir,</hi> to open my heart
and to ease my griefe, please you to
pardon me a word more. I must
confesse I haue long liued in paine,
<hi>Sleepe</hi> hath giuen mee no rest, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours</hi>
&amp; <hi>Fortunes</hi> no content, much
haue bene my secret sorrowes to be
thought the man of <hi>Seperation,</hi> and
that diuided the <hi>King</hi> from his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and them from him; but I hope
it shall appeare, they were some mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
mindes, that would haue
made me the euill Spirit that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:14280:4"/>
betweene a good <hi>Master</hi> and
a loyall People for ill offices.
VVhereas by your <hi>Maiesties</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
I shall euer endeauour to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
my selfe a good Spirit brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
nothing but the best of serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
vnto them all. Therefore this
day I account more blessed vnto me
then my birth, to see my selfe able
to serue them, to see you brought
in loue with Parliaments, to see a
Parliament expresse such loue to
you. Loue them I beseech you,
and God so loue me and mine, as
I ioy to see this day.</p>
