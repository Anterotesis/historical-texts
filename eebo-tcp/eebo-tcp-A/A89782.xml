            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Nineteene humble Propoſitions for Peace, which the Author deſireth to cleere and make evident to all the true-hearted Citizens of London, if God will direct their hearts to heare and imbrace the ſame (and importune the Parliament for the practice thereof) for the good of City and Countrey, humbly ſhewing,</head>
            <p>THat your poor and almoſt reſtleſſe Suppliant, who for the ſpace of eight or nine moneths in the neglect of his own private affairs and livelihood having continually almoſt had new ſolicitations in his thoughts of certaine probable wayes and means for the deliverance of this City and almoſt the whole Kingdome with the ſpare of much money now ſpent, and bloud now ſpilt, hath ſought continuall opportunity to declare the ſame to you that being faithfull had power to execute the ſame, yet notwithſtanding could never get a hearing, Gods time being not then come, do yet once more, not knowing Gods time, try if God will now at laſt move your hearts in generall, or any particulars of you, to joyn together to hear him at large concerning that, the heads whereof he hath here ſet down, he doth not doubt but if God affect your hearts to hear, and endeavour the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ſame, that you will think it the beſt ſpent time you ſpent in temporall occaſions ſince our King depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from us, which alſo will be joyfull to many, and incourage them in your defence, which at preſent for feare dare not move therein, for if God do it, he will do it I conceive by a means yet unthought of in generall.</p>
            <p n="1">1 How to ſecure the ſtore of food, and chief goods both in City and Countrey for the uſe of the owners thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2 How to treble your ſtrength, and make them your helpers, that now (fearing your ſide the weakeſt) dare not.</p>
            <p n="3">3 How to make your enemies not onely defend your cauſe, but to doe it willingly, becauſe thereby they ſhould make their owne eſtates the more ſecure, and have a lawfull ſatisfactory excuſe if they be taken.</p>
            <p n="4">4 How notwithſtanding the enemies threatning, yet to keep the City and Countrey yet unplundered from ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or fear of ſtarving.</p>
            <p n="5">5 How to prevent the enemies Troupes, coming among us, of ſubſiſtence, except by yeelding up horſes and armes, which they will rather do then loſe their lives.</p>
            <p n="6">6 How to prevent a way of deſtruction which is like to come by the corne which our God ordinarily ſendeth for our preſervation.</p>
            <p n="7">7 How to make a comfortable defence about all places yet unplundered, to the great joy of the inhabitants, whereby they ſhall be a refreſhing to the City, and the City to them.</p>
            <p n="8">8 How to increaſe bread by deſtroying drunkenneſſe.</p>
            <p n="9">9 How to increaſe our friends and ſtore with the loſſe of nothing but ſuch members as we would not own and enjoy.</p>
            <p n="10">10 How it will ſo appear unto all, that they ſhall prevail in your cauſe, and thereby enjoy their lives, goods and priviledges, as it will much increaſe their courage therein.</p>
            <p n="11">11 How abundance of money of Colonels, Captaines and Officers wages, as alſo of the horſe and his rider might be ſpared.</p>
            <p n="12">12 How to give warning of the approach of the enemy, and to diſcover the number of them to the countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and which way they march, without ſending to them.</p>
            <p n="13">13 How both food and firing would hold out foure times as long as it is like to laſt, in a way much more profitable to the City and Countrey.</p>
            <p n="14">14 How this courſe would keep many friends among us that are daily flying beyond the ſeas.</p>
            <p n="15">15 How many women and maids would be as beneficiall as men.</p>
            <p n="16">16 How full of joy the practice hereof would fill the hearts of City and Countrey.</p>
            <p n="17">17 How it would in an ordinary way of providence be to the great increaſe of friends, food and ſtore.</p>
            <p n="18">18 How to keep your ſecrets from your enemies, and any other letters from paſsing to them.</p>
            <p n="19">19 The loſſe of enemies, which as it will be the increaſe of our food, which they being among us ſpend, ſo it will cauſe a ſcarcity of food among the enemies, and ſtore of food will procure friends.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beſeech you conſider, and uſe your beſt endeavour, if the Lord will ſhew you in this your day the things that belong to your peace. The weaker the means, and baſer the inſtrument, the more Gods own hand is ſeen.</hi>
