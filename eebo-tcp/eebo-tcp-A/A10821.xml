         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Was not ignorant, <hi>(Right worthy friends)</hi> when first I undertooke this <hi>taske,</hi> and busied my selfe to compasse this <hi>Worke,</hi> how difficult it would prove to bee in it <hi>selfe;</hi> what slender furtherances I had to accomplish the <hi>same;</hi> and how weak my own abilities were to give <hi>it</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: yet notwithstanding all these obstacles, when I had duely considered the generall want <hi>thereof,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit and commoditie that would redound <hi>thereby,</hi> especially to those of my owne profession (if <hi>it</hi> might bee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or in some measure truely perfected) I resolved (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the silence of those of better indowments) to take <hi>the same</hi> in hand, and cheerfully and willingly layed both my hand to the <hi>Worke,</hi> and my shoulder to the burthen, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting and gathering with laborious industry, and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous labour all those principall points and heads, as might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conduce to the accomplishment of <hi>the building,</hi> or any way further my intended <hi>fabrique:</hi> So that by my continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all toyle, and search after fit and apt materials, I hoped that at length a good issue would crowne my indeavors, and finish this my intended undertaken <hi>taske.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after long and tedious inquisition, I found that the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I sailed in this <hi>Ocean,</hi> the vaster were my desires, and the fewer were my furtherances to my wished <hi>Port;</hi> so that
<pb facs="tcp:22849:5"/>
perceiving the <hi>Worke</hi> thus to increase upon me, beyond my expectation and first purpose, I was constrained (with the wind-scanted <hi>Seaman)</hi> to cast about againe, and limit my selfe to a narrower scantling; for that to doe it at large, and as the matter punctually required, was farre beyond the reach of my knowledge; yet because I could not doe as I would, I resolved to doe as I could, and thereupon begun againe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve these my first scattered Collections into a lesser mould, and reduce my first thoughts and observations into such a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond limit and order, as might best befit my experience, and the compasse to which now I had confined it; conceiving that as my intentions (ioyned to my labour and paines herein) tended onely to the good of others, and principally of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> and their actors, that reside or negociate in forreigne parts, so they will in requitall be induced to have a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>thereof,</hi> as a reward to mee, for the benefit that shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to them by <hi>the same,</hi> excusing those errors which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the better experienced may by triall find in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall of this <hi>Worke,</hi> and the defects which my ignorance hath inforced me to let passe, which by reason of the diversitie and rarity of the matter the same is most subject unto, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther because I have beene constrained oftentimes in this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert</hi> to travell without a certaine <hi>guide,</hi> and not seldome to navigate by anothers <hi>Compasse,</hi> having not in any Language or Countrey met with any <hi>Author,</hi> that could either totally conduct me, or truely rectifie my steps when I went astray; yet I must confesse I met with some that shot at the marke I aymed at; but it was at randome, and came not home to my proposed blanke; and I found <hi>some</hi> that tooke up stuffe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trust, and a <hi>second</hi> followed <hi>him,</hi> and a <hi>third</hi> that <hi>second,</hi> and heere (not able otherwise to contradict nor amend) I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so became a follower of theirs; some againe I observed to have borrowed from others, of which number I may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the Collections of <hi>Claud Bojer Lionois,</hi> of <hi>Gio: Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> a <hi>Florentine,</hi> of <hi>Iacob Cartolano,</hi> a <hi>Venetian,</hi> of <hi>Gio Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiste Zuchetta</hi> a <hi>Genovois,</hi> of Mr. <hi>Malines</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hunt</hi> our owne Countreymen, and some others, who againe gave addition to what they had in this nature gathered; but all
<pb facs="tcp:22849:5"/>
these (though by their indeavours meriting due commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet satisfied not throughly my curiositie, nor the earnest desire I had to bring this <hi>Worke</hi> to a more absolute perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore in this case I was furthered by some friends, whose <hi>Starre</hi> led mee when I was benighted, and whose <hi>Candle</hi> lightned me, when otherwise I should have stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; by which meanes, and my owne old twelve yeares collections, during my aboade and imployment in many parts of the World, I have at last by due sounding of the <hi>Channell,</hi> safely sailed over the <hi>Ocean</hi> afore-mentioned, and brought my <hi>Barke</hi> to an Anchor in <hi>her</hi> desired <hi>Harbour;</hi> and I hope so well observed the depths, shoulds, rocks and sands thereof, that he that navigates after me, and by this my <hi>Mapp,</hi> shall bee secured from all dangers, and thereby bring his accompts to that wished <hi>Port,</hi> that may prove both to his owne profit and Commoditie.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> having thus then understood with what industry and care the materials of this <hi>Edifice</hi> hath beene collected, what paines hath beene used to bring <hi>it</hi> to this conclusion and perfection, and having truely weighed the benefit arising <hi>thereby;</hi> all these I conceive are effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all inducements to challenge a faire acceptance from you: yet notwithstanding all these reall arguments I cannot denie, but the <hi>Worke it selfe</hi> may not onely suffer in the opinion of the censorious, but be also subject to the verdict of the judicious, both in the <hi>forme, manner, method</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> thereof, which I shall easily be brought to acknowledge, though as easily I might alleadge, that had not my younger yeares been drawne by adverse fortune or crosse fate, from the study of <hi>Arts</hi> to the studie of <hi>Marts,</hi> I might peradventure have delineated this <hi>Mapp</hi> with more curious colours, illustrated <hi>it</hi> with more diversity of pleasing objects, and adorned <hi>it</hi> with some more delightfull varietie; but proceeding thus from the Pen of a <hi>Merchant,</hi> from whom such excellencies cannot be expected, <hi>it</hi> may the rather find a favorable construction from the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous of my profession, and from the learned of what Art soever, to whose judgement and candid censure, I shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submit both my selfe and these my <hi>Labours;</hi> and for
<pb facs="tcp:22849:6"/>
those whose tender appetite cannot relish <hi>it</hi> in that nature as <hi>it</hi> is, and who are ignorant of my paines <hi>herein,</hi> it will not be judged to be a point of ill manners in mee to tell them, that this <hi>method, forme,</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> was prescribed me by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity and consequence of the <hi>Worke</hi> in hand, and by the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasme</hi> of my owne fancie, which I conceived in some sort I was bound a little to please, partly to ease the burthen I endured in the <hi>building,</hi> and principally to adde some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasure to the toyle I underwent in rearing the <hi>same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as touching the <hi>Structure it selfe,</hi> many motives have induced mee to lay the foundation <hi>thereof</hi> upon the knowledge of <hi>Geographie,</hi> and upon the use of <hi>Mapps</hi> and <hi>Sea-Cards</hi> in generall, so delightfull, profitable and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the <hi>Merchant,</hi> that it cannot be by him that would be accompted such a <hi>one,</hi> neither neglected nor omitted. The principall parts thereof I have touched, so farre only as conduced to the enlightening of the <hi>matter</hi> in hand, and to the generall understanding of the insuing <hi>Tract:</hi> from hence (for method sake) I was inforced to a cursory <hi>survey</hi> of the foure principall parts and divisions of the <hi>World,</hi> according to moderne Authors; from this I descend to the <hi>Empires, Kingdomes,</hi> and particular <hi>Provinces</hi> of each of them; and thence to the <hi>eminent</hi> and most <hi>noted Cities,</hi> and <hi>Townes</hi> of Traffique therein, whose scituation I have superficially run over, and in some sort, observed the most remarkable <hi>passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> as have presented themselves within the compasse of my <hi>reading;</hi> and for matter of <hi>Trade,</hi> I have in the first place ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the <hi>naturall artificiall Commodities</hi> therein found; then the <hi>Coines</hi> there in use and <hi>currant,</hi> with the <hi>value</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> thereof, and the <hi>species</hi> wherein <hi>Merchants</hi> do there frame and regulate their <hi>accompts</hi> by, also the <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of those places, together with their <hi>Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and how these are found to be calculated amongst the <hi>Italians,</hi> who are accounted the most expert <hi>Bankers</hi> and <hi>Exchangers,</hi> with all other fit instruments and materials, as at this day is found practised in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Merchandizing,</hi> in all the parts of the habitable <hi>World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:22849:6"/>
And in conclusion, I have added a Table of the <hi>longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and <hi>latitude</hi> of all these <hi>eminent</hi> places of <hi>Traffique,</hi> not onely thereby to satisfie the curious, but the better to guid the inquirer to any such <hi>Citie</hi> or <hi>Towne</hi> sought for: In the rest, I have (following the example of many <hi>Merchants)</hi> shewed the <hi>worst</hi> first, and the <hi>best</hi> last; I meane declared the particulars of the <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> as the least and worst knowne unto us; then of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and <hi>last</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> as the <hi>best,</hi> and best knowne to us, and according to my <hi>Title</hi> included and concluded all, within the <hi>famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of London</hi> where we abide, which ever with all grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes as the place of my Education in the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,</hi> I am obliged to honour.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, in all this <hi>Worke</hi> my ambition still hath prompted me to an indeavour of pleasing all <hi>Merchants</hi> in generall, and (if I may not bee thought to judge too favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of this <hi>Child</hi> of my owne <hi>braine)</hi> I may be induced to beleeve I shall hereby please not onely the most, but also the most ingenuous. I am confident, were my <hi>Labours</hi> truely scand, my <hi>indeavours</hi> might challenge that thankes I expect; and he that knowes both my publique and private imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, may well answere for me, and excuse the defects or omissions, that may by further triall peradventure be found herein; and if in the future I find <hi>this</hi> acceptable, I may yet bee incouraged to publish some other <hi>Workes,</hi> which in this kind I have hewen out to your profit and commoditie: till when, and ever, I remaine,</p>

               <p>How excellent is it then for a <hi>Merchant</hi> (that hath another proper and peculiar end of his travels,) so to imploy his time and spend his houres, as that he may at pleasure, without cost or char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, reape that benefit to himselfe which others purposely come to learn and painfully labour for, with great expence of time and money; and yet for all this, are peradventure destitute of those helpes and furtherances, which <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>Factors</hi> by reason of their aboad or vocation doe continually injoy, and who return as ignorantly home (perchance) as they went out; or happily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with some such <hi>cursory speculations,</hi> as reach not into the depth of such <hi>policies</hi> of government, as the reall intent of their

               <p>
                  <hi>Geographie</hi> in brief then, <hi>is an Art that doth demonstrate by rules in a flat, levell or Plano; the whole Sea and Earth, and the division</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Geographie demonstrated.</note> 
                  <hi>thereof, setting downe by a certaine method, the limits and extents of Countries, Provinces and dominions of Princes; the scituation of Cities, Townes, Hills, Rivers, Woods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The bounds of Seas, Capes, Ilands,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All which is performed and expressed by apt lines, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and parts of the Heavens: and lastly, it giveth rules to know the distances of the said places, either in leagues or miles from one Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, City or place to another;</hi> all which being also necessarie to be known by the <hi>Merchant,</hi> I will in few words declare the same.</p>
               <p>First then to make <hi>the same</hi> more evident, the ground of this <hi>Art</hi> is ordinarily demonstrated and best expressed in <hi>Mappes</hi> and <note place="margin">Maps and Cards.</note> 
                  <hi>Cards,</hi> which doth comprize both the Earth and Waters, of which making one intire <hi>body,</hi> the <hi>Cosmographers</hi> do inviron with five Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the first is the <hi>equinoctiall,</hi> then the two <hi>tropicks,</hi> and lastly the two <hi>polar circles;</hi> thereby dividing the <hi>whole,</hi> which now we call the <hi>World</hi> into five <hi>Zones,</hi> two whereof are found to be <hi>cold,</hi> two <hi>temperate,</hi> and one <hi>extreme hot:</hi> all which in these our daies are found to be habitable, contrary to the opinion of some an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Cosmographers,</hi> of which <hi>circles</hi> and their particular parts, divisions, demonstrations and descriptions, it will not be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I should briefly handle, as an entrance into <hi>this worke,</hi> and for the better understanding of what is to follow hereafter.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Mappe</hi> or <hi>Carde</hi> then for the most part is commonly <note place="margin">The use of Maps and Cards in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. <hi>Meridian.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Parallels</hi> are either <hi>right</hi> or <hi>circular lines,</hi> imagined to be equally distant one from another, which doe crosse the aforesaid <note place="margin">Parallel.</note> 
                  <hi>meridians</hi> with <hi>right angles;</hi> and in the very midst of these Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall <hi>Maps</hi> and <hi>Cards,</hi> are most commonly drawn, from head to foot a right <hi>line,</hi> which signifieth not onely the first <hi>Meridian,</hi> but also the <hi>axletree</hi> of the <hi>World;</hi> the upper end of which <hi>line</hi> is call'd the <hi>Poleartick,</hi> or the <hi>North Pole,</hi> and the nether end is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Poleantartick,</hi> or the <hi>South Pole,</hi> and this <hi>line</hi> is crossed in <note place="margin">

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22849:16"/>
halfe towards the left hand, sheweth the West part of the World; so as these two <hi>lines,</hi> the first <hi>meridian</hi> and the <hi>equinoctiall,</hi> do point out the 4 <hi>quarters</hi> of the VVorld; <hi>East, West, North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> from whence the 4. principall winds do blow, betweene which winds are set down in all generall <hi>Maps,</hi> and generally in all <hi>Sea-cards</hi> the other division of the winds, which as not much pertinent to my present purpose, I willingly omit.</p>
               <p>Further, it is to be noted that both the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> and the <hi>Meridian circles</hi> or <hi>lines</hi> are divided each of them into 360. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;</hi> so as every quarter of them containeth 90. <hi>degrees:</hi> and in the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> are set down the <hi>degrees</hi> of longitude, which is the length of the VVorld, round about from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East,</hi> and from <hi>East</hi> by <hi>West</hi> home againe. The first <hi>degree</hi> whereof begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth where the first aforesaid <hi>Meridian</hi> crosseth the <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> in the very midst of all Universall <hi>Maps</hi> in generall, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth Eastward unto the number of 180. <hi>degrees;</hi> which is as farre as you can goe Eastward: for from thence by reason of the roundnesse of the Earth, you must needs turn back againe VVest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, untill you come to the 360. <hi>degrees,</hi> which is the last <hi>degree</hi> of longitude, and endeth where the first <hi>degree</hi> beginneth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the said first <hi>Meridian</hi> are set downe the <hi>degrees</hi> of latitude, that is, the breadth of the VVorld, both in Northern and Southern, for from the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> to the <hi>North Pole,</hi> are contained in the aforesaid <hi>Meridian 90. degrees,</hi> and that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>North</hi> Latitude; and from the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> to the <hi>South Pole</hi> are contained in the said <hi>Meridian,</hi> other 90. <hi>degrees,</hi> which is called the <hi>South</hi> latitude; and in most <hi>Mappes</hi> the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> Line is divided and crossed with 18. <hi>Meridians,</hi> on each side of the first <hi>Meridian,</hi> dividing the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> into 36. severall <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;</hi> every <hi>distance</hi> containing 10. <hi>degrees,</hi> and every <hi>degree</hi> containeth 60. <hi>Italian</hi> Miles of length.</p>
               <p>Againe; betwixt the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> and each of the <hi>Poles</hi> are <note place="margin">Circles Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artick.</note> drawn certaine Circles or lines, which as I said before, are called <hi>Parallèls,</hi> of which most commonly it is found that 4. are poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with red ink, signifying, the 4. lesser <hi>circles;</hi> the highest towards the <hi>North Pole,</hi> is called the <hi>Circlearticke,</hi> which is 23. ½ <hi>degrees</hi> distant from the <hi>Pole;</hi> and the lowest towards the <hi>South Pole</hi> is call'd the <hi>Circleantartick,</hi> which is also distant 23. ½ <hi>degrees</hi> from the <hi>Pole;</hi> and as touching the other two red <hi>Circles,</hi> the one lying betwixt the <hi>Circlearticke</hi> and the <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> it is called the <hi>Tropique</hi> of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and the other lying betwixt <note place="margin">2 Tropiques. 1 Cancer, 2 Capricorn.</note> the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> and the <hi>Circleantarticke,</hi> that is called the <hi>tropique</hi> of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and each of these two <hi>tropiques</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the <hi>Equinoctiall 23. degrees,</hi> 2. 8. ½ which is the greatest declination of the <hi>Sunne;</hi> for betwixt these two <hi>tropiques</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> continually maketh his course, and returneth, mounting never higher then the <hi>tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> nordescending never lower then

the <hi>tropique</hi> of <hi>Capricorne:</hi> for which cause some do set down in their <hi>Maps</hi> betwixt the said two <hi>tropiques</hi> an overthwart line, signifying the <hi>ecliptick</hi> line, under which the <hi>Sun</hi> continually wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, by helpe of the said 4. <hi>circles,</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> (as I said before) is divided into 5. <hi>Zones,</hi> one <hi>hot,</hi> two <hi>temperat,</hi> and two cold: The <hi>hot</hi> is contained betwixt the two <hi>tropiques</hi> in the midst of <note place="margin">Five <hi>Zones</hi> and where placed.</note> which the <hi>equinoctiall</hi> line is placed; and of the two <hi>temperate Zones,</hi> the one lieth betwixt the <hi>tropique</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and the <hi>Circleartick,</hi> and the other betwixt the <hi>tropique</hi> of <hi>Capricorn</hi> and the <hi>Circleant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artick;</hi> and of the <hi>cold Zones;</hi> the one lieth betwixt the <hi>north Pole</hi> and the <hi>Circleartick,</hi> and the other betwixt the <hi>south Pole</hi> and the <hi>Circleantartick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, besides the 4. speciall <hi>Parallels,</hi> there be also divers other <hi>Parallels</hi> drawn on each side of the <hi>equinoctiall,</hi> both <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and <hi>Southward,</hi> which crossing in certaine <hi>points,</hi> the first <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> marked with <hi>degrees,</hi> doe shew the true latitude of every place, and under what <hi>Clime</hi> or <hi>Parallel</hi> it is: and also how many houres the longest day of any place under every <hi>Parallel</hi> is, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to account the same; either from the <hi>equinoctiall</hi> upward, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>north Pole,</hi> along the first <hi>meridian,</hi> marked with <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude, or else from the first <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards towards the <hi>south Pole,</hi> marked with <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>southern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22849:18"/>
wind you may saile from one Point, Cape or Citie maritime to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: in which foure things the chiefe vse of <hi>Maps</hi> are found principally to consist. First then, the <hi>degrees</hi> of latitude or the <note place="margin">Latitude how accounted.</note> 
                  <hi>elevation</hi> of the <hi>Pole</hi> (being both one thing) is accounted from the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> to either <hi>Pole</hi> which is 90. <hi>degrees,</hi> and the <hi>degrees</hi> of longitude accounted vpon the said <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> from the <hi>Iles</hi> of <hi>Cape Verde</hi> towards the <hi>East,</hi> and so round about the <hi>Earth</hi> till you come to the number of 360. <hi>degrees:</hi> where it is to be noted that the <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Townes</hi> scituated vnder one and the same <hi>degree</hi> of latitude, have at one selfe time like houres of the day; but those that are scituated vnder divers <hi>degrees</hi> of longitude doe differ in number of houres; and that is the cause that when it is in one <hi>towne</hi> noone-tide, it is in another <hi>towne</hi> distant thence 30. <hi>degrees</hi> towards the <hi>East</hi> two a clocke in the afternoone, and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently for euery 15. <hi>degrees</hi> distance, it is then found to differ one houre in time.</p>
               <p>Also those that dwell vnder one and the selfe same degree of <note place="margin">Dayes and nights differ according to the latitude.</note> latitude haue equall quantitie of dayes and nights; but yet so as they which dwel on the <hi>South</hi> side of the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> have the shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test day, whenwe have the longest, and have their <hi>Winter</hi> when we have <hi>Summer:</hi> and those that are vnder divers <hi>degrees</hi> of latitude, have inequalitie of dayes and nights; for the nigher that any <hi>Place</hi> is scituated towards any of the <hi>Poles,</hi> the more houres the longest day of the yeare in that <hi>place</hi> hath; and those that dwell vnder the <hi>equinoctiall</hi> have alwaies their dayes and nights of like quantity: but I vnderstand heere by the day the space betweene Sun rising and Sun-setting; so that to those that have 30. <hi>degrees</hi> of latitude the longest day is almost 14. houres, and the nigher the <hi>Pole,</hi> the longer, insomuch as those that dwell vnder the <hi>Pole,</hi> and whose <hi>Zenith</hi> is the <hi>Pole,</hi> their yeare is but a day and a night, that is to say, they have sixe moneths day, and sixe moneths night.</p>
               <p>It is also to be noted, that the <hi>Meridians</hi> are found to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny necessary vses in the generall and common <hi>Maps,</hi> for thereby is learned that it is noon-tide or mid-day sooner in one place then in another, by observing that <hi>Meridian</hi> that is most towards the <hi>East,</hi> which the Sun toucheth alwaies sooner then that <hi>Meridian</hi> which is more towards the <hi>West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the <hi>Meridians</hi> is also known how the <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Meridians and their vse.</note> appeareth sooner to one place then to another, and sheweth what varietie of time; for they whose <hi>Meridian</hi> is toward the <hi>West,</hi> do see the <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> sooner then they whose <hi>Meridian</hi> is more towards the <hi>East;</hi> whereas indeed the <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> is seene to all places (where it can be seene) at one very instant of like greatnes, and yet seemeth to bee seene later or sooner by reason of the diversity of the time of the day, in places standing one <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West</hi> from another; and if the distance betwixt those <note place="margin">Eclipse of the Moone when seene.</note> two <hi>Meridians</hi> doe containe 15. <hi>degrees</hi> of the <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22849:18"/>
the <hi>Eclipse</hi> appeareth to bee sooner to the one then to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by one whole houre, according to my former assertion, for every 15. <hi>degrees</hi> maketh an houre, and therefore observe how many 15. <hi>degrees</hi> you find betwixt the two <hi>meridians,</hi> so many houres are to be accounted, and if fewer <hi>degrees</hi> be found, then the time of the <hi>Eclipse</hi> is to bee shortned accordingly, attributing 4. minutes of an houre to one degree, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Eclipse</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> it is seene neither generally nor fully at one selfe same time, nor yet of the same greatnes in all <note place="margin">Eclipse of the Sunne when seene.</note> places: indeed it appeares sooner, to the <hi>Westerne</hi> Countries then to the <hi>Easterne;</hi> but the diversity of the time of appearance doth depend not onely of the number of <hi>Meridians</hi> betwixt the two places, but also of the swift or slow motion of the <hi>Moone,</hi> which comming betwixt vs and the <hi>Sun</hi> taketh the sight of the <hi>Sunne</hi> from vs.</p>
               <p>The latitude and longitude of <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>places</hi> may bee found <note place="margin">Latitude and longit. found out by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians.</note> out by the <hi>meridians</hi> also; but heere it is observeable that the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of latitude are in all places of like bignes, as making ever 60. miles, but the <hi>degrees</hi> of longitude proceeding from the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall</hi> towards any of the two <hi>poles,</hi> are unequall, and every one shorter then the other, and containing 4. miles; so that if two <hi>Ships</hi> were under the <hi>Equinoctiall 150. degrees</hi> distant each from other, and being to saile towards the <hi>North pole,</hi> upon the same course when they come to the 60. <hi>degree</hi> of latitude, their distance shall bee but 75. <hi>leagues,</hi> and the farther <hi>they</hi> goe towards the <hi>Pole,</hi> the lesse distance <hi>they</hi> shall be one from the other, insomuch as when <hi>they</hi> are right vnder the <hi>Pole</hi> it selfe, <hi>they</hi> shall both meet: but this <hi>point</hi> doth more particularly concerne <hi>Navigation,</hi> which so farre forth as it is requisite to the knowledge of a <hi>Merchant,</hi> I have handled in my <hi>Booke</hi> of the <hi>Factors Aviso,</hi> which together with a <hi>collection</hi> of the <hi>Sea-lawes</hi> I intend (God willing) hereafter to publish.</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch as the vse of these latitudes and longitudes is most necessary and needfull in <hi>this Art,</hi> it is proper I should set downe the waies whereby not onely these latitudes and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitudes, but also the distances of all <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>places</hi> by all univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <hi>Maps</hi> and <hi>Sea-cards</hi> that are perfectly drawn and delineated, is learned and found out.</p>
               <p>First then, to find out the longitude of any place, doe thus: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <note place="margin">To find out the longitude of a place.</note> a <hi>thred</hi> so as it passe through the <hi>Pole</hi> and through the <hi>place</hi> whose longitude you seeke in any <hi>Map</hi> or <hi>Card,</hi> euen to the very <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> and somwhat beyond, holding the <hi>thred</hi> strait, and then the number of <hi>degrees</hi> written vpon the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> will shew the longitude;</p>
               <p>Againe, by the <hi>Meridians</hi> likewise are knowne what longitude any <hi>place</hi> in the <hi>Map</hi> hath: as thus; Set the one foot of a paire of <hi>compasses</hi> in the <hi>place</hi> it selfe, and the other in some <hi>Meridian,</hi> that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22849:19"/>
is next unto it, whither on the right hand or onthe left it matters not; from thence draw downe your <hi>compasse,</hi> following still that <hi>Meridian</hi> untill you come to the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> line, and there marke upon what <hi>degree</hi> of the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> that foot of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe</hi> which you did first put in the <hi>place</hi> doth rest; then count how many <hi>degrees</hi> that is distant from the first <hi>Meridian,</hi> and that is the true longitude of the <hi>place;</hi> and note that that longitude ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to all the <hi>places</hi> that be vnder that <hi>Meridian,</hi> though they be never so farre distant one from another <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the latitude of that <hi>place</hi> or anyother, do thus: Set <note place="margin">To find out the latitude of a place.</note> the one foot of your <hi>compasses</hi> in the very <hi>pole,</hi> extending the other to the <hi>place</hi> or <hi>Citie</hi> whose latitude you seeke, and keeping your <hi>compasse</hi> at that widenes, bring the movable foot to the first <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> whereon the <hi>degrees</hi> of latitude are marked, and there stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the number of the <hi>degrees</hi> counting from the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> vpwards towards the <hi>Pole,</hi> will shew the latitude of the <hi>place</hi> sought, and note that the like latitude have all they that dwell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>parallel,</hi> how farre soever they dwell asunder <hi>east</hi> and <hi>west,</hi> and by knowing the latitude of any <hi>place,</hi> you may quickly also find in some <hi>Maps</hi> under what <hi>clime</hi> or <hi>parallel</hi> such a <hi>place</hi> is sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated, and of how many houres the longest day is there.</p>
               <p>Now to know how one <hi>place</hi> beareth from another and with what wind your <hi>Ship</hi> is to be directed from one <hi>Maritime port</hi> to another, is needles heere to bee handled, as not pertinent to my <hi>taske;</hi> but for what distance is betwixt two severall <hi>places,</hi> many <hi>Cosmographers</hi> have found, by severall waies taught the same, <hi>one</hi> only, the most common in use, I will pitch vpon, as the most facile and easie.</p>
               <p>To find out then the distance betwixt any two <hi>places,</hi> doe thus: <note place="margin">To find out the distance of two places or Cities.</note> Set the one foot of your <hi>compasse</hi> on the one <hi>place,</hi> and the other foot on the other <hi>place,</hi> and apply that widenesse to the <hi>equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall,</hi> and looke how many <hi>degrees</hi> of the <hi>equinoctiall</hi> that wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse comprehendeth, and allowing 60. <hi>Italian miles</hi> to every <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree</hi> you shall have the distance by a right <hi>line</hi> of those two <hi>places</hi> demanded.</p>
               <p>But if the said two <hi>places</hi> have both either <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South</hi> lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, then <hi>substract</hi> the lesser latitude out of the greater, so shall you find the difference, which difference if you multiply by 60. the <hi>product</hi> will be the number of <hi>miles;</hi> and if to the whole <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees</hi> of difference there bee annexed any <hi>minutes,</hi> then you must adde to the <hi>product</hi> for every <hi>minute</hi> a <hi>mile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if one of the two <hi>places</hi> haue <hi>North</hi> latitude, and the other <hi>South</hi> latitude, then you shall find their difference by <hi>addition</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">The distances of two places having diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and east and west la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note> and not by <hi>substraction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if you would find the distance of two <hi>places,</hi> differing only in longitude, both <hi>places</hi> having either <hi>east</hi> or <hi>west</hi> latitude; then <hi>substract</hi> the lesser out of the greater, so shal you have the true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22849:19"/>
which difference you must <hi>multiply</hi> by the number of <hi>miles</hi> belonging to their latitude, which commonly is found on the <hi>North-west</hi> side of the <hi>Maps,</hi> or by the <hi>table</hi> of <hi>miles</hi> answerable, of one <hi>degree</hi> of every latitude, and the <hi>product</hi> thereof will bee the number of <hi>miles;</hi> whereby the one <hi>place</hi> is distant from the other; but if the one <hi>place</hi> have <hi>East</hi> longitude, and the other <hi>West</hi> longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, then you must find the difference as well by <hi>addition</hi> as by <hi>substraction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude this point, I conceive it not much materiall to <hi>my purpose</hi> further to insist hereupon; for the <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>ingenious</hi> will easily hereby comprehend the benefit that may redound to him by a generall inspection in this <hi>Art,</hi> referring what is here by me willingly omitted to his owne private search and studie, and to such <hi>Authors</hi> as have learnedly written of this subject more at large; and therefore from the universall knowledge of <hi>Maps</hi> that pointeth out the generall divisions of the World, I will come to the particulars comprised therein, and view the <hi>subdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi> thereof, as <hi>Potencie, Might</hi> and <hi>Soveraigntie</hi> have prescribed rules thereunto.</p>

               <p>In the times of old amongst us, and yet in these dayes in many <note place="margin">Bartering.</note> places of <hi>America, Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> the <hi>first</hi> manner of <hi>Bartering</hi> was and is yet in use and practised, where though <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver</hi> and <hi>brasse</hi> was not known nor accounted as a stamped <hi>coine,</hi> yet it was then both here, and is still there held in greater estimation then was any other <hi>commodity</hi> or <hi>mettall;</hi> the which <hi>Homer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth in his relation of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Warre, where <hi>he</hi> mentioneth that <hi>Achilles</hi> his <hi>golden</hi> Armour, was valued in <hi>barter</hi> at <hi>one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Oxen,</hi> and that the <hi>brasse</hi> Armour of <hi>Diomedes</hi> was valued in <hi>barter</hi> but at <hi>nine:</hi> But <hi>Man</hi> in processe of time, finding it too too difficult a thing, and too too troublesome a busines, to carry about him, all things thus <hi>barter'd</hi> and <hi>trucked</hi> from one place to another, chose out <hi>one singular thing;</hi> which as a common <hi>standard</hi> or measure, should countervaile and be in Value as all other things, and which should be received and accounted of in <hi>payment, satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>equivalencie</hi> to all others, and the things thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen and estimated, was <hi>gold, silver</hi> and <hi>brasse,</hi> the most excellent of Mettals, which being then and since, by the authority of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, divided into great and small peeces, and into severall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct parts and denominations, was stamped and coyned with severall <hi>characters,</hi> to denote thereby the true weight and value of the same; the which was first done by <hi>Servius</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> of <hi>brasse,</hi> whereon was imprinted the image of Sheep and Oxen, betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wealth and riches of those dayes, as <hi>moneys</hi> do now with us; and because that ten of those pieces was then called a <hi>denier,</hi> therefore it is, that universally all such moneys are still called by the Latines <hi>Denarij:</hi> this being then the <hi>originall</hi> of <hi>Moneys,</hi> afterward came to be coined both of <hi>silver,</hi> and <hi>gold;</hi> as I shall more at large have occasion to demonstrate in the Chapter of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> in this following Treatise.</p>
               <p>This <hi>first</hi> sort of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> or Commerce then, as I said <note place="margin">Bargaining.</note> before, termed <hi>Bartering</hi> or <hi>Trucking,</hi> of one commodity for another, begat consequently by the meanes of <hi>moneys,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> manner of <hi>negotiation,</hi> which is <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling,</hi> or <hi>bargaining;</hi> for all <hi>Merchants</hi> that would transport commodities from one Countrey or place to another, to effect the same, needed either other commodities, wherewith to <hi>barter</hi> and so to procure them, or <hi>money</hi> and so to buy them; and therefore to facilitate <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing,</hi> and to take away the incommodity and danger of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>moneys,</hi> about a man, or from place to place, A meane was invented to have the <hi>same</hi> in what Countrey a man pleased, without trouble or danger of the transport, carridges or rigor thereof; and this was found to be best performed by <hi>exchange,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exchanging.</note> which is the <hi>third</hi> sort of <hi>commutaetion;</hi> the which is noted to be no other then the giving of so much <hi>moneys</hi> in one place to one, who should cause it to be againe repaid in another place by another
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22849:21"/>
for him; as for example, <hi>Edward</hi> hath here in <hi>London</hi> one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, and desireth to remit the same, or have it in the hands of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who resideth in <hi>Venice;</hi> and <hi>Lodowicke</hi> hath one thousand pounds in <hi>Venice,</hi> in the custody and hands of <hi>Thomas,</hi> which he would get, receive, and recover out and have them here: it happeneth that <hi>Edward</hi> meeteth with <hi>Lodowicke,</hi> to whom he delivereth and payeth the said one <hi>thousand pounds;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Lodowicke</hi> writeth to <hi>Thomas,</hi> that he pay the said thousand pounds to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and thus each party come to be both satisfied and accommodated; by which it may be discerned, that in all <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes,</hi> there is concluded two payments, two places, and fouro distinct persons; as he who payeth in the one place, and he who receiveth in the other; and he who receiveth in the one place, and he who payeth in the other; and from hence it consequently followeth, that no man can <hi>remit,</hi> except there be another to <hi>draw;</hi> nor no man can in the second place <hi>receive,</hi> except there be another authorized to <hi>pay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner then came in use the originall of <hi>exchanges,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely <note place="margin">Exchanges drawn into a profitable Art, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons there of.</note> invented to accommodate Trade and <hi>Commerce,</hi> the which at first was practised without either benefit or losse, or any other consideration; and to render againe the self same summe and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell as was received: but in processe of time it came to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the giver or deliverer of the money came both to lose a certain space in time ere the same was repayd, and did also run a certain risgoe in the payment thereof, which the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver or drawer injoyed, and profited by; and therefore it was held reasonable that the deliverer should have some fruit and benefit, in requitall and satisfaction thereof, which afterward occasioned that the second payment came to be somewhat grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the former; and that in consideration thereof there should be restored, more then was received: The indeavour of this gaine then hath converted <hi>exchanges</hi> since into an <hi>art</hi> or <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie;</hi> from whence it proceedeth, that many are found at this day to <hi>remit</hi> and <hi>deliver moneys,</hi> to the intent, to have the same retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with benefit, and not for a need or necessity to have it more in one place then in another; and many againe are found to be <hi>takers</hi> and <hi>drawers,</hi> not with intent to <hi>withdraw</hi> or recover their <hi>money,</hi> from another person, or place; but to serve themselves and their occasions with that of others, for a certaine time, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and allowing for the same, that consideration and interest as is agreed upon, and covenanted between them; which really and in effect is nothing else but a certaine kind of <hi>permitted Usury,</hi> and therefore by some accounted as a thing unlawfull, though by many, and by the common and received practise of the World, it is upheld and maintained with many solid reasons and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall arguments; besides which, it is considerable, and peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it may well be granted, that if it were not, that there is by

this <hi>art</hi> and <hi>mysterie,</hi> againe and profit made therof, very few <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes</hi> would present; because that <hi>draughts</hi> and <hi>remittances</hi> would in this nature but seldome happen, that would or might any way be available to Traffique and <hi>Commerce,</hi> and lesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit would consequently redound to the publike and universall <hi>Commerce</hi> of Kingdomes; and therefore though the intention of particular <hi>exchanges,</hi> be not alwaies found good herein, yet the generall good effect which <hi>it</hi> produceth, and that proceedeth therefrom, is in <hi>it</hi> self and in the true use and custome <hi>thereof</hi> both approved and laudable.</p>
               <p>Now in the <hi>first</hi> sort of <hi>commutation,</hi> which I terme <hi>bartering,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering.</note> many things do happen considerable and necessary in the <hi>art</hi> of <hi>Merchandizing;</hi> the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>knowledge</hi> as well in the commodity, thus to be delivered, as in the commodity so to be received: next a <hi>knowledge</hi> in respect of the <hi>value</hi> and present request and esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of both; then in respect of the <hi>quality,</hi> whether it be lasting and durable, or impairing and perishable; and <hi>lastly</hi> in respect of the <hi>property,</hi> whether it be of it selfe naturall and growing, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall, and made by the hand and industrie of man; and <hi>lastly</hi> in respect of the <hi>quantity,</hi> whether plentifull and in aboundance, or scarce and in few hands.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>commutation,</hi> which I terme <hi>bargayning,</hi> or <note place="margin">Things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining.</note> buying and selling, are likewise besides the above mentioned, these particulars to be well known and considered; <hi>first</hi> a <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> how the commodity is either bought or sold, as either by <hi>weight,</hi> as are ponderous commodities, or as by Concave or long <hi>measures,</hi> as are commodities of length, or commodities <hi>solid</hi> or <hi>liquid;</hi> the knowledge of which <hi>weights</hi> and <hi>measures,</hi> is in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perfectly to be known, and really to be understood; and then the finenesse, goodnes and currant valuation of the <hi>money</hi> of the place, is also to be known, and perfectly and rightly to be found out and distinguished, that the bargaine may appeare to be made the more justly, equally, and conscionablie between both parties; and for the needfull circumstances observed in <hi>bargaining,</hi> these foure things are considerable, as having necessary dependances upon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> a <hi>Merchant</hi> must know what to <hi>bargaine</hi> for, and under <note place="margin">Prncipally foure.</note> this the knowledge of the commodity it selfe is comprehended. <hi>Secondly,</hi> how to <hi>bargaine,</hi> and under this the knowledge of the weights and measures in the generall is comprised. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> when to <hi>bargaine,</hi> and under this the fit and proper seasons of <hi>bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> are generally included.

               </p>
               <p>Now in the <hi>third</hi> sort of <hi>commutation,</hi> which is here termed <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing,</hi> the things necessary to be knowne and considerable by <note place="margin">Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in Exchanging.</note> the said <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> are these: First a knowledge of

the finenesse, goodnesse and currant value of the <hi>Princes Coine,</hi> both where the partie <hi>Remitter</hi> abideth, and whither the said <hi>moneys</hi> are <hi>remitted; then</hi> a knowledge of the <hi>currant</hi> rate of the <hi>Exchanging</hi> of the <hi>Par</hi> or <hi>Value</hi> for <hi>Value,</hi> both according to the <hi>Standard</hi> of the Countrey, and according to the valuation of the <hi>currant Coine</hi> there passable; <hi>then</hi> of the <hi>Vsance</hi> of the Place; and <hi>lastly</hi> and principally, to avoid all prejudice and losse, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is to bee had of the <hi>partie</hi> who is the <hi>Drawer</hi> and <hi>Receiver</hi> of the same; and in default made of currant satisfaction and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accordingly, knowledge is to bee had of the due and true manner and forme of making of all <hi>legall intimations, protests,</hi> and other such needfull instruments, circumstances and observations as are requisite thereto, according to the strict and solemne rules required in a <hi>Bill of Exchange,</hi> which in its due place I shall more at large declare.</p>
               <p>Now forasmuch as many of these afore mentioned points may as well be included within the <hi>mystery</hi> of some subordinate trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as comprehended within the bounds of the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing;</hi> I shall not need to insist farther thereupon, onely heere insert some other principall parts and points more aptly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised within the particular limits of <hi>this Science,</hi> which in briefe I will only nominate, as fitly serving for an Induction to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent MAP OF COMMERCE, and as being the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, wherewith also this <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> is practised.</p>
               <p>I have noted before that <hi>Merchandizing</hi> principally consisteth of <hi>Adventures</hi> made abroad into severall <hi>Regions,</hi> and that for the most part <hi>Merchants</hi> are found to traffique and negociate into divers parts and Countries of the <hi>World</hi> by the helpe and benefit of the Seas and Navigation, and have to that end their <hi>Factors,</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and agents resident in <hi>forraigne</hi> parts to performe those their <hi>Mercantile</hi> Occasions, and that <hi>Ships</hi> and Vessels of all bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens are dayly seene to be by them so imployed and set on worke through all the parts of the habitable <hi>World,</hi> therefore the <hi>next point</hi> needfull their knowledge, and comprised in the <hi>Art of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing,</hi> I may intitle under the name of <hi>Shipping;</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly consisting of sundry portions may bee fitly distinguished within the duties of <hi>foure</hi> severall distinct <hi>persons.</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22849:24"/>
which no City or Town can properly be said to be, or to have a being: <hi>First,</hi> it must have Victualls to feed and nourish <hi>it;</hi> and this is the proper taske and duety of the <hi>Husbandman</hi> and <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard. Secondly, it</hi> must have Armes and Armour to defend <hi>it,</hi> and offend <hi>its</hi> Enemies; and this is the proper taske and duety of the Souldier. <hi>Thirdly, it</hi> must have wealth and riches, as sinewes for <hi>its</hi> imployment, in private and publike affaires; and this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per taske and duety of the <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>eminent inhabitants</hi> of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Fourthly, it</hi> must have Justice for criminall and civill causes, to punish the bad and reward the good; and this is the proper taske and duetie of <hi>Counsellors</hi> and <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>State. Fiftly, it</hi> must have Religion and the worship of GOD duely and reverently perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in it, and this is the proper task and duety of the Priesthood: And <hi>Sixtly,</hi> to make <hi>it</hi> a compleate, able and absolute Citie, <hi>it</hi> must have Trade and Arts, practised therein, and this is the proper taske and duetie of the <hi>Merchant</hi> and <hi>artificer</hi> that inhabit it. Now though many Cities are seen sometimes defective, in some of these parts, and are not so well furnished as this rule and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnes of a compleate Citie requireth; yet it is daily manifested to the judicious and learned in <hi>policies</hi> of State, and government of <hi>commonwealths,</hi> that <hi>Merchants,</hi> and such as exercise the trade of <hi>Merchandizing</hi> in Cities, do supply by their indeavours and abilities by <hi>traffique,</hi> most of those other parts and helpes here before specified; and which are or may be found deficient and wanting therein. For setting aside the worship and service of God, which is onely fit and proper to <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Church-men:</hi> The person and purse of the <hi>Merchant</hi> supplies in a faire measure, all the other parts beforementioned; for first the <hi>Merchants</hi> Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation and <hi>traffique,</hi> is seen to supply the City with <hi>corne, graine,</hi>

to build warlike Ships, to traine up Seamen; and to make the City and place of his abode famous and eminent by sundry other meanes, which I could exemplifie if need were in this place, and which at present I willingly omit.</p>
               <p>Now then if the <hi>Merchant</hi> and the <hi>art</hi> of <hi>merchandizing</hi> be so excellent, and consequently necessary in a <hi>City,</hi> and bringeth with it so many benefits and commodities: how happy then is that <hi>City,</hi> where many notable and well govern'd <hi>Merchants</hi> are found to reside, and where their care of their own profit is so necessarily interwoven with the care of the <hi>commonwealths,</hi> and <hi>its</hi> good, that to <hi>themselves</hi> and to their Countrey; their labours and adventures do bring in thus mutually, not onely a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, but also an honour: but to the matter, All <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Townes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">What Cities are found fit for trade and commerce.</note> are not found in themselves proper for <hi>commerce</hi> and <hi>traffique,</hi> nor yet all of them fit residences for <hi>Merchants;</hi> therfore it is seen by experience, that <hi>trade</hi> hath setled <hi>it</hi> self principally in two sorts of <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Townes,</hi> and in such <hi>first</hi> the Inhabitants by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and then Forraigners and Strangers by conversation, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and noted to have planted themselves and established a <hi>trade</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Traffique</hi> then residing and abiding principally in two severall <note place="margin">Two sorts of Cities of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique.</note> sorts of <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Townes,</hi> by daily observation are found to be such as these; the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>Maritime,</hi> and these are they that have <hi>their</hi> scituation on the Sea shore or coast, or upon navigable Rivers and streames; and the <hi>second</hi> are <hi>they</hi> that have their scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within some continent, and may be called <hi>land Townes</hi> and <hi>Cities,</hi> distant both from Sea and River. And though that in both these, <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>commerce</hi> is observable to be setled and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet the manner and common form of this <hi>trade</hi> is found to differ much, as being both of them proper to two severall sorts of <hi>traffique</hi> and Negotiation. <note place="margin">Sea Towns of trade what.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>trade</hi> observed then to be driven in Sea <hi>Townes</hi> or <hi>Cities,</hi> seated on navigable Rivers, is noted to subsist principally by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and by the easie transportation of <hi>merchandize</hi> by that commodiousnes, from one <hi>place</hi> to <hi>another;</hi> which is indeed the most proper and customarie way, whereby <hi>traffique</hi> is in these dayes seen to be maintained and preserved; for in many <hi>places</hi> thus scituated, it is noted that eminent <hi>Merchants</hi> do reside, who by reason of this neighbourhood of the Sea, and consequently of navigation, do hold a respondencie and <hi>trade</hi> from one fit <hi>place</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> over all the known parts of the habitable World, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the commodities of all other Countries, and exporting the native commodities of the place it self; and of this sort is <hi>Marsilia, Amsterdam, Genoa, Venetia, Sivil, Lisborne, London,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Cities,</hi> subsists by carriage of commodities by land, which in some places is done by Carts, in some by Camels, Caravans,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22849:25"/>
Mules, Horse, &amp;c. as is at this day seen practised in many great <hi>Cities</hi> of the World; as at <hi>Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Turkey,</hi> at <hi>Spahan</hi> in <hi>Persia,</hi> at <hi>Agra</hi> in the <hi>Moguls</hi> Countrey, and such other, who injoy neither the benefit of Rivers, not yet the commoditie of the Sea it self by many <hi>miles</hi> distance; yet therein are oftentimes found residing many <hi>Merchants</hi> of great eminencie and a nample <hi>trade</hi> is discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, as may be seen in this following <hi>tract.</hi> And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to adde some furtherance to this their want: some of these have a Sea port or haven, as the neerest whereto <hi>ships</hi> from other parts do come in; and do there both land and relade as occasion requireth, in which nature is <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Aleppo, Combrone</hi> to <hi>Spahan,</hi> and <hi>Sindy</hi> to <hi>Agra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Besides which, I might here adde a <hi>third</hi> sort of <hi>Cities,</hi> where yet <hi>trade</hi> is noted to be setled, differing from both the former, and <note place="margin">Townes of trade inmanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all arts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks.</note> which cannot be comprised within either of the limits; and these are such as subsist by some excellent or curious <hi>manuall Arts</hi> or <hi>fabriques,</hi> as is <hi>Norimberg</hi> and others in <hi>Germanie, Roven</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandie, Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Norwich</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> and some others, whose <hi>trade</hi> subsists by the benefit of nature, producing of it self, speciall or needfull commodities for <hi>traffique,</hi> as doth <hi>Bordeux</hi> by <hi>Gascoine</hi> Wines, <hi>Zante</hi> by <hi>Corrants, Smirna</hi> by Cottens, <hi>Gilan</hi> in <hi>Persia</hi> by raw Silke, <hi>Ivisa</hi> by Salt, and the like: and where these are joyned by scituation proper for <hi>traffique</hi> to the former, they are found to be farre more absolute, eminent and compleat, as shall be discerned also in this following <hi>tract.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are then the <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Townes</hi> which generally in this <note place="margin">The Cities of trade mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Map</hi> of <hi>Commerce.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Mappe</hi> I handle, relating as neere as my observation and reading will permit me, the commodities that the <hi>place</hi> doth naturally afford for <hi>Merchandize,</hi> and the commodities the same is noted properly to <hi>vent;</hi> together with the time when the same is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sent out or brought in, the quantity, how much; with all other such circumstances as are thereunto belonging.</p>
               <p>Moreover it is to be noted, that in all <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Townes</hi> of <note place="margin">Five places in a City depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding upon trade.</note> 
                  <hi>traffique,</hi> there are alwaies found <hi>five</hi> particular places, that onely have a being and dependencie upon the <hi>trade</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> place is it where <hi>Merchants</hi> and <hi>tradesmen</hi> do assemble and meet at certain houres, and limited times of the day, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre <note place="margin">The Burse or Exchange.</note> and treat together, concerning <hi>Merchandizing, shipping, buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>selling,</hi> and the like; as is seen to be the <hi>Royall Exchange</hi> of <hi>LONDON,</hi> the <hi>Burse</hi> in <hi>Antwerpe,</hi> the <hi>Piazze</hi> in <hi>Venetia,</hi> and the like in other places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>second</hi> place is it where the <hi>Princes, customes,</hi> and dueties <note place="margin">The Custome house.</note> upon all Wares, either imported or exported by way of <hi>Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize</hi> is seen to be paid and collected, where officers are appointed to attend the same; and where all Writs, as <hi>Cockets, bills of entrie, Certificates;</hi> and the like are granted, both to loade and land goods, either going out or coming in, and these are called by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall

names, as in most places <hi>Custome-houses, Dattio, Commercios,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> place is it where <hi>Merchants</hi> do keep their goods and <note place="margin">Magazines for commodities.</note> wares in, where <hi>weighers, porters, car-men</hi> and <hi>labourers</hi> do hourely attend to be set on worke; where <hi>Brokers</hi> and <hi>Contracters</hi> are daily imployed in making of <hi>bargaines,</hi> shewing of <hi>Wares,</hi> transporting of <hi>bils</hi> of <hi>dept,</hi> and such like, as is seen in the <hi>Besistons</hi> and <hi>Basars</hi> in <hi>Turkey, Alfond<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>next</hi> place is it where the publique <hi>beame</hi> is set up, by the authority of the Magistrate, to weigh all ponderous commodities <note place="margin">Kings Beame.</note> bought or sold; to decide differences and controversies arising by weights and weighing, and where a <hi>sworn weigher,</hi> with labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers at all houres attendeth upon <hi>Merchants</hi> occasions, and who by his place is to keep a Register of all commodities weighed, to serve if need shall so require; and in this nature is the <hi>weight-house</hi> called the Kings <hi>beame</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> the <hi>Domme</hi> at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> the <hi>Viconte</hi> in <hi>Roven,</hi> the <hi>Romano</hi> in <hi>Marsilia,</hi> and such like in other places of <hi>trade.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>next</hi> and last place is it where the publike <hi>measures,</hi> both <note place="margin">Met-house.</note> of length, of dry, and of liquid commodities, in every <hi>City</hi> are kept and set up by the authority of the Magistrate, to measure all measureable commodities bought or sold; to decide all differences and controversies arising thereabout; and where a <hi>sworn measurer</hi> is to give attendance with other necessary helpers at all houres to dispatch <hi>Merchants</hi> occasions, of which he is to keep a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to serve in time of need, as was seen of old to be the <hi>standard</hi> of Cheap in <hi>London,</hi> and as is found the like in other places.</p>
               <p>And thus much shall serve to have said of <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Townes</hi> in generall, of <hi>trade,</hi> and of the principall places found therein, which have a dependence thereupon; which few <hi>Cities</hi> in the World, of <hi>traffique</hi> do want or are found to be defective in.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Merchant</hi> then who intendeth to negociate and traffique <note place="margin">The Merchant must learne what the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes are, and duly pay them.</note> into any <hi>Citie</hi> or <hi>Kingdome</hi> (seeing there is a necessity in the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and discharge <hi>thereof)</hi> ought <hi>first</hi> diligently and carefully learne and observe the summe and quantity payable upon all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities whatsoever; and then truely and honestly satisfie the <hi>same</hi> according to the ordinances and proceedings used respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively in those Countries, partly to avoid the danger of the losse of the commodity (the nonpayment being in many places the forfeiture) and partly the better thereby to make his calculation either to buy or sell to profit, and that before he make <hi>entry</hi> of any goods in the said <hi>Custome-houses</hi> or office (thus appointed for the collecting of this duty) and that he take notice what the true and right custome in it selfe is; to further which knowledge it is often seene that a setled <hi>rate</hi> by Booke or particular <hi>Teriffe</hi> either in print or writing may easily in every such <hi>Citie</hi> of <hi>trade</hi> be had <note place="margin">Book of rates.</note>

and obtained: But if (as it is sometimes seene) in some places that the same cannot be had, then the <hi>Trader</hi> must learne in this case from others what the duety and <hi>Custome</hi> of the place is; wherein much care and circumspection is to be used, for the fraud and poling deceit, that is practised in sundry <hi>Custome-houses</hi> by many officers where no such Bookes are publique, is excessive, when either they collect the same to the immediate use of the <hi>Prince,</hi> or when they collect the same to their owne use, being let out to <hi>farme</hi> by contract and yearely rent unto them by <hi>his</hi> authority; many <hi>Merchants</hi> being deceived by their devices and slights, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under officers and new offices being dayly hatched up and maintained by the <hi>chiefe Customers</hi> and <hi>Farmers,</hi> not onely to the detriment of <hi>Merchants</hi> and of all <hi>Trade</hi> in particular, but also to the prejudice of the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> and all <hi>Traffique</hi> and <hi>Commerce</hi> in the generall.</p>

                  <hi>First,</hi> they are found to differ in regard of <hi>places</hi> and <hi>kingdomes,</hi>

               </p>

               <p>All these things and many others, as necessary to this <hi>Commerce,</hi>

and is ever a prejudice to him that is found to exercise <hi>Trade;</hi> for the rigor and strictnesse practised in sundry <hi>Countries</hi> herein a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Merchants</hi> is extreame, whereas these <hi>Customes</hi> are not duely and truely to the utmost satisfied and paid.</p>
               <p>As first in <hi>Russia, Denmarke</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the law is, that if a <note place="margin">

               <p>And if the <hi>Merchant</hi> would againe ship out those goods, so brought in by him, hee may doe it by certificate free of <hi>Custome</hi> for 13. moneths, and have the <hi>impost</hi> thereof returned to him againe, provided the propertie hath not beene during that time altered.</p>
               <p>There is also by way of <hi>tares</hi> granted to the <hi>Merchant</hi> in the <hi>Custome house 5. per cent.</hi> upon all commodities, either weighed or measured, and allowances upon <hi>Wines</hi> and <hi>Oyles</hi> for <hi>leakage,</hi> and upon <hi>Clothes, Kersies</hi> and such like <hi>one</hi> in <hi>ten</hi> for <hi>wrapers,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other limited observations, which are found published in his Majesties declaration, before the printed Booke of <hi>rates</hi> for <hi>Customes</hi> in <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>France, Germany,</hi> and many places of <hi>Italy</hi> and in the <hi>low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>

                     <hi>In</hi> Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands.</note> the goods concealed are onely forfeited; but the same may be afterwards compounded for, wherein the circumstances will in some places bee considered, and the manner how the error grew, and whether it appeare to be done with a set purpose or not.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Constantinople, Smyrna,</hi> and many places of <hi>Turkie</hi> the goods <note place="margin">

               <p>I have noted that the <hi>rates</hi> of the <hi>customes</hi> is found to alter in sundry <hi>countries,</hi> as in <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> is paid upon divers
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:22849:27"/>
goods, 10. <hi>per cent.</hi> upon some 20. and 25. <hi>per cent.</hi> In <hi>Turkie</hi> is paid by the <hi>English</hi> onely 3. <hi>per cent.</hi> but by all other <hi>Christian</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions 5. <hi>per cent.</hi> and the same is not there paid nor satisfied in <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> as in other <hi>Countries,</hi> but in <hi>species</hi> and in kind, except com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for before hand, and so by a value reduced into <hi>monies:</hi> so also it is in some <hi>Countries</hi> more and in some lesse, sometimes setled upon the <hi>hundred</hi> in value, and sometimes upon the <hi>peece;</hi> and in <hi>China</hi> and some places of <hi>India</hi> it is noted that in favour of this duety the vessell and Ship is measured in length, and bredth, and depth; and so by a certaine rule and summe the <hi>custome</hi> is le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied accordingly, upon all sorts of goods abord her without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction alike in bulke.</p>
               <p>Besides this duetie of <hi>Custome</hi> paid in most <hi>Cities</hi> by <hi>Merchants,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Impositions upon goods.</note> as I have shewed, there is another duety like to this, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of <hi>impositions,</hi> because the same is <hi>imposed</hi> upon some certaine and particular commodities, and not in generall (as <hi>customes</hi> are) upon all; the which also is not alike <hi>rated</hi> upon all <hi>wares:</hi> for though <hi>they</hi> be found now to bee much of the same nature as <hi>customes</hi> are, yet originally <hi>they</hi> are conceived to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>custome</hi> strained beyond a faire proportion, and are <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed</hi> oftentimes more for the inriching of some private <hi>courtier</hi> then for the profit or benefit of the Soveraigne, and which in <hi>themselves</hi> are found to be, very <hi>heavy excessive</hi> and <hi>burthensome</hi> upon some particular commodities; and therefore, as there is a necessity in the payment <hi>thereof;</hi> so is there likewise a necessity that the <hi>same</hi> be truely learned and knowne, and also the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity upon which the <hi>same</hi> is so <hi>imposed;</hi> lest otherwise the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> make a short reckoning in his accounts, and find this <hi>impost</hi> to deceive him of his expected and hoped for gaine.</p>
               <p>To conclude, neither are these duties thus to be onely learned <note place="margin">Fees to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to be paid and knowne.</note> and duely satisfied according to the <hi>customes</hi> and usance of euery <hi>Citie</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> but also all such appurtenances, as belong ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, in the passing of all goods in the said offices and <hi>Custome houses,</hi> as in <hi>bils</hi> of <hi>Entries, Cockets, Certificates, passing</hi> of <hi>Bonds,</hi> and all <hi>fees</hi> thereunto appertaining and thereupon depending, as to <hi>Waiters, Searchers, Clerkes, Visitors,</hi> and such like, be also knowne and satisfied, the better to avoid the dangers and inconveniences that may happen by the default thereof to the goods whereupon the same is liable.</p>
               <p>These <hi>Customes</hi> then and <hi>Impositions</hi> thus varying by time, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and circumstances, and imposed, altered and changed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the will of the <hi>Prince,</hi> are not by the industry of any one hand, to be punctually knowne in all places; therefore it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <hi>me</hi> to have given here these generall rules and observations conducing both to the knowledge and the necessity of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and payment <hi>thereof,</hi> for the better Reiglement of <hi>Commerce</hi> in this particular; therefore I may bee held excusable,

               <p>To proceed then, <hi>Budelius, Varro</hi> and sundry Authors writing <note place="margin">Moneys called by 3. severall names.</note> upon the originall of <hi>moneys,</hi> and upon the excellencie of this predominant pointe of <hi>traffique;</hi> affirme that all <hi>coines</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall have been nominated by their severall and distinct names. 1. <hi>Moneta, 2. Nummus, 3. Pecunia;</hi> the reasons given thereof are <note place="margin">Moneta.</note> these: First, <hi>Moneta</hi> is said to have taken that name, and is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>a Monendo,</hi> which is to admonish and warne the people of the name of the <hi>prince, vel Nummi nota,</hi> and of such a signe or marke impressed thereupon, thereby alluding to the saying of CHRIST, <hi>Matthew</hi> 22. Where the <hi>Pharises</hi> brought him a <hi>penny,</hi> he thereupon demanding <hi>whose image and superscription that was?</hi> and they answered <hi>Caesars;</hi> then said he unto them, <hi>give therefore to</hi> Caesar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caesars, <hi>and unto</hi> GOD <hi>the things that are</hi> GODS.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Nummus</hi> is said to take its name as some will have it <hi>à Numerando vel Nomine,</hi> of the name of the Prince stamped upon <note place="margin">Nummus.</note> it, as a <hi>Duccat</hi> is said from <hi>Ducatus,</hi> or as some say from <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> the <hi>Romane</hi> King, who is said to be the first that 1900.

yeares past, commanded <hi>moneys</hi> to be made, whereof ever since after his name every piece of <hi>money</hi> is called <hi>Nummus;</hi> or againe, as some hold, it is derived from <hi>Nomos,</hi> which signifieth a Law, and implyeth as much as such a <hi>Prince,</hi> or such a <hi>common wealth</hi> hath ordained <hi>money,</hi> from whom it hath taken a certaine price and valew.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pecunia</hi> is derived <hi>à Pecude.</hi> of <hi>cattle, sheep,</hi> and <hi>Oxen;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pecunia.</note> wherein was said to consist the wealth of the ancients, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the figure thereof was stamped; and is construed to be all manner of living Creatures, wanting the forme of Man: and some hold that the name of <hi>money</hi> signifieth, not onely <hi>money</hi> numbred or told, but also all things that are contained in the World; aswell moveable as immoveable, liquid as solid; and in generall all things whatsoever men have upon the earth.</p>
               <p>From these three names and kinds grew first amongst the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> a particular distinction, and nomination of the quality of the <hi>species,</hi> as they were <hi>currant</hi> in worth and esteeme amongst them: for they had then in use certaine <hi>moneys</hi> of <hi>copper,</hi> aswell as the others of <hi>silver</hi> and <hi>gold:</hi> and because every piece of the <hi>silver</hi> was in valew ten pieces of the <hi>copper,</hi> it was called <hi>Denarius;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Denarij.</note> and because every piece of <hi>gold</hi> was worth 10. pieces of <hi>silver,</hi> the same was also called <hi>Denarius;</hi> and thus for distinction sake, other Nations in their <hi>coines</hi> in after ages followed their example; and our English <hi>moneys</hi> came to have the apellation of <hi>starling,</hi> and to be distinguished into <hi>pounds, shillings</hi> and <hi>pence,</hi> as some say from the <hi>esterlins</hi> that were in times past the masters of our <hi>minte,</hi> and the refiners of our <hi>coines,</hi> which yet holdeth this name, and by <note place="margin">Esterlin mony of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>Now for the manner of <hi>weighing</hi> in generall (so farre forth as <note place="margin">Two manners of vveighing in use.</note> ever I have observed) hath beene noted to have beene done by two severall wayes; that is, either by a <hi>Beame,</hi> or by a <hi>Romano</hi> or <hi>stalier:</hi> the <hi>weight</hi> by <hi>Beame</hi> I hold the best and justest perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">By Beame.</note> with <hi>leaden, brasse</hi> or <hi>iron weights,</hi> provided the said <hi>Beame</hi> be good and even both emptie and laden with one equall <hi>weight;</hi> and this is seene to bee the common custome of <hi>weighing</hi> in <hi>England, Netherlands,</hi> and in many other places and Countries.</p>
               <p>The <hi>weight</hi> by <hi>stalier</hi> which is used in <hi>Turkey, Barbary</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> and sundry other Countries, I hold not so sure; for thereupon is <note place="margin">By Stalier.</note> marked all the number of <hi>weights</hi> that may be <hi>weighed</hi> thereby, which by the helpe of a small counterpoise removed to severall

               <p>Now if with a <hi>Beame</hi> one would abbreviate a long labour with <note place="margin">To abbrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the labour of vveighing.</note> small time and paines, and <hi>weigh</hi> much with few <hi>weights,</hi> his <hi>weights</hi> must be made by an augmentation doubled, as by peeces of 1 <hi>lib.</hi> 2 <hi>lib.</hi> 4 <hi>lib.</hi> 8 <hi>lib.</hi> 16 <hi>lib.</hi> 32 <hi>lib.</hi> and 64 <hi>lib.</hi> making in all 127 <hi>lib.</hi> with which all summes under that number may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and <hi>weighed,</hi> and some exercised in great affaires, by single <hi>weights</hi> tripled have gone further and procured 1 <hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>l.</hi> 27 <hi>l.</hi> 81 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> and thereby with little labour have performed very weighty and great businesse: but I leave this to the ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to him that shall fancie this method and manner of <hi>weighing.</hi>

               <p>He then that intendeth by way of <hi>traffique</hi> to make use of <hi>this tract,</hi> must aswell be skild in <hi>measures,</hi> (as I have observed) he <note place="margin">All measures to the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> must be as one Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</note> ought to be in <hi>weights;</hi> for he must not onely readily know his owne <hi>measure</hi> as it stands, and is found to be in it selfe in use, but also the <hi>measure</hi> of that place whereto he bendeth his <hi>trade</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation, allowing or deducting by addition or substraction where the overplus or want doth challenge a part, to make a due proportion of both, and be so well versed therin, as that all <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> may be to him as one <hi>measure,</hi> by a true calculation of the length or the shortnes therof.</p>

               <p>First then learn the order and custome of <hi>measuring</hi> of all those sorts of commodities in both the places which you would inquire after, then prepare a smooth straight <hi>borde, plate</hi> or such like, and draw upon the same a straight <hi>line</hi> of the length of the <hi>measure</hi> in one of the places with his allowance of <hi>measuring,</hi> either an <hi>inch</hi> or <hi>shaftnet</hi> or such like; which for example I will demonstrate in the Figure following, A B.

               <p>Then marke upon the <hi>line</hi> A B the length of the <hi>measure</hi> of the other place, with his allowance, which is for example from B to F being just in the 900. parts; therefore 900. of those <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> in the first place, make just 1000. of those <hi>measures</hi> in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: but if the <hi>measure</hi> of the other place be longer then the <hi>measure</hi> of the first place, as for example, if it were from B to G, then take the distance of A G with a compasse, and set the one foot in C, and extend the other towards A, which for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample doth come to rest in F, being 150. parts from C; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then 1150. <hi>measures</hi> of the one place makes just 1000. of the other, by which you may calculate to a lesser proportion; and this is as much as I conceive needfull to insert con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the knowledge of <hi>measures</hi> in generall, and proceed to the next, which is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in generall of commodities used by the way of <hi>Merchandizing.</hi>

               <p>But in the generall it must be granted that the <hi>eye</hi> above all the rest of the senses, still claimeth an especiall interest and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative herein, and must ever bee admitted as one of the chiefest that must still accompany the rest in this <hi>distinction,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many things are oftentimes found <hi>saleable</hi> that are pleasing thereto; and in some <hi>commodities</hi> the same is noted to have the whole stroake, and onely to give the judgement, as in all manner of <hi>colours,</hi> and such like things depending thereupon.</p>

               <p>These <hi>Exchanges</hi> then in the generall propertie <hi>thereof,</hi> doe much differ both in the name and in the proportion betweene the <hi>gold</hi> and the <hi>silver</hi> observed in most Countries, and that to set

downe the <hi>Parr of Exchanges</hi> exactly, wee are to examine and compare, not onely our owne <hi>weight</hi> (as is aforesaid) with the <hi>weight</hi> of other Countries; but also the <hi>fines</hi> of our <hi>sterling Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derds</hi> with the <hi>fines</hi> of the severall <hi>Standerds</hi> of the <hi>Coines</hi> of other Countries; and if wee bee found not to differ with them in the proportion betweene the <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> then may our <hi>Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> run at one and the same <hi>price and rate,</hi> both for <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>silver,</hi> taking the <hi>denomination</hi> according to the valuation of the <hi>moneys</hi> of each Countrey; and hereby shall wee find how much <hi>fine silver</hi> or <hi>gold</hi> our owne <hi>pound sterling</hi> containeth, and what quantity of other <hi>moneys</hi> either of <hi>France, Italy, Germany, Low Countreys, East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and elsewhere, wee are to have in <hi>exchange</hi> to countervaile the same, in the like <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>finenesse</hi> answerable to ours, bee it by the <hi>pound, doller, duccat, crowne,</hi> or any other <hi>imaginary</hi> or <hi>reall Coine,</hi> giving alwaies a <hi>value for value,</hi> and receiving the like, which is called by <hi>Exchangers</hi> (as I said before) the <hi>Parr;</hi> the which should in all <hi>Exchanges</hi> be so particularly knowne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that as <hi>money</hi> is <hi>publica mensura,</hi> or the <hi>publique measure</hi> within the <hi>Realme</hi> betweene man and man, so should <hi>Exchanges</hi> thus made for these <hi>moneys,</hi> bee the <hi>publique measure</hi> betweene us and forreigne Countries, for all <hi>commodities</hi> either bought or sold, which therefore necessarily requireth a certainty in the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of this <hi>Parr</hi> aforesaid, admitting neverthelesse (as I said before) an advantage upon the same upon good ground and just occasion on either side.</p>

               <p>The Buildings are squared out proportionably, and every street is drawne out to a line, so that every Gate yeelds a free prospect through the Citie to the opposite Gate, be beautified on each side with stately edifices and houses for the honourable of this Countrey.</p>

               <p>As for the <hi>Trade</hi> of this Citie of <hi>Cambalu,</hi> and generally of all <hi>Tartaria,</hi> it is observed, that the Countrey (though in a large tract) extending it selfe upon the North Ocean; yet by reason of the long continued colds and frosts, the Inhabitants have but little benefit thereof; however it may bee conceived, that the <hi>Moluccos, Iapans,</hi> and other Ilanders thereabouts in the season of the yeare, have here a great traffique, and that hence these <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> are furnished with the <hi>spices</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> the <hi>jems</hi> of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and <hi>Bengala,</hi> and peradventure with other the <hi>druggs</hi> of <hi>Arabia:</hi> but upon the <hi>Caspian</hi> Sea, they are the masters of many good Sea-Ports, besides <hi>Astracan</hi> which of late they have lost to the <hi>Mosco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite,</hi> as <hi>Zahaspa Cosmi, Melmesuach,</hi> and others; by which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed to them the <hi>silkes, tapestries, carpets, armes,</hi> and excellent <hi>manufactures</hi> of <hi>Persia,</hi> and in the <hi>black</hi> Sea, besides <hi>Capha,</hi> now in subjection to the <hi>Turkes,</hi> they enjoy the brave Ports of <hi>Curaropo, Asow,</hi> and others, serving to conveigh unto them the <hi>commodities</hi> of <hi>Turkey, Trabesond, Podolia, Walacia,</hi> and other Countries bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering upon the famous riuers of <hi>Danubius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the other parts of this large <hi>Empire,</hi> it bordereth on the one side with <hi>Moscovia,</hi> with whom it is now in peace, though not seldome at debate, from whence by the benefit of traffique, which I find observed not to bee of any great consequence, they have <hi>rich furres</hi> and other the <hi>commodities</hi> of this Countrey.</p>
               <p>But where it bordereth upon <hi>China,</hi> which is for a very large extent of ground, by some Authors accompted 400 leagues, the common report of the strict lawes and customes of that Nation (to debarre entrance to all strangers) should perswade me of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle traffique that way; yet I find it observed by some late travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers whose relation herein is questionable, that the Citie of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu</hi> receiveth yearely thence by way of traffique, 10000 <hi>carts</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with <hi>silkes</hi> and <hi>stuffes</hi> of the <hi>China</hi> fabrique; the truth thereof I referre to the censure of the Reader.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>moneys</hi> currant in this large Territorie, I find it to <note place="margin">

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:22849:102"/>
the <hi>Kings marke</hi> thereupon, and from this meane stuffe, the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> causeth a huge masse of <hi>moneys</hi> to bee yearely made at <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balu,</hi> which sufficeth for his whole <hi>Empire,</hi> and no man under paine of death may coine or spend any other <hi>money,</hi> or refuse it in all his Kingdomes and Dominions; whereby it commeth to passe, that <hi>Merchants</hi> often comming hither from farre and remote Countries, bring with them <hi>gold, silver, pearle,</hi> and <hi>precious stones,</hi> and receive the <hi>Kings money</hi> for them; and because the same is not currant in their Countrey, they therewith buy in this <hi>Empire</hi> other the <hi>commodities</hi> heere found, which they carry hence away with them: the <hi>King</hi> also payeth his stipends, officers and armies with the said <hi>moneys,</hi> and buyeth whatsoever else hee needeth with the same, so that no <hi>Prince</hi> in the world can exceed him in treasure, which is at so easie a rate provided and procured.</p>
               <p>Besides which, I find it observed in some parts of this large Countrey subject to some subordinate <hi>Kings,</hi> in subjection to the <hi>Great Cham,</hi> that they use in some places pieces of <hi>polisht corrall</hi> in <note place="margin">Of <hi>corrall</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished.</note> stead of <hi>money;</hi> and in others they have certaine <hi>twiggs</hi> of <hi>gold,</hi> in lieu of <hi>money,</hi> which is distinguished by weight into severall par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, without stamp or Character, and this is accompted in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of consequence: but they have a lesser <hi>coine</hi> (if I may so terme it) made of <hi>salt</hi> which they boile in coldrons for a certaine <note place="margin">Of <hi>salt</hi> in loaves hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> time, which congealed they make into lumps, like our penny loaves, which being made solid, is signed with the <hi>Princes</hi> stamp, and passeth thus currant amongst them, &amp; wherewith they provide themselves of all necessaries: in some others I find also that they use <hi>purs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The <hi>fishing</hi> for <hi>pearles</hi> beginneth yearly in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> and continueth but 50 dayes; but yet they fish not alwayes in one place every yeare, but change their places by certaine appointed and setled orders amongst the principall that have the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight thereof.</p>
               <p>Now when the time of this <hi>fishing</hi> draweth neere, then they send very good <hi>divers</hi> that goe purposely to discover where the greatest heapes of <hi>oysters</hi> are under water, and on the shoare op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to that place, there they set up and plant a village with houses, and a <hi>Bazaro</hi> or market place, of stone and other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls, which standeth as long as the <hi>fishing</hi> time lasteth, and is for that time furnished with all things necessary, which now and then happeneth to bee neere unto places inhabited, and now and then a far off, according to the place appointed for that yeares <hi>fishing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>fisher-men</hi> themselves are for the most part <hi>Christians,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of that Countrey; neither is any other debarred from this <hi>fishing</hi> that will, paying a certaine tribute or acknowledgement to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and to the <hi>Iesuites</hi> who have sundry <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> upon that coast: now during the said <hi>fishing,</hi> there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes maintained three or foure <hi>fasts</hi> or <hi>galliots</hi> armed to defend the <hi>fishers</hi> from <hi>injuries</hi> and <hi>Rovers.</hi> The order of which <hi>fishing</hi> is observed to be thus.</p>
               <p>There are commonly three or foure barkes, and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that make consortship together, much resembling our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish pilot-boates,</hi> having eight or ten men in a boat, and in the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:22849:108"/>
morning they goe out together from the shoare, and anchor in 15 or 18 fathome water, which is the ordinary depths of this whole coast; and being thus moored to their Anchor, they cast a rope into the Sea, and at the end of that rope usually make fast a great stone, and then they have in readines a <hi>Diver,</hi> who hath his <hi>nose and his eares well stopped and annointed with oyle,</hi> and a basket fastened about his necke, or under his left arme; then he sinketh downe by the said rope to the bottome of the Sea, and as fast as he can he filleth the said basket, and being full, he then shaketh the rope, and his fellowes that hold the other end, and are in their Barke, instantly hale him up with his filled basket, and in this wise they goe one by one vntill they have laden their said boat with <hi>Oysters;</hi> and in the evening returning a shore to the village, every company maketh their owne heape or mount of <hi>Oysters</hi> by themselves, one distant from another in such wise, that there is seene a great long row of mounts or heapes of <hi>Oysters,</hi> which remaine untouched untill such time as the <hi>fishing</hi> be ended; and at the end whereof every company sitteth downe about their mount or heape, and fall to opening of them, which they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily doe, because that then they bee both dry, dead, and brittle; and if every <hi>Oyster</hi> should prove to have <hi>pearles</hi> in them, it would prove a very good purchase unto them: but many are found to have no <hi>pearles</hi> at all in them; therefore when their <hi>fishing</hi> is done, they then perceive whether their said <hi>fishing</hi> and gathering proveth good or bad.</p>
               <p>Now there are certaine men expert in the choice and distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Pearles,</hi> which heere they call <hi>Chittini,</hi> which set and make the price of <hi>Pearles,</hi> according to their <hi>carracts,</hi> each <hi>carract</hi> being foure <hi>graines,</hi> and these with an instrument of copper having holes therein of severall greatnes serving to distingush the sorts, to which also they consider their <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>goodnes,</hi> and then ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make 4 severall sorts. The first sort be the <hi>round Pearles,</hi> which they call <hi>aia</hi> or <hi>unia</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> because the <hi>Portugals</hi> buy them: the second sort which are not round, are called <hi>aia</hi> of <hi>Bengola:</hi> the third sort, which are not so good as the second, they call <hi>aia</hi> of <hi>Canora,</hi> that is to say, the Kingdome of <hi>Besnegar:</hi> the fourth and last, and indeed the worst sort, they call <hi>aia</hi> of <hi>Cambaia:</hi> and thus the price being by the men set thereon, according to their sorts, goodnes, and greatnes, there are <hi>Merchants</hi> of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey which are ready with their <hi>moneys</hi> in their hands to buy them; so that in few dayes, all the said parcels are bought up, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the said prizes set upon them altering according to the <hi>carract, beauty,</hi> and <hi>shape</hi> thereof. And this is the manner of the <hi>fishing,</hi> and dispersing of the <hi>Pearles</hi> throughout <hi>India,</hi> and thence through the World, so farre forth as I thought good to insert the same in this place.</p>

               <p>But those severall Nations inhabiting the large Coast of <hi>India, Persia,</hi> and these abovementioned <hi>Ilands,</hi> are found to bee more addicted thereto and of greater eminencie, and are found by their <hi>traffique</hi> and <hi>commerce</hi> to have raised to themselves Estates in these Countries equall to many of our <hi>European Dukes</hi> &amp; greatest <hi>Earls,</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Nation challenge also a large share in this <hi>Trade</hi> of ASIA, occasioned by their excellent and industrious <hi>fabriques,</hi> and their naturall plentie of <hi>raw silkes,</hi> which from them is aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly transported and spread over all the World, and their sumptuous adorning and curiositie of living, drawing to them by exchange, the riches and <hi>commodities</hi> of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>China</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Arabians,</hi> (as possessing a great part of ASIA) may not heere bee omitted, amongst which are found many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Merchants,</hi> not onely trading by Camels with <hi>Caravans</hi> from <hi>Turkey</hi> into <hi>Aegypt</hi> and other places, and into the Red Sea, but also from <hi>Aleppo</hi> to <hi>Babylon, Balsara,</hi> and so to the <hi>Persian gulph;</hi> and also by Sea, not onely on the Coast of <hi>Sindy, India, Cormandell, Siam, Pegu,</hi> and the <hi>Ilands</hi> aforesaid, where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Mahumetane Princes</hi> are found to beare rule; but also at <hi>Suachem, Melinda, Brava,</hi> and <hi>Quiloa,</hi> and many other parts and Ports of <hi>Africa</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither amongst all these above-mentioned Nations, which are found in the generall to afford <hi>Merchants</hi> of eminencie and note, and to have a Countrey for a particular residence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and where their <hi>Princes</hi> doe beare Soveraignty, are the Nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> to bee omitted or forgotten, who (though by the curse of the <hi>Almightie)</hi> are scattered and dispersed as it were over the face of the whole earth, and are permitted (with some limitations and restrictions) their abode in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Countries, paying for their libertie, and freedome of resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and <hi>commerce,</hi> both great and large annuall contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in sundry places; yet by their ingeniousnes in Trade, and their expertnes in Arts, and their subtilty in the valuation of <hi>Princes coines,</hi> and their skill in Accompts, they are found in all these afore-named Countries to bee both eminent and rich <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> trading as well by Land as by Sea through all these afore-named Countries, and by their craft and Art, raising to themselves eminence and great Estates thereby.</p>
               <p>I should heere give a share of this ASIAN <hi>Trade</hi> to the <hi>Chinois, Tartarians,</hi> and other great Nations: but my ignorance herein doth silence me.</p>

               <p>This Citie then hath for many yeeres had the sole <hi>commerce</hi> and <hi>traffique</hi> of all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas, and not content therewith, have made that Citie the common <hi>Mart</hi> of all the <hi>commodities</hi> of <hi>Arabia, Persia, India,</hi> and those Easterne rich Countries by their great <hi>trade</hi> to <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Cairo,</hi> which continued for many yeres; and when the <hi>Grecian Empire</hi> was both in its height and in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, they mannaged the sole <hi>Trade</hi> thereof, till the <hi>State of Genoa</hi> did looke thereinto, and by their power and might at Sea, shared with them therein: but the <hi>Portugall</hi> finding the way to <hi>India</hi> by the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Bona Speransa,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch Merchants</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing those leaders, now bring those rich <hi>commodities</hi> that way straight to their own homes, which in former times they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to have from this Citie at a farre dearer rate and at a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond hand, since which times, their <hi>customes</hi> have decaied, their ships rotted and their Mariners, the pride of their Commonwealth all become Poltrones, and the worst accounted in all those Seas.</p>

This Citie now serves in matter of <hi>Trade</hi> for an inlet into <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria,</hi> and upper <hi>Germany,</hi> which this way it yet fits with some <hi>spice, drugges,</hi> and other <hi>Arabian</hi> commodities, which in part is brought hither from <hi>Alexandria, Aleppo,</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> where they still have <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Factours,</hi> and partly by a second hand from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> now thereby bringing to them those commodities which a few yeares past wee had and fetched from them, as from the onely Citie and prime <hi>Marchants</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commodities here found and afforded are not many, nor of much worth, as some <hi>corne, wines, oiles, rice, woollen cloth, paper, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Injurious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of <hi>Venice</hi> against the trade of the <hi>English</hi> in the <hi>Levant</hi> seas.</note> Subject and <hi>Merchant,</hi> and tending to draw the whole <hi>trade</hi> of the <hi>Levant Seas</hi> to the City of <hi>Venice</hi> onely, to the generall prejudice of the shipping of <hi>His Majesty of England</hi> traffiquing in those Seas, which I conclude under five points.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First, they have considered the late great Exportation of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> out of <hi>Zant</hi> and <hi>Zeffalonia</hi> (two <hi>Islands</hi> of their <hi>Signory)</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> and that the principall <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> into their <hi>Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nory</hi> is onely for this <hi>Fruite,</hi> therefore they have of late leavied an <hi>imposition</hi> of ten <hi>Duccats</hi> upon every thousand of <hi>Corrance</hi> bought and shipped from the said <hi>Islands,</hi> and of later times have also infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the payment of the said <hi>Impost</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> which formerly and at first was free, and have discharged their owne Subjects thereof, to the speciall dammage and prejudice of the <hi>English.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, they have to burthen the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> thither, or rather seeing all the <hi>Trade</hi> of that fruit wholy sought out and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veted by the <hi>English,</hi> to which end they use to vent in those <hi>Islands</hi> some few <hi>English commodities,</hi> they have I say of late, burthened the <hi>native commodities of England</hi> brought into those <hi>Islands</hi> with new <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posts,</hi> as leavying upon an <hi>English cloth 7. duccats,</hi> upon 100. waight of <hi>tinne 2. duccats,</hi> and upon a <hi>hearsie 2. duccats,</hi> and so upon all other <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish commodities,</hi> thereby to inforce all <hi>commodities</hi> of <hi>England</hi> to be brought into the city of <hi>Venice,</hi> and though sometimes <hi>English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> finds it necessary in those seas to transferre some <hi>English</hi> goods out of one <hi>English</hi> vessell into another, and yet not land the same, when as ships do happen to meet together and to be bound for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ports, yet the same is not permitted them unles they pay the said <hi>Impost</hi> abovementioned, as if the said goods were there really landed and sold, contrary to the <hi>common custome</hi> of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Seas.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, they have prohibited, that any <hi>Turky commodities</hi> should be landed there out of <hi>English</hi> shipping, or any other <hi>commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities</hi> that are afterward to be shipped for the <hi>Kingdome of England,</hi> which for the conveniency of <hi>English</hi> shipping, the <hi>English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> trading into those Seas have often occasion of: but they doe compell the <hi>English</hi> first to send such goods and wares to the Citie of <hi>Venice,</hi> purposely there to pay the duty of <hi>custome</hi> and the duty of <hi>cottinio,</hi> before they will suffer them to ship the same for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. They have made an act for the imployment of their owne
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:22849:165"/>
shipping and Mariners, and for the restraint of all forreiners, that no commodities of the parts of <hi>Turky</hi> may bee brought into any the <hi>Signory</hi> of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> but onely in <hi>Venetian</hi> shipping, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have been found to have beene so strict and severe, that if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>English</hi> ships happen to bee fraighted either by their owne Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or by the <hi>Merchants</hi> of any other Nation when any of their owne shipping are in Port, or happen to come into the Port, or within the space of twenty daies after, upon the firming of a bare <hi>Protest</hi> against the said ship so fraighted, they have no law nor reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die left them in law to recover any fraight money, due for the said goods so laden by them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fiftly, they will not permit nor suffer no <hi>English</hi> ship to relade at <hi>Venice</hi> except they come first fully laden thither, neither will they suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>he <hi>English</hi> Nation, neither in their owne nor yet in the shipping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but doe straightly prohibit and forbid it, as also they doe prohibit the bringing in of some particular <hi>commodities</hi> by any whatsoever, themselves and their Subjects onely excepted.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To these I might adde some others, but I will conclude it with this last poynt of <hi>slight and fallacious subtilty</hi> some yeeres past, when as the <hi>Signory of Venice</hi> had heere a permission from <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of Englana</hi> to contract with divers <hi>Merchants</hi> for their shippes to serve against the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the <hi>Gulfe of Venice;</hi> when the said ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was performed, and that they came to receive their contract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d payment, they raised their monies 12. <hi>percentum</hi> above the rate of the same at the time of their agreement, by which rate, <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties</hi> Subj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>cts came to lose a great summe of money by the said ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to their great prejudice, and to the great dishonor of that so Honourable <hi>Seigrory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having by these few particulars given the ingenious Reader a taste of these present policies enacted by this state of late for the supportation of their decaying <hi>Trade,</hi> and also given a touch of the subtilties used by them to preserve that little that is yet remaining, and their indevours to augment the same, I will now in a word view the state of the present <hi>traffique</hi> of this Cirie.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Naples</hi> is a large and rich Country, and <hi>Genoa</hi> rich, though of little extent, yet the great number of <hi>Nobility</hi> in the former, and the great <hi>usury</hi> practised in the latter hath reduced them to a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of all <hi>Trade,</hi> what the bosome of their Country doth natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vent that they traffique with, and these being in themselves rich induce other Nations to bring them those few things they want, for though <hi>Italie</hi> as it now stands acknowledgeth many <hi>Soveraignes,</hi> yet one Country supplying another, stands in need of little from Forainers, so that it may be said, while they have peace they have plenty; some provisions of <hi>fish, corne,</hi> and <hi>cloth, England</hi> doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them, and in returnes have only their <hi>silke fabriques, oiles,</hi> and some few other commodities, so that putting aside the <hi>Trade</hi> driven thither by the <hi>English,</hi> as being of greatest consequence, the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Spaniard, French,</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> is but small, and but of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongst them; which in particular may bee thus surveied; for <hi>Venice</hi> I have given you the <hi>anatomy</hi> of the <hi>Trade</hi> thereof, now in the waine, and almost at the last breath, save where it is preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their new devised Edicts, and the naturall growing <hi>Corrence,</hi> and by their small <hi>Trade</hi> to <hi>Constantinople, Cairo,</hi> and <hi>Alleppo</hi> by sea, and to <hi>Austria, Dalmatia, Istria, Italie,</hi> and into the upper <hi>Germanie</hi> by land: the next part of this <hi>Trade</hi> of <hi>Italie</hi> is challenged by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> which in it selfe affords rich <hi>silkes, corne, oile,</hi> and <hi>wines,</hi> with which they seeme to bee contented, for they covet not much to traffique among themselves, nor yet with others further than for their meate, and drinke, and clothing, which to the poorer sort is most wanting.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Antwerpe</hi> then being seated upon the River of <hi>Sheld,</hi> which by eight channels cut, runneth through this Citie, is conceived to be eight miles in compasse, some of these channels being able to hold 100. great ships which made the same more commodious for the transport and carriage of wares to any part thereof. The former and ancient <hi>trade</hi> of this Citie was great and eminent, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned as some have observed by three meanes, and had its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caies also by three occasions. First, by reason of two <hi>free Martes</hi> holden yeerely, continuing five and forty daies, during which time, no man either in his person or in his goods could be arrested or molested for either debt or otherwise. Secondly, by reason that the <hi>King of Portugall</hi> having discovered the <hi>East Indies</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1500 and diverted the course of <hi>trade</hi> driven by the <hi>Venetions</hi> from <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> and the <hi>Red Sea</hi> to his Port of <hi>Lixborne,</hi> kept heere his <hi>factors</hi> and sent hither those <hi>Indian commodities</hi> to seeke their vent, and this first drew the <hi>English Merchant Adventurers</hi> from <hi>Bridges</hi> hither to reside. The third was the <hi>Warres</hi> that fell betweene the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Charles the fifth,</hi> which brought hither many <hi>Gentlemen</hi> from villages and petty townes for safety sake here to reside and build.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:22849:180"/>
Now as the causes of her rising have beene noted to bee three, so the causes of the losse of that <hi>trade</hi> may be reduced also to three.</p>
               <p>First, the <hi>Warres</hi> heere, and in generall in these <hi>Provinces</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the <hi>Dutch Nation,</hi> wherein this Citie suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered pilledging, and indured the commaund of new Lawes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>abrogation</hi> of part of those <hi>Priviledges</hi> that were graunted heere to the <hi>English Merchant Adventurers</hi> and others, and the <hi>new and great customes</hi> imposed upon their <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>Merchandise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Navigation</hi> of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> to the <hi>East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> whereby the <hi>Portugall factors</hi> decreasing thereby, and the Cities of <hi>London,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> increasing thereby, were also sharers in the <hi>India trade</hi> and <hi>commodities,</hi> leaving by this meanes this Citie bare and to subsist upon the <hi>traffique</hi> of her owne inhabitants, in that nature as now the same is found to be.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Accounts</hi> are heere kept by <hi>Livers, Sol</hi> and <hi>Deniers,</hi> which they terme <hi>Pounds, Shillings</hi> and <hi>Pence</hi> of <hi>grosses, 12. grosses</hi> making a <note place="margin">Accounts in <hi>Antwerpe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zealand</hi> is the next and last <hi>Earldome</hi> of the seventeene <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> consisting of seven <hi>Islands,</hi> the remainder of 15. which the seas <note place="margin">Zealand.</note> are said to have devoured.</p>
               <p>The chiefest Cities of these seven are these.</p>
               <p>First <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> which from nothing grew great by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of the <hi>English Merchant Adventerers,</hi> and now by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall <note place="margin">Middleburgh.</note> hence is now almost come to nothing againe; by this Citie and <hi>Stoade,</hi> and many other places may easily bee discerned the benefit that a <hi>Trade</hi> brings to a Citie or country, therefore <hi>my praiers shall ever bee, that London may never loose that great reputation it hath gained by commerce throughout the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Citie is <hi>Flushing,</hi> famous in that it was the first that the <hi>Low-country men</hi> got from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and being cautionary to <note place="margin">Flushing.</note> the <hi>English,</hi> Sir <hi>Philip Sidney was the first Governour thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Brill, Tergouse, Brever-haven,</hi> to all which my curiosity lead me in 1625. in that my Northerne Voyage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Westfrisland</hi> is the first <hi>Barony,</hi> and accounted one of the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene <hi>Provinces,</hi> wherein is found for principall Townes <hi>Lewardin.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Well frisland.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Next, <hi>Harlingham,</hi> then <hi>Zeutsen,</hi> and some other Sea-ports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vtrecht</hi> is the next <hi>Barony,</hi> containing therein the Townes of <note place="margin">Utreicht.</note> 
                  <hi>Rhenen, Wicket, Amsford, Montfort,</hi> and <hi>Vtrecth</hi> the principall Citie, and a pleasant <hi>Bishopriche,</hi> it is accounted the most excellent seate in all these Countries, whereto are found many <hi>Ferries</hi> for passages, for it is said, that a man may easily goe hence in one day to any one of 59. walled Townes equally distant from this Citie, or to any of 26. Townes to dinner, and returne againe at night to bed, which is both strange and true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Overissell</hi> is the next, from whence comes our <hi>Linnens</hi> bearing <note place="margin">Oversell.</note>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:22849:185"/>
this name, the chiefe Cities are <hi>Swall, Campen,</hi> and <hi>Daventer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mailin</hi> is the next, famous in her famous <hi>Nunnery,</hi> where are <note place="margin">Mailin.</note> sometimes found 1600. <hi>Nunnes,</hi> who may at their pleasure leave the <hi>Cloister</hi> and marry, as indeed it is fittest for them.</p>
               <p>The last <hi>Province</hi> is <hi>Groineing,</hi> the chiefe Townes being that of <note place="margin">Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Old-haven</hi> and <hi>Keykirke,</hi> and these bee all the principall Cities of Traffique in the said seventeene <hi>Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the abbreviating of my Worke, I have comprised in short the <hi>Weight, Measures,</hi> and <hi>Trade</hi> of this populous and rich Country thus according to my intended Methode.</p>
               <p>The particular <hi>Weights</hi> and <hi>Measures</hi> of the chiefe Cities of these <note place="margin">Waights in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the 100. li. in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>

After which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Florence, Lucca,</hi> and the <hi>Spindas</hi> of <hi>Genoa</hi> seated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves there, as also the <hi>Marchant Adventurers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 1516. and many of other Nations were invited thither by the priviledge of marriage dowries, which became shadowes to many frauds: for when husbands either brake in their life time, or be found <hi>Bankerout</hi> in death, the wives are preferred to all debters in the recoverie of their dowrie. And thus farre he sheweth the rising and falling of the <hi>trade of Burges,</hi> and how it came to bee removed and setled in <hi>Antwerpe;</hi> and how since also it hath been lost and departed thence,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:22849:188"/>
I have shewed in another place: and this is as much as I have thought good to insert of the <hi>trade</hi> in generall of <hi>Netherland,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, that though the countrey be of small extent, and bee bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of rich commodities either to preserve or maintaine a <hi>trade,</hi> yet the industrie of the inhabitants hath made them potent, wealthy, and great <hi>Merchants,</hi> and now at this day they traffique to all parts of the habitable world, with the commodities of other countries, which by their endevours and paines they make and purchase to be as if naturally and really the same were their owne.</p>
               <p>Now for the generall <hi>trade</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> so farre forth as it is in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the <hi>Archduke,</hi> or more properly to the <hi>Kings of Spaine,</hi> it must be granted, that it holds not any equalitie at this day with that part in subjection to the <hi>States. Antwerpe</hi> as the principall Citie of which the <hi>Flemings</hi> did, and might justly boast, is now, as then, the chiefest; but the former splendor is now and long agoe lost: for it had the preheminence, and was one of the chiefe Cities of <hi>traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique</hi> in the world; but is now onely the chiefe of this jurisdiction. What it could formerly herein challenge, it hath now lost: for if the <hi>trade</hi> thereof be well observed, it will be discerned, it lookes not so high by many millions as it then did, the <hi>Merchants</hi> the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants partake of one of the qualities of the <hi>Spaniard Merchant,</hi> which they have since their reduction to that <hi>Scepter,</hi> learned thence, and this is never or very seldome to <hi>traffique</hi> or <hi>adventure</hi> their estates into any other <hi>Princes</hi> dominions, but where their <hi>Lord</hi> is <hi>Soveraigne.</hi> Which rule found here, as in all <hi>Spaine</hi> for the most part true, and granted, it must be confessed their <hi>trade</hi> cannot possibly be of any great consequence: for such is the nature of a <hi>free and uncontrouled Commerce,</hi> that no Countrey or Nation how remote or distant so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can give limit or bound thereto. Whereupon it may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and as by proofe at this day it is found observeable, their generall <hi>traffique</hi> is small, and consisteth more by a laborious indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of the inhabitants at home, than by their great <hi>adventures</hi> by sea abroad, their greatest navigations extending but to <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in some second <hi>adventures</hi> thence to <hi>India,</hi> and that for no great matter, and otherwise they trouble not, neither the <hi>East</hi> nor <hi>West,</hi> neither the <hi>North</hi> nor the <hi>South</hi> parts of the World, no nor hardly as farre as into <hi>France, England,</hi> or into <hi>Netherlands,</hi> the nearest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours (when at amitie) for any great matter of moment.</p>
               <p>The principall meanes whereby their small <hi>traffique</hi> is now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to them, is by their severall sorts of cunning and artificiall <hi>Fabrickes</hi> and <hi>Manufactaries,</hi> which every towne of any note is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for, such as are <hi>Hangings of Arasse, Tapestrie,</hi> some sorts of <hi>stuffes of Silke,</hi> and of <hi>Wollen</hi> and <hi>Linnen,</hi> and in <hi>exchanges</hi> to purchase which, the <hi>English, French,</hi> and other the neighbouring Nations bring them <hi>Wollen Cloathes, Wines,</hi> and some other needfull provisions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:22849:188"/>
which they want, to supply their occasions, and the necessities of those Armies as are for the most part seene to bee fed, maintained and clothed in this Countrey. <hi>Dunkerke</hi> their onely and best Sea-port, affoords some shipping, but so poorely set on worke by way of <hi>Merchandising,</hi> that they find their best <hi>traffique</hi> to consist of <hi>thie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie</hi> and <hi>boothalling</hi> against both their friends, and their enemies the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> which yet they are so far unable really to set out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For the rest of the <hi>Polanders</hi> they are observed to live content with their owne, and not by way of <hi>Merchandising</hi> to stir much abroad; yet are they not rich, because they want the above sayd commodities, which the proud <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>Nobilitie</hi> of these countries buy deere, and wil have, though brought from farre unto them, and they are noted to have so little <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> as despising all in respect of it, they sell the rich commodities of their countrey at a low rate, especially those which are for daily food, and thereby made unfit to bee exported. The people themselves are not much addicted to <hi>trafficke</hi> into remote regions, nor to travell farre out of their owne Countries, yet in imitation of other their neighbours, they sometimes trade with their rich <hi>Furres</hi> into other countries, of whom I have observed some to come to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> rather making a rangeing voyage, than comming with intent to trade and reside. Wherein they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much blamed, in regard that they have in plenty all things that naturally is wanting to mankinde, if they can bee contented therewith: but the inhabitants of <hi>Pomerland, East countrey,</hi> &amp;c. are observed to be more ingenious, and farre more addict to <hi>traffick</hi> and <hi>commerce,</hi> and have some vessels fitter for transport and carriage than for warfare, but yet most proper for their grosse commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and large stowage, however their winter colds depriving them of almost halfe the yeares <hi>trafficke:</hi> the other halfe wherein their seas are navigable, cannot make them any competent amends and their <hi>Merchandise</hi> being altogether grosse, cannot give them therfore the attribute of <hi>Eminent Merchants.</hi>

               <p>The second is the <hi>Grograine</hi> or <hi>Chamblet Fico,</hi> containing 24 inches, and observed to make 24 <hi>pico</hi> 16 yards <hi>English.</hi>

               <p>The third is the linnen <hi>pico,</hi> which is onely the former dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: and note that in the measuring here of all commodities of length, here is no allowance made nor given in curtesie, as the inch is over-plus in <hi>England;</hi> but the sayd <hi>picos</hi> are found to bee made flat of Iron, and no more allowance given than the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>pico</hi> at the end, which commonly exceeds not the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of an <hi>English shilling.</hi>

               <p>As at <hi>Meyson</hi> in <hi>Saxony,</hi> 20 ounces <hi>ponderales,</hi> make 24 ounces <hi>mensurales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also at <hi>Lipsich,</hi> 32 ounces wet measures, goes to 26½. ounces weight measure, the difference of correspondence being of 5 to 6. This is further demonstrated in many commodities.</p>

               <p>Also a <hi>hogshead of corne</hi> weigheth 400 li. the caske 50 li. the net corne is 350 li. so that by this computation, the tunne of wine weigheth 1800 li. and with the caske 2000 li. and the tunne lading of corne, weigheth 1600 li. and with the caske 1800 li.

               <p>In the next place it is considerable that many of these before <note place="margin">Many Cities practice Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes by one and the same monyes &amp;c.</note> mentioned <hi>Cities,</hi> are found to practice their <hi>Exchanges,</hi> in one and the selfe same <hi>moneyes, Coines,</hi> and <hi>denominations,</hi> as doth <hi>Lechie,</hi> and <hi>Barry,</hi> which are included in <hi>Naples,</hi> as <hi>Naples</hi> it selfe, <hi>Palermo</hi> and <hi>Mesina</hi> comprehended in <hi>Sicilia, Valentia, Saragosa, and Barselo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> in <hi>Catalonia, Sivil, Alcala, &amp; Medina del Campo</hi> in <hi>Castilia, Francford, Noremberge, Colonia,</hi> and <hi>Augusta</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and so in some others.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22849:260"/>
a rate and tearme wherein, and whereby this is brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion and perfection, which are principally observed to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed <note place="margin">Rates, termes, Faires, and V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sances of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note> by certaine <hi>faires</hi> or <hi>usances,</hi> accustomed in the Art of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing,</hi> and which are set downe, by Merchants, <hi>Bankers</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers,</hi> at their assemblies and meetings, in a faire and regular Order, by a certaine course of Iustice, and by peculiar lawes and ordinances amongst themselves, both which faires and the rates and tearmes thereof, have a constant expiration and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, within certaine monthes, as the <hi>Vsances</hi> have, that are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise included within the rules of the said <hi>Faires,</hi> which are found also to end and determine within certaine prefix't daies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the received custome of those two <hi>Cities,</hi> wherein the said <hi>Exchanges</hi> are found mutually and respectively to be both setled and placed.</p>
               <p>Moreover, in the practice of <hi>Exchanging, Bankers</hi> and <hi>Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> are found to observe this custome amongst themselves in <note place="margin">What is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the usual manner ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> the usuall manner of <hi>Exchanging</hi> from one place to another, that is, the <hi>One</hi> propounds his <hi>Money</hi> in a <hi>whole number</hi> or denomination, and the <hi>Other</hi> consequently and necessarily in a fraction, <hi>broken Number,</hi> or lesser denomination, in which <hi>contract</hi> or <hi>Bargaine,</hi> it is imagined, that those two, either persons or places, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate one and the self-same thing, so that the one would be the <hi>Seller,</hi> and the other the <hi>Buyer</hi> thereof, to performe which, it is questionlesse needfull, that he that hath the thing, makes the rate and price, the which shall happen without any contract, or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of much or little, and as it chanceth in the sale of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, so falleth it out in the <hi>Exchanges</hi> of <hi>Moneyes,</hi> for of the two places that would <hi>Exchange,</hi> the one propounds a grosse summe, and the other the condition and price in a lesser summe, which may either admit an encrease, or decrease in estimation or value, according as they fall to agreement, upon the lesser or greater esteeme of the said some propounded, the use of which is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified thus.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Placentia</hi> would <hi>Exchange</hi> with any other place, the said <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centia,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Example.</note> or as <hi>Exchangers</hi> tearme it, the said <hi>Faire,</hi> or <hi>fiera</hi> propounds and gives alwayes the intire summe, or greater denomination, and by consequence, the other that would exchange therewith, gives the other which is the lesser denomination.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Summe</hi> which I thus tearme an intire or whole denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, falles in some places to be, sometimes one Crowne, and in other places sometimes 100 Crownes, <hi>Florins</hi> or <hi>Duccats,</hi> the same is likewise found to be practised betweene any two places; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing,</hi> for each place giveth either a Denomination intire of one to one other, or of <hi>one hundred</hi> to another <hi>Hundred,</hi> or else of a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser divident then one, or then one hundred, which I here tearme the fraction, broken number, or smallest denomination, as shalbe more plainely expressed in the <hi>calculated Tables</hi> following.</p>

Now as touching the <hi>monyes</hi> which are thus given as intire or <note place="margin">What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire summe Exchanges is, and what a broken num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or fraction.</note> whole <hi>summes,</hi> Videlicet, One or One <hi>hundred,</hi> these are either found to be <hi>Crownes, Ducats, Pounds, Florins,</hi> &amp;c. according to the received quality of the grosse and whole <hi>monyes,</hi> which that place is found to have <hi>current,</hi> that would give, so in like manner it falleth out in the smaller or lesser denomination, in the places that would take, which in themselves is also various, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of divers sorts, as <hi>pence, sols, deniers,</hi> &amp;c. as shall also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the <hi>said Table.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though it fall out to be the custome, that one place giveth <note place="margin">Liberty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing to the judicious.</note> an <hi>Exchange in grosse monyes,</hi> and another place in <hi>small,</hi> (as is before related,) and that this <hi>grosse</hi> and <hi>small monyes</hi> be of such or such a quality and kind, This observation and Rule prescribed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, is not alwayes necessary, but that <hi>Exchangers</hi> may, (though I confesse it is seldome seene) at their pleasure propound, the one or the other differing or contrary hereunto, and that the wise and judicious <hi>Exchanger</hi> may for his profit, ease or commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, propound his owne intentions, and thereby (if he can) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a beneficiall bargaine or issue, according to his desired de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe and plot. As for example.</p>
               <p>If it should be said, that <hi>Exchanges</hi> may be made in a method <note place="margin">Ignorant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the custome of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing.</note> differing from this or the common rule, or contrary to that way that hath beene received and taken, some would soone censure him of folly that should be of that opinion, and conceive such a one to be little versed in <hi>exchanging</hi> affaires, that should either propound or seeke to performe such a thing, but yet no great heed is to be taken, to the <hi>raw conceits</hi> and <hi>childish opinions</hi> of such selfe-willd <hi>Merchants,</hi> which may for the most part, be said to be either drench'd in ignorance, or drowned in Envy; because that a <hi>skilfull Merchant,</hi> may (as I have alledged) frame his <hi>Exchanges</hi> as he fees good, and to his owne commodity, the which very often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is observed tobe done by others, and practised daily by those of <hi>this Cittie</hi> of excellent judgements.</p>
               <p>In example whereof, <hi>posito,</hi> I would <hi>Exchange Genoa</hi> with <hi>Naples,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Example.</note> betweene which two places, the use and custome is, that <hi>Genoa</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the intire <hi>summe,</hi> or greater denomination, which is the <hi>Crowne of gold,</hi> for the which <hi>Naples</hi> gives the <hi>Graine</hi> 135. a little more or lesse, I demande, why may not <hi>Genoa</hi> give that whole summe, which is the <hi>Crowne</hi> of 4. <hi>livers,</hi> as it is accustomed to give with other places, and estimating the same by 120 <hi>graines Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and thereby the <hi>Exchange</hi> will prove to be equall with the first manner before mentioned. And further, why may not the contrary be practised, <hi>Naples</hi> giving the whole denomination, which may be <hi>Ducats,</hi> one, for <hi>sold</hi> 66. 8. d. and so vary in as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny formes as they please, wherein I confesse I never yet found any <hi>Exchanges</hi> made, neither doe I know any true reason that the common customes should be altered, though I have thought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22849:261"/>
good to note the same here, that each <hi>knowing Merchant,</hi> may boldly use which he please, for to him that truely understands the value and course of both the places <hi>Exchanging,</hi> there will appeare no difficultie therein, and I wish that those, which knowe no other wayes but their owne, content themselves within the limits of their owne manner and understanding, and suffer others of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgements, without their censure, to follow their owne, when it is to their benefit or commodity.</p>

                  </note> of <hi>Exchange,</hi> and is grounded partly upon the <hi>Soveraigne</hi> or <hi>Princes Par</hi> above mentioned, but principally upon the <hi>current value</hi> of the said <hi>Coines,</hi> the <hi>plentie</hi> and <hi>scarcitie</hi> thereof, the <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, inhansement</hi> and <hi>debasement</hi> of the same: and therefore such <hi>Merchants</hi> as are <hi>Exchangers,</hi> doe endevour by certaine rules of <hi>Exchanges,</hi> to equalize the valuation of the <hi>Monyes</hi> of one <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>Countrey</hi> with another: And therefore every man that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his <hi>Money</hi> in one <hi>Countrey,</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> to have it in another, is and ought to be ever curious, to understand either the <hi>losse</hi> or <hi>gaine</hi> that commeth thereof; which is onely and properly distinguished by the knowledge and finding out of this <hi>Par,</hi> afore mentioned. For finding out of which, it is requisite for him that remitteth, to know either by his owne advice, judgement, or otherwise, how much the <hi>Crowne, Doller, Duccat,</hi> or <hi>Pound</hi> whence he remitteth, is worth in the place whither he would make his remittance unto.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22849:276"/>
As for example, having <hi>Money</hi> in <hi>Lions</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which I would remit for <hi>Antuerpe,</hi> I ought to know how much the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>France</hi> is really worth in <hi>Antuerpe:</hi> as presuppose, that the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> of 67 <hi>Souls,</hi> or 3 <hi>li. 7 Souls Tournois,</hi> is worth by <hi>exchange,</hi> according to the course thereof, 100 <hi>Grosse</hi> there; I would then know that the <hi>reall Crowne</hi> of 60 <hi>Souls</hi> or 3 <hi>li. Turnois</hi> (the <hi>Crowne</hi> wherein <hi>Exchanges</hi> are made) is worth, multiplying and dividing as the rule requireth, it will appeare to be <hi>Souls</hi> 89 37/67 <hi>Grosse,</hi> which is indeed the true value of the <hi>Crowne:</hi> if then the <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Exchange</hi> be made for <hi>lesse</hi> then 89 37/67 <hi>Grosse per Crowne</hi> of 3 <hi>li. Turnois,</hi> there is a losse thereby; and if for <hi>more,</hi> there is a gaine thereby: so that it is hereby evident, that 89 37/67 <hi>Grosse</hi> is the <hi>Par</hi> in <hi>Exchanges</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene these two Countries, in the <hi>Crowne</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and in the <hi>Grosse</hi> of <hi>Antuerpe;</hi> the which rule may serve as example in remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances for all other places: for it is not otherwise to be imagined, that any positive rule can be set downe herein, considering the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie of <hi>species,</hi> which, as I said before, dayly riseth and falleth, and the price of the <hi>Exchanges,</hi> which every day, according to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting occasions, likewise altereth, found to be sometimes at one rate, and sometimes at another. And this <hi>Par</hi> is the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all <hi>Merchants Exchanges</hi> for profit and losse is grounded, and is the <hi>Par,</hi> or Value for Value, which in this following Tract I principally and fundamentally ayme at.</p>
               <p>Now the last thing considerable in this place, and now to be observed, is the <hi>method, forme,</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> how the Accounts of these divers <hi>Exchanges,</hi> from one Countrey to another, is betweene one <hi>Merchant</hi> and another cast up and calculated; which indeed principally is the worke of the <hi>Fen,</hi> and the <hi>hand</hi> of the <hi>Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian;</hi> which as a necessarie adjunct, and needfull furtherance to the <hi>Mysterie of Exchanging,</hi> I have hereto inserted, and have herein pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon the principall places here mentioned, willingly omitted the least and rest of them, having fitted (to such as I have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the most worthy) apt <hi>questions</hi> and their <hi>solutions,</hi> from one Towne or Citie to another, with the denomination of their severall accounts and <hi>species,</hi> the manner of the briefe calculations there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the short proofe of each prescribed rule and position, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for conclusion to each generall Citie of <hi>Exchanges,</hi> some examples of orders and <hi>Commissions,</hi> given and received, in <hi>draughts</hi> and <hi>remittances,</hi> made according to the common custome &amp; use of the place, omitting some other principall points, wherein I might have enlarged both this matter and subject, that the ingenious head and hand of the learner may have roome and scope to worke upon according either to his desire, capacity, or inclination.</p>

               <p>To doe this succinctly and briefly, I first draw the discounte of the said <hi>Lib.</hi> 3709, 12, 9 at 108 <hi>per cent.</hi> and then multiplie the said summe by 2, and of the <hi>product</hi> take ⅓ of a 1/9 or more facilie, 3 thirds, the one of the other, the last whereof, shall bee the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the said parcell, and so much must the seller rebate to the buyer, the which discount deducted from 3709. 12, d. 6. there resteth 3434 <hi>Lib.</hi> 17, 0 <hi>d.</hi> which the buyer ought to pay in ready money, the which for better declaration, I will lay downe by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, with the proofe of the rule, for the triall of the certainty thereof. <gap reason="math">

Now the reason why out of 108 <hi>per Cent.</hi> there must three thirds <note place="margin">Example pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> be taken one out of the other, is, because that 8 (which is the discounte or Rebate) is contained 13½ times in 108, the which 13½ doubled, are 27, and therefore must be divided by 27, or for the briefer and readier way, take ⅓ of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
