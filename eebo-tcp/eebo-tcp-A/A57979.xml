            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether time or the fashion hath obtained of me (worthy
Reader) that this Sermon should come under the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of your favourable judgement and Candor, I
can hardly determine: But you have it as it is, onely
I shall heartily desire, in reviewing of it, your serious
thoughts in these insuing considerations.</p>
            <p>1. What I speak here of <hi>God</hi> and his excellency, is but a shadow to
the expressions of others; and what others can say, <hi>men</hi> or <hi>Angels,</hi> is but
a short and rude shadow of that infinite <hi>All,</hi> the High <hi>Jehovah, Creator
of Heaven and Earth:</hi> so my thoughts come forth as shadows of sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
for there behoved to be much honey in the Inke, much of Heaven
in the breast, much of <hi>God</hi> in the Pen of any who speaketh of such a
transcendent subject; yet if these do affect you, it is possible I say more,
if not, I shall desire not to spill the <hi>Lords</hi> highest praises with my low-creeping
under-expressions. 2. Concerning <hi>Gods</hi> dispensation now in
<hi>Brittaine,</hi> and his Churches condition; I shall be your debter, in all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
modesty, to beg these thoughts to go along with <hi>God.</hi> As 1. Let the
<hi>Lord</hi> have a charitable sense and good construction of his most wise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and beleeve <hi>that he who hath his fire in Zion,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
in Jerusalem,</hi> seeth good that <hi>Christs</hi> Crosse should be the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Christs birth-right,</hi> and that a life-rent of afflictions, is a surer way
for Zion, then Summer-dayes. 2. You are not to stumble that <hi>God</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
will not fit his times to mens apprehensions, when to raine, and when to
shine fair, neither is clay to usurp the chair, and dispute the matter, to
make the <hi>All-wise</hi> providence a School-Probleme,<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 21.</note> nor asks, Why is our
<hi>Zion</hi> builded, <hi>with carcasses of men,</hi> in two kingdomes, <hi>fallen, as dung
in the open field, and as the handfull after the harvest man?</hi> Why is <hi>the
wall of the daughter of Zion</hi> sprinkled with blood? One thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know,
It is better to beleeve, then to dispute; and to adore, then
to plead <hi>with him who giveth not account of his matters.</hi> 3. Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
in these times, is better then court with princes, and the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the heirs of Heaven, yea, their tears, better then <hi>the joy of the
hypocrite. 4. Christs Church</hi> can neither shift nor adjourne such a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <pb facs="tcp:41754:3"/>
share of affliction, as is written in <hi>Gods</hi> book. It is a standing and a
current court which hath decreed what graines of <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
England</hi> must drink; what a cup is prepared for <hi>Scotland;</hi> and
the Ballance of wisedome hath weighed by ounce weights, how much
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> wrath shall be mixed in the cup of wasted <hi>Ireland.</hi> 5. You know it is
generally the condition of the <hi>Church,</hi> if she have any Summer, that it
is but a good day betwixt two Feavers; <hi>Heaven, heaven</hi> is the home
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and the desired day of the <hi>Bride, the Lambs wife.</hi> 6. It is much better
to be afflicted, then to be guilty; and that the <hi>Church</hi> may have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and want peace. 7. That the faith <hi>which is more precious then
gold,</hi> can bid the devil do his worst, and that the patience of the Saints
can out-weary the malice of Babylon or Babel, <hi>on whose skirts</hi> is found
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the <hi>blood of the Saints.</hi> 8 That it is now and ever true, <hi>as when a
hungry man dreameth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esa. 29. 8.</note> 
               <hi>and behold he eateth, but he awaketh and
his soul is empty; or, as when a thirsty man drinketh, but he awaketh,
and behold he (is) faint, so shall the multitude of all nations be that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> fight against mount Zion.</hi> 9. Vengeance is gone out from the <hi>Lord</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
those who feast upon <hi>Zions</hi> teares,<note place="margin">Ezech. 28. 9.</note> and they must <hi>die the death of
the uncircumcised,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezech. 25 6.</note> 
               <hi>who clapped their hands, and stamped with the
feet, and rejoyced in heart with all their despight against the land of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Israel.</hi> 10. They are in no better condition <hi>who refuse to help the
Lord against the mighty,</hi> and whose heart is as a stone and a piece of
dead flesh, at all the revolutions and tossings of <hi>Christs Kingdome,</hi> who
daunce, eat, and laugh within their own orbe; and if their desires bee
concentrick to the world and themselves, care not whether <hi>Joseph</hi> die
in the stocks or not, or whether <hi>Zion</hi> sink or swim, because whatever
they had of Religion, it was never their minde both to summer and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> winter <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> 11. The rise of the Gospel-sun, is like the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
appearance of a new Comet, to the woman that <hi>sitteth on many
waters, to that mother</hi> Rome-<hi>planted, as a Vine in blood,</hi> the Lionesse,
whose Whelps, Papists and Prelates in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to catch the prey, and this Comet prophesieth, Wo to the Pope, King
of the bottemlesse pit, and his bloody Lady Babel, if <hi>Christ</hi> shall arise,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> and shine in the power of his Gospel. 12. <hi>God</hi> hath now as great a work
on the wheels, as concerneth the race of the Chariots of Jesus Christ
through the habitable world; pray, O <hi>let his Kingdome come,</hi> and
farewell.</p>

            <head>A SERMON,
PREACHED
Before the Honourable House of
COMMONS,
At their last solemne Fast, Wednesday,
<date>January 31. 1644.</date>
            </head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>DANIEL 6. 26.</bibl>
               <q>I make a Decree, that in every Dominion of my Kingdome, men
tremble and feare before the face of the God of Daniel, for he
is the living God, and indureth for ever, and his Kingdome
that which shall not bee destroyed, and his dominion shall bee
to the end.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ethod requireth, that first, the words bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded;
secondly, that they bee taken up in a
right order; thirdly, that such observations bee
hence deduced as serve most for the present
condition of the times.</p>
            <p>The words are plaine: here first is a Statute
of a great King, <hi>Sim,</hi> that the seventie interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
render <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a decretall letter; for sometimes, though sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the Lords cause findeth the grace of faire justice with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41754:4"/>
men. The matter of the Decree is, that men tremble and
feare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lehevon zognin vedachalin:</hi> The Seventie render it, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
that is, that they be such as feare and tremble before
the God of <hi>Daniel;</hi> feare is indeed put for the worship of the true
God, so is God called, <hi>Gen. 31. 42. The feare of Isaac,</hi> but it is not
the word used here; a devout man as <hi>Simeon</hi> is called, one taken
up with a religious feare, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Luke 2. 25. Act.</hi> 8. 2. nor are the
words used here, those which doe expresse <hi>Jobs</hi> fearing of God,
<hi>Job</hi> 1. 1. though I know the words doe expresse trembling and feare,
and also horrour and dread, such as was given to creatures and false
Gods; and therefore from this none can inferre the conversion of
this King to the true knowledge of <hi>Jehovah.</hi> God also is called
<hi>kajam,</hi> an induring and standing God, from <hi>Kum surrexit,</hi> and
well rendered to the sense by the Seventy, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
the Eternall GOD, in opposition to all falling and fading
time-gods, and Kings of clay; and so hee is a God to whom
<hi>Daniel</hi> did with a great deale of reason, rather tender the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of prayer, then to King <hi>Darius,</hi> or the supposed deities of
Persia or Chaldea, who are not standing gods induring for ever,
but come out of times wombe, and decay, and fall as creatures
also doe.</p>
            <p>Lastly, his Kingdome, that is, his People and Servants, (such
as <hi>Daniel,</hi> and his Church) and his dominion shall endure to
the end, <hi>Gnadsopha,</hi> which is not so to bee taken, as if <hi>Gnad</hi>
did signifie a date or tearme-day, at which time the dominion
of God should have an end; for 2. <hi>Samuel</hi> 6. last <hi>verse,</hi> it is said,
<hi>Michol had no childe, Gnad jom mothach, even till the day of

            <p>2. The words containe this generall, a Proclamation royall of a
great King: and for particulars,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Who giveth out the Proclamation,</hi> From my face a Decree
goeth, I <hi>Darius</hi> make a Decree.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>The parties to whom,</hi> to every dominion of my Kingdome.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>The matter,</hi> that they feare and tremble.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>The object,</hi> before the face of the God of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. The reasons of the Decree, for Law without reason is will,
not Law; men goe to heaven or hell with reason.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He is the living God:</hi> and this is form his nature.</p>
            <p>2. He is eternall: <hi>then from his government,</hi> his kingdome, <hi>such
as, 1. time, 2. violence, 3. wisedome cannot destroy; but such a</hi>
Church and Kingdome as shall endure for ever, and his dominion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
to the end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[I make a Decree.]</hi> This <hi>Darius</hi> the Mede, called <hi>Nabonithus,</hi>
succeeded to <hi>Belshazzar</hi> the sonne of <hi>Evil-Merodach,</hi> about the
yeare of the world 3393. others 3442. and did reigne 17. or 19.
yeares. And having advanced <hi>Daniel</hi> to great honour, by force of
a wicked law cast <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Lions, and God having miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously
delivered <hi>Daniel</hi> from the Lions, this King giveth out a
Law, that all his Subjects fear and serve <hi>the God of Daniel.</hi> Whence
observe,</p>
            <p>1. All Princes are obliged to governe and rule for the Lord and
his honour. 1. <hi>So Scripture speaketh, it shall be in the last dayes,
Esay</hi> 49. 25. Kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and Queens thy nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
mothers. <hi>Psal.</hi> 72. 10. The Kings of Tarshish and of the Isles
shall bring presents. <hi>(I would the King of this Island were in this
Text)</hi> ver. 11. The Kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts, yea, all
Kings shall fall downe before him.</p>
            <p>2. Princes are Gods Standard-bearers, they beare his sword by
office, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and they hold Crowne and Scepter of him, as
great Landlord of all powers.</p>
            <p>3. In a speciall manner they are second Gods. <hi>Psal. 81. 6. Nor
do rulers judge for men, the judgment is the Lords,</hi> 2 Chro. 19. 12. All
rulers in the act of judging are Gods deputies, even though their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41754:5"/>
second calling be to be sent by a King, and therefore see what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
God himselfe would pronounce, if he were on the bench,
that same must they decree, except they would make the deputed
mouth to belie the minde of the great Lord who sent them.</p>
            <p>4. The Lord hath entrusted Christian Rulers with the most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
thing he hath on earth, he hath given his Bride and Spouse
to their tutory and faith.</p>
            <p>5. What sweeter comfort can the Ruler have, either when his
soule lodgeth in an house of groaning and sicke bones, and the
image of death sitteth on his eye-lids; or in the day of his greatest
calamity, then to looke backe and smile upon such an old friend,
as a good conscience? and to say as <hi>Job</hi> doth, <hi>ch. 29. 13. The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I caused the
widowes heart to sing for joy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. You are entrusted by God with an honourable Virgin,
a <hi>Kings daughter, Psal.</hi> 45. 9. Now then for her Fathers sake, and
for her Fathers blessing, deale kindely with her: As you love the
Bridegroome take care of the Bride. You have now amongst your
hands Christ, his Crowne, <hi>his Israel, his glory, Esay</hi> 46. 13. his
Prerogative Royall: be faithfull Tuterers and active Factors for
the Priviledges, Lawes, and Liberties of the high Court of heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. If this be the place and relation that Princes have to
Christ and his Church, then can the Lord have given no power
to any Ruler to waste and destroy the <hi>mountaine of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, 1. All royall power given of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19, 20. in
the first moulding of royall highnesse, was a power to rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that <hi>which is written in the Booke of the Law,</hi> and so there
can be no royall power to the contrary, truly royall.</p>
            <p>2. That power cannot be from God as a lawfull power, the
exercise and acts whereof are sinfull. I speake of a lawfull morall
power.</p>
            <p>3. If such an uncontrollable power as cannot be resisted, be of
God, then are Princes given to the Churches and people of God, as
judgements of God, then are all Christian States, <hi>actu primo,</hi> made
slaves by God, in the very intention of God the giver, and of the
gift, at what time hee giveth them a Nurse-father to feed and
governe them; and so shall Gods gifts be snares, plagues, and no
gifts. If God give a fatherly power to a father to kill all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41754:5"/>
and if a State give to their Generall a military power to
fell and destroy all his Souldiers, so as neither Sonnes nor Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
may defend themselves; then the fatherly power should be
of its owne nature a plague to the Sonnes. If any say, the Prince,
the Father, because they feare God, will not put forth in acts such
a power; I answer, thankes to the Princes goodnesse for that, but
no thankes to his office and power. God gave him the Sword as a
Prince, if he doe not draw that royall Sword to drink bloud, we
cannot impute the cause to the nature of the royall gift or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of God the giver, but to the goodnesse of a man; which must be
bad divinite.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. So much as <hi>Darius</hi> hath of God, or any good Ruler, so
far is his spirit for the publick.</p>
            <p>He heareth something of <hi>the God of Daniel,</hi> now then he hath
a publick spirit to send something of God to all nations, people,
and languages, <hi>v.</hi> 25. Though there bee nothing to prove that the
man had saving grace, yet the generall holdeth, so much of God as
any hath, in so farre is he for the publick.</p>
            <p>1. Because grace is a publicke beame of God, and a branch of
Gods goodnesse, and so of a spreading nature; and the better things
be, the more publicke they are: the Sunne is better then a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
God best of all; because every thing that hath beeing, hath
something of God; and Christ best of all, because he is the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of many, and <hi>Col. 1. 20. hath reconciled all things in heaven and
earth to himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Graces end is the most publick end of the world, even Gods
glory, for all things are for God, <hi>Rom. 11. 36. Prov.</hi> 16. 4. mens
private ends are sinfull ends.</p>
            <p>3. The more gracious men be, the more publick they are; <hi>David</hi>
will not be <hi>David</hi> alone in praising God, but <hi>Psal.</hi> 148. he wil have
a world in with him, even <hi>Angels, Sun, Moone, Stars, Heaven of
Heavens, Dragons, deeps, fire, hail, snow, vapour, stormy winde, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
trees, beasts, creeping things, fowles, Kings, Judges, old and,
young,</hi> to hold up the song. <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> would lay out in ransome
their part of heaven to redeeme Gods glory, and salvation to the
Lords Church; the Martyrs desired that their pain &amp; torment might
praise and exalt God. How broad, how catholicke and publicke
was his spirit who said, 1 <hi>Cor. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19. Though I be free from all men,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41754:6"/>
yet have I made my selfe servant unto all, that I might gaine the
more. 20. And unto the Iews I became as a Iew, that I might gain the
Iewes; to them that are under the Law, as under the Law, that I
might gaine them that are under the Law. 21. To them that are
without the Law, as without Law, (being not without Law to God,
but under the Law to Christ) that I might gain them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Law. 22. To the weake became I as weake; I am made all
things to all men, that I might by all meanes save some.</hi> A publike
spirit is not himselfe, he is made a Jew, a Gentile; a weake man,
not a weak man; he is made Law and Gospel; he is made a bridge
over a River, that the Church may goe over him drie; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
with all who but lend out halfe a looke to Christ; and
he is, in a complement of grace, a servant to all. 2 <hi>Corinth. 4. 5.
We preach not our selves</hi> (except wee preach our owne sinnes,
our owne condemnation by nature, and that wee under-preach
all eminencie in our selves) <hi>but our selves your servants for Christs
sake;</hi> yea, your servants servants for Christ. See the Complement
of a publicke heart, of one who is willing to stoope, and put
his head and haire under the feet of the Church, and of the
poorest and most despised passenger who maketh out for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse.</hi> Then Grace maketh men rich Parliament men, and there
is a wide difference betwixt a publicke man, and a publicke spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
all Parliament men are publicke men, but they are not all
publike spirits, else so many of them would not have deserted
the publicke, and runne away from Christs Colours, to seeke
their owne private Idols. Men void of grace make an Idol of
themselves, every wicked man is wholly himselfe, and wholly
his owne, <hi>Phil. 2. 21. They all seeke their owne, not the things of
Jesus Christ.</hi> Hee who is for the Bridegroome, cannot bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Bride, nor against the Common-wealth; he who is a
Statesman of heaven, and knoweth savingly the fundamentall
Lawes of Jesus Christ, the power and prerogative roall of
the King of Kings; he who is acquainted with the frame and
constitution of the Kingdome of sinne, in his owne heart; he
who feareth God, who feareth his owne light, and is awed
with the Decrees and Lawes of an inlightened conscience, shall
be fast for the publicke; and the man who selleth his Religion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41754:6"/>
and his soule for his private ends, will soone sell his countrey, his
Parlament, the Lawes and Liberties of the Kingdome. Will hee
put the Law of God, and the Crowne and Scepter of that Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Lord Jesus to the market, and will hee sticke for his Court and
Honour, to sell the Lawes of England? and will hee forfeit Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and will hee not forfeit you all, and your Parliament and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties?
O then bee intreated now to bee for Heaven, and Christ,
as his publicke State-wits, to convey Decrees for Christs ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
for Reformation (against Babylon and her sonnes) through
this whole Kingdome. You have now power and opportunitie
to send the Glory of Christ over Sea, to all Europe; the eyes of
Nations are upon you, exalt the Sonne of God: thinke it not
sweet policie to have peace with Babylon, and warre with God;
consider if Church and State did ever prosper since the Queenes
Idol of the Masse was set up amongst you: and what is your
part when many Masses are now in the Kings Court at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[I make a Decree]</hi> There was a wicked Law and a cursed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
made by <hi>Darius,</hi> that for thirtie dayes, neither <hi>Daniel</hi> nor any
of Gods people should pray to God, or to any god save to <hi>Darius:
Daniels</hi> enemies prevaile thus farre, that <hi>Daniel,</hi> the Churches
right eye now in the Court, should be decourted and cast out to bee
meate to beasts; Behold the artifice and fathomlesse depth of
Gods wisedome, who bringeth a contrary Decree out of this
wicked Decree, even a Decree for adoring that God of <hi>Daniel,</hi>
whom they had dishonoured.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> It is the art of the deepe wisedome of divine providence to
bring good out of the sinnes of his enemies and the sufferings of his
owne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren moved with envie, sell their brother; <hi>Potiphar</hi>
casteth him in prison: the wisedome of God commeth in, in
the game, and hee exalteth <hi>Joseph,</hi> and keepeth alive people in
famine. <hi>Herod, Pilate, Jewes and Gentiles, crucifie the Lord
of glory,</hi> the Art of free grace, deepe wisedome in God must bee
more then halfe play-maker here, and in this redeeme the lost
world. The Chaldeans spoyle <hi>Job</hi> and plunder him; Satan
maketh him an empty house, and a childelesse father; mercy
commeth up in the Theater, and free Grace, maketh <hi>Job</hi> an illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41754:7"/>
and faire copy of patience and faith to all ages. <hi>Achitophel</hi>
did, as many now with our King doth, hee gave wicked counsell
against the Lords servant and a just cause, divine justice cometh in
in the game, and <hi>Achitophel</hi> hangeth himselfe.</p>
            <p>The use of this shall answer two questions.</p>
            <p>1. Why doth God suffer sinne to be, and so much sinne in England
and Ireland?</p>
            <p>2. Why doth hee suffer his people in Covenant with him, to bee a
land of bloud?</p>
            <p>The former question is a generall, a wicked <hi>Marcion</hi> asketh, why
the Lord, who foresaw the event, did suffer <hi>Evah</hi> and the Devill to
conferre? and if he was able, why did hee not hinder sinne to bee,
except he had been either envious, and would not, or weake, and
could not hinder the enters of sinne in the world? <hi>Tertullian</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth,
Because the Lord is free in his gifts. <hi>Augustine</hi> answereth,
<hi>Epist. 59. ad Paulinum, Quia voluit,</hi> because it was his will.
<hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Hilarius</hi> both with <hi>Augustine,</hi> say; <hi>The cause may
be unknown, it cannot be unjust.</hi> Though it were in the Potters
hand, to turne clay into brasse, yet his power should not destroy his
liberty, to cause him to make a lame vessell such, as if it had reason
and will to fall, it should not bee broken. Why should <hi>Daniels</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
prevaile so as to cast him to Lions? that these knees that
bowed often to God, and these hands which was lifted up to him,
should be eaten with Lions? O lame vessell beleeve, beleeve but
dispute not. And the answer is cleare, sinne is the worst thing that
is, but the existence of sinne is not ill: otherwayes (saith <hi>Augustine)</hi>
God should never permit it to be. Yea sinnes being in the world, is
<hi>(silva justiciae divinae, officina gratiae Christi) A field for the glory
of revenging justice, and sinne is the work house of the pardoning grace
of God.</hi> And therefore there bee good reasons why the Lord should
permit sinne, and such sinnes.</p>
            <p>1. That there may be roome in the play for pardoning grace; the
colour and beauty of free grace had never beene made obvious in
such a way, to the eye of Angels and Men, if sinne had not
beene.</p>
            <p>2. There had beene no employment for the mercy of a soule-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
Jesus.</p>
            <p>3. Wee should not have had occasion in the eares of Angels,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41754:7"/>
to hold up for ever and ever the new Psalme of the Praises of a
Redeemer.</p>
            <p>4. By this, nature, clay, and fraile nature, and selfe-dependence is
cried downe, and God exalted.</p>
            <p>5. By this, the humble love of the contrite and broken in heart is
necessitated to kisse the bowels of him who bindeth up the broken
hearted mourners in Sion, and furrowes of blood put to reall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of everlasting compassion.</p>
            <p>6. Hence also are minors and poore pupils put to improve their
faith and dependence upon so Kingly a Tutor, as never enough loved
and admired Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>7. Hence, to the praise of grace, Satan hath faire justice, and that
<hi>(in foro contradictorio)</hi> in open patent Court, when clay trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheth
over Angels and Hell, through the strength of Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other question is also soone answered:</hi> Why should the cause
of God be so oppressed, and his Churches garments rolled in blood?</p>
            <p>But 1. God must bee knowne to bee God in his owne chaire of
estate, and hee must be <hi>The Saviour of Israel in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Satan, Prelates, Papists, Malignants,</hi> shall be vnder-work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and kitchin-servants to him <hi>who hath his fire in Sion, and his
furnace in Jerusalem,</hi> to purifie and refine the vessels of mercy in
the Lords house.</p>
            <p>3. Christs Bride must know that this is their Inne, not their
home; their Pilgrimage, not their Countrey; otherwise our Lord
knoweth how to lead his passengers to Heaven, not by Sea, but by
dry land.</p>
            <p>4. All must see that the losse of men is not the Lords losse, but the
Gospels gaine.</p>
            <p>5. His glorious grace must be commended who suiteth in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
a spouse to himselfe, in no place rather then in the <hi>Furnace,
Esay</hi> 48. 10.</p>
            <p>6. Prayers and praises must bee the rent paid to him to whom
belongeth the issues from death. The Lord hath a great worke now
on the wheeles in Britain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Be very charitable of our Lords dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though the slaine of the Lord bee many in England and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
looke not on the darke side of Gods providence, or on the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41754:8"/>
blacke and weeping side of his dispensation; <hi>widdowes are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied</hi>
almost as the <hi>sand of the Sea;</hi> children weepe and cry, Alas
my father! mothers in Ireland die twice, when they see their
children slaine before their eyes, and then are killed themselves. Oh!
(say men) why doth the Lord this? Behold, the faire and smiling
side of Gods providence; contrary windes from Rome, from hell,
by the art of omnipotency, promove the sailing and course of Christs
ship.</p>
            <p>1. God is now drawing an excellent portract of a refined
Church, but with the inke of the innocent blood of his people; say
not, What is the Lord doing? or, Is there knowledge in the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?
who hath given the Lord counsell? better wee be his courtiers,
then his counsellors.</p>
            <p>2. If we love the dust and the stones of Sion, <hi>Psalme</hi> 102. 14.
Christ is ravished with one of his Churches eyes, and with a <hi>chaine
of her neck, Cant.</hi> 4. 9. God loveth his owne glory more ardently
then I can love it.</p>
            <p>3. The Church is dearer bought to Jesus then to me or you; hee
hath given too great a price for her, to lose her.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Rather when wee cannot see to the bottome of providence,
beleeve upon plain trust, and say as</hi> Esay 8. 17. I will wait upon the
Lord that hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will looke
for him.</p>
            <p>Part. 2. <hi>[In every dominion of my kingdome.]</hi> This is the second
part, wherein the parties to whom this Law is given, are expressed
in their universalitie, as they are, <hi>v. 25. To all people, nations, and
languages that dwell on all the earth, peace:</hi> Whence observe; <hi>That
Nations without the visible Church never wanted means, either or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
or extraordinary, to know God;</hi> though we cannot in reason
say that the Decree or Law of a heathen King is the <hi>Arminian</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall
grace, yet some means all have: And God hath laid open
foure bookes to all nations. 1. That booke of creation of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and his workes, <hi>Psalme 19. 1. The Heavens, Mesappe-rajim
cevodel, doe booke, and register the glory of God, Romanes,</hi> 1.
20.</p>
            <p>2. The booke of ordinary providence is a Chronicle or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41754:8"/>
of a God-head, and a Testimony that there is a God, <hi>Acts
14. 17. Acts</hi> 17. 27.</p>
            <p>3. There is a booke of the extraordinary workes of God, and
some report of the true God, upon occasion carried to Nations
without the borders of the visible Church; As our text saith: And
<hi>Rachab</hi> saith, <hi>Josh. 2. 10. We have heard how the Lord dryed up the
red Sea,</hi> &amp;c. But as children sport themselves and play with the
pictures in a booke, and with the gold on the covering of
the booke, and the ribbins, not knowing the sense and meaning
of this book; so doe we sport our selves in looking on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of these three bookes, not searching it to reade and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the <hi>invisible things of God, his eternall power and God-head,
Rom.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
            <p>4. The booke of mans conscience, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. doth speake of
God to all Nations, though now by reason of our sinfull blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and dulnesse, that book be uncorrected, and dimme-printed,
written with white and watery Ink, so that we see not God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
in it; yet all these foure serve to make men <hi>without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse,
because, when they know God, they glorifie him not as God,
neither are thankefull, Rom.</hi> 1. 20. But this condemneth us to

            <p>Yea, if Christ in the Gospel <hi>had not come to us, we should have
had no sinne</hi> (no evangelick guilt of unbeleefe) <hi>but now wee have</hi>
(<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>no shift of Law, no cloake for our sinne.</hi> Hence, though
this Island be in a more blessed condition, by reason that the Sunne
shineth in his strength and light in our Meridian, <hi>(God hath not
done so to every Nation,</hi> Psal. 147. 19, 20.) yet by reason of despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
salvation in this day-light of the Gospel, we are in a most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
condition.</p>
            <p>1. Because Sodomy is not so hainous a sinne as unbeleefe, and
the despising of the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 15. For Evangelick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe
is against the flower and garland (to speake so) of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of God; not onely against a Creator, but against a Saviour,
and against those most lovely and soul-ravishing attributes of God,
his mercy, goodnesse, free-grace, longanimity, patience, bowels
of compassion: and therefore an unbeleeving Covenanter with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41754:9"/>
God in England and Scotland, is to looke for a hotter furnace in the
lake of fire and brimstone, then one of Sodome and Gomarrah.</p>
            <p>2. Because there is some exception against the Law-vengeance,
for the Gospel is a cleare exception against those who are under
the Law-curse, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. But there is no exception against the
Gospel-vengeance: this is a year and age, and Eternity-vengeance,
for the finall rejecter of the Gospel hath not a Sacrifice for sinne
to looke to, as the Law-breaker hath, <hi>Heb. 2. 1, 2. Heb.</hi> 10.
26, 27.</p>
            <p>3. The rejecting of the Gospel is a fighting against the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Gospel, whereas the Law is but a letter: and unbeliefe
is <hi>a sinne against the Holy Ghost,</hi> though it be not alwayes <hi>the sinne
against the Holy Ghost;</hi> therefore are the despisers of the Gospel
kept, as desperate robbers are, to the judgement of the great Court
day, and chained up and fettered to the last and terrible vengeance,
2 <hi>Thes. 1. 8, 9. Deut. 32. 22. Heb.</hi> 10. 26.</p>
            <p>O tremble and stand in awe of this high treason, for your
sinne is not like Sodomes, nor like the despising of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
decree of such an heathen King as <hi>Darius.</hi> But ere I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
it may be asked, Is unbeliefe a greater sinne then Sodomy,
which hath a cry up to Heaven? unbeliefe soundeth no such cry
to Heaven?</p>
            <p>I answer: Hainous sinnes against the second Table are borne
with a shout and a cry in their mouth, and are very broad-faced
and bloudy, and have more of a naturall conscience in them,
because the duties of the second Table are written in our heart
in fairer print, and in a bigger Character then the duties of
the first Table. Therefore naturall men can heare the cry of
these sinnes; and that is our corruption, that a man is more
wounded in minde if he offend his earthly Father, then if
he blaspheme his heavenly Father, the great and eternall Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah.
But the duties of the first Table are written in our heart
by nature, in a more dimme and obscure way, and hath lesse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
conscience; and the principles of the Gospel are not
written in our heart at all, at least as they are Evangelicke,
we know them not but by revelation, <hi>Gal. 1. 15, 16. Mat.</hi>
16. 17. and therefore sinnes against the Gospel are borne dumb,
and being more cleanely and spirituall sinnes, they have no
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41754:9"/>
shout or cry against the conscience, except in so farre as they are
enlightened supernaturally, in whom unbeliefe hath a stirring and
a paine of Conscience. Hence observe a considerable difference
by the way, betwixt the naturall and renewed soule: A naturall
man may be pained in conscience with parricide, robberies, acts of
cruelty, but never shall you heare him troubled in minde with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe,
and doubting of a God-head, and the soules immortality,
as <hi>Judas</hi> was wakened in conscience for bloud and treachery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his innocent Master, but not for unbeliefe and blasphemy,
whereof he was guilty in an high measure. But the renewed are
troubled with spirituall sinnes, which are onely discerned by a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
and supernaturall light, as with unbeliefe, ignorance, securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
wandring of heart in Prayer, doubtings of a providence that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all.</p>
            <p>Also it may be questioned, How it commeth to passe that God
sendeth not sufficient helps to all Nations, that they may <hi>come to
the knowledge of the truth and be saved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer shortly: It is enough that he giveth sufficient meanes
in this sense, That Gods justice is cleared, and men are without all
excuse, in that they wilfully lose themselves. 1. Men are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
guilty because they are not saved. 2. Nor are all men guilty
because the Gospel commeth not to them. 3. Nor are they all
guilty because they beleeve not; <hi>For how shall they beleeve in him,
of whom they have not heard? Romans</hi> 10. 14. But they are
guilty because they doe not use that which is given them for
God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But God gave me no more grace, and what can I doe
without grace?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This argument toucheth those who heare the Gospel,
as well as those who never heard of it: And it is a chiding with the
soveraigne Lord, because he gave not efficacious grace to all: And
Patrons of nature, and Arminians, are no lesse straited with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
dispensation of God then we are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But if I had had such grace as God gave to <hi>Peter,</hi> I
should have beleeved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is the carnall mans argument, <hi>Rom. 9. 18, 19. If he
have mercy on whom he will;</hi> He cannot be angry against me, who
do not beleeve, for no man resisteth his will. Yea, but as the clay
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41754:10"/>
should not dispute with the Potter, so the clay having a corrupted
will, doth wilfully refuse to beleeve, and the creatures willing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience,
and Gods free decree of denying grace, doth meet in
one, for which cause the creature is justly condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But more grace should make me beleeve, and more
grace God denieth to me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is easier to complaine for what we have not, then
thankfully to use what we have. If the creditor crave the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ten thousand pounds from a Land-waster, it is bad pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to say, <hi>You are to be blamed that I pay not, because you lent me
not twenty thousand pound.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. But I have a strong inclination, and cannot resist when
I am tempted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> O lame vessel, tremble, but dispute not. 2. It is lawfull
to complaine and sigh under those fetters, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. but unlawfull
to childe and excuse sinfull rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Part.</hi> 3. That men tremble and feare before the face of the God of
<hi>Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this third Part we have to consider these two:</p>
            <p>First, Who commandeth trembling and feare.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The thing commanded, trembling, and feare.</p>
            <p>1. The Commander is <hi>Darius,</hi> but whether converted, or not, is
a question. I thinke there is no ground to hold that he was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
man: 1 Because all that he commandeth, is trembling, and
<hi>feare of God;</hi> upon the occasion of a miracle, the positive worship
of God is not commanded. 2. He calleth not God, his God, but
<hi>the God of Daniel.</hi> 3. He acknowledgeth <hi>Daniels</hi> God to be the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, but doth not command that he onely shall be served,
and all dead gods cast off. 4. The Babilonish History sheweth he
still kept his idol-gods. 5. The rise of this Proclamation is a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and such as breedeth rather a servile feare then a filiall adoring
of God. 6. There is nothing here of the meanes to instruct his
people in the knowledge of the true God: And to command Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
without information of the minds, is rather Tyranny over
the conscience, then true zeal: Hence <hi>unrenewed men may out of the
dominion of a convincing light, be forced to acknowledge the Lord,
when yet the will and affections are not subdued to the knowledge of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41754:10"/>
God.</hi> Hence I expresse my thoughts in this point, in these assertions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The naturall conscience is not its owne Lord in
knowing, bleeving, and confessing something of God. For, first,
<hi>Devils believe there is a God, but they tremble, Iames</hi> 2. 19. They
beleeve against their will, as a man condemned to death for a crime,
beleeveth he must die, but his will is opposite to his faith. <hi>Iudas</hi>
awaked cannot chuse but beleeve a vengeance. Light is a King, and a
conquerour sometime. 2. You seldome finde but enemies have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
a testimony, now or then, for God. <hi>Exod. 14. 25. Let us flee,</hi> (say
the Egyptians) <hi>for the Lord fighteth for them, against the Egyptians:
Pharaoh</hi> being mastered in conscience with the plague of haile
mingled with fire, saith, <hi>Exod. 9. 27. I have sinned [this] time: The
Lord is righteous, and I and my people are wicked: Deut. 32. 31. For
their rocke is not as our rock, our enemies being Iudges: Psal. 126. 2.
Then said they amongst the heathen, the Lord hath done great things
for them. Sauls</hi> conscience speaketh truth, in a dreame, through his
sleepe, though he went to bed again, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 17. Thou art more
righteous then I,</hi> so speaketh he to <hi>David.</hi> The Devill can say no
otherwayes, <hi>Luke 4. 34. I know thee who thou art, the holy one of
God. Pilate</hi> must say of Christ, <hi>I finde no fault in him. Caligula</hi> his
feare must make his faith a lyar, and when he heareth a thunder, say,
<hi>Mine eares heare the God which my heart denieth to have any being.
Nero</hi> cannot say but hell is begunne in his soule before the time. The
Apostate <hi>Iulian</hi> said, <hi>Vicisti tandem Galilaee, At length, O Iesus,
thou art victorious. Paul</hi> the third, a monster of men, said dying,
<hi>I shall now be resolved of three things: 1. If the soule be immortall:
2. If there be a God: 3. If there be a hell. Plinius</hi> the second wrote
to the Emperour, that Jesus Christ was a great Prophet, and a holy
man. Many Papists of old gave testimony that the <hi>Waldenses</hi> were
holy men. Many at Rome, said <hi>Luther,</hi> was for the truth, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
that <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth would reforme the Church, as <hi>Guiciard.
hist. l.</hi> 3. saith. Malignants on their death-bed have said, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of England is for justice and religion, and Scotland contend for
the purity of the Gospel; and let but adversaries aske at their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in cold blood, whether the world, and their own ease, or the
truth of God bottomed their conscience in following the wayes of
Cavaliers; and aske, on whose side are lies, perjury, blaspheming,
mocking of godlinesse, the idolatrie of the masse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41754:11"/>
               <hi>Assertion</hi> 2. The will and affections have a dominion over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
in many things; in that,</p>
            <p>1. There is a Covenant betwixt conscience and concupiscence,
while (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith) <hi>Men beleeve not what they know, but
what they will,</hi> and will is halfe play-maker in their faith, 2 <hi>Pet.
3. 5. Of this they are willingly ignorant:</hi> excellently is it said, <hi>Ier. 9.
6. Bemirmah, In deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord.</hi> The
will hath a pack-pull on the minde: Light and malice, minde and
will are vowen through other, the wills malice soureth and leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the minds light, as rotten matter mixed with good wine over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastereth
it, and taketh taste and colour from it.</p>
            <p>2. The will and affection hath power to suspend the acts of, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
of Christs excellency: 2. Sinnes horrour: 3. Truths beauty:
4. The sweet peace of obedience to God: 5. The eternitie of heaven
and hell. <hi>Hos. 7. 1. The theefe cometh in, and the troopes of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
spoile without, and they say not in heart, that I remember all
their wickednesse.</hi> The will and affections should ingage and take the
minde suretie and oblieged to consider of God and his wayes: But
it is here as when a merchant cometh in, and overbiddeth the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and causeth the seller and the customer part company. When
the minde is upon this or the like: <hi>What shall the wrath or the smiles
of a King doe to mee, when my eye-strings shall bee broken? What
thoughts can I have of gaine, lust, pleasure, court, when wormes shall
make their nests in my eye-holes?</hi> In these, affections come in and
divert the minde from such precious thoughts; and here bee two er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
in the will: First, a sort of wicked diverting of the minde from
necessary truths. Secondly, a will-heresie, when faith and divinity
is swallowed up in the will and affections.</p>
            <p>3. The will and affections resist truth in the minde, as <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 10.
The adversaries <hi>could not resist the wisedome and spirit by which Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen
spake:</hi> then their minde was convinced, <hi>Act. 7. 51. You doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes</hi>
(saith <hi>Stephen) resist the holy Spirit.</hi> Behold, they could not
resist light, yet they doe of malice, resist light.</p>
            <p>4. The will and affections can imprison and cast in fetters Truth,
<hi>Rom. 1. 18. They keep the truth of God captive,</hi> or in bonds: though
Truth sometime break the fetters, and bolts, and escape, and come
out to a confession, yet they apprehend Truth againe, and lay it in
fetters.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41754:11"/>
               <hi>Assertion</hi> 3. The onely saving grace of God, infused in the
mind, will, and affections, doth subdue the conscience to
truth, and obedience of the truth. Grace is the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
of all. Jer. 20. 9. <hi>I was weary with forbearing, and I
could not stay.</hi> Act. 4. 20. <hi>We cannot but speake the things which
we have seen and heard.</hi> New wine must have vent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. We would beware of sinnes against light, these are
under water in the ship, and are sinking sins; a Reformation
hath beene calling on you, and offering it selfe to you these
fourescore yeares, and men have beene saying, It is not time
to build the house of the Lord: and consider I pray you, how
fearefull it is, for men not to stoup and fall downe, as taken
captives to the truth of God, for every thought should bee
brought as an apprehended souldier and a captive, to the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. 5. And specially the land is to be
humbled for such sins as by the light of the Gospel hath been
cried against, as luxury, vanity, pride, and fulnesse of bread,
uncleannesse, swearing, lying, unjustice, oppression, but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
multiplied Altars, Idolatry, superstition, wil-worship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. The honourable Houses are to beware of the halfe
reformation of <hi>Darius;</hi> nothing more odious to God then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>1. A negative devotion: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> thinketh hee
hath done all if nothing bee spoken amisse of the true God,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 29.</p>
            <p>2. Agrippa <hi>his</hi> almost a Christian, <hi>is not a Christian at all,</hi>
Ier. 3. 10. Yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not
turned to me with her whole heart.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>God</hi> detesteth lukewarmnes, and coldnes in his matters.</p>
            <p>4. Hee hateth a mixture, it is a marke put on <hi>Samaria,</hi>
2 King. 17. 33. <hi>They feared the Lord, and served their owne
Gods;</hi> this is that which bringeth the stretched-out arm of the
Lords fury on the land, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5. because they <hi>sweare by the
Lord, and by Malcom,</hi> and because the people <hi>halteth betwixt
the Lord and Baal,</hi> 1 King. 18. 21. And it is <hi>Johu</hi> his reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reformation, 2 King. 10. 28. <hi>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out
of Israel. 29. Neverthelesse he departed not from the sinnes of
Jeroboam the sonne of Nobat;</hi> O how fearfull to be under this?
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41754:12"/>
he is for the good cause, neverthelesse he knoweth nothing of
the power of Religion, so hee is right in the house, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
he complaineth much with Malignants. It is knowne
to you all when the Whore of Babylon was cast out of the
Church, that shee left behinde her a gold ring, and some love
tokens, I meane Episcopacie, and humane Ceremonies; this
was the whores policy to leave a token behinde her, that she
might finde an errand in the house againe: and shee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
returning to the house to demand her love-token again,
but it shall bee Heavenly wisedome to make a perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation:
keep nothing that belongeth to Babylon, and let
not a stone, to be a corner-stone or a foundation, bee taken out
of Babylon for the building of the Lords house, for they are
cursed stones.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[That they tremble and feare]</hi> In Part 2. of the third mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our Text we are to consider, that <hi>Iehovah</hi> is to bee look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and served with feare and trembling; upon these sixe
grounds all applicable to the present condition of times.</p>
            <p>1. He is a great God, Ier. 30. 6. <hi>For as much as there is none
like unto thee O Lord, thou art great, and thy Name is great;
who would not feare thee, O King of Nations?</hi> Ier. 5. 22. <hi>Feare
ye not me, saith the Lord; will ye not tremble at my presence,
which have placed the sand for the bound of the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> Alas
we fancy to our selves a little God, and a great mortall King,
therefore we tremble at the one, and feare not the other; so
when we have to doe with an earthly power, the soule is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilely
timorous; when we have to doe with God, the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is all made of stoutnesse.</p>
            <p>2. The sinnes of the Land should make us tremble, Esa. 24.
16. <hi>But I said, my leannesse, my leannesse, woe unto me, for the
treacherous dealers dealeth treacherously,</hi> Ier. 23. 9. <hi>My heart
within me is broken, all my bones shake, &amp;c.</hi> Psal. 119. 53. <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
hath taken hold of me, because of the wicked that keep not
thy law:</hi> What should the sins of Court, of Prelates, make me
tremble? are they my sins? Yea 1. every sin that I am not grieved
for is mine. 2. He never mourned for his own sins, who is not
humbled for the sins of the land. 3. A gracious <hi>Samuel</hi> will
own the sins of <hi>Saul.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41754:12"/>
3. Gods great workes call for trembling, <hi>Habak.</hi> 3. The
Prophet considering <hi>Gods walking through the red Sea with
his horses,</hi> maketh him say, though it was a worke of mercy,
<hi>verse 16. When I heard it, my belly trembled, my lips quive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
rottennesse entred into my bones, and I trembled in my
selfe.</hi> O tremble at this Lord, who hath, 1. Wrought State
miracles, if not miracles in nature; hee hath commanded the
Sunne of righteousnesse to stand still in the Meridian of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
2. He hath divided our red Sea. 3. He hath brought
us backe from the bordell-house, and renewed a Covenant
with us. 4. Our enemies are fallen, and those are inlarged
who were banished, imprisoned, vexed by Prelates for the
haynous crime (as they thought) of pietie, holines, and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxie.
Tremble at his goodnesse, <hi>Feare the Lord and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
Hos. 3. 5. <hi>Rejoyce in trembling,</hi> Psal. 2. 11. An ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
minde feareth debt, mercies tendered to us are debts lying
on us; O how shall we repay him? what shall we render to
him? Are wee not banckrupts to mercy and the goodnesse
of God.</p>
            <p>4. Tremble at Gods judgements, Psal. 119. 120. <hi>My flesh
trembleth for feare of thee, and I am affraid of thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
Jer. 4. 19. <hi>My bowels, my bowels, I am pained at the
very heart, my heart maketh a noise within mee, I cannot hold
my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soule, the sound of the
trumpet, the alarme of warre.</hi> Here is a waste field of trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling:
God in Germany is God to be feared in all places, for
in these lands the wife could scarce have the halfe of her
husband to bury, the best halfe hath beene blowne up in the
aire with fire-work. 2. Horse hath beene esteemed good
meat. 3. In Ireland the mothers have heard their young
children aske mercy at the rebell with his Skainzer cutting
the throat of her sonne; and hath not the Sword multiplyed
Widdowes, and multiplyed Orphans in this land? It is fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to man to bide it out, as a warre, whether Gods displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
will or no.</p>
            <p>5. We are exceedingly to tremble at his anger, Amos 3. 8.
<hi>The Lyon hath roared, who would not feare?</hi> When God doth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41754:13"/>
but seeme to be angry. The children of God have beene
distracted, and almost besides their wits with Gods terrours,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 15. and they were scarce in the suburbs of hell. Is
there not cause to feare, if any of the land breake the oath
of God, that the flying roll and book of vengeance, <hi>twentie
cubits long, and ten cubits broad, shall enter into such a mans
house, and remain in the midst thereof, and shall consume it, both
timber &amp; stones? Zac.</hi> 5. 4. When God declareth himself angry,
mountains and hils do tremble, <hi>Psal. 114. 3. The sea saw it, and

back?</hi> ver. 7. <hi>Tremble thou earth at tho presence of the Lord.</hi>
Hab. 3. 10. <hi>The mountains saw thee, and they trembled.</hi> That
God is now angry, it may appeare, 1. Because your adversaries
never prospered in any warres before, and now the Lord hath
girded them with strength. 2. The godly man is taken away,
it is cleare then there is evill comming, <hi>Esay 57. 1. Mich.</hi> 7 1.
When an old sheep fleeth into an hedge, it is like a storme is
comming. 3. There be more bloud shed then would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Palatinate.</p>
            <p>6. We are to tremble when the Lord is like to depart;
and that Christ and the Gospel shall depart from this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
is intended by Papists and Prelates, for the extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Protestants and Protestant Religion, is the designe of
Babylon, and of those in whom is any of her spirit: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what this is, <hi>Hos. 9. 12. Though Ephraim bring np chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
yet wil I bereave her of them,</hi> that not a man shall be left;
that is a sad condition: but this is a sadder case comming, <hi>also
wo be to them when I depart from them,</hi> Zach. 11. 9. <hi>Then said I,
I wil feed you no more.</hi> Nay, but (say some) we are not to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at that, if the Gospel be removed, and Popery come in,
we shall have the good old world, and plenty of all things:
Take heed of that good old world; in these same words, <hi>I
will feed you no more, that which perisheth, let it perish, and
that which is cut off, let it be cut off, and let the rest eate the
flesh one of another:</hi> woe, woe to the Land if the Lord depart
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41754:13"/>
from us, and remove his Kingdome: this is worse then the
Sword, therefore let Christ have welcome in the land, and
his Throne be exalted, and his Temple builded, that hee may
delight to come and fill the Temple with the Cloud of his
Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[That they tremble and feare.] Darius</hi> requireth outward
subjection to the <hi>God of Daniel,</hi> even trembling and inward
subjection, <hi>feare;</hi> and both being put together, he then would
teach, that the true God should have the highest bensill and
outmost pitch of the strength of the affections of feare, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
joy, love, &amp;c. Hence it may bee questioned, whether
or no, affections in their highest pitch are conducible in Gods
Service.</p>
            <p>I answer in these Assertions.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Assertion.</hi> Those affections which goe before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate
acts of understanding, doe overcloud and mist reason,
and marre the acts of beleeving in God, and serving and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, Luke 24. 41. <hi>The disciples beleeved not for joy, and
wondered:</hi> So hungring for Christs presence doth sometime
hinder faith, and this is seene here, <hi>tam misere cupio ut vix
credam,</hi> I so eagerly long for Christ, that I beleeve never to
enjoy him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The more grace, the lesse passion; I meane
the lesse inordinate affection; this is cleare in Christ Jesus,
in whom was the fulnesse of grace, and therefore affections
in him were rather actions, then passions, Iohn 11. 3. <hi>Jesus
groaned in spirit and was troubled,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
himselfe, Christ did call upon sorrow to rise, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
in him did not arise uncalled; affections in Christ were
servants, in us they are masters. There is mud in our bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
even when our affections are liquid and cleare in the
brimme, especially the sensitive part is clayie and drimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
water. 2. Grace is a good stirseman, and overmaster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
passion; and reason, in the renewed man, is made a
masse of Grace; and the most mortified have most reason,
and strongest light, <hi>Romans 8. 7. The carnall minde</hi> (that is,
the unmortified minde) <hi>is enmitie with God, Philippians 3. 8.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41754:14"/>
Yea doubtlesse, and I count all things losse for the super-excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
knowledge of God in Christ Iesus my Lord.</hi> Then he was
dead to all his priviledges, that hee might excell in the
knowledge of Christ; and where there is little or no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
there is little or no heavenly light: therefore,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 5. walkers after their lusts, and mockers and scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
at the day of <hi>Christs second comming, are willingly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi>
and brutish in that which they should know,
and so there is as much Clay in the Fountaine as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The more faith, the lesse passion; for as
some say of the Sunne, that light is not an accident of the Sun,
but the essence thereof, so as the Sunne is but a masse and body
of pure light; so is faith a Globe of heavenly light of reason.
The beleever is the most reasonable man in the world, hee
who doth all by faith, doth all by the light of sound reason,
and <hi>Paul, 2 Thess.</hi> 3. prayeth to be delivered <hi>from unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
men;</hi> but how unreasonable? because <hi>verse</hi> 2. they <hi>have
no faith:</hi> faith is a beame of Heavens light; Idolaters are
farre from faith, and so they are cruell and superlative in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of anger, hatred, envie: for this cause Babylon is fat
with drinking much blood. When mortification is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. it hath the name to be called reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
service to God.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Assertion.</hi> If the action bee done in faith, the more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in the action, the better: But if it bee not done in the
light of faith, the action is the worse. <hi>Jehu</hi> casteth downe
Altars from anger and fury, not from faith: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Altars from the light of faith and zeale. If a strong
ship bee faire before the winde, if all other things bee right,
the more winde the better: so two principles of grace in
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> are better then one carnall principle in <hi>Iehu.</hi> In
reformers of the Lords house, and in those who purge the
Temple, and cast out <hi>the buyers and the sellers,</hi> there should
bee strong affections of love, anger, zeale; but all these are
bad principles, if there bee not much light of sound faith in
reformers, yet a caution is here needfull. In actions of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41754:14"/>
second table, where our selfe, or our neighbour, and not God
or Religion hath place, the higher bent the affection bee,
the action is the worse; duties to Prince, parents, husband,
wife, children, Parliament, require not all the love, all the
feare, all the joy; halfe love is best here, and it is good that
love, feare, joy, desire, anger, goe by ounce weights; but
Reformation, God, Religion calleth for <hi>all the heart, all
the soule, all the strength,</hi> Psalme 42. 2. <hi>Davids</hi> soule and
his flesh are allowed in seeking after the <hi>living God, to long,
to faint, to cry out with a shout for the living God;</hi> so more
affection should bee for Christs fundamentall Lawes, for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
then for the fundamentall Lawes of a Kingdome, or
for the power and priviledges of Parliament. And it is
cleare in ill actions, the lesse affection the better; <hi>Pilates</hi>
slaying of Christ, had lesse hatred and envie, then the
Scribes and Pharisees killing of him; and the more innocent
that the affection bee, the bad action is the lesse evill: feare
is a more innocent affection then hatred. Those who out
of feare desert the Lords cause, are not to be punished in
that degree with those who out of malice and hatred to the
truth joyned to the Malignant faction. How ever, God
challengeth the floure of our affections, and it is a sweet
thing to spend the vigour and floure of the affection upon
God, and if you had ten tongues to speake for God, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
hands to fight for him, many lives to lose for him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophels</hi>
wisedome to imploy in his services, except you
engage the heart and affections in his service, you doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him. If Prelates, Papists and Malignants bee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely as hurtfull to your State, to the gaine and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
peace of the Common-wealth, and not as Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as Idolaters, as they are under the King of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse
pit, the Antichrist, and Comets who borrow light
from that fallen Starre, and not as servants to our King; the
warre is shedding of innocent blood; heart reduplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the affections doe mightily invert the nature of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<hi>Jehu</hi> 2 Kings 10. 30. 31. <hi>did right in the sight of
the eyes of God, and did to the house of Ahab according
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41754:15"/>
to all that was in Gods heart;</hi> yet because hee did it with a
crooked and bastard intention, for his owne honour and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
ends, his obedience is, <hi>Hosea,</hi> 1. 4. murther before
God.</p>
            <p>art. 4. <hi>[The God of Daniel.]</hi> This is the fourth point
considerable here. <hi>Darius</hi> speaketh of the living God, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
men doe, with a note of estrangement of affection, he
applyeth him to <hi>Daniel,</hi> as the God of <hi>Daniel,</hi> but applyeth
him not to himselfe, as making him his owne God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth insinuate that hee had another God then <hi>Daniels</hi>
God: So doe naturall spirits destitute of faith stand afarre off
from God, and bide at a distance with God, whereas onely
faith can claim interest in God, and father it selfe upon the
Lord. <hi>Laban</hi> speaketh thus to <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 31. 29. <hi>The God
of your father spake to mee yesterday,</hi> Exod. 8. 25. <hi>Pharaoh
called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Goe yee sacrifice to
your God in the land,</hi> 1 King. 13. 6. <hi>Jeroboam saith to the
Prophet. Entreat now the face of the Lord thy God, and pray
for me:</hi> and <hi>Rachab</hi> speaking in the name of the people of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo</hi>
saith, Iosh. 2. 11. <hi>For the Lord your God hee is God in
the Heaven above, and in the earth beneath;</hi> unbelief maketh
the unbeleever that which he is, even a bastard and stranger,
not a sonne nor an heire; whereas faith challengeth right and
heritage in God, Psalme 5. 2. <hi>Hearken unto the voyce of my
cry, my King and my God,</hi> Psalme 7. 1. <hi>O Lord my God, in thee
doe I put my trust.</hi> Psalme 18. 1, 2. <hi>The Lord is my strength.
The Lord is my rock, my fortresse, and my deliverer: my God,
my strength in whom I will trust, my Buckler, and the horne
of my salvation, my high tower;</hi> here bee nine relations, nine
My'es. 2 Chr. 20. 12. <hi>Our God, wilt thou not judge them?</hi> Ezra,
9. 6. <hi>O my God, I am ashamed, &amp;c.</hi> Dan. 9. 4. <hi>And I prayed unto
the Lord my God:</hi> the three children say, Daniel 3. 17. <hi>Our
God is able to deliver us,</hi> Ioh. 20. 28. <hi>Thomas</hi> said, <hi>my Lord,
my God. Daniel</hi> here is made proprietor and heritor of the
true and living God; and <hi>Darius</hi> and all his people have
their owne Gods, called the gods of nations, and <hi>Darius</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it as a ground, That the God which any man serveth, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41754:15"/>
trusteth in, hee hath a relation to him, as to his owne God:
every man may by Law claime what is his owne. Hence are
these two questions to be discussed.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether Application bee essentiall to Faith
or not?</p>
            <p>2. What ground have those who heare of God, and those
within the visible Church, to call God their God.</p>
            <p>For the discussion of the first, these following assertions
may resolve us.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Assertion.</hi> Faith is more then a naked, hungry, and
poore assent to the truth, there is in it a fiduciall acquiescence
and a leaning upon JEHOVAH, expressed by divers expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
full of marrow, as <hi>Psalme 22. 8. He trusted,</hi> the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes
say, <hi>He rolled himselfe on</hi> JEHOVAH; which is, when
a wearied man sweating under a burden casteth himself and
his burden both upon a place or a bed of rest <hi>Gol El-Jehovah</hi>
as that <hi>Psal. 55. 22. Cast thy burden on</hi> JEHOVAH, and 1 <hi>Pet.
5. 7. Roll all your care on him, Psalme</hi> 37. the <hi>Chaldee Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase</hi>
saith on the place, <hi>for [he rolled himselfe on God] I
spake prayses to God,</hi> which holdeth forth, that Faith is a
worke of the heart and affection, rather then of the minde;
So <hi>Psalme</hi> 37. 5. Resigne, and give over, or roll over thy
wayes to the Lord, as <hi>Jerom</hi> doth well turne it; <hi>Bibl. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plutense,
flee in to Jehovah. Psalme 18. 18. They prevented
me in the day of my calamitie, but Jehovah was my stay;</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this to the Lord his bearing up of <hi>Davids</hi> heart in his
trouble (which in reason cannot be denied) <hi>Mis<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gnan</hi> is, (as
<hi>Arias Montanus</hi> turneth it) <hi>fulcrum; Junius, scipio,</hi> or <hi>bacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
the seventy Interpreters <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Lord was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
stay and his staffe: so is the word used, <hi>Esay</hi> 3. 1. The
Lord <hi>taketh from Judah the stay and the staffe;</hi> and it is not
evill that Christ is the sinners stay, and the lamed mans
staffe, <hi>Esay, 26. 3. Thou wilt keepe him in perfect peace,
whose minde is stayed (as a house holden up by a proppe) on
thee, Psalme</hi> 112. He that feareth the Lord, is not afraid of
ill tidings <hi>because his heart is fixed: Samuch Libbo, leaning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41754:16"/>
on the Lord;</hi> and beleeving is not simply in the word, a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
credit to God, in what hee saith; but it is when men
put their weight on God, as <hi>Esay, 10 20. The residue of
Israel shall leane upon the Lord, the Holy one of Israel:</hi> and
so is the word, <hi>Micah. 3. 11. They leane upon the Lord, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Is not the Lord amongst us?</hi> and faith is termed, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi>
11. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>the substance of things
hoped for:</hi> some doe not ill expound it to bee the pillar and
ground-stone of the soule, in expecting good from God; and
so is it <hi>the buckler of faith, Ephes.</hi> 6. 16. and these two
words say, that Faith is a most valiant Souldier, which yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to that which commeth against it, but that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever,
when hee is killed and fallen, doth still stand and
live. <hi>Doeg</hi> is thus made a wicked man, <hi>Psalme 52. 7.
Loe this is the man that made not God his strength; Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huzzo,
his fortitude,</hi> saith <hi>Jerome;</hi> and in the matter of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
assent to truthes. Consider in this comparison, how
Faith layeth it selfe upon God: There bee six men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
to die for treason; the King sendeth a sealed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
to one, all the sixe reade the pardon, and all believe
it is the true deed of the Prince, but five of them doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
it with sorrow, and no love to the Prince, because
their names are not in the pardon; but the pardoned man
beleeveth it, not onely as true, but his heart cleaveth to it
with a heate and warmenesse of soule resting upon the
grace of the Prince: So doth the believer thrust his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ, and his free grace, and hath a soule-kindenesse to
the promises, when hee heareth them, which is not in
these, who onely take the word as true, <hi>Canticles, 8. 5.
Who is she that cometh upout of the Wildernesse associating,
or neighboureth her selfe upon her well-beloved?</hi> Faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
Christ a neighbour and a companion to the soule, and
therefore here must bee an Application of the heart to God
in Christ.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Assertion.</hi> Some even deserted and missing the Lord
to their feeling, may, and doe apply him to themselves,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41754:16"/>
as their owne Lord. <hi>Psalme 22. 1. My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me? Canticles 5. 6. I opened to my well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
and my well-beloved had withdrawne himselfe;</hi> then a
<hi>God hiding himselfe,</hi> and withdrawing his felt love to my
faith, may be my God. <hi>Esay 49. 14. Zion saith, My Lord
hath forgotten me:</hi> so <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> saith, <hi>Iohn 20. 13.
They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they
have laid him:</hi> then hee may be a forgetting and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
Lord to my feeling, and yet to my faith also my
Lord; as though I were in Hell and Christ in Heaven, I
may beleeve and apprehend the relation standing to mee,
as the wife may beleeve that the angry and the forsaking
husband is still her husband; Gods glooming some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
doth not breake the relation of a Lord or Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
to mee, no not in my apprehension and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Assertion.</hi> To beleeve that God is my Lord, who
from eternitie did chuse mee, and of intention sent
Christ to die for mee, is not essentiall to saving faith; for
the doubtings of many beleevers who dare not say (hee
is my God) and yet dare not renounce God, or give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their claime and interest in Christ, doth evidence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly
that such doubting ones doe also beleeve, though
they cannot beleeve so much as appropriation of Christ as
proper possession. Hence two cases they be in, who thus
doubt.</p>
            <p>1. They beleeve but in the darke; <hi>They stay on Jehovah,
and yet see no light, Esay</hi> 50. 10. as children say their lesson
sometimes without their booke, and as those who are in
the darke make their hands serve for their eyes, and grope
with their hands stretched out, when they cannot see with
their eyes.</p>
            <p>2. They be ready to halfe the Covenant, and to divide
it betwixt God and their soules, and beleeve God to bee a
father, and yet dare not say they are Gods sonnes: so the
Prodigall divideth, as it were, the relation of a father,
from the relation of a sonne, which is the bad Logicke
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41754:17"/>
of unbeleefe, <hi>Luke 15. 18. I will arise and go to my Father,
and say, Father, I have sinned against thee;</hi> then hee belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him with a broken and halting faith to bee his Father,
yet his petition, saith hee, did not fully beleeve himselfe
to bee a sonne, and therefore hee craveth a place in the
house inferiour to a sonne, <hi>ver. 19. Make me as one of thy hired
servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other question is, What warrant hath any weake
doubter to beleeve that God is his God in Christ? And
there bee two grounds on which the doubt is bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>1. No man knoweth whether he be elected or reprobated,
when he is first charged to beleeve.</p>
            <p>2. The Lord is not really <hi>(a parte rei)</hi> the God and the
Lord of the thousand part, who heareth the Gospel, and
are condemned, <hi>because they beleeve not on the onely begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Sonne of God:</hi> I set downe these Assertions for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Assertion.</hi> The question is often, not so much whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a poore soule would have Christ or no, (for there is
no question of that) as if hee would have Christ to bee
his God, in his owne legall way, that is, if hee would
first be holy and worthy, and then take Christ for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Assertion.</hi> Gods Decree of Election, or his intention
to save me, is not the proper object of my Faith, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of my sense and feeling: wee goe mightily beside the
line, in the method of beleeving, when we goe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
at first Gods intention to save me: The order is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humbled for sinne, wee are to adhere to the goodnesse
of the promise, not to looke to his intention to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but to his complacencie and tendernesse of heart
to all humble sinners: So <hi>Paul, 1 Tim.</hi> 1. 15. embraceth
by all meanes that good and faithfull saying, <hi>Iesus Christ
came to save sinners;</hi> before he put himselfe in as the first
of these sinners, as the condemned man beleeveth first the
Kings grace and clemencie to all humbled supplicants,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41754:17"/>
who sueth for grace, before hee beleeve grace to himselfe;
and if this were not, the method of applying Christ
were unreasonable. The woman diseased with the bloudy
issue, <hi>heard of Jesus,</hi> and therefore came and touched the
hemme of his garment: What had she heard? nothing of
his exorable kindnesse and tender mercy towards her selfe,
but towards others, and upon this beleeved; so a Rope is
cast downe in the Sea to a multitude of drowned men,
and all are bidden, for their life, lay hold on the Rope,
that they may be saved; it were unseasonable and foolish
curiositie for any of these poore men, now upon death
and life, commanded to hold fast the Rope, to dispute
whether did the man, who cast downe the Rope, intend
and purpose to save me, or not, and while my minde be
at a point in that, I will not put out one finger to touch
the Rope: but foole, dispute with hands and armes, and
lay hold on the remedy, and doe not thou begin a plea
with Christ, and leave that question to another time. A
Prince proclaimeth a free market of gold, moneyes, fine
linnen, rich garments, and all precious Jewels, to a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of poore men, upon a purpose to enrich some few men,
whom of grace he purposeth to make honourable Courtiers
and Officers of Estate; all these men are now not to dispute
the Kings secret purpose, but to repaire to the market, and
to improve their Princes grace, and buy without money.
Christ holdeth forth his Rope to drowned and lost sinners,
and layeth out an open market of the rich treasures of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
doe thou take it for granted, without any further
dispute, as a principle after to be made good, that Christ
hath thoughts of grace and peace concerning thee, and
doe but now husband well the grace offered, lay hold on
Christ aye while he put thee away from him, and if there
be any question concerning Gods intention of saving thee,
let Christ first move the doubt, but doe not thou be the first
mover.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Assertion.</hi> It is true, your Christian name, <hi>John, Peter,
Anne, Mary,</hi> are not in the New Testament, but here is as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:41754:18"/>
good and better, and a more individuall designation then
your Christian name, if thou bring sinne with thee to
Christ, and there be no man but hee hath this name, bring
a lost soule with thee. <hi>Luke 19. 10. The sonne of man
came to seeke and to save that which was lost. Matthew</hi> 9. 13.
Christ saith, <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to repentance.</hi> Then if it be said, <hi>What is thy name, who
layest hold on Christ?</hi> there is an answer, <hi>My name is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi>
2. Leave, behinde thee, righteousnesse when thou
commest to Christ, thou mayest easily leave true righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
behinde thee, and come without it, because true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
of thy owne is a <hi>non-ens,</hi> and just nothing, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is the proper heritage of the poore; bring want and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie
with thee, and there is another name, say, Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
my name is not in the royall promise of grace made to
Traitours and Rebels against the Crowne of Heaven, but
my name is povertie, they call me want and necessitie; and
all men hitherto hath these two names, <hi>sinners, poore and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous;</hi>
but three bring some feeling and sense; come wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
and laden, and then thou hast a third name. This is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
yet it is amongst the most easie things required of thee;
the Law which worketh (if it were felt and heard) will
worke this in thee, and though then thou want it, thou hast
that which is nearest to it, even sinne; for these two be of one
bloud almost, to wit, <hi>want of cloathing, and nakednesse, a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
load, and a wearied body;</hi> and nakednesse is a neare friend
to shame and cold, and povertie is very neare of kindred to
hunger; hunger is come of that same stocke and house; and if
thou canst say, <hi>O Physician Iesus, my right name is sicknesse; O
rich Iesus, they call me want; O bread of life, they call me hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;</hi>
it is enough.</p>
            <p>Object. 1. But it is not faith, but presumption, for mee, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a warrant, and without law or right, to beleeve in a God,
who was indeed <hi>Daniels</hi> God, but not mine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Presumption is a sister to Pride; if thou be
wearied and laden, thou cannot readily be proud. 2. Thou
askest a warrant of Law to beleeve in Christ. I answer by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41754:18"/>
another question: What Law or Warrant have countrey
beggers to cry for Almes at the hands of the rich? often
Acts of Parliament and Lawes are against begging. What
Warrant or Law have they to begge? Let the begger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
it himselfe. <hi>I have no Law</hi> (hee can answer) <hi>but
I am poore, I have nothing, and I cannot steale, I cannot
starve;</hi> so by the Law of want thou restest upon Jesus Christ;
I want all things, Christ hath all things, and wanteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and this is as good as any act of Parliament in the
world.</p>
            <p>Object. 2. Daniel was one of the righteous men on earth;
Noah, Iob, and Daniel, were none-suches, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Cart wheele moveth, because it is round,
not that it may bee round, but the sinner doth not beleeve,
because he is righteous, but that hee may bee righteous; it
were a wicked faith, and it were to beleeve treacherously, to
beleeve, because you are holy, or as holy as <hi>Daniel;</hi> faiths
bottome is want, sinne, damnation; and the Kingdome of
beleevers is but (as we say) a nest of beggers.</p>
            <p>Object. 3. But if I were worthy to believe and rely upon
Christ, I should then come to him with some boldnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is the Papists merit of congruitie, that wee
will not come to Christ while wee have an hire, and it is
seeming humilitie, but reall pride: I will not come to
Christs Market, <hi>without money;</hi> you will not come to the
fountaine, while your thirst bee quenched, nor to him who
can give you fine gold, and fine linnin, while first you bee
rich and well cloathed, and that is cursed righteousnesse,
and unholy holinesse, that any soule getteth out of another
then Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Object. 4. But if I cannot come to Christ without sense of
sinne and povertie, then is my coming and my act of beleeving
founded and bottomed upon something that I have before I
come to Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is the question betwixt us and <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
like the very question betwixt us and Papists concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the authority of the Scripture: but I say, as the Churches
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41754:19"/>
authoritie is not the formall reason why I believe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to bee the Word of God, yet the Churches autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is not excluded from being a meane and motive;
for, <hi>Romanes</hi> Chapter 10. verse 17. <hi>Faith commeth by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
so Christ himselfe is the formall reason of my Faith, I
rest on Christ, because hee is Christ: sense of poverty is
a strong motive, for except I bee driven and compelled to
come to Christ, I shall never come; sense of povertie is
not the foundation of the wall, yet it may bee a pinning in
the wall.</p>
            <p>Antinomians <hi>teach,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>D. Tobias Crisp.</hi> Christ exalted, Serm. 15. Serm. 16. Serm. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> inherent qualifications and all
workes of sanctification are but doubtfull evidences to us of
our interest in Christ, or that wee are in the state of grace.
<hi>What then maketh mee,</hi> Iohn, Anne, <hi>by name, sure in my
conscience that I am in Christ, even to the full removall of
all heart-questions?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which revealeth <hi>(say they)</hi> my evidence of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that I am my well-beloveds, and that he is mine, is the
Spirit speaking personally and particularly to my heart with
a voyce, Sonne, be of good cheare, thy sinnes are forgiven thee;
and this is that broad Seale of the Spirit making an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
impression on my heart, without any begged testimony of
workes of sanctification, which is the revealing evidence of
my interest in Christ; and the receiving evidence is Faith,
believing this testimony of the Spirit, onely because Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
saith so, not because I have evidences, by particular works
of sanctification, such as are universall obedience, sinceritie
of heart, and love of the brethren.</p>
            <p>But to speake a little of this for the times; The Papist is
the blacke Devill, taking away all certainty of assurance
that wee are in Christ, or that any man can know this.
The <hi>Antinomian</hi> is the Golden white Devill; a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Hell cloathed with all Heaven, and the notions of
Free Grace: and first, the Well-head of all is, Free Grace
in us is a dreame, Sanctification inherent is a fiction, Christ
is all, there is no Grace existent in the crearure, Grace is all
in Christ, and nothing but imputed righteousnesse, for if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41754:19"/>
works of sanctification be not marks intelligible, or which can come
in under the capacity of received light, to be known with any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
or assurance. 1. The joy and rejoycing that wee have in the
the testimony of a good conscience, that <hi>in simplicity and godly sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,
not with fleshly wisedome, but by the grace of God, we have our
conversation in the World,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12. must be a dream. <hi>David, Job,
Moses, Samuel,</hi> the Prophets and Apostles, their joying in a good
conscience, arise from doubtfull and conjecturall evidences: yea, no
man can say in any assurance, <hi>(I beleeve in Christ,) (in the inner man,
I delight in the Law of the Lord,) (I am crucified to the world,) (my
conversation is in Heaven)</hi> for all these are inherent qualifications
in the childe of God, but they are doubtfull and uncertain. How then
hath God promised to love the righteous, to reward beleeving with
life eternall, to give the prize to him that runneth? &amp;c. 2. <hi>The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit bearing witnesse to our spirit, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, Rom.</hi> 8. 16. is in this sence an immediate act of the Spirit,
because reflex acts of the soul are performed without any other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
or means, but that whereby the direct acts are performed: I
know that I know; I know that I beleeve; my sence by that same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
operation of the Spirit, by the which I know God without
any other light, teacheth me to know that I know God: even as by
light I see colours, but my common sense needeth not another Sun,
or another light, to make me know that I see colours. The Lambe
when it seeth a Wolfe, though it never did see a Wolfe before,
knoweth it to be an enemy, and fleeth: but to make it know that it
knoweth the Wolfe, there is nothing required but the internall and
common instinct of nature: So when I beleeve in Christ, that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
instinct of the grace of God, actuated and stirred up by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, maketh me know that I know God; and that I beleeve,
and so that I am in Christ to my own certain feeling and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
but this doth not hinder, but the assurance of my interest in
Christ is made evident to me by other inferiour evidences, 1 Joh. 2. 3
<hi>And hereby we know, that we know him, if we keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
By the keeping of Gods Commandements we doe not know
simply that we know God by certainty of faith: But wee know that
we know God these two wayes: 1. We know (the instinct of the
new man being stirred up to action by that winde which bloweth
when and where it listeth) our knowing of God to bee sound
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41754:20"/>
saving, and true. Wee doe not so much know our knowing of God,
by this supernaturall sense, as we know the supernaturall qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and sincerity of our knowing of God. So that we rather know
the qualification of the act, that <hi>the worke is done according to God,</hi>
then the act according to its substance, though wee doe also know it
in this relation, 1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 14. We know that we have passed from death
to life, because we love the brethren:</hi> that is, our love to the brethren
doth evidence to us, both that wee are translated to the Kingdome of
grace, and also it doth evidence that that translation is reall, true,
sincere, sound and effectuall by love, and all the fruits of the Spirit.
2. By these works of sanctification we have evidence that we have
interest in Christ, not as by former light, suggesting to us that the
immediate impression of this great and broad Seale of the King of
glory, and his personall and particular testimony is true; (for Gods
Spirit needeth not another witnesse to adde authority to what hee
saith,) but because this conclusion, <hi>(Thou Iohn, Anna, hast interest to
Christ to thy owne feeling)</hi> must be proved by Scripture (except
with Enthusiasts and fanatick Spiritualists wee separate the Word
and the Spirit) therefore these workes of sanctification prove the
conclusion <hi>consequenter</hi> by Scripture and sence, and so lead us to the
word of promise, thus to prove this conclusion, <hi>(I Iohn, Peter, Anna,</hi>
have interest in Christ, to my owne reflect, and private assurance;)
the major proposition is made good by Scripture; the Assumption by
sense; and the conclusion leadeth us to the certainty of faith in the
promises: as,</p>
            <p>He that beleeveth, and maketh sure his beliefe, by walking not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh, but after the Spirit, hath a cleare evidence to his owne
feeling, that he hath interest in Christ.</p>
            <p>But I Iohn, Peter, Anna, doe believe, and doe make sure my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,
by walking not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</p>
            <p>Therefore I Iohn, Peter, Anna have a cleare evidence to my owne
feeling, that I have interest in Christ.</p>
            <p>The proposition is Scripture, <hi>Iohn 3. 36. Ioh. 5. 24. Ioh. 11. 25, 26.
Rom. 8. 1, 2. 1 Ioh. 1. 4. 1 Ioh.</hi> 2. 3. The Assumption is made sure by
sense, not at all times, but when the wind is fair, and the Spirit is
breathing upon the soul; for though I do believe and walk after the
Spirit, yet to my owne feeling I have onely evidence of my interest
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Christ, when the Spirit stirreth up my sense to compare my
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41754:20"/>
saith, and walking with the promises of God in Christ: But saith the
Antinomians, <hi>Alas, all the certainty then, and the whole personal evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that I have to know that I have interest in Christ, is ultimately
and principally resolved on this weak &amp; rotten foundation, to wit, On
my own good works, which being examined by the law of God, will be
found so sinful as they shal involve me under the curse of God, &amp; so the
debate of conscience shal stand in ful vigor, &amp; I shal never be satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily
resolved of my interest in Christ: for you lead me from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of the immediate seal of the spirit to my good works; &amp; this is
to drive me off Christ, and put me back again to my old Jaylor and my
old keeper the law.</hi> But I answer, this consequence is just nothing: for
if my good works of sanctification were causes of my peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
this connexion had some colour of truth; but though those
works be sinfull by concomitance, because sin cleaveth to them, yet
because my supernaturall sense of the Spirit suggesteth that these
works are the fruits of faith, and are done in some measure of sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and flow not from the spirit of the Law, but from the Spirit of the
Gospel: therefore they lead me to Christ, and drive me upon a
cleare Evangelick promise, That 1. the adhering sinfulnesse of my
workes are purged in Christs bloud. 2. That this promise is a shoare
before mine eyes. <hi>He that fighteth the good fight of faith, a Crown
of righteousnesse is laid up for him,</hi> 2 Tim. 4, 7, 8. <hi>He that runneth,
shall obtain,</hi> 1 Cor. 9. 24. And here is an Evangelick word, <hi>Revel.
22. 14. Blessed are they that do his Commandements, that they may
have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates to
the City.</hi> So that the right of your peace and clear evidence, in as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of your right to the Tree of life, is not laid upon your works,
but upon the promises of the Gospel: onely your inherent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
leadeth you as a morall motive to looke to the promises of
God, which is the bottome and the foundation of your peace; even
as my walking, eating, drinking, may assure me I am a living man;
and from the knowledge that I live, I come to know what I stand in
relation to the King, as a sonne and an heire of a Crowne; yet my
right to the Crowne (suppose I were the eldest sonne of a King)
standeth not on this pillar, that I eat and drink and live, but upon
my birth and my relation to such a father. All my inherent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
doe well prove that the tree and stock they grow on, is
faith; but is it hence proved that the Tree is bottomed upon the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41754:21"/>
branches? nay, but by the contrary, the branches are stocked upon
the Tree.</p>
            <p>3. If workes of sanctification be no sure markes of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ, because sinne adhereth to them, and the sinne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
to them, involveth me in condemnation; then neither can
faith in Christ be a sure marke of my interest in Christ, because
faith is alwayes mixed with sinfull doubting: for I do not thinke
that <hi>Antinomians</hi> do beleeve with all their heart; and sinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe
adhering to our faith no lesse involveth the sinner in a curse,
being commited against the Gospel, then sinnes against the Law.
And therefore as faith justifieth, not because great and perfect, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
lively &amp; true, as the palsie hand of a man may receive a summe
of gold, no lesse then a strong and healthy arme; so also doe our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
workes of sanctification give us evidences that we are in
Christ, and so lead us to the promises of the Gospel, as signes, not
causes of our interest in Christ, and that under this notion; because
they are sincerely performed, not because they are perfect and
without all contagion of sin cleaving to them.</p>
            <p>4. In exalting Christs righteousnesse one way, by making Christ
all, they make Christ nothing another way, by vilifying the glory of
sanctifying grace; for we are not by good workes to make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and election sure to our selves, and in the evidence of our
owne consciences, if our good workes be no signes of our interest
in Christ.</p>
            <p>5. The spirit which these men make the onely witnesse, must be
knowne to us by Scripture, not to be a deluding spirit: for if this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
cannot be knowne by these things which are called, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5. 22.
the fruits of the spirit, to wit, <hi>by love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
goodnesse, faith, meeknesse, temperance:</hi> as the fruits are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of the life of the tree, men are to labour for faith, and the
raptures, impressions, and immediate and personall influence of a
Spirit from Heaven, without any conscience of holy living; and this
is the path-way for men void of all sanctification and inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
to beleeve they are in Christ. So the Divell putteth upon
holinesse, inherent and constant walking with God, the foule scandall
of faire white civility, and market morality, that so men may walk
after the flesh, and beleeve the testimony of the broad Seale of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
working Spirit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:41754:21"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But what be these which goe before faith in Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Sense of sinne. 2. Halfe an hope, &amp;c. What if I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out upon Jesus Christ for my life? he is called a Saviour, a Prince
of much tendernesse of grace. 3. The soule is first put to <hi>What shall
I doe?</hi> Luke 16. 3. 4. It is put to an halfe prising of Christ, and to
some raw wishes to have Jesus Christ, but otherwise no man can
prize Christ, but he who hath him already. However, we have in all
this an advantage of our adversaries the Papists now in Armes, they
call faith and resting on God as our God, Pride: as if it were pride
for the drowned man to flee to the rocke, and pride for the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to cry, O my Physician help. Yet doe Papists really cry, O
my Idol, awake; O my god of bread, heare; O my intercessour
<hi>Mary,</hi> answer me: But be not afraid of their gods: Nor are we to
feare their prayers to Saints, or the Cavailiers Fridayes fasting. But
we are to learne how in time of need to make use of faith; and <hi>let
Israel trust in the Lord,</hi> he is an hiding place and a covering in the
ill day: and let the weake soule that findeth nothing but darknesse,
wants, feares, from that flee to Christ: bleeding of wounds is here
preparatory to beleeving: Want is beginning of motion; let it be
made a motive of beleeving: the lesse evidence, let adherence be the
stronger.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The God of Daniel.]</hi> The History maketh it most evident, that
<hi>Daniels</hi> God, and his Honour and Court, both were aimed at, to be
laid on the dust by his enemies. Here <hi>Daniels</hi> name goeth through,
verse 25. <hi>all people, nations, languages, that dwell on all the earth,</hi> and
<hi>the God of Daniel is exalted.</hi> Hence observe, first, how <hi>God bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
right precisenesse and strictnesse in his way. Moses</hi> standeth by
this (not an hoofe) and he obtaineth his end, God bringeth him
and Israel out of Egypt. <hi>Mordecai</hi> not halfe a legge to <hi>Haman,</hi>
and hee is promoted to great honour. What lost they ever, who
stood upon the latitude of an haire for Christ? either they gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both life and Gods Cause, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did here, and Jesus
Christ, who died, but put his life in pawne three dayes, and tooke
it up againe and gained the Cause; or if they lost their lives, they
gained the Cause, as the Martyrs of Christ: and therefore let not
the Saints beare the name of Precisians, except in an heavenly
sense, because they <hi>walke precisely,</hi> Ephes. 5. 15. These be the right
Precisians who contend for substance, for God, for Heaven, for the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41754:22"/>
purity of the Gospel. And certainly God is not a thing indifferent,
and excellent Jesus Christ is no circumstance; but those be damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Precisians who contend for feathers, and things indifferent. Now
Court-favour of Princes, this clay-world, honour, ease, are really in
their nature things indifferent, and being compared with Christ
(and Christ is no trifle, but all substance) are lesse then things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
even toyes, shadows, losse, dung; therefore the Malignants who
make this choice, are the Precisians.</p>
            <p>2. Obser. <hi>How God disappointeth all the purposes of his enemies,
and honoureth those who feare him,</hi> and maketh <hi>Daniel</hi> evidently
known to be the true Royalist: and observe how the enemies must be
disappointed: how can it be otherwayes? for first, they take two
crosse wayes to compasse their end: First, sinfull meanes; there is no
way for the Princes of Zoan to come by their ends but idolatry: surely
they are fooles, and drunken men staggering in their vomit, <hi>Isa.</hi> 19.
11, 14. and the adversaries now finde no better means to set up their
Idol-god in Brittaine, and their abominable Masse, then after they
have made the Prince glad with their lies, to kill and destroy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
and devour and eat up the Lords people as bread. Secondly,
they set the policie of hell against the wisedome of God: hence so
many plots, first to divide, then to seduce; so many lies and perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in print, and all with this profession, To defend <hi>the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion:</hi> But surely hee hath a strong Metaphysicall faith,
more subtill then solid, who beleeveth that an army of Papists, led on
by the rules of Jesuits, and helped by the forces of the Irish Rebels,
have a minde to defend the true Protestant Religion: I hope never
to beleeve it. Yet as God disappointed <hi>Daniels</hi> enemies, so are they
mis-led in all their purposes: God hath alwayes done this. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of God and a good Cause, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7. 14. is with childe, but the
Justice of God is Godfather, and giveth the name of the childe, it is
named, <hi>A lie: behold, he travelleth with iniquity, and hath conceived
mischief:</hi> and the birth, when it is borne, is no King, no God, <hi>hee
bringeth forth a lie: Esay 33. 11. Ye shall conceive chaffe:</hi> and the
childe is a monstrous bastard, a childe of straw and stubble: <hi>and ye
shall bring forth stubble: Iob 15. 35. They conceive mischiefe, and
bring forth vanity.</hi> There is a long web now in weaving in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and many hands spin threds to the web, as England, Scotland,
Ireland, Rome, Italy, France, Spaine, Denmarke, Papists, Jesuits, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41754:22"/>
Princes, Pope, Prelates, Politicians: and Jehovah the Lord
hath an hand eminently in the contexture; and almost all (except
the Lord and his Church) have sundry ends, therefore they weave in
threeds of sundry colours, Babylon, Rome, and Papists are for their
idolatry set up in Britaine: God hath broken that threed once, twice,
but they cast new knots, and doe still spinne and weave Prelates
ends with shouting, and garments rolled in blood <hi>(let our great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana
stand)</hi> the honour, the bellies of fourteen, and twenty and sixe
must bee defended by the sword, and the blood of the Church of
Christ. God hath often broken their threed: Ireland hath no end
but that their Babel shall be built again with blood, and their hearts
like a piece of the nether milstone are grinding blood and revenge;
this end must fall. The Politician and Malignants end is the world,
and the glory of Court, and their glory is very lean: Princes weave
in their threed, to set up their absolute and independent soveraignty,
and if any more be intended, God knoweth; but by the wooll wee
may judge of the web. But when all is done in this long and great
web, though the enemies black policy bee transparent and sevved
vvith vvhite threed: heare the conclusion of all, <hi>Psal. 33. 10. The
Lord bringeth the counsell of the heathen to nought, he maketh the
devices of the people of none effect. 11. (But) the counsell of the Lord
standeth for ever.</hi>

so far are we to have high &amp; noble thoughts, and suteable expressions
of God;</hi> hence are vve Christians far more to think and speak of God; and that upon these grounds,
Because he is

            <p>1. The notion; and that great thing God is admirable. God wil say
no more to put <hi>Abraham</hi> upon a course of contentment, when he had
the spoil of the Kings of Sodome, and to set him in a way of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but <hi>Gen. 17. 1. I am God all-sufficient,</hi> and goodnes &amp; mercy are
included in the very essence of God, <hi>Hos. 11. 9. I will not execute the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41754:23"/>
fiercenesse of my wrath against Ephraim: for I am God, and not
man.</hi> And he saith no more in the Covenant, and it is much and all.
<hi>I will be your God;</hi> for if you say God, you say all that can be said.</p>
            <p>2. For greatnes any way, he is above all; heare what <hi>Zophar</hi> saith,
<hi>Job. 11. 7. Canst thou by searching finde out God? canst thou finde
out the Almighty unto perfection? 8. It is high as Heaven, what
canst thou doe? deeper then hell, what canst thou know? 9. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
thereof longer then the Earth, and broader then the Sea.</hi> 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the supreame absolute Soveraignty that hee hath over Heaven
and Earth; what created royalty is in the pieces of Clay, who carry
diadems of clay on their heads, is eminently in him, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> is
but King of some Kings; but God is absolutely the supreame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
Superiour, Landlord and King of Kings, and of all Kings and
<hi>Lord of Lords, Ahashuerosh</hi> sent his royall mandates through an
hundred and twenty seven Provinces: hee sendeth his Officers of
the state of Heaven, his Angels, through his Monarchy of Heaven
and Earth, and they <hi>fulfill his will, Psal.</hi> 103. 20. He sendeth his Sea-posts,
stormy winds to destroy Armado's, and <hi>to breake the ships of
Tarshish, Psal. 30. verse 4. The Lord is great, and greatly to be
praysed, he is to be feared above all Gods.</hi> And wee put him out of
his Throne, when we appoint Peeres to sit and give Counsell, and
make Lawes with this highest Lord; make a Throne of glory the
height of thousand thousand millions of Heaven of Heavens, and set
that Throne above the circumference of all these Heavens; set
Worlds of Angels and millions of Seraphims, or if there be created
Arch-Angells, and thousand thousands of Dominions, Thrones,
and Principalities, as servants under the foot-stoole of his Throne,
yet hee were set too low; hee deserveth a Throne above that
Throne.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Consider his gracious nature. 1. How tender hearted to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
people,</hi> Jud. 10. 16. The Lords soul was grieved for the misery
of Israel, Jer. 31. 20. Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant childe?
for since I did speake against him, I doe earnestly remember him, my
bowels are troubled for him, I will surely have mercy on him, saith
the Lord? <hi>What tendernesse! O what compassion in the heart of
an infinite God!</hi> Psal. 147. 3. The Lord healeth the broken in heart,
he bindeth up their wounds. <hi>O how softly and compassionately doth
his heavenly hand put in joynt the bones of a broken heart? his Son
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41754:23"/>
Christ hath a roome in his heart for the Lambes which are not
able to go there alone, Esai.</hi> 40. 11. He shall gather the Lambs with his
arms, he shall carry them in his bosome.</p>
            <p>4. He is (Psal. 13. 1. <hi>Clothed with glory,</hi> Psal. 104. 1. <hi>Clothed with
honour and majesty. 2. Covered</hi> with light (uncreated light) <hi>as with
a garment.</hi> How dear must every yard of that garment be? poor earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Kings ride upon horses of flesh; <hi>He rode upon a Cherub, and did
flie upon the wings of the winde,</hi> Psal. 18. 10. Nor is he then upon his
highest horse, he can ride higher then <hi>on the wings of the winde,</hi>
Psal. 104. 3. Psal. 18. 10. Kings of Clay have their Tents on the cold
Earth: He maketh dark Clouds his pavilion: It should kill the holiest
on earth to see one glimpse of his glory.</p>
            <p>5. What beauty must be in this Lord? Angels and glorified soules
are not able to look off his Face for all eternity, Mat. 18. 10. Revel.
22. 3. Esai. 24. 23. <hi>The Moone shall be confounded, and the Sun asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
when the Lord of Hosts shall reigne in Mount Zion, and in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
before his ancients gloriously.</hi> He must be a fair Lord when the
fair Sun blusheth, and is ashamed to appeare and shine before him.
Nothing <hi>David</hi> desired in this side of time, but <hi>to dwell all the dayes
of his life in the house of the Lord, and behold the beauty,</hi> (the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
increated beauty) <hi>of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 27. 3. Put all the imaginable
colours of the Firmament, Of the morning skie, Of all the Lillies
and Roses of the Earth, which surpasse <hi>Salomons</hi> royalty, in
one; Imagine a Rose to bee of the quantity of the Earth, all
these should be but created shadowes to him, <hi>Zach. 9. 17. How
great is his goodnesse?</hi> how great is his beauty? he is both good
and fair.</p>
            <p>6. Who can speak of omnipotence and boundlesse power in God,
Esai. 40. 12. <hi>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand,
and meted out Heaven with a span, and comprehended the dust of the
Earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in Scales, and the hils
in Ballance?</hi> there is but one in all the World, and from eternity
to eternity never was there any save one who can do all this. What
fingers be those, which at one time are in the furthest borders of the
Eastern Heaven, and of the Western Heaven? ver. 15. <hi>Behold the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are as a drop of a bucket, and are compted as the small dust of the
ballance, behold he takes up the Iles as a very little thing.</hi> And he can
take up the whole Ile of Brittain in his hand, &amp; can hang the weight
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41754:24"/>
of the massie body of Heaven and Earth on the top of his finger, who
is he who hangeth the Earth, yea, the whole world upon nothing?
what hindreth, (seeing there be such Broyles, Tumults, Motions in
Heaven, Earth, and Hell) but this great huge vessel of the great All,
this whole world should fall to the one side and break? but omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence
holdeth it up: who hath Arms to spread a web of black
darknesse from the East to the West? Esai. 50. 3. <hi>I cloath the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
with blacknesse, and I make sackcloth their covering;</hi> and alas, all
that I say here is nothing; it must be true here, <hi>praestat tacere quam
pauca discere;</hi> better be silent in so great a matter, as speak little.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> is, To teach us not to be in love with the creature, or with
men. What is man, but a weeping, groning, dying, nothing? Esai. 40.
17. <hi>All Nations are before God as nothing and lesse then nothing, and
vanity.</hi> VVhat is nothing? it is the least thing that can be, but (I pray
you) what is lesse then nothing? nothing can be lesse then nothing,
but all Nations being compared with God evanish infinite miles,
out of the world of some things: and if one man be nothing, nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men, and nations of nations are nothing: multiply Cyphers
to millions of millions, they cannot make a number, because every
Cypher is nothing, and therefore the product must be nothing; so
multiply infinitely Nations, let Spaine, France, Italy, Ireland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
and what the power of men can make, the product shall be
nothing. Millions and Hosts of men are millions and Hosts of
vanities, God is all, and in infinite all, and what can we do to make
him lovely and desirable. We may preach this admirable Lord, but
we shall never out-preach him; and praise him, but shall never out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praise
him, his favour is more to be sought then favour of Kings, he
is more to be feared then Kings, Esai. 5 12. <hi>I, even I, am the Lord, the
Lord that comforteth you: Who art thou that shouldest be afraid of a
man, that shall die, and of the Son of man that shall be made as grasse?</hi>
Hence are you to see to the prerogative royall of the King, but more
to the prerogative royal of the Prince of the Kings of the Earth: And
therefore, O Judges be wise: O all you who carry on your heads,
Diadems, and royall Crowns of yellow dust, and glistering clay, I
meane of gold and precious stones, stoope, stoope before this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
cast down your Crownes and Scepters at the feet of the
King of Kings: Know your Superiour the highest Land-lord of dying
Monarchies, <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 12. It is said, <hi>The Lord shall inherit</hi> Judah, <hi>and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:41754:24"/>
shall chuse</hi> Jerusalem: O but Kings and Dominions who keep Judah
captive, cry out with a shout, Judah shall serve us, and our King, and
Jesus Christ shall not raigne over us: but there is a royal Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given with an, ô yes, from his palace of glory, <hi>who inhabiteth
Eternity,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Be silent, O all flesh, before the Lord.</hi> So Psal. 2. 2. Jew
and Gentile are upon foot raging, and consulting with all, <hi>Let us break
his bands and cast his cords from us;</hi> nay <hi>v.</hi> 6. one who is not on foot, but
sitteth in Heaven, laughing, not troubling himselfe with the Tumults
of clay-nothings, sent out a princely mandate! <hi>I have set my King
upon my holy Hill of Zion:</hi> I have put the Crown on Christs head,
what men of dust and ashes shall pull it off his head? Psal. 46. 9.
<hi>He breaketh the Bow, and cutteth the Spear, he burneth the Chariots
in the fire.</hi> The heathen cannot endure this, they flie on armies, and cry
with a shout, He shal not break our Bowes, He shal not burne our
Chariots with fire; therefore a royal Commandment and Decree
cometh out, v. 10. <hi>Be still, and know that I am God, I will be exalted
above the heathen, I will be exalted on Earth.</hi> He is crying, O
Rome: O Spaine: O Ireland: O Kings, and powers of the world,
O Babylon, Lady of Nations: O Pope and Cardinals hold your
peace, speak no more, Esai. 46. 13. <hi>I bring near my Righteousnesse,
it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry, and I will place
salvation in Zion, for Israel, (for Brittain) my glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Vse</hi> is, To bring hearts in a fervour and sicknes of love with God,
and make us mould higher and more Majestick thoughts and conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions
of this most high Lord, then ordinarily we do; and therefore
consider, how inconsiderable &amp; incomprehensible he is. 2. Summon all
created glory before him, by way of comparison. 3. Look at him as the
last end. First then consider two words that <hi>Paul</hi> hath, Eph. 3. 18, 19.
<hi>That you may be able</hi> (it is his prayer) <hi>with all the Saints to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend,
what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, 19. And
to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge.</hi> Now from the
love of Christ you may take the measure, in some proportion, of this
great Lord himself: Then conceive a love higher then the Heaven
of Heavens, deeper then the Earth, broader then the Sea, yea broader
and longer then the circumference of the outmost shel, or orbe of the
Heaven of Heavens, that love should not passe knowledge; but seeing
I am warranted to speak of love according to dimensiones of Height,
Breadth, Depth, Length; But imagine, in the capacity of knowledge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41754:25"/>
and understanding, ten thousand millions of new created Heavens
and Worlds at the East end of this Heaven that now is, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
millions of new Worlds created at the West end of this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that now is, and let your knowledge run along to the North
and the South, and to the thirty two points of the foure Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
arches, here would be great Height, Length, Breadth, and
Depth of love; yet, I am sure, this love should not passe all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
for the understanding of man will go along through all these,
to multiply and multiply againe and againe, and yet all love within
knowledge, What then must himself be? if we could separate God
and Gods Love. Again, conceive so many multiplyed new Worlds,
new Heavens, new Earths, new Seas, new Forrests, Woods, Trees,
Reeds, Herbs, Grasse, Stones, and all the rest multiplyed; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
so many worlds of men and new created Angels, and let all
these millions of VVoods, Trees, Forrests, Herbs, Grasse, be all made
pens, and let all these thousands millions of new created Seas, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
Rivers, be all Ink; and all these thousands millions of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
yea of Heavens, Aire, Earth be paper, and let these thousands of
millions of men and Angels write Books and Psalms of praise of this
infinite and incomprehensible Lord, and let their wits be enlarged in
the capacity of so many thousand millions of degrees of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
above what they now have, according to the former multiplied
numbers, and let their wits for all eternity, conceive new expressions
and most heavenly conceptions of the infinite excellency, transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
glory, incomparable goodnesse, and matchlesse and boundlesse
highnesse, greatnesse, omnipotence of this never enough admired and
adored Lord, of this high and loftie one who inhabiteth eternity, and
yet all these should not passe knowledge; for you and I, and any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
understanding of no great capacity may know all this, and
therefore all these should not say any thing to expresse this Love and
this Lord who passeth all knowledge. O if we could be drawn to a
higher measure of Love, and to put a greater price on this Lord
then we do. 2. From this we may easily see the comparison betwixt
this Lord and Peers of created nothings: And if all Nations be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him as nothing, &amp; as lesse then nothing, as it is said by himself <hi>Es.</hi>
40. 17. Then say, O smal, base nothing of a Creature: O highest: O ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of all things in the Creator: O little and really small crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
O great and surpassing great, and incomparable Creator: O
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41754:25"/>
man, poor man, that living lie; and that dying and expiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
but O infinite all: O unspeakable and infinite glory of uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
being! O man, a breathing fable, a living and a laughing vanity:
O self-sufficient and al sufficient life of solid happinesse: O creature:
a dying vanity, and a weeping nothing, a nothing rejoycing,
eating, drinking, sighing, dying: O highest Creator: O eternity
of ever-living and ever-joying life: O self-living immortality of
endlesse and uncreated joy: O created sparkes, and poore drops
of creature-goodnesse, and creature-mercy: O Sea: O bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
world of worlds of infinite goodnesse, and bottom-lesse mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Creator of all things: O shamed and despised royaltie of
Princes of Earth and Clay: O never enough admired glory of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created
royaltie in the incomprehensible God! O fair Sun! O beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
Moone! but rather, O confounded and shamed Sunne and
Moon, <hi>Esa.</hi> 24. 23. and, O infinitely fair and glorious Lord who made
Sun and Moon: O pleasant Roses and Lillies: but, O pleasanter Lord
the Creator of Roses and Lillies: O mighty and powerfull Kings and
Emperours, but most mighty and matchlesse King of Kings: O foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
and unwise men: O unstedfast and changeable Angels: O Lord
there is no searching out of thy understanding: O unchangeable and
unmoveable mover of all things: O peeces of Breathing, Laughing,
and then dying Clay: O creature of yesterday, of the last by-past hour,
for the world is not of one weeks standing to him; seeing a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeers are to him as one day. But, O Lord, <hi>The ancient of dayes,</hi>
Daniel 7. 13. <hi>O Father of eternity,</hi> Esai. 9. 6. <hi>O King of ages,</hi> 1. Tim.
1. 17. And King of time: O weak men: O mightlesse and infirme
Heavens which shall wax old as a garment: O eternall Lord: O
what an Arme of omnipotency is in him, who shall with a shake of
his right Arme move the Heavens and loose all the fixed Stars, and
cause them to fall out of the Heaven, as Figs fall off a Fig-Tree sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with a mighty Winde, Revel. 6. 13. O all you created Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
and Orchards and Paradises, be ashamed, blush and hide your
selves beside the Tree of life, which beareth twelve manner of fruit
every moneth: Every Apple growing on this Lord who is the Tree
of life, is life eternall: O Gold: O Silver: O Rubies: O precious
Stones, much desired by <hi>Adams</hi> sonnes! What are you to him whose
City is fairer, Revel. 21. 18. <hi>And the building of the Wall was of Jas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the City was pure gold like unto clear glasse.</hi> He saith not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41754:26"/>
there was abundance of gold in the City, and multitudes of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
stones, but the City was all gold, and precious stones; a City
like Rome, Venetia, or Constantinople; in which, Timber, Wals,
Stones, Streets, &amp; all the buildings were nothing but precious stones
and gold, were admirable; O all fair Rivers and Seas, what are you
but pooles of dead water, being compared with <hi>a pure River of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of life, proceeding out of the Throne of God, and of the Lamb?</hi>
Rev. 22. 1. Every drop of that water is an heaven. O created wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloveds
you are black, and the Sun hath looked on you, when
you come out and stand beside the <hi>Standard bearer amongst ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,</hi>
Cant. 5. 10. Oh, who are sick of love for this Lord: O for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
leasure to look on him, to feast upon a sight of his Face: O
for the long summer-Day of endlesse ages to stand beside him and to
enjoy him! O time: O sin be removed out of the way: O Day:
O fairest of Dayes dawne: O morning of eternity break out, and arise,
that we may enjoy this incomprehensible Lord. And therefore, O
come out of the Creature. 3. Make not Clay and the Creature whose
mother is <hi>purum nihil,</hi> pure meere nothing, your last end; Alas,
make not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus a post-horse to ride your own
errands, or a Covenant with the most high Lord a Chariot and
Stirrop to mount upon the height of your carnall and Clay-projects:
this is, as if one should stop the entry of an Oven with a Kings robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royall.
Let God, onely God, be your last end.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>He is the living God]</hi> The words <hi>Chajah</hi> and <hi>Havah,</hi> to be, and
to live, are neere of kindred together, for living is the most excellent
being, and it is most agreeable to reason that JEHOVAH, who is
the first being, and hath being of himself, should be <hi>the living God.</hi>
And you do not finde man called <hi>living man,</hi> though man have a
life, as God is called <hi>the living God;</hi> he is <hi>the living God,</hi> because all
life is originally in him, Psal. 36. 9. <hi>With thee is the well of life,</hi> Joh.
1. 4. <hi>In him was life;</hi> all heat is orignally in fire, and in other things
at the second hand: all light originally in the Sun; and other things
have light by loane onely; and light in other things is from the
Sun by a sort of grace. 2. He is the <hi>living God,</hi> in opposition to
dead Idols, who, Psal. 115. want life. 3. And have <hi>mouthes and speak
not, eyes they have, but see not:</hi> you need not be afraid of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The use is. 1. If all things that live, and we mortall men
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:41754:26"/>
borrow our life from God, we are to correct three errours. 1. We take
this borrowed breath for our proper heritage, and we make this lif<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
our Idol and our last end: hence all is done for this life, men betray
the cause of God for their life, men desert the cause of God, Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Countrey and Religion, for a life to them and theirs; men kill
and destroy for life; men rise early in the morning, and go late to bed
at night, and eat the bread of sorrow for life: but oh! little do wee
for the <hi>living God,</hi> and a communion with the living God in the
best life, the life of grace. Our second error is, that as our life is but
a borrowed thing, we do not think on two things; 1. The paying of
the annuall of this borrowed sum, even the dedication of our life, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
wayes, and purposes to God, and his honour: Secondly, we doe
not think of paying back again the principall sum, and who hath
the sum in his hand, and his soul in readinesse to render to God? 2. But
like bankrupts we minde not to pay except we be arrested, and then
the soul is taken from money, but if we do not render it, the ghuest
is pulled out, but doth not come out, <hi>anima ejicitur, non egreditur.</hi>
Who liveth as having no morrow? who walketh as if death were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at his right side? 3. We love best the worst of our life, we are
much for the time-accidents, and the clay-accidents of this life, such
as are court, honour, riches, pleasure, ease: some sell Religion to be free
from plundering, others to keep a whole skin, and to go to heaven, as
they imagine without losse of bloud, comply with Papists, Prelates,
Court, and the Times. And for that which scarce deserveth the name
of Life; men give, (as the Lyer saith, Job. 2. 4.) <hi>skinne for skinne, and
all that they have for life:</hi> but oh! that noble accident of life, eternity
of life, or rather that excellent substance, eternall life, is much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected;
the life <hi>hidden up with Christ in God,</hi> Col 3. 3. is regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>2. How sweet is it to make God a friend sure and induring to thy
soule, who cannot die? is it sure to trust in the Prince who <hi>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to his Earth,</hi> the Earth whereof he is a landed heritor, when
he dieth? Psal. 146. 3. Is it not surer to trust in <hi>the Lord who made

               </gap>, in riches which deale not plainly and fairly
with us, nor go out the high way, but are uncertain, like a friend,
and you know not when to have him, and when to want him?
Is it not better to trust <hi>in that living God?</hi> that God who liveth for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41754:27"/>
ever, whereas riches is a dead and a dying God; <hi>David</hi> speaking
of his owne greatnesse, valour in war through Gods strength, and
of Nations, People, and Kingdomes, who served him, yet looketh
on one above all, Psal. 18. 46. <hi>The Lord liveth and blessed bee my
Rock:</hi> this putteth me in minde of a Prince, who heard of the death
of many of great and noble friends in war, and that this Duke and
this Prince, and this and this worthy friend was killed in war, yet
comforted himself with this, <hi>vivit imperator, sat habeo;</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
liveth, and I am happy enough. But is not this better, to a soule
that knoweth God, my father is killed, my brother lost, my Prince
dead, my deare friend buried, but God liveth, and blessed be my Rock;
yea, but say thy God the King of Brittaine liveth, yet his favour to
thee may die before he die himself, and then what hast thou? Court,
Court is made of glasse, and can glister, and be broken in one houre,
the pavement of the chamber of presence is Icy and slidy, and thou
maist fall: It is known to many, the Courtier is as a compter laid
downe in the compting Table to day for a thousand pound, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up and laid downe in the next accompt for a farthing: O but
these two be sweetly combined; The ever-living God, and The ever-loving
God: how comfortable that I beleeve Gods love toward me
is as old as God, and that as God did never begin to be God, so he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
began to love me, but as he is eternall, so his love is eternall, and
I know the Court shall not change upon me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And abiding, or stedfast for ever.]</hi> This is another attribute of Gods
blessed nature that <hi>Darius</hi> ascribeth to God; He is a God eternall,
Daniel 7. 13. <hi>He is the ancient of dayes,</hi> Psal. 102. 26. <hi>The Heavens
shall perish, but thou shalt endure, yea all of them wax old as a
garment: as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
27. But thou art the same, and thy yeers shall have no end.</hi> I know
now that the whole created masse of heaven and earth, and all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
is but as a web of cloth, and as a Sute of clothes, and the best end
of the web is old and moth-eaten, and shall bee laid by, as an old
threed-bare Cloak, ragged and holed, when God shall endure for
ever and ever. 2. Time goeth not about God, as it goeth about crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
there is not with him yesterday and to morrow, and this yeere,
and the last yeere; but his duration is an instant standing alwayes
still; you and I slide through moneths and yeeres, and at length
wee are over ears in time, and under the water by death: but he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41754:27"/>
standeth still, his being is in no flux or motion from first and last, from
time past to time to come, because he is Revel. 1. 17. <hi>The first and
the last,</hi> and v. 8. <hi>The Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
saith the Lord: he which is, and which was, and which is to come.</hi>
Imagine there were a verbe that doth involve an action done and
ended yesterday, and in doing to day, and to be done to morrow, and
yet a compleatly perfected action that should expresse Gods duration
best; whereas our being taketh three verbs to expresse it, this man
was, and continueth yet, and to morrow shall be, but may not bee,
2 Pet. 3. 8. <hi>One day is with the Lord as a thousand yeares, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
yeeres as one day.</hi> And therefore he is the <hi>King of ages,</hi> 1 Tim.
1. 17. as if generations and centuries of yeares were his subjects and
servants. His Sonne Christ is, Esay 9. 6. <hi>The Father of Eternitie:</hi> And
Esay 57. 15. <hi>He inhabiteth Eternitie.</hi> Men do not inhabite Eternitie,
For, in this, we do but take by the curtains of time, and looke into
the borders of Eternitie, and in the life to come we shall bee beside
Eternity, and not inhabite Eternity, so as if non-existence and our
glorified natures should involve a contradiction; whereas existence
is as essentiall to the glorious Majesty of God as his blessed essence,
and his blessed essence involveth a contradiction not to bee. And all
time-gods are no gods: for if you say God, you say an eternall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of an eternall and ever living God: And this maketh God free
from change, and from ups and downes, from falling and rising, that
are incident to all created natures, even to men and Angels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. If God be eternall and Lord of time, we must be carefull
that wee say not as the people doth, Jer. 8. 20. <hi>The harvest is past,
and the summer is ended, and we are not saved.</hi> Wee are inclined to
weepe upon time as being too long, especially when wee our selves,
and the Lords Church have sad and bloody dayes. But the children
of God have three advantages, which are as many motives to cause
us to submit to Gods dispensation of time. 1. Wait on, for Psal. 9. 18.
<hi>The hope of the poore shall not perish for ever,</hi> Psal. 40. 1. <hi>I waited pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
on the Lord;</hi> and what was the issue? <hi>and he inclined his eare
and heard my cry. 2. He brought me also out of the horrible pit, out of
the mirie clayes, and set my feet on a rock, and established my goings.</hi>
Hence, as while the bellows blow, the fire casteth heat and light, so
doth the heat and fervour of our long lodging under the crosse make
broad aimes of praising and walking thankefully; and when the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41754:28"/>
breathing of the Bellowes ceaseth, the fire goeth out again; so when
we are delivered, and are cooled, wee turn cold in performing reall
thankfulnesse to God; but let faith in long troubles wait on, and sow
seed in Heaven and on Christ (and that is excellent soyle) and wee
shall reape in due time, if we faint not. 2. Gods delayes are the seeds
of greater mercies; we are (to borrow that expression) to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the long delayed salvation of God, and to forgive times leaden
wheeles which move slowly, because God recompenseth want of
present deliverance with a superplus of grace; Was it not best that <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
was not blessed at the first? his faith was lengthned to continue
with this; <hi>I will not let thee goe while thou blesse me.</hi> The woman of
Canaans daughters body is not freed of the divell at the first or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
cry, but her owne soule is inriched with faith, great faith, and
fervour of spirit, to continue in praying and humble submission to bee
willing to be a dogge to Christ; and here the Lord often recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the want of Brasse with the presence of Gold. For faith here
intrusteth a stocke in Gods hand, and doth forbeare and suspend
both principall and annuall till Gods time come. Therefore wee
are to take heed that while we fret and challenge our Lord, that hee
loseth time, that we be not in the mean time losing time our selves;
if he hold his Church long in the furnace, if his Church doe not joyn
with God actively, to melt her selfe, and to humble her selfe under
Gods mighty hand, then the Church loseth her time, but God doth
not lose a moment. The Gold-smith should hold his vessell in the
fire till it be melted and refined. Here also wee are to consider, that
to deliver out of some crosse, as it is Gods mercy, so it is my duetie.
I lose a father, a childe, a deare friend in warre; I can never in this
life be delivered from this crosse, according to the reality of it: for my
father, my childe, my deare friend, once being dead, cannot returne
to mee againe: but though I cannot bee delivered from the reall
losse, yet may I by Gods grace deliver my selfe from the impatient
fretting and distrustfull apprehension of that losse, by doing that for
conscience to the God of patience, (who commandeth mee to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit)
which for length of time I shall doe; but here wee obey time
rather then God.</p>
            <p>3. Gods time is better then ours, for hee knoweth when wee are
ripe for deliverance, and when the drosse cometh away from the
mett<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll, and when we cast our scumme. Here before we glorifie him,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41754:28"/>
we would binde him to deliver us; and we desire here to be served be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, that he should deliver before we be mortified and dead
to our lusts. But it is better that our paine continue praising and
beleeving, as both paine and faith be removed. How excellent is
that of the Church crying out of the deep, <hi>Psal. 130. 5. I wait for
the Lord.</hi> But many lie stil under the load, rather then wait, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they cannot help the businesse; therefore he addeth, <hi>My soule
doth wait.</hi> 2. Many wait, and they know not whereon; it is a fooles
nest they seeke; therefore he addeth, <hi>And in his Word doe I trust.</hi> A
soule is not bottomed on a dreame in his on-waiting, when he hath
the Word of God for his warrant. 3. Many doe wait, but it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
that they wait for, and not for God himselfe; therefore saith
he, <hi>ver. 6. My soul waiteth for the Lord.</hi> It is as much for God and
a communion with him that faith waiteth for, as for deliverance.
4. But many wait, but very lazily, and with great deadnesse; the
Prophet expresseth more of himselfe, <hi>My soule waiteth for the Lord,
more then they that watch for the morning, I say, more then they that
watch for the morning.</hi> Such a waiter with these foure qualifications
can never be delivered out of time. Here then are newes; <hi>Awake, O
Sion, sit no longer in ashes, put on thy beautifull garments,</hi> O people
really in Covenant with God; England, Brittain, be not weary, the
King is comming, Christ is in his journey posting, deliverance is at
hand. O beleever make no haste; O prisoner of hope, die not in the
prison. Oh! we want faith. It is the art and cunning of faith to beleeve
and not see, and to have memory for eyes and sense; but we would
both sow and reap in one day, and would have physicke and health
both in one houre; we would alwayes be at miracles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 2. If God be eternall, his love and decrees must be necessary
and irresistable; nothing is so necessary as that which is eternall.
Then I could easily yeeld, (considering who are this day against us)
we should be sunk and overwhelmed, if those three hold good which
Papists and Arminians hold. 1. Our salvation were in danger, if
free-will, which hath its rise and working in time, were the Axeltree
upon which are rolled the wheeles of eternall election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But there is as good reason to say, that a sucking childe may
reach up his arme above the Sunne and Starres, and roll about the
wheele of the first Heaven from East to West, and turne the wheele
again from West to East, as to say that time-free-will can turn about
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41754:29"/>
the eternall counsel of God, and that our acts of believing are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
and our good and evil works which have their rise from ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday
and to day, and are like <hi>Jonahs</hi> gourd, up and down in one
night, doe roll about the eternall will and decree of God, from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
and love to hatred and rejecting of men. Better make the former
of all things supreame and soveraigne, then give the Prerogative
Royall of all to naughty and sinfull clay.</p>
            <p>2. We could easily grant that it were in mens power to destroy
the Church of God, and that the King of the bottomlesse pit, and his
Lady and Queen Babylon the great whore, and their sonnes, Papists
and Prelates, might cut off the name of the Lords Israel, if upon the
supposall of their dream of N. <hi>media scientia,</hi> the new eyes which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits
(with all humble submission and glory to the glorious God bee
it spoken) have given to the Almighty, contingency did rule all: for
upon the nod and dominion of causes, without all determination of
Gods righteous providence and eternall counsel, all revolutions of
Church and Kingdomes depend, say they, and all hang upon these
two poles, <hi>may be, may not be;</hi> what hindereth then that Christ have
no Spouse, no redeemed people, and that he be a husband without a
wife, a King without Subjects, a Saviour without a ransomed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
as they expresly teach, who with Arminians are advocates for
nature, and pleaders against the grace of God; but wee believe God
to bee eternall, and his counsel eternall, and his eternall decree to
have a strong influence in the safety of his Church, <hi>against which the
gates of hell shall not prevail,</hi> and that Divels, Men, Babylon, Rome,
Spain, Irish rebels, powers on earth in their plots, machinations,
counsels, endeavours, battels, victories, all which, come from free
causes, are yet chained and fast linked to the high dominion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
soveraignty of an eternall God. And we believe that this
differenceth Jehovah from all other Gods, who, as Esay saith, <hi>Can
neither do good nor evil.</hi> Therefore there is not an arrow steepd in hell
and shot against the Church, but it cometh out of Gods bow, and he
saith it, Esay 43. 13. <hi>Yea, before the day was, I am he, and there is none
that can deliver out of my hand. I wil worke, and who shall let it?</hi> The
Churches victories and deliverance depend upon an eternall hand,
and therefore the sonnes of Belial prevail not, and the sons of <hi>Jacob</hi>
are not consumed. 3. It were a desperate matter for the elect to be
saved, if the first <hi>Adam</hi> were our surety; but our Tutor Jesus Christ is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41754:29"/>
old and wise, <hi>the ancient of dayes, Daniel</hi> 7. 13. and <hi>he hath seven eies;</hi>
they cannot chuse but hold the apostasie of the Saints, who make
free-will our tutor: And therefore if I were halfe in heaven, and my
one foot in eternity, and my other in time, if such a sinfull principle as
free-will should tutour and guide me, I should come back again out
of heaven, and be damned eternally. If any weak soule apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
wrath, and under a fervour of desertion should complain, What
hindreth me to be eternally condemned? for I am not distracted, I am
privie to my selfe, that I have sold my birth-right, and sinned against
the grace of God hainously: Let me answer, That the selling of your
birth-right dependeth upon the consent of your tutor Jesus Christ,
who is the King of ages, as no minor can sell his inheritance without
the consent of his tutor, and if he should doe it, it cannot stand in
Law, but may be revoked. Christ is first heire, and all the elect <hi>joynt
heires</hi> with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. and joynt heires in Law, though many
persons, yet they make but one heire: consider then, if he who is
your eternall King of ages, and so unchangeable, hath not given his
consent to the bargaine, that you should sell his birth-right and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,
and under him, your own birth-right, you had no power to
doe it; Christ because he is God eternall cannot subscribe, nor signe
with his hand the writs wherein you have sold your inheritance,
therefore the bargaine in Law is a meere nullity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, if he be God enduring for ever, What fooles are we to
place our hope in a King that shall die? Surely they cast their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
in ill ground, who trust in the creature; thou puttest thy heaven
betwixt the browes of a King and in the light of his countenance;
he is but a man, and may change, and though his favour were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
yet when his eye-strings shall be broken, with one breath he
shall breathe out his own soule, and thy heaven: And what canst
thou then say or do? because sence and the flesh leadeth us, and
time goeth about us from the cradle to the grave; we are all for time,
we are for a time-Court, a time-Glory, a time-Prince, a time-Friend,
a time-Husband, a time-Brother, a time-Heaven and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,
a time-deliverance in trouble, time-Riches, time-joy and
time-pleasure, time-triumphing, a time-life, &amp;c. But we may finde in
this King of ages, who indureth for ever, these same good things
of another nature, as we finde in God, eternall Court, eternall Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
an eternall King, an eternall Friend, an eternall Husband, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41754:30"/>
Brother, an eternall Happinesse, an eternall Salvation, eternall
riches, eternall victory and triumph, and in summe, life eternall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Kingdome such as cannot be destroyed]</hi> The other classe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to prove <hi>Daniels</hi> God to be the true God, is from his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
<hi>His Kingdome;</hi> that is, The people of his kingdome cannot
be destroyed: and now the King doth say, though there be variety and
choyce of gods in Chaldea and Persia, yet <hi>Daniels God</hi> is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
above them all; and <hi>Daniel</hi> and his fellowes are blessed and
more happy in their God, then all that serve other gods. The Lord
when he is tried, will be found the onely excellent and matchlesse
God above all gods, and none like to him and his people, the onely
happy people; that mans portion is fallen in pleasant lines who hath
the Lord for his portion; but I must go on to make good this doctrine,
<hi>That the Kingdome and Church of God is the most permanent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
society on earth,</hi> and a Kingdome which cannot fail; and I
go upon these grounds, There is a most firm and sure Covenant made
betwixt the Lord and his people, <hi>Jer. 31. 35. Thus saith the Lord that
giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the Moon and
Stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves
thereof roare, the Lord of hosts is his name,</hi> vers. 36. <hi>If these ordinances
depart from before mee, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel shall
cease from being a Nation before me for ever.</hi> I might alledge other
Scriptures also, as <hi>Jer. 32. 39, 40. Ezech. 36. 26, 27, 28, 29. Esai. 54.
10, 11, 12. Esai. 59. 21. Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Now then because God
hath bottomed the eternity of his Church upon his own unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
counsell, they must raze the acts of Heaven who can take away
the Church of God. I leave it to the thoughts of the judicious, if the
rooting out of the Protestant Religion bee a rationall purpose of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
men. What if we should imagine a society of transported
men should convene in Parliament, and make Statutes thus, <hi>We or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
as a Law and Statute, that from the 22. of January the Sunne
shall shine no more by day, and the Moone and Starres shall give no
more light by night; also we inhibite and discharge, under the highest
pain of treason, from this time forth the Sea shall never ebbe or flow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
These or the like, should be but the notions of sick imiginations;
acts of night counsels have been these; first, fire the City of London;
secondly, cut off the Parliament; thirdly, leave not alive in Ireland
a Protestant or their seed; fourthly, roote them all out of France,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41754:30"/>
and Germany; fifthly, destroy Scotland and their Covenant; sixthly,
undoe all reformation of Religion in Brittain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider the strength of the Church of God, Numb.
24. 8. <hi>He hath, as it were, the strength of an Vnicorn; he shall eat up
the nations his enemies, he shall break his bones, and pierce them tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
with his arrowes.</hi> Why? and the Church is but a feeble worme:
let it be so, yet he saith, Esay 41. 14. <hi>Feare not, worm Jacob, and yee
men of Israel, I will helpe thee, saith the Lord thy Redeemer, the holy
One of Israel in the midst of thee.</hi> vers. 15. <hi>Behold, I will make thee
(worme as thou art) a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth;
thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small, and shalt make
the hils as chaffe.</hi> vers. 16. <hi>Thou shalt fanne them, and the winde shall
carry them away, and the whirle winde shall scatter them.</hi> You have
not seen such a miracle, that a worme shall destroy a great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and blow it away as chaffe; But it is Gods way, that Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
rides on a straw, on a worme, and triumph. And how can it be
but thus? The Church is the weakest thing in the earth, but in God
incomparably the strongest, <hi>Psalme 46. 1. God is our refuge and
strength:</hi> Gods strength is the absolute greatest strength, and so over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
God and overcome the Church, for a greater strength must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
the lesse. Where dwelleth hee? in earth, in Hell, or in
Heaven? who hath strength above the strength of God? they doe
not flie to the strongest side, who desert the Parliament and flie to
Oxford; they run but downe to Egypt, but Esay 30. 7. <hi>Their strength
is to sit still.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the destroying of the Church is not a worke of reason or
deep policie, as men suppose; they will but swallow downe and
drinke the Protestants, let them be doing and goe on: Put the Church
of Christ in a cup and drink her, but you will be sick when shee is in
your belly, and had better drinke many quarts of lead or brasse melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and coming hot out of the furnace, for <hi>Zach 12. 2, There is poison
and death in the cup. I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto
all the people round about:</hi> The gall, the wormwood, the poyson of
the vengeance of the Lord, and the vengeance of his Temple is in the
cup; Drink who will, they shall be sick, and drunken, and vomit, and
fall, and die in their vomit, and never rise again. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dranke of
this cup, but he was killed with it, and made fishes meat. <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi>
and <hi>Belshazar</hi> dranke, but they swelled hand and foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:41754:31"/>
and died. <hi>Herod Acts</hi> 12. had the cup at his head, and tooke a
draught of this wine, but he was stricken with wormes: Papists,
Prelates, the Irish good Catholique subjects, the Emperour, Spaine,
Rome, the Antichrist, the powers of the earth are now drinking one
to another, and the cup of trembling goeth in a round to them all;
but consider how sick they shall be, Zach. 14. 12. <hi>And this shall bee
the plague wherewith the Lord shall smite all the people that have
fought against Ierusalem: their flesh shall consume away while they
stand upon their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes,
and their tongue shall consume away in their mouths.</hi> Babylons
cup-bearers, and Atheists, and Malignants, to whom the morning
of a sound reformation is as the shadow of death, would then know
how deadly a cup is now at their head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, consider Gods promises to his Church. There is a true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall
written from Heaven, that God is to make a glorious Church
in the end of the world, Esa.</hi> 30. 26. Moreover, the light of the Moone
shall be as the light of the Sun, and the light of the Sun sevenfold, as
the light of seven dayes. <hi>And when the new resurrection shall bee,
I mean the in-coming of that elder sister, the Church of the Jewes,
Rom.</hi> 11. 15. and when all Israel shall be saved, <hi>What a glorious house
shall he build for the Lord, when that shall be fulfilled! Esay</hi> 60. 13.
And the glory of Lebanon shall come unto theee; the fir-tree, the pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
and the boxe together, to beautifie the place of my sanctuary, and
I will make the place of my feet glorious. <hi>v.</hi> 14. The sons also of them
that afflicted thee shall come bending to thee; and all they that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thee shal bow themselves down at the soals of thy feet, and they shal
cal thee The City of the Lord, The Zion of the holy One of Israel. <hi>v.</hi> 19.
The sunne shal no more be thy light by day, neither for brightnesse shal
the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shal be thine everlasting
light, and the dayes of thy mourning shal be ended. <hi>All which, with
many other places, do make God say, That the Church shall stand,
and never be prevailed against by the very gates of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, Christ cannot leave off to be a King, therefore his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
must stand: there is a seed and a reward promised to Christ for
his labours, <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 10. There bee Articles of grace concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Father and his Sonne, which cannot be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, there are in all the sufferings of the Church two things
most considerable: first, a turn; secondly, a contexture: a turne or
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41754:31"/>
returne, Gen.</hi> 39. 21, 22. Joseph <hi>was cast in prison;</hi> But the Lord was
with Joseph. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 23. The archers have sorely grieved Joseph, and
shot at him, and hated him: <hi>but consider the returne, vers.</hi> 24. But his
bowe abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by
the hands of the mighty God of Jacob. <hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 2. Many say of my soul,
There is no help for him in God. <hi>See so sweet a (But) vers.</hi> 3. But thou
O Lord, art a shield for me, my glory, and the lifter up of my head. <hi>So is
the childe of Gods condition made up of two haltes,</hi> Psal. 18. 18.
<hi>Hence the fall;</hi> They prevented me in the day of my calamity: <hi>Then
the rise;</hi> But the Lord was my stay. <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 7. All that see me laugh
me to scorn, &amp;c. <hi>Hence faiths rise, vers.</hi> 9. But thou art he that took
me out of the wombe, &amp;c. Psal. 30. 5. Weeping may endure for a night;
<hi>then the returne,</hi> But joy cometh in the morning. Psal. 34. 19. Many
are the troubles of the righteous; <hi>this is their down, but they lie not;</hi>
But the Lord delivereth them out of all. Psal. 71. 7. I am a wonder to
many; <hi>that is dark night; but the day dawneth againe;</hi> But thou
art my strong hold. <hi>So doth the servant of God fall,</hi> Psal. 109. 4.
For my love they were mine adversaries; <hi>but faith riseth again,</hi> But I
give my self to prayer, Psal. 118. 13. Thou hast thrust sore at me that
I might fall: <hi>see the escape,</hi> But the Lord helped me, <hi>vers.</hi> 18. The Lord
hath chastised me sore; <hi>shall he lie in that condition? No,</hi> But he hath
not delivered me to death. Esay 54. 7. For a smal moment I have forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thee; <hi>behold the returne,</hi> But with great mercies wil I gather thee.
Esay 63. 6. For we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnes
as filthy rags, &amp; we all do fade as a leafe; our iniquities like the winde
have taken us away: <hi>this is death; and look to life again, vers.</hi> 8. But
thou, O Lord, art our Father, &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 19. They shall fight against
thee; <hi>there were but a whole Parliament, all the estates of the Land,
Kings, Princes, Priests, and People against</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>but he must not
lie on the dust;</hi> But they shall not prevaile against thee, for I am with
thee to deliver thee. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 22. Ye now therefore have sorrow; <hi>that
is a sad case, yet it hath a turne,</hi> But I will see you againe, and ye shall
rejoyce, and your joy shall no man take from you; <hi>so are these two at
once in the Lords witnesses his Apostles. 2. Cor.</hi> 4. 9. persecuted, But
not forsaken; cast down, But not destroyed. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 16. At my first
appearing no man stood with me, but all men forsook me; <hi>yet is he
lifted up, vers.</hi> 17. But the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me.
<hi>Secondly, There is a contexture of contraries, as black and white,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:41754:32"/>
sweet and sowre woven through other, as day-light and night in a
morning twy-light: as contraries in one subject. 2. Cor.</hi> 6. 9. As
dying, and behold we live; as chastened, yet not killed, verse 10. Or, as
sorrowfull, yet alwayes rejoycing; as poor, yet making many rich; as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
nothing, yet possessing all things. <hi>How can these two be in one?
They kill us, but we die not; they bury us, but we live againe in the
grave; we have nothing, and we have all things; we have, we want
not. Rom.</hi> 8 36. Killed all the day long, and counted as sleep for the
slaughter. 37. Neverthelesse in all these more than Conquerours, &amp;c.
<hi>Hence they are killed all the day long, and they live all the day long.
I know not how it is, but the Churches death is a living and a breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
death, their poverty a rich poverty, their shame glorious shame,
their sadnesse joyfull sadnesse, their foyles victorious foyles, their
paine an health, and an easie paine, their weaknesse strong and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
weaknesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I desire to make some use of this, And 1. There be no worldly
States and Monarchies of whom this can be said, Their Kingdome
such as cannot be destroyed. Where is there a worldly Kingdome
that cannot be shaken? <hi>Moab</hi> was a Kingdome, and yet <hi>Moab</hi> shall
<hi>die in his own vomit.</hi> Jer. 48. 26. Aegypt is a great Kingdome, and yet
it is broken like an old Clay-pot or a lame Vessell. The foure great
Monarchies are become like foure May-flowres, withered, and their
rosie blossoms are fallen off them in their moneth. Did they mean no
truth who said of earthly Kingdomes? <hi>Omnis faelicitas ad culmen
perducta, retrogreditur;</hi> and, <hi>Magna suo pondere ruunt.</hi> VVorldly
felicity when it is at the height of the Stairs, sitteth downe and slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
back againe; And great things of this Earth are a burden to
themselves; <hi>summisque negatum stare diu.</hi> It is denied to great
things to stand long. Alas, how long did one of the Kings of Gods
People raigne, even <hi>Zachariah?</hi> poore six moneths. <hi>Shallum</hi> came
not to this, he raigned in Samaria one moneth. And <hi>Zimri</hi> who came
to the Crowne by blood, had a shorter raigne; He did walk with a
Crowne seven dayes; If Pope <hi>Victor</hi> the fifth had a longer time of a
golden chaire, it was but five years; and <hi>Clemens</hi> the third ruled but
three yeers; and <hi>Alexander</hi> the eleventh only two yeers. And though
it be but a fiction that Kingdomes have their fatall yeers, and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies
are under Planetary houres, yet some truth must be in this;
Kingdomes have their infancy, and come to a greater strength, till
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41754:32"/>
they come to their flowre, and then they begin to turn: and it is
congruous to their experienced truth, That Kingdomes finde old age;
And <hi>gray hairs are here and there upon Ephraim, and he knoweth not.</hi>
7. 9. It is much better to bee a subject, or one of the States of the
Kingdome of grace; for grace knoweth no old age, nor hath grace
an internall principle of corruption, for it is the seed of eternall
glory; and though the Powers of the Earth may subvert the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Fundamentall Laws of earthly Kingdoms, yet cannot Christs
Kingdome or the constitution of it be broken. But that which doth
loose the Pillars of a Kingdome is sinne. Amos. 1. <hi>For three trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions
of Edom and for foure, I will not turne away the punishment
thereof,</hi> So <hi>Ammon, Moab, Judah,</hi> are under the same punishment.
There is no way to secure England from wrath, but turning to the
Lord: And especially two sinnes in the State are to be seriously taken
to heart. 1. You suffered many worthy servants of God who pleaded
the Lords cause for a Reformation against the Prelates, to be silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
deprived, imprisoned, banished. Both in the reigne of Queene
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of King <hi>James,</hi> Prelates oppressed the servants of
Christ, and did tyrannize over the conscience of the Lords people
in this Land: former Parliaments did not give Christ and his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
faire Justice, and now hath the Lord stirred up these oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
to oppresse your Parliament, and to raise bloody wars against
the Land. 2. It is said, Hos. 5. 11. <hi>Ephraim is oppressed and broken in
judgement, because he willingly followed the Commandement.</hi> It hath
been the sinne of this Land, that when Episcopacy, Antichristian Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,
Superstition, and Will-worship were injoyned by Law, to
pleasure an earthly King, you willingly followed after the command,
against the direction of the King of Kings: and now hath the Lord
delivered the people of the Land into the hand of their KING.
And for this the Sword of the Lord hath gone through the
Land.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Vse.</hi> From the perpetuity of the Lords Kingdome, we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
That this Cause of God shall prevail, and that the Church, though
in the burning Bush, cannot be consumed; for JEHOVAH is in the
Bush. There be three grounds that there is hope that God will build
his own Jerusalem. 1. God never laid the foundation of so fair a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and then deserted the VVorke: when he hath put it into the
hearts of the Parliament and Land to enter into a Covenant with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41754:33"/>
the Lord, the Cause doth now in formall and direct termes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Lords Cause: And so the Lord is become surety for Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
2. When did the Lord ever finally prosper his bloody-hearted
enemies? Babylons Womb and Bowels are swelled with blood, they
intend to root out the Protestant Religion. Can God say Amen
to this in Brittaine? No, he will not, this end was sworne at the
councell of Trent; It was aimed at by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, by <hi>Leo</hi> the
tenth against <hi>Luther,</hi> and the designe of the Actors of that bloody
massacre of Paris; yet hitherto all hath failed them. 3. Gods Noble
and stately acts of disappointing and discovering so many Plots,
give us hope; for in them all God maketh true of England what is
said, Esai. 66. 7. <hi>Before she travelled, shee brought forth, and before
her paine came, she was delivered of a man-Childe.</hi> When she was
sleeping, ere the blow came, the Childe was borne, and the Woman
delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Dominion shall be to the end]</hi> Dominion is a power to use a
thing, as you please, for such ends as you think good; in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our pleasure is supposed to be regulated by Law and Reason;
but men or Angels will or pleasure is not the rule of the use or
lawfull exercise of Dominion, but in God; whose blessed will, not
being differenced from his holy reason, and infinite wisedome, its
the rule of the use of his Dominion, and none may say to him, What
doest thou? that but standeth still to the Creature as a binding Law.
<hi>Illud tantum possumus quod jure possumus,</hi> we have no more lawfull
morall power given to us of God, then we can, or do lawfully exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
according to the morall rule: But Gods Dominion is to be discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
thus, as it standeth in those following heads. First, in the manner
of it, its compleat. <hi>Deus Dominatur in totum ens, &amp; in totum entis;</hi>
God hath Dominion over every being of the Creature, and over every
part of the being. God hath Dominion over his Creatures soule,
and his soules faculties, his will, minde, conscience, affections, faith,
hope, feare, love, joy; over the body, and all the powers and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therof. So God hath a compleat Lordship over the Creature:
One Creature hath not a compleat Lordship or Dominion over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yea a free reasonable Creature hath not a compleat Dominion
over himself. The reason is, God made the Creature, he made all
and every being and part of the Creature; He made the soule, the
body, the faculties of both, the actions and purposes of both:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41754:33"/>
Therefore he hath an absolute Dominion over both. The potter hath
a Dominion of art, not a Dominion by creation over the Lame-pot:
he made the Lame-pot, but he created not the Clay: He hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
but a Dominion of art over the Clay, not to annihilate the
Clay as god can do. His Dominion is of Art to frame of the Clay a
Vessell of honour, for a Kings Table, or a Vessell of dishonour for the
receiving of Urine. The Master amongst the Jews might sell his
man-servant, and put him in his purse; but the truth is, when he
sold him, he sold but his bodily-service, as hee was usefull to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
and work; but he could not sell his servants soule, nor his
understanding, nor his will, nor his love, nor his faith or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor any of these: Courtiers then and Cavaliers, Prelates,
Atheists who professe they are of the Kings Religion, and will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of their soules at the Kings pleasure, to kill the innocent, they
make their soules bastards and unlawfull broods, and they make the
King the Creator of their soules, and the absolute Lord of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
O foole, the King did not make thy Soule, there is an
other Soule-Lord then the King! Ezek. 18. 4. <hi>Behold all Soules are
mine,</hi> saith the Lord; and there is another Soule-former, then the
King of Brittaine: hear God speak himself, Esai. 57. 16. <hi>If I should
contend for ever, the spirits should faile before me, and the soules that
I have made!</hi> O finde me an Earthly King that can forme Soules,
and then let the Cavaliers sweare that which many now practice,
<hi>I am the Kings wholly, both soule and body, faith and conscience.</hi> But
I pray you, are not all in England the Kings Subjects? yea trùly
and all in Scotland also, but not one soule, not one conscience in all
the three Kingdomes is the Kings Subject.</p>
            <p>2. Gods Dominion: for the matter is universall, he can presse an
Army in the Clouds, and in the Firmament, Judg. 5. 20. <hi>The Stars
in their course fought against Sisera:</hi> he hath an host in Hell, and
raised an Army against the first-borne of Egypt, Psal. 78. 49. <hi>Hee
troubled them by sending, Malokim ragnim, evill Angels,
or Devils amongst them.</hi> He can blow a Trumpet, and cry to
the dust of the Earth, Arms, Arms, and there ariseth an host of
Catter-pillers, or Canker-wormes, Joel 2. and vers. 6. <hi>before the
faces of these Wormes the people is much pained, and all faces gather
blacknesse;</hi> that is, strange to see valient men of Warre tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Worme, and one man with a tramp of his foot may kill
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41754:34"/>
hundreds of them, but this is the Dominion of JEHOVAH the Lord.
He hath an host of VVaters, every wave of the Sea being a Souldier,
every fish receiving pay from JEHOVAH, first to drown Pharoah, and
then to eat him and his Princes.</p>
            <p>3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He hath a Soveraigne Dominion over the salvation and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of men, as Rom. 9. 21. <hi>The potter hath power over the Clay.</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians
and Papists will have Freewil Lord and Carver of the white
roll of election to glory, but Gods own Pen from eternity did
write in the Lambs Book of life so many, and did book those from
eternity, whom he was, of free grace, to make Senators of heaven,
to walk with the Lamb in white: nor doth freewill pen its own
doome: But God hateth <hi>Esau,</hi> before he doth good or ill.</p>
            <p>4. God hath an absolute Dominion in all the operations of second
Causes. The Stars these five thousand yeers have marched so orderly,
and kept their Orbes, Distance, Line, that not one of them ever trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed
the borders of another. And Gods Dominion herein is so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
that in necessary causes the Lord worketh a sort of contingency,
and in contingent causes, a sort of necessity; as he saith to the fire,
Burn, Burn not; Burn those who cast into the Furnace the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
Burn not the three Children, <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. 22, 24. He commandeth
the Sun to move, and it moveth, Psal. 104. 19. He commandeth it to
stand still, and it doth so, in the dayes of <hi>Ioshua.</hi> He saith! O sea, ebbe
and flow, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 22. and it doth so. He saith! O sea, stand still, as a
VVall, or as an heap of Ice, do not ebbe, nor flow, while my people
go through dry; and it doth so. And what he hath decreed must be,
though it fall out in a contingent way; <hi>Iosephs</hi> Brethren must fell
him, <hi>Potipher</hi> must cast him in prison, King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> must exalt him
to honour.</p>
            <p>5. VVhen causes seeme confused in their operations, God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
his Dominion. Why should an Arrow smite <hi>Achab</hi> betwixt
the joynts of the harnesse, and kill him? many thousands may bee
killed as soone as he: But God shot the Arrow; the Bow and the
Arrow of JEHOVAHS Dominion was here, when two Armies of
many thousands on every side joyne battell: What confusion is there,
when thousands are rolled in bloud? who marshalleth bullets through
the Aire? God ranketh Bullets, Arrows, and Fire-works as his
Souldiers, flying in the Air, and will have a good man killed in a good
cause, and a wicked man in an evil cause: to come faire and safe off
here, must be the Dominion of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41754:34"/>
6. How is it that Satan and wicked men in their blackest works of
hell are as Chariots and Horsemen, carrying on the counsels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and serving Gods eternall counsell, when they are not serving
God himself? we are to draw this into our selves, for God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth
an inferiour Dominion to his Church and people, for the
which he is to be adored.</p>
            <p>1. God is conquering mens judgement, that they yeeld to
truth.</p>
            <p>2. He hath given a Dominion to his saints, and given them to bee
above all things, and put all Creatures under the childe of God, and
hath put the world, life, death, court, glory, riches, under the fear,
faith, love, and joy of his own children: nothing is great to a believer,
but Christ; nothing high but the most high, nothing fair but he who
is white and ruddy, and the <hi>fairest of the sonnes of men,</hi> Cant. 5. 10.
Psal. 45. 2. Nothing ancient; <hi>as the ancient of dayes.</hi> Nothing honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as the King of ages. Nothing desireable as <hi>the Lord, the desire of
all Nations,</hi> when creatures have Dominion over us, and are above us,
and too great in our affections, we be then under their power, and
our hearts are mastered and over-loaded by clay and shadows; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if death, torture, the sword, losse of the sweet pleasures of this
life have a Dominion over us, our life is a bondage to us.
The people of God are Rom. 8. 36, 37. killed, and yet conquerors and
victors.</p>
            <p>3 We are to effect a Dominion over sin. How can this be? for the
children of God for the most are foyled in their combat betwixt the
spirit and the flesh; <hi>Paul</hi> was led captive: I answer, This may be, and
yet the Dominion is on the childe of Gods side. 1. Because victory must
not be measured by one blow, but by the issue of the battell; Christ at
length in all his Saints shall <hi>bring forth</hi> Esai. 42. 3. <hi>judgement unto
truth,</hi> Mat. 12. 20. <hi>into victory;</hi> The Gospel at length is victorious in
the heart of the childe of God. 2. That the spirit keepeth the fields
in that same soule with the flesh, is a great Dominion; in carnall men
the spirit is not in the Fields at all; and therefore he is a servant not
a captive; and when the childe of God sinneth, it is but with the half
of the will, and so the flesh hath but half a vote; and there is a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station
made on the contrary by that supernatural instinct. A mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging,
or a woodsetting is not a buying, the soul giveth half consent,
but with reversion, and a power to take back again at another time.
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41754:35"/>
what is now given. A man is legall proprietor, and Lord of Lands
morgaged, though he want the present use of them. 3. The foyles of
the childe of God are the seed of humility, of hunger for a fuller mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of grace, of cautelous and more strict walking; and often here
falling one way is rising another way; and this fall is a vertuall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over pride. Sinne helpeth, by Gods grace, to mortifie it self.</p>
            <p>4. We are to pray, that the Gospel may have a Dominion! O that
we might be witnesses to see him who rideth on the white horse go
forth through the habitable world <hi>with his Bow, and his Crowne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering,
and to conquer, and that he would cause his servants alwayes
to triumph in Christ, and make manifest the savour of his knowledge in
every place!</hi> Revel. 6. 2. 2. Cor. 2. 14. Pray, exalted be the glory of
Jesus; high, high for evermore be his Throne! O that the Pearles
and Diadems of his royall Crowne may glister as farre as the beames
of the Sun in the Firmament shine. Let the wheeles of his
Chariot be as the wings of an Eagle. Let his enemies
bow before him, and those brazen knees, which
will not bow to Jesus Christ, let them
be broken! O Lord let thy
Kingdome come.</p>
