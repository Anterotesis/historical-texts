         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

any violence vnto it. For, where more
occasions are offered, to staie men from
their euill purposes, there to passe the

can be practised, then by dissimbling,
lying, slaundering, &amp; blind reasoning,
to go about to defloure such a vertue?
Surelie, yf those eyes and iudgementes,
by which spirituall bewties are consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
were as generallie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>monlie

After which sort, yf but a cusson of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

would we make, and what
detestations would we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceiue against
them? There is not vndoubtedlie, ther
<pb facs="tcp:22571:4"/>
is not, that zeale for the truth it self,
which is vttered in defence of playne
vanitie: and God most allmightie and
glorious, is not so attentiuelie conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as a man, or a mase, or a badge
onlie vpon the sleeue, which are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in comparison. For defence yet
of which thinges so small, how greate
angers and stomakes are taken, and
how much is he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>temned in the world,
which dissembleth an iniurie in such
matters? And in deede, allthough the
thinges them selues are but simple, yet
the truthe is in them allso, moderatelie
to be folowed, and in right iudgement
it were not to be suffered, that either
officers, either orders, should be freelie
disgraced: how much more iustlie then
are the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes &amp; the auncient ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Catholike faith, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered

of euery honest man, whi is the
euerlasting veritie, and cause of owr
sowle, which should be chiefest, either
not sought for, when it is easelie to be
fownd, either els not cared for, when
it is euidentlie perceaued. Hath he
(trow you) a good iudgement or a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hart, which either affecteth igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and wil not turne ouer the leffe,
least he should haue a conscience of
the truthe once knowen, either being
conuinced by euident reason, that his
forfathers beleiued well and trulie,
doth thinke that diuines onlie haue to
thinke of such matters, and foloweth
outwardlie the fond and newfound
brothers? Or thei, which reade the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
of both sides, and either through
lightnes and vanitie doe beare awaye
no more then the phrase and maner of

and enemitie, consider onlie how to
find faultes with the writer, doe thei
<pb facs="tcp:22571:5"/>
shew therein, anye point of great witt
and grauitie? And so, whiles some
thinke, and those I feare no young ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
or beggars, <hi>I hold with Christ
whom all confesse, and further if
I should consider the question, I
might be made, to my cost, a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist:</hi>
and others saie priuilie, <hi>in deed
the old religion is best, when all is
done, but we must beare a litle
with the world:</hi> further when on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort reporteth, <hi>it is smoothelie
done, or he paieth his aduersarie
home, or he runneth lyke oile, or
he byteth lyke vineger:</hi> and finallie
whiles others saie, directing their eye
not to the matter, but against the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
that, <hi>herein he declareth litle
good nurture in not belording so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
person, or he misseth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruitie
of speach, or he telleth old
dreames and stories, or he iesteth
and dalieth all togeather:</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
<pb facs="tcp:22571:5"/>
is, that verie few do honor the
truth, or seeke ernestlie for it. For,
thei which refuse to be acquainted
with it, or dissimble the knowledge
thereof, doe without all doubt geaue
occasion to disgracing of it. Like as in
court, to make as though you knew
not some notable and worthie Lord,
it is halfe a dishonor vnto hym. And
others, which busie themselues about
wordes and titles, and passe ouer, with
out consideration, the sense of thinges
and the matter, are lyke them which
loke a man in the face, whiles he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them a sadd tale for their profite,
&amp; thinke all that while vpon nothing
els in a maner, but what tailer it shold
be, which made his cote and apparell.
I appeale therefore vnto euerie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and my selfe I prouoke to the
vttering, and the, (Reader) to the
considering of the truthe.</p>
            <p>It is not inough to reade, but thow
<pb facs="tcp:22571:6"/>
must allso consider, and it litle profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to consider, except it be a truthe
worth the marking. Of the .ij. women,
which striued before Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, one told
a long tale, of her dwelling in one hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
togeather with her felowe, of her
owne and her felowes childebearing,
of her quicke child taken in the night
season from her side, and the placing
of her companions dead boye in her
bosome, with other such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
more, to moue perchaunse some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
When she had ended: <hi>It ys
not so</hi> (quod the other woman vnto
her) <hi>as thou saiest,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Reg. 3.</note> 
               <hi>but thy soune
ys deade, and myne lyueth.</hi> But on
the other side, <hi>Thou lyest,</hi> saieth she,
<hi>for my soune ys a lyue, and thyne
ys deade.</hi> And thus thei striued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
te kinge. Now, what sentence the
wise Prince gaue, it is commonlye
knowen, as how he called for a sword,
and commaunding the quick child to
<pb facs="tcp:22571:6"/>
be diuided in .ij. partes, sought to find
out thereby, in which of the .ij. women
the naturall compassion ouer her child
would sonest appeare. Which strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
vttering it self brimly, in one of
them, as he wittilie had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ceiued, vnto
her he apointed the quicke child, and
sensiblie dissolued a secrete question.
Of which example, this I thinke, may
be well gathered, that in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies
we goe strayt to the quicke of
the question, and rest not vpon the
by matters. For, in disputing of the
Sacrament of the aultar, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
whether some allwaies should
communicate, thou lyest saieth one,
thou blasphemiest saieth the other,
this is an itching folie saieth one, this
is sluttisshe eloquence saith the other,
you playe apishe partes saieth one, you
be like S. George an horsebacke saieth
the other, and this is no litle sport vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
manie to see, how contrarie sides can
<pb facs="tcp:22571:7"/>
cutt one the other. But this vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlye
is nothing to the question, how
euen one is with the other. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
such odd wordes, as I can not tell
hou thei come in, and serue to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
of affections, so let hym take
heede which vseth them, that thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and agree with the matter, and
let other be warned, which are the
readers or hearers, not to gape after
such glauncies, which happ now and
then in sadd writing, but to marke
aduisedlye what truth is in question,
and neither by acclamation to the
wordlie proceedinges, neither indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
against the old faith and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
to shrinke in anye part from
it. Wich is (me thinketh) to call for
a Salomons sword, and not to sitt still
in iudgement with harkening after
such by phrases, as are not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the question. The sharpnes
of which sword will shew, who is the
<pb facs="tcp:22571:7"/>
false harlot, and who is loth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie
examined, caring not what
absurditie he permitteth, so that he
be not openlie confounded, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(as I may saye) of the question
be not espyied. And this, I speake, not
onlye for the indifferent reader his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
whom I wisshe to consider the
truth ernestly, but for our ease allso in
this fight with the Protestantes, that
we might come to some peace and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clusion.
For, to the bokes of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
which of late haue ben printed,
some of the answers, and the most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
are these: <hi>It is an vnlerned bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
it doth not obserue the stiles &amp;
titles which it should doe, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
hym but Master, whom it
should call my Lord, it alleageth
such authorities as we neuer saw,
it reciteth visions which are not
in scripture, it hath false Latin in
it, it is full of skoffes and tauntes.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:22571:8"/>
As who should thinke, the argument
were dissolued, if the maker of it were
reproued, for lisping in his vtterance,
or making a wrie mouth vpon his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie.
For, if these were heighnous
faultes, and might in deede be so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
against the Catholikes, or if there
were not a perfect hatred, which the
holye Prophete boldlye confesseth,<note place="margin">Psal. 138</note> in
louing the persons of his enemies, with
detesting to the vttermost, and defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their iniquities, yet a wise prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
would not speake at all of them,
or lightlie passe away from such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and go exactlie to the point of the
question, and proue that it toucheth
not the state of his religion.</p>
            <p>Yet I graunt, if a religion were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
by long vse of all Christendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
it were inough to tell the people,
that the contrarie is not to be credited:
and thei without more wordes ought
to be perswaded, as bound to folow an
<pb facs="tcp:22571:8"/>
vniuersall authoritie of Catholike prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stes
and Bishopes. But when new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
are brought furth in to open pul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pites,
and thei co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mended by no formar
authoritie, allso when straunge Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spells
are confirmed by no miracles, but
onlye by naked affirmations, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

and <hi>this we vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d it,</hi> or els by no
likelie and probable reasons, by which
the vnderstanding might be sumwhat

dealing, that when such their wordes
and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts are disproued, it should
be inough for them to answer againe,
<hi>you lie,</hi> or <hi>you iest,</hi> or <hi>you fauor
not the pure and sincere Ghospell.</hi>
I gather by the handeling of other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
what I haue to prouide for,
about my owne doings.</p>
            <p>A preacher at paules crosse, (in an
euill houre) prouoked all the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
in the world, vpon manifold arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:9"/>
against him (for part of his lying)
a short confutation was straitwaies
put in writing. which for the shortnes
of it, being easelie copied out, and for
the truth and soundnes of it, liked ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
well of the Catholikes, through
much goeing abrode in to manie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and free communicating of it vnto
diuers persons, it cummeth at length
vnto a protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts handes, which befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
that, was desirous of it. Which, (to
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mendacion of his zeale vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedlie,
although not of his science) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
with speede an answer vnto it, and
intitled it, <hi>An answer in defence of
the truth. &amp;c.</hi> Wherin you may note,
how much in a short time the world is
chaunged. For, at that season, simple
and familiar letters of Catholikes, not
framed to such purposes, were out of
hand answered, and put in print. Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tisies
also, which went abrode without
name from frind to frind, were sought
<pb facs="tcp:22571:9"/>
and inquired for curiouslie, and set
furth in print to be considered. Yet
now, when thei are prouoked againe
and againe, to make good the crakes
sett on their Ghospell, thei worke (I
feare) by deceipts and subtelties, and
haue either no answer at all to make,
or that which thei haue made is not
lyked of their fauorers, or els thei will
make so manie wordes and so greate
a worke, that lyke craftie wormes
thei maye couer themselues vnder lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
and still mainteine a russhing,
with creeping yet awaye from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or els thei are not so hott in spri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
as thei were wont to be. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that called <hi>Defence of the
truth,</hi> being sent vnto me by a great
fauorer of the proceedinges, and sent
of verye good will and frindshipp,
that I should be reformed (after his
desire) by it, by considering how the

               </gap>es are allwayes repelled, I ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
not long, but made a reply again<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ste
it, the veritie of our cause was so
euident, and the false demeanure of
the aduersarie, that I might well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the Catholike, and turne the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of crakers in to confusion. What
I dyd, that it might come in to the
handes of our aduersaries, and find
emong them a direct answer vnto it,
or els a quiet geauing ouer of their
further striuing against the truthe,
allthough it be harmelesse, yet being
needelesse, I will not declare it. Yet,
this I am bold to saye, that thei might
(if thei would) haue done by this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
as thei dyd by the Apologie (as
thei termed it) of priuate masse, and
haue set it furth in print with their
answer vnto it, for the glorie of their
religion, and much liberalitie towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
poore Catholikes, whose writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb facs="tcp:22571:10"/>
without the author his labors and
charges, full diligentlie thei haue
printed. Which, whether it were
worth the answer, or no, therein let
anye reasonable men be iudges, and let
the truthe be considered, I praie the
(Reader) most hartelye, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of anye my manner of writing.
Not because I am not willing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
to euerye point that thei maye
haue against me, but that the truthe
should be seen the better, when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie
inuectiues are not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
For, (as I haue saied,) I feare,
by the examples of other, lest this will
be their chiefest answer: <hi>It is not
worth the answering, it is full of
toyes and fancies. It forgetteth
good nurture in writing. &amp;c.</hi> As
who should thinke, that thei (like
gentle doues) had no manner of gall
<pb facs="tcp:22571:11"/>
in their writinges, or as though that
a wiseman might not dissimble an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
and answer to the matter direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.
But, be it so, you be patient, quiet,
fairespoken, innocent, harmelesse, you
thinke euill of no man, you praie for
the Pope and the Cardinals, you reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
the name of religious folkes, you
know not how to nickname the Papi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
no bitternes, no skoffing, no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curteousnes,
is in your preachinges and
writinges espied, and the contrarie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are in Catholikes. Forgeaue vs
then, I praie you, these our singular
faultes, considering yourselues, that
you allso maye be tempted. And if a
sharpe word or sentence, allthough it
be medicinable, must not be spoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, take awaye all such wordes in
this boke, as may troble your patience,
and let the truthe by itselfe be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,

            <p>Therefor let the truthe be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the substance of the matter
regarded, that, when preachers and
prelates find fault with our maner of
wrytinge, as though all the boke we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
then answered, if they say toyes and
nothing els to be in it, thou (indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

either iudge thou by our doings,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 3.</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we be like Luther and skoffers,
or whether the cause it selfe be not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,

of handeling it. For which purpose,
I haue gathered this table, of such

<pb facs="tcp:22571:13"/>
what religion thei be of, and how sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mefullie
they abuse their whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.
The end is this, let no honest
man be ashamed of the truthe, let no
protestant belie the truthe, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
a euill cause, there are wittes to
discusse it, and prouing our matters
so euidentlie, why is no more regard
made of them? Yf our Lorde be the
God, folow hym, if Baal be he, folow
hym. Yf we slaunder or misreport our

to cleere themselues of such matters as
are laied against them, that we maye
haue a further occasion to shew the
weakenes of this new religion, &amp; that
others, which through harkenyng to
the world, and their owne priuate lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes

thei be of no religion. For which kynd
of men, if it were not, lesse preuailyng

would be permitted, but seeing man is
free and master of his owne actions,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:14"/>
thei can be no more then warned, that
thei seeke after truth, and folowe it.

are of the same opinion and faith with
them: in the one syde it may be a questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
and on the other, I know it is none at all.
For, as concernyng the folowers of new

whose faith ys not to finding owt in the

I refuse to do this, and, I should not do
this. Or els<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I refuse to do this, and I allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
my vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> for one cause, and, I shold
not do this, because I am a Bishope. For
in refusing and alleaging cause of it, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
ys greater occasion geauen of further
consideration: but in sayng, I should not
do this, because I am a Bishope, there ys
small grace shewed because of so hastie
conclusion. This second kynd of phrase,
ys for them which stand gloriouslie vpon
their honor and estimation, but the first
agreeth euen with such, as are readie to
fullfill their vocation. The one sentence
doth challenge a thing of dutie, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
emploieth within it a reason and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie.
And to be short, the one may
be spoken, mildlye, discreetly, and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie,
but the other is vttered (I thinke)
stoutlie, vnwyselie, and presumptuouslie.
Wherefor, Sir, you make the matter wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
by your telling, then it was in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
his writyng: and yow find fault
with others for misreporting and misco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

prouiding not in the meane whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
<pb facs="tcp:22571:17"/>
for your selfe, to vse and shew true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
The Catholike doth not take M.
Iuell to be so folishe, as to thinke that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is a Bishope, he should make no
rekonyng of his doctrine: but he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueleth
rather (his lerning co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sidered) that
he would alleage such causes as he dyd,
for the refusall of prouing his doctrine.
And so he may yet still maruell at it.</p>
               <q>But (say you) my Lord Bishope dyd not
saye,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> he should not proue his doctrine, but
that he might not well do it without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
licence.</q>
               <p>Wherein truly you do take very much
from a Bishope his libertie,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> if he can not
safely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ferr with such as D. Cole is, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>owt
obteinyng of licence. And you will
troble allso the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sell of the realme with
more matters then needfull, if they shall
make so litle of their Bishopes, that they
are not to be trusted, with vsing of their
office, except they first aske leaue and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
Yf the Catholikes, which are in
prison, were such greuouse offendars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the state, that it might be suspected
they would practise all treason, then in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22571:17"/>
deed, for suertie that none of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
might come vnto them, it were not
done vnwyselie to make the restraint ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall:
and then might a new Bisshope
doubt perchaunse to conferr with them,
without further licence. But where as all
the fault, which is laied to their charge,
hath no other name but papistrie, and old
religion, M. Iuels doubt was more then
needfull, to refuse the prouyng of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
without further licence. But it ys
well that you will declare vnto vs, the
rightfullnes of his refusall, and make his
part more probable. Wherein your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonyng
is this:
<q>VVere it good reason (think you) that a
magistrate at the demaund of euerie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,<note place="margin">Defence.</note>
should bring reason to proue any law,
publisshed by the prince, to be good? &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Neither euery demaund,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> neither euery
subiect is to be answered, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
that either cardmaker, or tapster, or

emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g their pottes and packes, to sitt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> great Doctours, or reuerend Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of generall Councells. Yea trulie, if
<pb facs="tcp:22571:18"/>
either gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> or marchant, would cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouslie
and proudlie appose the priest
or curate of his parishe, it were not to be
suffered. But is D. Cole euery man? and
the good and lerned Catholikes, which
continue in indurance, are they no more
to be regarded, then the common sort of
Englishe men? or on the other syde, are
they to be abhorred, as a singular sort of
wicked men? To submitt the iudgement
of the Prince and realme, to the mysly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
of one wayward subiect, I graunt
with yow, it would be great impeachme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
to the Princes authoritie<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> neuerthelesse
to defend the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, which hath pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by consent of any Prince, or realme,
it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mendeth their estimation and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
But, concernyng waywardnes, hath
D. Cole shewed hym selfe to be such a
one, in his request and letter to M. Iuel?
In deed you speake brodely of hym, and
say that he required a proufe of M. Iuels
doctrine, vnder pretence of lernyng, but
in deed quarelling. But a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ee herein yowr
honest and true charitie. M. D. Cole in
hys first letter to the Bishope, promiseth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:22571:18"/>
by the faith he beareth to God, that he
will yeld so farr as M. Iuel shall geaue him
cause. And he againe in the second let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
to M. Iuell, in most hartie and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wyse, desyreth hym to geaue eare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his sute, and he speaketh so loulie and
baselie, that it may be wel marueiled, why
such a Catholike would submitt hym sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe
vnto a protestant. Yet this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
you, which see further in other
mens hartes, then you can gather by any
outward signe, dare to speake it, and that
in print, that for all M. D. Coles preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
yet in deede, he went about quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
And you speake not onlie for your
selfe, but you would haue other beleeue,
that M. Iuell allso was of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,<note place="margin">The <hi>M.</hi> of the defence slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dereth <hi>D.</hi> Cole, and Master Iuel, bothe.</note>
as though he had therefore made
strange, without further licence, to shew
furth the proufes for his doctrine, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
he had to do with a wayward and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
subiect. Whereof you do fouly
and vnworthely cause hym to be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
as it doth clearly appeare by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to M. D. Coles first letter. In which
after he had declared the doubt of hys
<pb facs="tcp:22571:19"/>
mynd whether without further lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, he
might safely geaue a rekonyng of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>M.</hi> Iuell in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer vnto <hi>D.</hi> Coles first letter.</note>
                  <hi>Not withstanding (sayeth he) for as
much as I am persuaded that you charitablie
desyre to be resolued, I can allso charitablie be
contented &amp;c. to conferr with you herein.</hi>
Wherefor truly, Syr, (what so euer you
be) you be much to blame to report in
such sort of D. Cole, as neither by hym
is to be gathered, by the faith he oweth
vnto God, neither to M. Iuell ys persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as plainely appeareth by his letters.
Yf therefor D. Cole was not in such sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
taken by M. Iuell, as you suppose hym
to haue ben receiued, it is euident that as
you vnderstode not the meanyng of the
author of the Apologie, so lykewyse, you
haue mistaken the mynd and saying of
your Lord of Salisburie. Which maketh
me iustly to doubt, whether you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
your selfe in such matters, as you
haue enterprysed. As, in an other reason
which you bring for M. Iuell, it may be
partly proued, vntill I procede further.
Your reason is this,
<q>In that he is orderlie called,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> to the state of
a Bishope, he is in possession of the truth.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:22571:19"/>
And therefor it were not reason, he shold

               </p>
               <p>What meane you then,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> I pray you, by
possession of the truth? Is the truth so
ioyned vnto the Bishopericke of Sarum,
that he which is sett in possession of the
landes, ys straitwaies placed in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the truth? And because it is not
so: how ys M. Iuell at this daye more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
in the possession of the truth, then
he was seuen yeres past, when he was out
of all possession of land? And if seuen ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res

nothing haue doubted, to shew his eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
vnto a Catholike Bishope: wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> ys
it against reason that at this daye (for all
his temporall honor) he should do the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke?
For allthough palace, parkes, reuenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
seruantes, horses, and such lyke, do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
hym in the sight of the world more
worthyer, yet all the ryches and glorie of
the world, should not make hym, by one
iote, the truer. If the wyll or counsell of
mightie Princes of the world, or yf the
consent of the commons of any realme,
were able to sett the studentes of diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb facs="tcp:22571:20"/>
in the possession of the truth: then,
not only such Princes or such commons
might be called Lordes of the truth, but
allso the truth, which is one in it selfe,
should be oftentymes changed, euen as
their myndes shoulde be altered whiche
are letters and setters of it. But the wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God hath apoynted a better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And he hath geauen vnto his only-begoten
and singularly welbeloued soun
Ihesus Christ, the nations of the world,
as his iust inheretance, which yet is so
geauen of the father, that the soun by his
pretiouse death hath truly <hi>&amp;</hi> deerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
it. To take therefor the possession
of the world, which he might of right
challenge for his obedience vnto death,
he sent furth his officers and Apostells,
and by his diuine power,<note place="margin">How the possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the truthe was geaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and who be the holders of it at this daye.</note> and shewing of
miracles, he placed those so few and so
simple persons, in the possession of hys
landes, and by sending vnto them all the
giftes and graces of the holyghost, he set
them perfectly in the possession of hys
truth,<note place="margin">Io. 16.</note> as it ys writen, <hi>when the holygost
cummeth, he shall teach you all truth.</hi> Now,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:22571:20"/>
that the possessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of this truth might not
be lost for euer after, and that, allthough
the Apostells and Disciples should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few yeares, depart from this world, yet
that such should neuer be to seekyng, as
might hold the possession of truth once
taken, therefor God (which was able to
performe it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>) dyd apoynt in hys church,
<hi>some Apostles;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>some Prophetes, some Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelistes,
other some Pastors and teachers,
vntill all we shall come and meete togeather
in vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the soun
of God.</hi> Such therefor as succeed the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postells
in their faith and places, and such
as haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tinued in the possession of the
truth euer sence Christ hytherto, such al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
as keepe the Catholike tradition and
priesthode in the most partes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
are to be regarded and este<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
as the right heires of the Apostles
and Christ. But if in some corner of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome,
the old and auncient Bissho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
be dryuen out of their places, and if
a new religion be planted .xvC. yeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christ, allthough it should continue
without interruption in that one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb facs="tcp:22571:21"/>
place vnto the worlds end, yet could
it be neuer rightly saied, to haue the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of truth by order. No verely, it
hath not so much as the possession of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
orderly, and much lesse the possession
of the truth. For, I pray yow, what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ner
of faith was he of, whom M. Iuell succe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in the palace of Sarum? Or what
order can yow number vp, sence England
was Christened, of Bisshopes and Priestes
inspired with the lyke confession of faith,
as now is, for the tyme, vsed? Well Syr
yet agayne, if the order which any one
Realme taketh, be able to settle men in
the possession of truth, and if for the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of that order standyng, no Bishope is
to be required to shew his euidence: how
chaunseth it, that in the disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which
was prepared at Westminster, the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Bishopes, which then were in posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
were not yet permitted to enjoy their
pruilege? Or whi did your Bishopes now,
which then were out of office, refuse to
shew their euidences as thei were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
As the church of Christ had hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of yeares togeather vsed, so dyd the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:22571:21"/>
Bisshopes and clergie of England obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
and keepe in their seruice and order of
church, what tyme you began to ryse and
reason against them. And whereas it was
sufficient cause inowgh for them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue
and mainteine as thei dyd, because
thei had so receiued of their predecessors
and fathers, whose wysedomes thei had
not to suspect, yet you were not content
with the licence grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted vnto you, of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putyng
with them, but you would allso
apoint vnto them, what order thei should
take in the matter. And for all their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
yet you would dryue them to
shew their euidencies. What if thei had
lost their writinges? or could not fynd
them presently? or wold not shew them
to such as you were: ys their silence, or
refusall in that behalfe, to be accompted
for a losse of their cause? But (thankes
be to your Bishoperickes) when you be
now well placed,<note place="margin">The here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge their ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gumentes, togeather with the changes of tyme.</note> you are content that
the plaintyfe shoulde first and formost
shew his euidence. And now it ys against
reason, that the possessor should take the
person of a plaintyfe, which, before this
<pb facs="tcp:22571:22"/>
tyme, would not be grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted, whiles your
selfes were out of all possession. But how
say yow, if the Catholikes doe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
yet keepe their possession? for the
Bishopes of Fraunce, Spaigne, Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and Italy, are not yet dryuen out of
their chaires and places of the Apostells.
And as long as they keepe their romes,
you can not enter in to the churche, as
it were a house forsaken and destitute.
how then? will you dryue them out by
force, <hi>vi &amp; armis?</hi> In deede it ys one of
the cheifest wayes, by which the new
ghospel hath proceded, which if you can
not, as yet, folow thoroughly, you must
then, either lett them alone (which you
do not as appeareth by your sermons &amp;
writinges) or els bring furth your euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against them which be in possession.
But no reason shall preuaile except it
make for you, and therefor you passe not
vpon the possession, which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
hold and keepe in the world, but
you wyll dryue them to the prouyng of
such articles as doe offend you, and for
your owne part, you will stand vpon the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22571:22"/>
negatiue. The resting vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> which, because
you say, it ys mistaken, lett vs heare your

fathers, or councells.</q>
But, Syr, how can your wysedome serue
you to think,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> that because you will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
vs to proue our doctrine, therefor we
must do it? Yf euerie Catholike Bishope
in the world, should in his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
haue mislyked, the vse of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
church in sundrie articles, yet for
the reuerence, which they owe vnto anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
they should not without euident
and manifest reason, haue lightly geauen
ouer their old orders, for the strength of
tradition ys so great, that allthough I
could see no reason why I should defend
it, yet I should not contempne their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
from whom it was receiued. For
lyke as in the Epistle vnto the Romanes
<pb facs="tcp:22571:23"/>
(which epistell traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> teacheth me to
be S. Paules) I must not blott out euerie

but reuerently thinke, that all ys well, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
my vnderstandyng be very euill:
so when the churche of Christ doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerallie
receaue and folow a custome, I
ought to iudge the best of it, allthough I
were not able to proue it. <hi>To dispute of

require of me a cause of my doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in wryting, and except I shew it owt

Lett me suppose that you browght M.
Iuell vnto me, and that he should find
me standing in this poynt of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
faith, that it ys not of necessitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in a Christen man to receiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

you) say vnto me either wysely, either
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:22571:23"/>
lernedly agaynst me? you would make
hym, (I know) to speake after this sort,
that I haue no sufficient proufe, owt of
Scriptures, Doctours, or Councells, to
make for me. Yes Syr (would I answer)
and please you, I haue sufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
for my beleife therein, but I am not
disposed to tell you of it, and I would not
care to take a blowe for so answering a
Bisshope. Yes Mary (shall he saye) if you
had any, you would alleage it, and except
you tell me of one or other, you shall be
accounted to make only an auaunt, and
in deed to haue nothing. And here, I
trow, if all Catholikes should hold their
peace, in lyke manner as I do, it should
be declared at Paules crosse the next sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
folowing, that the papistes haue no
one sentence or word to make for them,
in all Scripture, Doctours and Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cells.
Well Sir then, allthough this be to much
iniury and oppression, because the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
were not disposed to refell your
negatiue, therevpon to conclude, that
they are able to say nothing: I will yet
goe further with you, and graunt for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb facs="tcp:22571:24"/>
sake, that which for truth sake
is to be denyed. And what is that? for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soth
that I haue no other cause in all the
world, for defence of the article which
I mentioned, but only this one, that it
hath very long, and quietly continued.
How say you in this case? wyll you stand
still vpon the negatiue, which for trying
of your wysedome, I graunt vnto you?
And to keepe your negatiue, wil you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that receiuyng in one kynd only, hath
not ben long vsed in the church? No ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely,
that can you not doe, because it is
so playne and euident, that receiuyng in
one kynd hath continuance of tyme, and
approued practise of Christendome for
it, that your selues doe crye out and gap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

togeather before you were breathed
owt in to the worlde, all Christendome,
as in sundrie other pointes, so in that all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
was miserablie deceaued. How then?
you will perchaunse proue vnto me, that
my argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t is not good, because all the
world hath hytherto ben seduced. And
truly, what other thing you might say, I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:22571:24"/>

you that I haue no Scripture, Doctour,
or Councel, for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion in both kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
and when you should not well call
me vnreasonable, for dwelling against
you in that article and opinion, alleage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sent and vse of Christendome
for me: either you must declare, that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of myne to be nothing worth the
staying vpon: or els you must hold your
peace, as hauing no more to saye vnto
me: or els you must repete your begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
againe, and harpe madlye vpon one
string, in telling me that I can shew no
sufficient sentence, exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ple, or authoritie,
why co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion should be geauen vnder
one kynd only. Now, as you haue to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

and as your hart is to great in you to be
tongtyde, so must it remaine that you wil
refell my argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, and tell me that I doe
not safelye and wiselie, to haue in regard
and estimation a generall consent of all
Christendome. After which bold saying,
you must come to the particulars, and
shew by councell, doctor, example or
<pb facs="tcp:22571:25"/>
scripture, that the whole church may be
fouly deceaued, and I miscarye in the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
of her. At which point if you tell
me of pilgrimages, images, pardons, or
purgatorie (with the misusing or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of which the church doth neuer bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re)
I must answer you, that thei appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
to an other tyme, and that you should
more properlie talke of communion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both kyndes, of which our question
is instituted, and of which you make your
selfe sure. In which matter, if you can and
will proue the whole world to haue ben
deceaued: then shall you be dryuen from
the rest vpon your negatiue, and take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
you the person of a plainetyfe, in prouing
vnto vs, that one kynd alone should not
be ministred, but both of necessitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
And if you refuse to doe so, you
shall hold your peace, and hold downe
your head for all your negatiue, which you
thought should defend you, because I put
the case so, that I would graunt you your
negatiue. Wherefor M. Iuells inuention
of his negatiue, hath neither so great wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
nor lernyng, as you suppose, because
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22571:25"/>
it would neuer serue hym, if the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
should tell hym plainely, either that
he would not, either that he could not
answer hym. Now, as concernyng all this
question of apposing and answering, and
all the shiftes lykewyse, and practisies,
which are conu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>eighed vnder the name of
negatiues, it should haue beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>med right
well the professors of a new Ghospell,
not to haue made their cheife defence
vpon the weaknes (if any should be) or
behauyor of their aduersaries, but openly
and willingly to haue vttered their good
tydinges: and not to inuent in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
what might greue the aduersary, but
rather to haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> euery occasion, which
had ben able to edifie. Now, because you,
which haue taken vpon you the defence
(as you call it) of the truth against the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie
of priuate masse, doe leaue the
further discussing of these matters, vnto
some other meeter places, I shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

But this much yet is clearly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:26"/>
that whereas it hath ben hytherto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched,
that the Catholikes had no one

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie
vnto common, so the church hath
no priuate masse. But if a priuate masse
be vnderstanded for a masse in which the

hym: the church in deed doth alow sole
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22571:26"/>
receiuyng. Mary, the terme of <hi>priuate</hi> is
not properlye hers, but inuented in the
scholes of heretikes. This distinction then
being layed, the master of the defence,
which wryteth against hym, is very much
greaued with his plaine dealing, as one
which could be well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tent to fight with
his twohandsword, and so to chainge fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
one sense to an other, that he might not
be directly ouercummed. And therefor
in his anger, whereas the Catholike spake
it very sadlye, that the church acknouled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
no priuate masse, as priuate is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
vnto common, he madlye alleageth:</p>
               <q>That in deed we haue ben very bountifull

if you can descant vpon diuerse matters,
and make gaye voluntary sport vpon no

wretched men, which make merchandyse
of their masses? yf you can proue, that
the church of Christ, doth not teache
her scholars, that the masse is a common
and no priuate seruice: then should you
speake vnto the purpose somwhat, and
be thought to write grauely: but when
you can say nothing to the matter, to
obiect against vs the bestowing of masses
for monie, such as the church neuer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
we can gather no better sense he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
then that you can pleasauntly dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
And thus much for the first vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of priuate Masse. Touching
the other significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of <hi>priuate,</hi> by which
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22571:27"/>
the heretikes haue meaned sole recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
the church doth hold, that the priest
may receiue alone at his masse, if no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate with him. Against
which conclusion, what one wyse word
haue you to bring furth? Marie, you find
fault, that the Catholike requireth you
to proue the affirmatiue, which is, that
euerie priest owght, when he receiueth,
to haue a cumpanie to receiue with him,
which is a shift (as you saie) of him that
mistrusteth his quarel. Then further, you
blame hym, that the question being of
priuate masses, he maketh his issue in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
receiuing. And you aske the question:</p>
               <q>Is there no difference (thinke you) between
sole receiuing and priuate Masse?<note place="margin">Defence.</note> doth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
one that receiueth alone, saye a priuate
Masse?</q>
               <p>Aske not this question of Catholikes,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
but of Luthera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s. For the Catholikes haue
no such priuate masse, as you haue made.
It is the Lutherans inuention, whom it
pleased to call that seruice and office of
the church a priuate masse, in which the
priest receiueth alone. Which office the
<pb facs="tcp:22571:28"/>
church calleth masse, and the Lutherans
nickname it <hi>priuate,</hi> because of sole recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
The church therefor doth not saie,
that he, which receiueth alone, saieth a
masse, or that sole receiuing and a priua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
masse are all one, but she openlie tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
you that in deed no masse is priuate:
yet because she hath to doe with hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and for better expedition of matters
is contended to vse their termes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
the Catholikes of this tyme doe call
that a priuate masse, at which the priest
receiueth alone, which they do not, out
of their owne bokes, but because they
read emong the heretikes, that they haue
such a sense of priuate masse. Wherefor
you haue done verie vnskilfullie to tell vs
of Tully &amp; Panetius, and to require that
we should define <hi>priuate masse</hi> vnto you,
which haue not ben the inuentors and
first authors of that terme. And if the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans
for the breeding of suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and
bringing furth of errours, haue so folishly
mengled sole receauing and masse togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that it is proued an absurditie, that
he which receiueth alone, sayth thereby a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22571:28"/>
priuate masse: lett the shame light vpon
their heades, and not vpon the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.
And yet for all this you will make vs
beleiue, that we must define a priuate
masse, and whether we will or no, you wil
define it for vs. But it is well yet that you
amend the matter, in saying that you will
shew out of our owne authors (not what
we take, but) what you take our priuate
masse to be.</p>

from the common, it ys such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
as may well becum perchaunse
your pregnant witt, but it ys not, I assure
you, in the Catholike doctrine. Yet, lett vs
consider the framyng of your definition.
<hi>A priuate masse</hi> (saie you of your owne
head by the Catholikes) <hi>ys a sacrifice.</hi> In
deed, if you vnderstand by masse, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of the bodie and bloud of Christ,
so is masse properly a sacrifice: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that you in reprouyng the partes
and ceremonies vsed in the celebration
thereof, and the common people togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with you do vnderstand it more lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelye,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22571:29"/>
you should not without some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
so absolutelie haue called it a
sacrifice, whereas in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>moner sense,
it ys taken for that office or seruice of the
church, not which is it selfe a sacrifice, but
within which there is offered vp a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
And therefor if I would not, without
addition, saie, of the masse it selfe which
we hold and defend, that it ys a sacrifice,
(except I would speake figuratiuelie, and
call that which doth conteine, by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the thing which is conteined) how
much lesse would I saie that a priuate
masse is a sacrifice. But you add further
vnto your definition, <hi>it ys a sacrifice vsed
in place of the Lorde his supper:</hi> which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
do sound so strangely, that a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
would neuer vse them, as which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiueth
that he hath, not any such thing
which is in place of our Lord his supper,
but that vndoubtedly he hath the same
meate, which was geauen to the Apostels
the night before Christ suffered, and that
he enioyeth the selfesame supper in deed.
Againe to make vp your definition, you
saie <hi>that it ys a sacrifice by one priest alone
<pb facs="tcp:22571:30"/>
offered to God the father:</hi> As who might
thinke, that there were some kynd of mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
in which more priestes then one dyd
offer vp sacrifice. And againe, these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of <hi>one priest alone,</hi> were craftely thrust
in to the heape, that thereof might be
gathered some argument of priuate mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se.
It foloweth further: <hi>which sacrifice with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
any to participate with hym he may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie
&amp;c.</hi> But why doe you make mention
of participantes with the priest? might he
then, applie the effect of the sacrament,
when any would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate with hym?
And is this it which greiueth you, that he
may applie it without any to participate?
Who doth not se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> (which is a Catholike,
or els but indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t and lerned) that you
labor as much as you may to bring in such
phrases by which Ã  priuate masse might
be suspected? for leaue out these wordes
of (<hi>one priest alone</hi>) and (<hi>without any to
participate with hym</hi>) there is nothing in
the definition, which might be enforced
to serue for masse priuate. And yet when
thei be added, we do right well know that
thei are not essentiall poyntes of a masse.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22571:30"/>
Wherefor I might iustly saie, that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of a priuate masse, which you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the Catholikes, is farr vnmeete
for their lernyng, as being vnproper, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall,
superfluous, and wandering. But
for all this, you will proue the truth of
this definition vnto vs, wherein I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

thinges impossible. But yet let vs
geaue you the hearing.
<q>All your sort-doe rasshlie confesse,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> and

But first let me heare of what you spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke?<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
Did you not goe aboute to define a

one of those .xx. shall not be ium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
vp togeather in one definition of
masse. But all this while, how proue you
that we define a priuate masse in such sort
as you haue inuented? You might haue
made it probable, if you had said that we
define Masse, after the same manner as
you report (and yet you should haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
a lye, for all your sight in our authors)
but you can neuer be able to shew, that
we make such definition of a priuate mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
whereas so expressely we answer you,
that we haue no masse priuate. But it is
to be noted the authoritie, with which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:22571:31"/>
you make your conclusions.
<q>I do therefor (say you) take priuate masse
to be not onlye as you &amp;c haue wrested it,<note place="margin">Defence.</note>
but as it was commonly vsed in the world
before, and as it was sett furth in your
scholemen, to the great defacing of Christ

Yf you haue any face at all of Ã  true man,<note place="margin">Replie.</note>
shew in what place of any scholeman, any
such priuate masse is spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of as you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine.
And I would allso that you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
whether you will take this word
(priuate) in such sense as by the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans
it is apointed, to expresse sole recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
For allthough you ioyne your issue
with vs, about this definition of priuate
masse which your selfe haue inuented: yet
you will not refuse alltogeather, to take
priuate masse as we do (thorough the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of certen heretikes) for sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing.
Which whether you do, because
you would not seeme to graunt vnto the
Catholikes, that priuate masse hath ben
in the primitiue church (which is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
easelie, vnderstanding by it sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing)
or rather because you would
haue some libertie to hyde your selfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:22571:32"/>
ambiguities, and thereby to troble
your aduersarie, when he shold not know
where to find you, as I feare them bothe,
so I wil not determyn vpon any one. But
if you mynd to stand with vs vpon that
definition of priuate masse, which you
haue made, we saie that there is no such
thing emong vs, as you do enforce your
selfe to proue owt of owr authors. And
yet if you will put out the word (<hi>priuate</hi>)
which you neuer lerned of vs, for the rest
we will abyde by all that which the church
hath receiued and delyuered, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cernyng
our sacrifice, and the value of it, and in
what sense the priest may applie a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
proper to some peculiar person.</p>
               <p>And therefor, when you will, begyn, and
you shall be answered: or rather answer
when you can, for we haue allreadie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon.
We, I meane, Catholikes, which
speake in all tonges, that if you find not
our argumentes in Englisshe, yet you may
resort to the Italian, Spaynisshe, French,

Luther hath ioyned vnto the masse, as

then shall we ioyne this issue with you,

folow, that none might or should be vsed at
these daies. For many thinges were then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted,
which now are permitted. And
many thinges were not extant then in the
church, which now are to be maynteined.
Examples hereof may be perceaued in was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of feete,<note place="margin">10. 13. Act. 15. Luc. 22. Cyp. ser. 5. de laps.</note> in absteinyng from bloud, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuyng
of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t after supper, in how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seling
of infantes, in temporalties of Bishopes,
and Christenyng of Princes. To call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
such thinges to the state of the primitiue
church, ys, to inforce a taule man to returne
to his swathing clothes. Againe, men at that
tyme were so well disposed, that it was no wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if at euerie masse there were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:
but now there ys such coldnes of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that if we should allwaies tarie for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantes,
we should verie seldome haue any
masse at all. Furthermore, the people are not
commaunded, but counselled only to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentation
of their housell, but the priestes
are commaunded to celebrate oftentymes.
Therefor it ys no reason, that a dutie should
be omitted, and the priest made to waite vpon
the pleasure of the laitie.</hi> And so he shortly
concludeth, that, <hi>to prescribe of necessitie,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:22571:33"/>
that there ought to be a cumpanie to receiue
with the priest, it is an itching folie.</hi> But
now, against these reasons of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
what saieth the M. of the defence?
<q>You would seeme to take from vs,<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 8.</note> the true
and right rule to reforme the church of
Christ?</q>
You be verie suspitiouse Syr,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> or verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious.
For no other thing was gone
aboute in this third chapiter, but that
all thinges should not be required to be
done, as thei were vsed in the primitiue
church. Which conclusion, do you sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

Nay, you confesse it to be so euident and

with hym, because of the speaking
of it. Here now it may appeare, who lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
out of the light, or who draweth
back. For, whereas you without distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
haue abused the name of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
church, and made so litle rekonyng
of these last .ixC. yeares, and more, as
though you would admit no other thing,
then that which should be proued to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the example of the primitiue
church: what thing is more necessarie to
be spoken of, then that discretion is to
be vsed in this matter, and that all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
are not absolutlie to be reduced vnto
the paterne of the primitiue church? For
allthough you, for your owne part, be of
such iudgement, that you can make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
betwene thinges necessarie and
indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t: yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the multitude of light
heades, do heare you to appeale simplie
to the primitiue church, and to crake that
the right and true reformation, ys from
thence to betaken: thei fall in to such a
conceit by and by, that except the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes
can bring all their orders from
the primitiue church, thei will not be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22571:34"/>
by them. And if I were so suspitious
as you, I could saie that your owne prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
and masters do seeme to be of the
same opinion, when thei make so exact
rekonyng vpon the tyme, in which orders
haue by holy men ben brought in to the
church, as though nothing were to be
permitted, but that which hath come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the Apostles, or that those thinges should
be alltogeather now aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tike, which were
vsed in the primitiue church. But if the
Catholike hath ben superfluous, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of that which no man (as you saie)
hath denyed, if you wyll charitablie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geaue
hym this once, he shall within the
turnyng of one leaffe in your defence, do
the lyke again for you. And now (I trow)
we do agree in this one poynt, that for
ceremonies and thinges indifferent, we
are not bound vnto the Apostells tyme.
In what thinges then are we bound to do
after the example of the Apostels, and
the primitiue church?</p>
               <q>In truth of doctrines and right vse of sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 10.</note>
as thinges in the church most necessarie.</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And you doe alleage this cause of your
<pb facs="tcp:22571:35"/>
so saying:</hi> In doctrine there is but one veritie,
and but one right vse of the sacramentes.</p>
               <p>If I were able precisely to know,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> what
you meane by the right vse of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
I could sone answer you, how
farfurth we agree with you in this part
of your distinction. For to receiue in the
morning or euening, to receiue fasting
or after meales, and to receiue with cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
or alone, they be such thinges as
you may, at your pleasure, vnderstand by
the right vse of the Sacrament, or saie to
disagree from the right vse of it.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> For in
S. Paules tyme emong the Corinthians
they vsed to receiue at night about sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
tyme, and they made no matter of
conscience, if they had dined that daie
before. And you can not saie, but, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the breaking of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes,
or takyng of their suppers, they dyd
in that beginnyng of the church, rightly
vse the Sacrament. Yf therefor the vse of
the Sacrament, ys to be taken for that
manner and order which they rightly v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at the begynnyng in receauyng of the
sacramentes, I denie vnto you, that the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22571:35"/>
right vse of them, is to be accompted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
preceptes and lawes vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
For the right vse is but one (you saie)
and therefor lyke as thei of the Apostells
tyme, dyd sitt togeather in the church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
euening, and receiue, either after or
before other meates, Christ his verie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
body: so should we do now of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
in these daies, or els we vse not
the sacrament rightly. To which case, if
you will answer, that tyme, place, and
maner of supping with common meates
(which then were vsed) do nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine
to the right vse of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t,
so shall I againe inferr, that number of
communicantes, and receiuing in one or
both kyndes, are as litle required to the
right vse of the sacrament. Therefor, to
auoid the occasion of stryuing, which
could not but be geauen if one part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanded
not the other, our meanyng
is this, that in the articles of our faith and
necessary doctrine, we haue to keepe one
veritie, which hath ben from the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng:
but in canons and orders which haue
ben added sence, vnto the substance of
<pb facs="tcp:22571:36"/>
our religion, the church of Christ is not
so straictly bound vnto them, but that she
may, with discretion, abrogate, or alter
them, or permit the discontinuance of
them. And in this kynd of orders we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the vse of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes, which
in substance are to this daie one with tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
of the primitue church, do thei neuer
so much differ in ceremonies, circunstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and manner of vsing them. We do
not therefore graunt vnto you, that the
right vse of the sacrament ys but one, or
that the vse of a sacrament is in the same
authoritie and estimation, as the truth of
doctrine is. For he which receiueth alone
(if he be in state of grace) doth well, and
he which receiueth with cumpanie doth
wel, if his liffe be cleane. And then againe,
a conclusion in doctrine can neuer be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued,
but in receiuing of sacramentes,
diuers vses may be permitted, except you
doubt, whether both parties should be
thought baptised a right, of which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
were but once dipped, the other thrise
wasshed and perfunded. Wherefore the
vse of the sacramentes being<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> with vs a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22571:36"/>
thing indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in it selfe, (allthough not

church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> For when you had said in
one sentence, (<hi>For the vse of ceremonies,

the Apostles tyme, and the primitiue church,</hi>)
in the next sentence folowing, you call
for redresse, according to the scripture
and primitiue church, not only for vse of
sacramentes, or false opinions, (which are
referred to the first member of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction)
but allso as concerning cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
which allthough you call super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,
that you might seeme to haue
some iust cause of taking them awaie, yet
you do against right dealing, to call vs to
the primitiue churche for ceremonies,
which you said before were in themselues
indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t. And here loe you make a rule,
and saie,<note place="margin">Fo. 10. &amp;. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>that nothing is to be added vnto the
first ordinances of the law, and that we must
<pb facs="tcp:22571:37"/>
bring thinges vnto the institution of Christ.</hi>
And againe: <hi>that we must not harken what
other dyd before vs, but what Christ first dyd,
that was before all.</hi> And yet againe: <hi>That,
that ys true, that was first ordeined: and that
ys corrupted, that ys after done:</hi> which rule
yf you wyll haue to be vnderstanded in
suche matters as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerne immutable do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
then haue you proued that thing
which none of ours denyeth vnto you,
and so you are all fallen in to the same
lapse, for which you misliked with others.
But if you vnderstand generally, by truth
of doctrine, the vse of Sacramentes and
ceremonnies, then haue you much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goten
yout selfe, which euen now made
ceremonies, indifferent. But if you do it
for that purpose, that a Catholike should
not know where to haue you, allthough
I seeme to aske your losse, yet, for truth
sake, amend that fasshion. And perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>se
this myght be amended allso, that you
do not trulie alleage your testimonies,
saying that to be Saint Cyprianes in his
Epistle vnto Cecilius, which is not at all
to be found there, but in his goodly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise

                  <hi>Thou art Peter</hi> (that is to

alleage the doctours, and how much they
make for you, it wyll be perceaued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we haue ended. Hytherto let it be
marked, that we refuse your rule of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorting
to the first institution for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
about the vse of the Sacramentes.
Because the vse of them is a thing indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and it neither maketh neither mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to receiue alone or with cumpanie,
and to receiue in one or in both kyndes,
or at night or in the morning, or thrise
in the yere, or ones in all our liffe, so that
the church be obeied.</p>
               <p>And now we will come to an other
part of this third chapiter, in which you
do excedingly reproue the Catholike,
because of the similitude of a taull man
and infant, which he vsed to the openyng
<pb facs="tcp:22571:38"/>
of his purpose, and confounding of his
aduersarie. Which so much displeaseth
you, that you saie:
<q>I assure you it was neuer inuented without
the spirite of Antichrist,<note place="margin">Defence. fol. 11.</note> nor can not be
mainteined withowt blasphemye agaynste
Christ, and singular reproch of his Apostells
and their successors.</q>
Syr,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> I beseche you to pacifie yourselfe, and
to vse the matter so calmelie and quietly,
as you promised to do in the end of the .ij.
chapiter. Consider, I pray you first, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Catholike hath such a meaning,
as yon make sense vpon hym. Let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herse
faithfully the wordes of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
and then as farr as your grammar
rules will suffer you, make your constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
vpon them. He had spoken before,
of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mones of all thinges in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue
church,<note place="margin">Apol. of priuate Masse fol. 5.</note> of miracles, of couering
of womens faces, of temporalties of Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopes,
of receiuyng after supper, of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
of blouddinges, and houseling of
infantes, of which all he saieth in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a conclusion: <hi>To call such thinges
to the state of the Apostles tyme, and of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22571:38"/>
primitiue church againe, ys nothing els but
to enforce a taule man, to come to his swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deling
clothes, and to crie alarme in his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
againe.</hi> These loe be his very wordes,
in which, do your worst, and tell vs what
fault you find? <hi>He resembleth the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
church</hi> (saie you) <hi>to infancie,</hi> wich si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
you terme, as please you, <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention
of Antichrist, a blasphemie against
Christ, and singular reproch of his Apostells.</hi>
But see now, herein how much you be
deceaued. The Catholike doth not (as
you weene) saie, that alltogeather that
church was an infant, but in such thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
as he speake of, concerning order or
dispensation which then was vsed in the
church, he saieth, and saieth it truly, that
to require that all thinges shold be now
in these daies obserued, as thei were then
vsed, it were no more nor better, then to
bring a taule man to his swadeling clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes
againe. And yet, as though he had
made no more of the primitiue church,
then as if none but boyes had lyued in it,
so you ful manly reason against hym, and
proue your selfe to lacke discr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22571:39"/>
For you saie:
<q>Yf that tyme were the state of infancie in
the church,<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 11.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Christ hymselfe instructed,
when hys Apostles taught, when the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gouerned next their tyme:<note place="margin">A fond col<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lection of the <hi>M.</hi> of the defence</note> then we
must needes recken Christ, the Apostles, the
fathers, to be infantes in religion, to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
in gouernement of the church.</q>
Yf we must needes do so as you saie,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> then
is there no remedie. But certenlie it is
wonder vnto me, how any such necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
should be concluded: yea allthough
I would affirme it, that not only in a few
particular causes, but allso co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cernyng the
whole state of her, the church was then in
her infancie. For allthough the whole
house be full of childerne, yet it must not
straitwaies folow, that the goodman and
the goodwiffe must needes be childerne.
Or if in a schole of one hundred of scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
the best is not come vnto his Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme,
or the institutions of Caluyne in
Englisshe, (bokes which will sone make
one a Doctour) it must not folow of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
that the master vnderstandeth not
his accidence. The Apostells of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyor

was Christ our master to be reckened
for an ignorant person? For so runneth
your wyse reason, <hi>that if that tyme were
the state of infancie, then we must needes rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Christ to be an infaent in religion.</hi> The
Christians allso, after the ascension of
Christ, and preaching of the Apostles,
were for the most part fraile and weak,
of which the Apostle had need to saie:
<hi>If a man be preuented in any fault. &amp;c.</hi> And

thei were vnable to heare hym. But
you, to make your part the stronger, do

childerne, which in further processe of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
serue for their profit and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:
so the wysedom of God, which was
abundantly in his Apostells and their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours,
did not straitwaies put furth in
writyng all misteries, but as occasion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
required, so it brought furth in
to the open knouledge of the church, the
auncient and Apostolical verities. I might
allso saie, that because the church then,
was, in externall shew, both poore and
naked, and subiect to persequutions, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor
it was in her infancie, but now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
it is so glorious, so strong, and mightie,
that she hath the Princes of the world o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
and subiect vnto her, and hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blely
spreaden herselfe ouer the cumpasse
of the whole world, it is no great absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie
(I trow), if she be said to haue co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to a perfect age and stature. Which
yet, if you will call dotage, because of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
euill maners and enormities extant in
<pb facs="tcp:22571:41"/>
her, I would not striue with you vpon it,
concernyng some members of her, if you
dyd so speake without priuy spite and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
But yet this doth folow, that the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
was then, by our saying, in her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
which now is come, as you report, to
her dotage. And as infancie then, dyd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
preiudicate vnto her wysedome, by
which she was well able to gouerne and
rule her childerne, so her dotage now,
which is seen in the liffe of manie, doth
nothing excuse you, for contempnyng
your old mother. If therefor now, it may
be well said, in sundrie waies and senses,
that the church in the Apostells tyme, was
in a certen infancie, what spryte moued
you to make such a sense of it, as against
which you might vse your indignation,
without the matter and purpose? Or with
what honestie could you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clud, that the
Catholikes do make Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stells
infantes: of which the one, thei ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
as true God, the others, thei worship
as Doctours and Patrones of the world?

Sir, I pray you, so ernestly take the
matter, when you see the Apostle hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
not to leese any of his own strength
and wisedome, because of the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Corinthians and others: and
consider allso, whether thei might not be
called infantes, which as yet, were to be
fedd with milke. But let vs goe further
in to the chapiter.
<q>You laie the cause of priuate Masse vpon
the keycold charitie of the people,<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 14.</note> (and
perhappes the first occasion came thereof
in deede) but. &amp;c.</q>
Who tould you that this was the cause
of priuate Masse? You read it not, I am
assured, in the Apologie which you would
faine answer: and yet you buyld so much
vpon it, as though it had ben a most plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
conclusion of it. The Catholike in
<pb facs="tcp:22571:42"/>
hys Apologie sayeth, that the constant
faith, the pure liffe, the feruent charitie,
&amp;c, whiche florisshed in the primitiue
church, were causes perhappes, why no
Masse was then celebrated, but that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
Christians dyd communicate. But
what conclusion doth he inferr there v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon?
not that truely which you drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of,<note place="margin">The <hi>M.</hi> of the defence mistaketh the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> but this only which he labored to
proue, that you should not therefor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
the lyke manner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municatyng
with the priest, to be at these dayes vsed,
when the lyke deuotion and charitie ys
not in the peoples hartes grounded. He
said not, that the keycold charitie of the
people shold be the cause of priuate mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
no more then he saied that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of communicantes was the efficient
cause of saying masse, as though there
might haue ben no masse att all, except
there had ben some prepared to receiue.
Is there no difference (trou you) betwyxt
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> these ij. propositions: <hi>There were no mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
saied in the primitiue church, but there
were some readie to comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:22571:42"/>
there would haue ben no masses in the
primitiue church.</hi> The first perhappes was
true, and the cause thereof ys attributed
in the Apologie, vnto the deuotion of
the people. The second ys denied play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely
vnto you, because the sacrifice of the
church of Christ, doth not depend at all,
vpon communicantes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for lyke as in these

men may be espyed to go closely in to
some one chapple, and there saie priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
a masse, in great deuotion and silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
the cause of which is, not in the lacke
of such as would communicate, but, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with many other causes, the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
which thei haue geaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in to their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
to goe so much the further from the

                  </gap>thoritie, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to the contrary, that euen in the most

masses were saied now and then, which
you do odiously call priuate. Wherefor
<pb facs="tcp:22571:43"/>
seing there is so great fault committed

taken great peines in commentyng v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
it all out of purpose. As when yow
tell vs of many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>modities, which grow
by the oft receiuing of the sacrament &amp;c.
But who shall bring the people daily or

themselues? <hi>The priestes</hi> (saie you) <hi>should

                  <note place="margin">Defence. fo. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and tell them
plainely, that if they be gasers only and no

of God:</hi> with many other vehement sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
which for that purpose you allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
owt of S. Chrisostome. And you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the matter so easie, as though for the

vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion: whereas it doth

the people, I thinke there wold be fewer

do not lightly excede one or .ij. a quarter
in most parisshes.<note place="margin">Math. 7.</note> First therefor pluck the

you shall be better able to take a mote

men by act of parleame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, you shall

But as though you had all the lernyng of

               <p>Truly, Syr, you geaue testimonie against

you can iudge no better of colours. For
this first I trust you will graunt, that prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
and laye men are not alltogeather o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.
You must graunt allso, that as we are

so lykewyse that we haue a correspo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>dent

ioyntly togeather. Then it foloweth he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revpon:
<hi>That euery Bisshope chosen out

                  <note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>is apointed for men, in those thinges
which are to Godward, that he should offer

vp giftes and sacrifices for synnes. &amp;c.</hi> But
sacrifice for synn there is none in this law
and tyme of grace, besides the body and
bloud of our Sauyor, ergo that must be
offered. Yet no man should take an offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
vpon hym, except he were called, and
there is no place in all scripture, where
that calling ys expressed, but only in the
last supper of Christ.<note place="margin">Priestes are bound to offer.</note> therefor whereas he
in that his last supper gaue authoritie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <hi>Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

only, are bound to blesse, to breake his
body, and consequently to eate it. I saie
not that euery priest is bound to daily
frequentation of the sacrament, (which
if you thinke vs to do, you speake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
boke therein, and misreport the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes)
but concernyng the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of priesthode, and the necessitie of a
daily sacrifice, priestes are not only bound
to offer, but to prouide that there be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offering. Knowing this,<note place="margin">D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 12.</note> that it is a most
sure token of Antichrist his presence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the <hi>Iuge sacrificium,</hi> the daily sacrifice, shall
cease to be offered. For thei only are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:22571:45"/>
to that high office, and their dutie is
to folow their office. And this thing being
rightly considered of the auncient fathers,
made them so reuerently to behaue them
selues, towardes the blessed sacrament.</p>
               <p>As S. Denyse the Areopagite, speakyng of

                  <hi>that the Apostles in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,
which are the ghospells, do declare that
Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunded them to consecrate the bread
by the prayers of his word: at what tyme he
toke bread, and after thankes geauing, saied:

                  <hi>and that the high priest bringeth

furth vnto the sounes of Abraham, which do
as he dyd, bread and wyne, sayng, this is my
body. Of which bread</hi> (saieth this blessed

but sence the time that it was saied of our
Lord (do this in my remembrance, this is my

the thing is done with these wordes and this

               <p>I haue proued vnto you the contrary,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
both by reason, (because priesthode ys a

distinct office, vnto which certen onlye

allso by Doctours, as S. Denyse, Iustine,

then you byd vs to vnderstand,
<q>That S. Paule, a good interpretour of Christ

Nay Sir,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> vnderstand you this rather, that
you vnderstand not S. Paule, which in
that his chapiter alleageth the institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of Christ to this purpose, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,
by consideration of the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
of theyr common meates,
from which they were fallen vnto seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and priuate tables or suppers in the
church. And he doth tell historically,
what Christ saied vnto his disciples, not
what Christ apoynted the Corinthians
and euery other of the Christians to do.
For <hi>I haue receiued of owr Lord that which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22571:46"/>
I haue delyuered vnto you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stell.
But what meaneth he by these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<hi>I haue deliuered?</hi> he spake vnto all
the Corinthians without respect of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualtie
or temporalty, but dyd he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
by waie of instruction, or by waie of
geauing some office and function vnto
them? And that which he receiued of
Christ, did he delyuer vnto them as a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and article to be lerned, or as a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
to be exequuted? if you

meane the second, you disagree from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sense and euident truth. for if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine
vnto all Christians, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
to doe as S. Paule receaued of
Christ, and as the Corinthians receaued
of S. Paule: then must euery Christian ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
bread, geaue thankes, and breake it,
and when euery body is a minister, who
then shall be a receauer? Againe, in the
wordes of our Sauyor <hi>(Do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance

now, if you will haue these wordes of (<hi>do
this in my remembrance</hi>) to stretch as well
vnto the people, as to the high order of
priestes, then may you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>plaine not only
that thei receiue not as oft as the priest,
(which thei will not, I warrant you, for
all your greate mouyng) but allso and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they take not the bread in to
their handes, and blesse it themselues, and
say masse, such as may be called priuate in
deed. Which vnsensible and pernitiouse
folissh opinion, because you will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to enter in to your hart, therefor you
must of necessitie graunt, great differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to be, betwyxt the priest and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:22571:47"/>
and confesse that, taking, blessing,
and breaking, is so properly his, that it
can not rightly be the common peoples.
Yea marie (saie you) but
<q>Christ tooke the bread,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> &amp;c. then the priest
in his ministration must do as Christ dyd,
and no otherwyse, that is, to take breake,
and geaue vnto the people. &amp;c.</q>
Speake you this of your owne mynd,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> or
do you speake it, as it were vpon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Catholikes wordes? Yf you
thinke as you speake, why find you no

ys apointed vnto ministers, of taking the
bread in to their handes, or of blessing it,
which Christ hymselfe dyd? But if you

must be done, as Christ dyd, at his maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
what cause then moueth you, whi di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributyng
should be more required, then
taking and blessing of the holy host, which

out for that purpose, because no man
should take an office vpon hym, before he

that to shew furth the death of our Lord

Christian man his part and office, and
therevpon vntruly conclud, that <hi>Do this
in remembrance of me,</hi> (which is, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of S. Paule, to shew furth the
death of Christ vntill he come) should
in all pointes be referred as well vnto the
people, as the priest: therfor I answer fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that allthough many thinges which
Christ spake to the Apostles onlye, and
their successors, may be truly applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
euery Christian, so is it in this case of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22571:48"/>
which we talke. Christ saied vnto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
onlye, <hi>You haue not chosen me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioan. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>but
I haue chosen you.</hi> which allthough it may
be truly verified of euery Christian man,
woman, and child, (because that Christ
in deed hath chosen vs to his people, so
many other besides co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tinuing in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie
or Iuisshnes) yet it must not fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that Christ dyd not meane by those
wordes, that the Apostles were singular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
chosen vnto the proper office of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
and ministring his sacramentes.
Therfor allthough one may vse the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
<hi>(Do this in remembrance of me</hi>) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the common peoples affection,
yet it is not true that Christ had no larger
or greater meanyng in them, then that
by eatyng of his body, we should only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that he dyed for vs, which euery
one may do as well as a priest. Wherefor
Syr, as you haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cluded, that the priest
is not bound to minister to other, if there
be none to receaue, (which is quickly to
be graunted vnto you) so I say, that you
haue nothing at all proued, that Christ
his institution, stretcheth as well to the
<pb facs="tcp:22571:49"/>
people, as the priest, or that the priest
could not laufully receaue, except there
were some cumpany. But where now are
your scriptures, your Doctours, your ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
councells, and your crakes, by which
you should directly answer, to that which
is required of you. We shall perchaunse
hereafter in your defence, read many great
argumentes against vs, but in the meane
tyme, you thinke it good to prouyde for
a place of refuge, when the ouerthrow
shall be geauen vnto you. And therefor
you saie:
<q>Yf we had no scripture at all,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 18.</note> to proue that
the priest should not receaue without cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
yf ye dyd geaue vs the ouerthrow in
that, yet could ye not triumph therein, as
though ye had wonn the field.</q>
And why so, I pray you?
<q>Our contention (<hi>you answer</hi>) ys for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
Masse, &amp;c.<note place="margin">fo. 19.</note> of which sole receauyng,
ys but one part.</q>
You pitch your campe,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> Sir, in a very wyde
field, and your kind of fight is such, as we
perceaue, you would neuer be ouercum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
The church of God, whose armies
of doctrine and verities do allwaies stand
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:22571:49"/>
in good order, if she be iustly ouercu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>med
in any one thing, which she absolutelye
mainteineth, she straitwaies shall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken,
as one which is not to be credited.
But you (in whose name I will not saie)
are so trimlye prepared, that allthough
you be ouerthrowen in one of your arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
yet you will not be ouercummed in
the state of your whole religion. Yet
how well this may be graunted, lett vs
consider. Do not you distinct thinges,
some in to necessarie, some in to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent?
Do not you saie,<note place="margin">Defence fo. 10. &amp;. 18.</note> that the sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyng
of a priest by hym selfe, is not a
thing indifferent? And do not you make
a necessitie of doctrine in it, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
must receaue with the priest, or els
Christ his institution is broken? Tell me
then now further:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> Is not the church of
Christ, the pillar and staie of truth? And
can that be possiblie his church, which
would sett furth a lye? No truly. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
that the church should err in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,<note place="margin">lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to whom the Holyghost was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
to teach her all truth, and allso to

<pb facs="tcp:22571:50"/>
which she defendeth, be proued fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
I will not saie, that all the rest which
she vttered is false, but this is most certen,
that she is not the church, which is to be
folowed. Yet see, you can so dispose your
selues, that allthough you be proued ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
in one of those your articles which
you make necessary, yet you will not be
mistrusted, but that neuerthelesse you be
the true church of Christ. And whereas
the Holyghost,<note place="margin">Ioan. 16.</note> which was promised vnto
the church, doth teach her all truth, yet
you so vnderstand the matter, that for all
the ouerthrowing of one whing of your
battaile, you neuerthelesse will not leese
the whole field and victorie. Which one

lost the victorie. And it may well be, that
your tong is yet free, and that your feete
may serue you to runn in to other questi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons,
besides the purpose, but as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
the truth (which is with you in all
poyntes, if you be the true church) you
haue lost for euer the grace of it, either
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22571:50"/>
because (as we know) you can not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
sole receiuing, either because your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
saie, that if you were therein ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
you had not yet lost the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
Which is thus much in effect, that
the church of Christ, (which honor you
challenge vnto yourselfe) might in any
one article be deceaued, and teach that
sole receauyng is against the institution
of Christ, and graunt for all that, that no
ouerthrow is taken, if the cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
be proued. But lett vs consider now,
what shiftes you can make, to the disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
of our purpose?
<q>Our contention is for priuate Masse. &amp;c. of
which sole receauing is but one part.<note place="margin">Defence.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>You may freely make, as many and as
few partes as you will herein,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> because it
ys alltogeather of your owne priuate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uising.
The Catholike church, (as it is
oftentymes told you) hath no priuate
masse, and we can not find, for what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cause you nickname it a priuate mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
then, for that the priest alone recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.
And if we hitherto haue not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed
your meaning, your selues are
<pb facs="tcp:22571:51"/>
very much to blame, which haue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
it vnto vs. All be it, if one may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to an others mynd, by considering his
waies in reasonyng, we can thinke no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but that you meane the priestes so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
receauing without the people, by the
name of priuate masse, because in all
your speakyng against it, you argue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and only against sole receauing.
Which whether we haue concluded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you or no, what haue you to the
contrary? This you saie:
<q>It folowth not,<note place="margin">Defence. fol. 19.</note> to saie, the priest in case of
necessitie, when none will receaue, may take
the Sacrament alone, therefore he may do
it without necessitie, when he may haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to communicate with hym.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yeas truly,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> it foloweth very well. for if
it be so as you report, that the right and
necessarie vse of the sacrament, ys, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
it with cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>panie, then can the priest
neuer receaue it alone by hymselfe, what
so euer necessitie should come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> hym.
for in such thinges as apperteyne to the
substance of the sacrament, no creature
can lawfully vse the contrary vnto them.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22571:51"/>
But sole receauing seemeth to be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of yow to vs, in case of necessitie,
(which prouision or exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you proue
not hytherto, out of the expresse word
of God), ergo it is no part of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
substance, which must be obserued
about the sacrament. And if it be not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential,
then doubtles it may be dispensed
with all, then allso may the Church of
Christ without breach of his institution,
lett the priestes alone with their sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyng.
what say you then? ys receauing
with cumpanie necessarie? if you saye,
yea: then is it for no mans pleasure or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
in any case to be altered. Yf you
saie, no, that is, if you graunt it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different:
why then might nor the priest
receaue alone, for any commaundement
of Christ or his Apostels? And what law
haue you, either of God or good man,
that chargeth hym, to haue alwaies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantes
with hym? And this I speake
concernyng your weake argument, and
allso of the libertie which is in the priest,
if he be disposed to vse it: Allthough in
deed that you can not shew the example,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:52"/>
where the priest dyd receaue alone whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
others would communicate with hym.
But now Syr, I pray you, come neerer
to the matter, and shew vnto vs due and
good proufes against the priests sole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauyng.
<q>Because ye vrge so ernestly,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 19.</note> to haue due prou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe

people will not communicate, I will shew you
some reasons: But before I enter. &amp;c.</q>
Take our whole meanyng with you,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> Sir,
we require to haue your proufes, against

you doe perceaue the ground vpon

(what so euer he be) which moued yow.
You saie then:
<q>I will shew you some reasons.<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 19.</note> But before I

that if our reasons, were not so well

before you come to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
You saied a litle before, that if we dyd

not triumph: and now you warne vs, that
if your reasons be not so well able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22571:53"/>
necessitie, (which is ment, I trow, by
the necessitie of some to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate with
the priest) that yet we could not conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
our purpose, because our priuate masse
is nothing lesse then necessitie, (by which
necessitie, you vnderstand, I thinke, the
lacke of communicantes, when the priest
would receaue) wherein if I do not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that in particular cases, and for extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

without any iniurie done vnto the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

and neither to more nor lesse: then shall
we not celebrate before dyner, or in a
cope or surplesse, or with psalmes, orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and solempnitie, such as you allso
vse, because we must do nothing els but
that, which Christ did, as your maior im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.
Now if you be to wise and ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to thinke that in such a generall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we ought to do as Christ did at his
last supper, then haue you iust cause to
correct your maior, and we can not but
deny it, vntil we may vnderstand of your
limitation, which you will (we trust) add
vnto it. And what limitation might that
be, which being added, we would graunt
your proposition. Forsoth if for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<hi>institution,</hi> you woulde put <hi>tradition.</hi>
For what so euer Christ dyd about the
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>secrating or delyuering of his pretious
body, it may be truly saied, that he dyd it
in his institution, but yet such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancies
as he then vsed, are not beleeued
to be his tradition. For it is allso one
thing, to saie, <hi>thys is Christ his institution,</hi>
and it hath a farr other meanyng, to saie,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:56"/>
                  <hi>Christ dyd this in his institution.</hi> For his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
importeth a law, and is directly
to be obserued, but the phrase of <hi>in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi>
importeth a signification of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
and place, and circumstancies, within
which his institution was vttered. Which
thinges, as thei be not essentiall, but stand
only about the substance, themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accidentall and chaingeable, so thei
may be, without all hurt, altered, as the
church shall thinke good and conuenient.
Therefor, as I graunt, that in matter of
weight and substance, Christ onlye, and
no other, is to be folowed: so in that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ner of speach, which you do vse,
I am sure, it can neuer be proued. Yeas
saie you:

of your countriemen, such as can

not once or twyse, that you appeale vnto
this epistle of S. Cypriane, I will therefor
sumwhat at large, shewe it furthe in this
place, to the Reader, that he take good
heed for euer, of geauing hastie creditt,
vnto strainge and newfound teachers.</p>
               <p>There were in S. Cyprians tyme, some
such priestes, which, either for simplicitie,
or for custome sake, or for certen deuout
causes, dyd offer vp at the tyme of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
not wyne and water togeather,
but only water by itselfe. Against whose
doinges in that point, S. Cypriane most
ernestlye writeth,<note place="margin">Cyprian. li. 2. epi. 3.</note> and it is the only scope
and marke, at the which he shooteth in
all that long epistle: alleaging first the
example of Melchisedech,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>which brought
furth bread and wyne, for he was the priest
of God most highest:</hi> afterwardes the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Salomon,<note place="margin">Prouer. 9</note> 
                  <hi>how that wysedome killed

then further, the prophesie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>acob, spea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
of his soun Iuda in the figure of

                  <hi>when he saw the vestmentes of Christ
full of redd spottes, as if he had come lately
from the wynepresse:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 26.</note> he alleageth allso the
institution of Christ,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> and the testimonie
of S. Paule, by which both places he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
that we should offer vp not water
onlye, but allso wyne. Then he maketh
further argument, saying,<note place="margin">That wyne and water should be mengled togeather in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of wyne and water in the chalice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather,
doth signifie the coniunction of
Christ and his church, and that if wyne
be offered vp alone, the bloud of Christ
is without vs: and that if water alone be
offered vp, then the people begyn to be
without Christ. Which reason of his, if
you wyll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tempne, I am sory, that S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
hath so sone displeased you, whom
you seemed to make so much of, before.
But as concernyng the argument of that
epistle, he proueth by those testimonies,
which I haue touched, and by many other
waies, that in the offering, which the priest
maketh, water and wyne bothe, are to be
mengled, and that it was Christ his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
so to doe, and that Christ only is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:22571:57"/>
to be folowed therein, and that we must
do herein no other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> that which
Christ hymselfe dyd first of all. Now, Sir,
then, with what face can you alleage S.
Cyprian, for proufe of your proposition
which is generall, whereas he speaketh of
water and wyne to be mengled, when the
priest doth sacrifice, which us a speciall
case onlye? And see how the dyuel dyd
owe you a shame. If you wyll refuse Saint
Cyprian in that place, then standeth your
maior like a miserable proposition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any similitude of defence. If you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
S. Cyprian, how standeth your reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
in whose communion and Lordes
table, water and wyne are not mengled
togeather, which should be so duly and
necessarily obserued? Will you saie here
that the field is not lost, and that this is
but an ouerthrow of one wing only? Do
you fight for the victorie, and not for the
veritie? so that you may be semed to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve
somwhat allwaies to saie, do you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
no conscience nor rekonyng, of your
vniust and foule plaie? Answer directly
vnto this one argument, or confesse your
<pb facs="tcp:22571:58"/>
falsehode or ignorance, and geaue ouer
your stryuing against the manifest veritie.
If all thinges are to be obserued in such
manner as Christ hath them instituted:
wherefor haue you no water in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
which Christ (as S. Cyprian proueth)
hath so solemply delyuered?<note place="margin">Let this be answered.</note> Now, on the
other syde, if some thinges may be well
vnfolowed, which Christ hymselfe apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
why make you such a generall stou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
proposition, which by yourselfe is so
quicklye neglected? For the mixture of
wyne and water in the chalice, you can
not saie that you haue no authoritie of
scripture, no example of primitiue church,
no testimonie of auncient Doctour, for
in that one epistle of Saint Cypriane, of
which we speake, which you seeme not
to haue readen onlye, but allso to alow,
you shall find all those places, by which
the veritie of this tradition may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Where then is your memorie? That
which S. Cyprian of purpose declareth,
of the mixture of wyne and water in the
chalice, you either see not, or regard not.
and that which you put furth of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:22571:58"/>
obseruing and keeping whatsoeuer
Christ dyd in the institution of his sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is not at all in that epistle, and yet
you can read it there proued at large.
And here now,<note place="margin">Note dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tly how S. Cyprian ys miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strued, and the reader abused by the <hi>M.</hi> of the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce.</note> I haue to saie further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
you, that you do not rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete,
not only his mynd, but not so much
as his wordes. For whereas that blessed
martir saieth: <hi>Admonitos autem nos scias, vt in calice offerendo, dominica traditio ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetur<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
which is: <hi>Know you further, that we
be warned, that in offering of the chalice,
the tradition of our Lord be kept.</hi> you interprete
it after this fasshion: <hi>Do you know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for,
that we be admonisshed, that in offering
the sacrament of the Lords bloud, his owne
institution should be kept.</hi> For examinyng of
which your interpretation, if you should
be brought, but vnto a Grammar schole,
<hi>dominica traditio,</hi> is to shortly Englisshed,
<hi>his owne institution,</hi> and, <hi>in calice offerendo,</hi>
is to ignorantly Englisshed, <hi>in the offering
of the sacrament of the Lords bloud.</hi> so that
I beleeue verely, if the Scholemaster were
not very much a sleepe, he would beare
softly at your backe doore, and make you
<pb facs="tcp:22571:59"/>
to remember yourselfe better. But if litle
regard be taken of construction, which is
made in scholes, yet it is to be prouyded
diligently, that no false construction be
sett furth in print, especially in such kind
of matter, as apperteineth vnto our sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
and is of so great weight and efficacie,
that it maketh or marreth an heresie. You
Englissh <hi>traditio,</hi> not <hi>tradition,</hi> but <hi>institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
And whi rather institution, then tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
Verely for no other cause, I thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
but for that you abhorr the name of
tradition, and because you would seeme
to the ignorant Reader, to be a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorer
of Christ his institution. You En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glisshe,
<hi>in calice offerendo,</hi> after this sort,
<hi>in offering the sacrament of the Lords bloud,</hi>
and whi not rather, <hi>in offering the chalice,</hi>
as the wordes themselues do signifie? You
had no litle craft in your mynd, when you
sett vpon the translating of this plaine
sentence, and for the word, <hi>chalice,</hi> to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute,
<hi>the sacrament of the Lords bloud,</hi> it
was a deceitfull enterprise. For if you
would haue plainely saied (as S. Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
wordes do signifie) that, <hi>in offering
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:22571:59"/>
the chalice the tradition of our Lord be kept,</hi>
the diligent Reader would haue ben mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to require, what tradition that should
be, which must be obserued in offering
the chalice? and he should be truly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it was the tradition of vsing not
wyne alone or water alone, but water and
wyne both, in the chalice, togeather.
which would much disgrace your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
But when you make S. Cyprian
to sound after this sense, that, <hi>in offering
the sacrament of the Lords bloud, his owne
institution is to be folowed,</hi> you geaue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to a simple and vnexpert Reader,
to thinke, that hereby it is manifestly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
that the lay people at these daies all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
must necessarily receiue his bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he, in his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of his sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t,
delyuered furth allso his bloud. Whiche
S. Cyprian yet dyd no more thinke vpon,
then he feared least any gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>marian should
come, many hundred yeares after hym,
and interprete his plaine wordes in such
a froward sense as you haue done. And so
in the Englisshing furth of the selfesame
sentence, after these wordes, <hi>and no other
<pb facs="tcp:22571:60"/>
thing to be done, then that the Lord dyd first
for vs hymselue,</hi> you make a full periode
and point: whereas it foloweth in S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian,
as clause of the same sentence, that
in deede we should doe as our Lord had
done first hymselfe, but wherein and how
farr, trowe you? in all thinges, and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstancies?
no truly. For straitwaies it
foloweth, in S. Cyprian, and it is the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the whole proposition, <hi>that the
chalice which is offered vp in commemoration
of hym, be offered vp mixt with wyne.</hi> By
which wordes he plainelye declareth his
intent and purpose, which was that for
the tradition of mengling water and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
in the chalice, we should not folow
any other order, then that, which Christ
hymself fyrst vsed. Therefor, if you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
by your <hi>maior</hi> proposition, that which
S. Cypriane meaneth, the plaine sense
thereof is this, that as concernyng the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of wyne alone, or water alone, we
should folow Christ his tradition only,
which apointeth for the chalice both wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and wyne. But then your argument
will be very ridiculous, as in example:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:22571:60"/>
                  <q>
                     <p>We ought to do that only,<note place="margin">Maior.</note> which Christ did,
and nothing els, as concerning the ordering
and tempering of the chalice:</p>
                     <p>But in Christ his institution appeareth,<note place="margin">Minor.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sole receiuing, nor ministring vnder one
kynd:</p>
                     <p>Therefor (<hi>you may inferr whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you will</hi>)
that,<note place="margin">Conclusio.</note> if all abbeis were destroied, we should
haue fortie egges for a penie.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>maior</hi> of this argument is S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians,
and much staied vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in his epistle
ad Cecilium. The <hi>minor</hi> is your owne.
The conclusion ys lawfull and currant.
For to suche agreeable and proper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses,
euerie conclusion will serue will
inowgh.</p>
               <p>But now if you will haue your <hi>maior</hi> to
be generall: first I flattly denie it: then I
haue declared that it ys not extant in S.
Cypriane: and thirdly, I answer vnto you,
that you do not beleeue your owne <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior,</hi>
because that in your communion no
water is put in to the chalice.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning your <hi>minor,</hi> I graunt
it vnto you, that in the last supper of
Christ, there appeareth no sole recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
I allso confesse, that S. Iustine, and
<pb facs="tcp:22571:61"/>
S. Denyse the Areopag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>te, whom you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage,
do well proue, that in their daies
there were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municants to receiue with
the priest. But, as I must tell you againe,
our question is not of what was done,
but of what might haue ben done then,
and now ys done withowt offence of
God, and breach of Christ his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>
               <q>I answer:<note place="margin">Defence fol. 26.</note> Christs institution, the example of
the Apostles, the common vse of the fathers,
was otherwaies: therefore the priest should
not communicate without other.</q>
               <p>I denye your argument.<note place="margin">Replie.</note> for their vsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and doinges, are not lawes vnto the
church, so as they may not be altered.
And by this reason you may bring vs to
receiue after supper, because of the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of Christ,<note place="margin">Luc. 24.</note> example of the Apostles,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon vse of the primitiue church.
As we againe myght bryng yow to take
the sacrament in one kind, because of the
authoritie of Christ, and example of the
primitiue church. But you seeme to yeld
that you haue no expresse commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to bryng furthe agaynst vs, and yet
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22571:61"/>
that notwithstanding, you will haue vs to
be ouercummed. And to this purpose,
you saye:
<q>You haue no expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundement,<note place="margin">Defence. fol. 26.</note> which
forbeadeth you, to baptyse in the name of
the father only: but that Christ his institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was otherwyse.</q>
What was the institution of Christ the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein?<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
was it not, that his Apostles should
baptise, in the name of the Father, the
Soun, and the Holighost? Yet the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
did baptise, in the name of IESVS
only, without mention made of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or the holighost. Yf thei did breake
Christ his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, thei were not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Apostles, and yet, thei do not seeme to
keepe it, when thei do not baptise in the
name of the three persons. What then
shall we saie? Truly, that you vnderstand
not the institution of Christ, and that the
church is the staie of all the Catholikes,
which doth interprete vnto them Christ
his full mynd and order. And lyke as it
is answered by autentike, and good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
that in baptising in the name of
Ihesus Christ, the sacrament is full and
<pb facs="tcp:22571:62"/>
perfect. For he which saieth, CHRIST,
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>prehendeth in that one word the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
which anoynted hym, and the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghost
with whom he was anoynted, and
then Christ, which is by interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the
anoynted, and so doth make vp the miste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie
of the three persons: so in receauing
vnder one kynd, we receaue both flesh &amp;
bloude, as perfectly as if both kindes had
ben ministred: and in receauing alone,
we receaue as much of the true and reall
profit which cummeth vnto vs by the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
as if all the parishe dyd beare vs
cumpanie at the aultar. Therefor, when
you talke of Christ his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
you speake you can not tell what,
and you know not,<note place="margin">Ioan. 3. &amp; 4.</note> I beleue, when Christ
instituted that sacrament. For he bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
before his resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, were it by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
or by his Apostells, and he gaue not
the commaundement of baptising,<note place="margin">Math. vlt.</note> in the
name of the father, the soun, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighost,
before the tyme of his ascensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.
And againe, when yow tell vs, that we
haue no other proufe against hym, which
would baptise in the name of the father,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:22571:62"/>
then Christ his institution,<note place="margin">The bold ignorance of the <hi>M.</hi> of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> yow would
seeme to vnderstand and know all our
reasons and conclusions, and yet you be
as ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in that point, as he which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
had readen any other then his owne
doctours. Reade in Petrus Lombardus,
that lerned Bishope, in what sense it may
be true,<note place="margin">Senten. li. 4. dist. 3.</note> that one might baptise in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the father, without specifying of

was not brought in,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> so much to proue, as
to open and expound that, which then
was to be approued. And whereas you
confesse, and we know, that similitudes
are of small force in them selues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
doe you discusse so narowlie, all the
partes of this similitude, as though there
had not ben one speciall point, for the
which it was alleaged? which is this: <hi>Yf
we can not obtaine the best, that then we
should take the next best vnto it.</hi> which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
being so natural, and reasonable, the
author of the Apologie was not so scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous,
as to passe vpon a most perfect
squaring of his similitude, whereas, to his
intent and conclusion, it was, he thought,
well inowgh framed. But yet let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
your wisedome in vsing of your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersarie,
and the mightie strength of your
reasons, which yow bring furth against
hym.
<q>Besides this you conclude here only the case
of necessitie,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> which helpeth the common vse
of the priuate Masse, very lytle.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the common vse (as you speake
<pb facs="tcp:22571:64"/>
now) or the ordinarie vse, (as you spake
before) or the terme of necessitie,<note place="margin">Fol. 20. p. 1.</note> (in
which necessitie, it seemeth by your owne
confession, that we proue vnto you our
sole receauing, which you call priuate
Masse,) all these are but shiftes of yours,
and starting holes, in whiche you may
couche, before the ignorant, and seeme
to haue some hart left vnto you. As for
vs, if we proue that in necessitie, when
the people wil not receiue, the priest may
take and eate alone: ergo sole receiuing
may be vsed, ergo the indignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of God
hangeth not ouer hym which hath no fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

whether, absolutely, it be against
Christ his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundement and his truthe

               <q>You make your comparison,<note place="margin">Defence</note> betweene thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

I wyll not greatly wonder,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> if you haue
strainge opinions as concernyng diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
whereas in naturall matters and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
yow make new conclusions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all truth and consequence. What call
you then impossible? <hi>Mary</hi> (saie you) <hi>that
all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tention should be banisshed from emong
men in this world.</hi> What thinke you then
of virginitie? Is it not as impossible, that
it should be kept of all Christians, as you
thinke it impossible, that an vniuersall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
might be contynued emong men,
whiles thei lyue in this world? No doubt,
but you wyll graunt my saying true, in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the whole number of Christians,
whereas many of the spirituall fathers,
and brothers of your syde, do thinke that
virginitie can not be kept vndefiled, no
not in any one person of the world. As
a Prophete of your owne, boldly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched

forsoth, of his chastitie, that
<q>All thinges which beare horne or heare,
must goe to their mate, once a yeare.</q>
But, I thinke not so euil of you, that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie
<pb facs="tcp:22571:65"/>
should be altogeather impossible,
mary that generallie it is to be no more
looked for, then surseasing from all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
in so miserable a world, I am su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
you confesse it vnto me. Yet, I dare
to make this similitude, and stand in it
allso againste you, that, <hi>lyke as queene ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
(or take what other name of good
apple yow will) <hi>are most to be chosen, and
yet yf a man loue a crabb better, God make
hym mery with it: so it were to be wisshed,
and it ys most best in deed, that all should,
be virgins, yet yf any body haue a mind to
mariage, I am not master of his tast, therein.</hi>
How say yow Syr, to this comparison?
will you tell me, that the nature of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and virginity,<note place="margin">A simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude may be made betwene thinges, in nature, diuers.</note> are very vnlyke? or that
crabbes are sowre, and mariage is swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te?
or that it is impossible that all should
be virgins, but in any markett daie of the
yeare, a man shall find good apples? or
that mariage is honorable, and that crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
are meate for swyne? will you make
such a serching or Anatomie of a simple
and plaine similitude, and gather so euill
a sense of it, as either folie or malice can
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:22571:65"/>
deuyse? Or els rather, will you examine it
no further, then the present matter and
cause required, for which only the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
serued? for as I doe not deny but
that a pleasaunt felow wold make much
sport vpon my similitude, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
my meaning is very true and honest:
that if a man will not folow counsell in
the best, he may be suffered to folow hys
fancie, in that which is not the worst.</p>
               <p>Crabbes allso, are not euil, as some choke
peares are, and they add a certen grace
vnto the cupp when they be rosted: and,
to be short, they are not so farr behind
good apples in worthines, as mariage is
farr beneth virginitie, be it spoken with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
irreuerencie, vnto the Sacrament of
wedlocke. Therefore, your conclusion,
vpon the Catholikes comparison, is very
false and faultie, because I haue shewed a
good and true similitude, in whiche yet
after your interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, the one member
is impossible, &amp; the other is possible. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
your mery folowing of the catholikes
similitude, and your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cluding (as it were
by the like argument) that bisshopes must
<pb facs="tcp:22571:66"/>
not forbydd priestes to haue such cussons
with whom <hi>Si non castÃ¨ tamen cautÃ¨:</hi> ys
much lyke as when Iacke an Ape,<note place="margin">Neither apes, men: neither the <hi>M.</hi> of the defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce doth folow well the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</note> doth
besides the right waye and maner, put a
reasonable man his cote vpon hymselfe.
For as the suing for our ryght is lawfull,
so will we proue that sole receyuyng is
lawfull: but as the suing for a man hys
right is lawful, so neither you neither we
do thinke, that priestes to haue lemmans
is lawfull. We also come to our conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
by an honest principle, as, <hi>When the
best is not obtained, let vs yet take the next
best vnto it,</hi> but the principle vnto your
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clusion must be this, (<hi>when the best is not
obtained, let vs take that, which is naught.</hi>)
Yea truly, not in sport but in sadd ernest,
you make a worse kind of reason, fauling
from the not obtayning of the best, to
concluding of that, which is worse then
naught. As, when you can not haue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to lyue chast, to geaue them free
licence to take open harlottes. whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you couer, with the name of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
or sisters, yet are they in very deed,
no better, then I haue termed them.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:22571:66"/>
Now after all this, you saye that all our
whole drift ys, by alleaging the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of maners in the world, to proue that
priestes must therefor receaue alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none will receaue with them. But
once againe, I tell you, you vnderstand
not our dryft. for yf the whole worlde
might and would receaue togeather with
a priest, yet we hold, that sole receauyng
is, in itselfe, alowable. And as you do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnderstand
vs in this, so do you in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
poynt, saying:
<q>Ye haue taken order for the people,<note place="margin">Defence fo. 28.</note> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to receaue, only at Easter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As who should saie,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> that the church hath
prouyded, that they should not receaue
generally at other tymes of the yeare, but
only at Easter. Which is as false as God
is true. For the Canon and decree of the
church, is, that who so doth not receaue at
Easter, shall not be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted a Christian.

hereby how much she mislyketh, that

she is constrained to put furth a law,
that, at the least, they shall receaue at Eas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or els be accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted for not Christans.
where lerned you then, that the people
were apointed to receaue onlie at Easter?
Or in what text or glose do you find it,
that the church hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> order for them,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:22571:67"/>
not to receaue generally at other tymes?
Tell vs, I praie you, whether all be one in
your iudgement, to saye, <hi>you shall receaue
at Easter, at the least,</hi> and, <hi>you shall receaue
only at Easter?</hi> The first the church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth,
constrainyng thereby, herr chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne
to remember their dutie, and to
receaue the cumfort of their sowles. The
second is only by you imprinted, to make
the laity suspect the gouerme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
Bishopes, as though they should
study how to diminisshe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
profit and knowledge, and therefor
had taken order and diligence, that they
should receaue only at Easter. What au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
you haue to make such open and
wicked lyes, I knowe not. but allthough
it might be geauen, yet a good man wold
not vse it. And allthough you might sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
vnespied, thorough the greate cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in which your brothers haue you
perchaunse, yet should you not shew such
malice or boldnes towardes the good
and indifferent reader, or towardes a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so euillbeloued aduersarie. But now
to an other matter. An other matter I
<pb facs="tcp:22571:68"/>
maye well saye. For whereas it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent,
to bring in the testimonie of S.
Chrisostome, you deferr that ouer vnto
the fifthe chapiter, and occupie the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and the replier allso, (when any such
would be found out for you) with the
question of the sacrifice. In which matter,
although I might be long and copious in
answering you, yet, as much as I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
for it, I will be short and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
in declaring the truth. Therefor
let vs heare of you, where your griefe is,
that, by answering yea or no vnto it, we
may the quicklier end this extraordinarie
eruption of yours, against the truth of
our sacrifice. First you alleage, that to
saie, that the priest is bound to offer vpp
the daily sacrifice, ys,
<q>The roote of all the abuses of the Lords
supper,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 28.</note> that haue ben brought in to the
church of Christ. &amp;c.</q>
Do you thinke then,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> that if priestes were
not bound vnto it, all abuses which haue
sprong vpp (as you saie) would strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
decaie and wither, the roote of them
being taken awaie? But who shall then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:22571:68"/>
stand at the aultar, and intend vpon the
misteries, for dutie sake? And when the
parissheners shall make courtesie, and saie
one to the other, <hi>(Goe you, and, nay goe
you,</hi> and, <hi>by my trothe I am not readie,</hi> and
<hi>by my trothe then, lett all stand)</hi> wyll you
permitt such disorder to contynue, when
the roote of abuses shall be taken awaie
by you? or will you apoint some one or
other, which shall be bound to serue in the
office? whom yet if you will apoynt to
be a reader only, and to haue no further
authoritie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>to open the boke, and tell
what is writen in it, then shall you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
very much the priesthode and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the newlaw, which by all common
reason, should be more worthier, then any
ptiesthode that euer was in the world.</p>
               <p>Now, if you, being venterous to take the
rule of Christen sowles in to your owne
handes, are enforced to keepe officies and
dignities emong you, for the better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of your Ghospell, thinke you
that the wisedom of God, and a God hym
selfe Iesus Christ, would gather a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s togeather in to one faith,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:69"/>
one hope, and one absolute forme of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
and honoring God, and prouide no
officers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cernyng that effect, ouer them?
Or when he hath apointed most perfect
and excellent offices to be taken and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equuted
of men, for the wealth of his
welbeloued, would he leaue them to their
pleasure, whether they did folow their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
or no, and lett them stand vnbound
and vncharged? It seemeth then, that as
by his diuine prouidence, he, as man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
a priesthode to serue for his church,
in matters apperteinyng vnto God, so by
as necessarie conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce, he charged his
leuetenantes and vnderofficers in that
kind, to exequute his wyll, and doe their
dutie. Wherefor that priestes should be
bound to daily offering (concernyng the
whole body of priesthode, and not euery
particular person) it is so farr of, to be
the roote of abuses, that except such a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
were folowed, we should by this tyme
haue had no supper of our Lords at all,
I warrant you. Iniquitie would so much
haue preuailed, when the dayly sacrifice
should haue ceased, and no man his law
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:22571:69"/>
could haue continued it, if by the law of
God, it had be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>found vnrequired. And fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
I saie, that the church hath brought
in or alowed no abuses in the ministrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t. But you goe forward
and lie:
<q>This is,<note place="margin">Defence. fol. 29.</note> wherewith you do pitifully deface
the death and passion of Christ, makyng
your selfe, for your glories sake, as it were
meanes of reconciliation, between God
and his people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a shamefull lie,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> yea rather it is a
slaunder, whereas you make the desire of
glorie to haue ben the cause in the church
of Christ, of hauing her priestes endued
with such excellencies and prerogatiues.
And you speake so aduisedlie, as though
Aaron had not stode laudablie, betwyxt
God and the people, when the plague
was sent furth against them,<note place="margin">Num. 16. Num. 14.</note> or Moyses
had done presumptuously, to be the spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kesman
for the people vnto God, or as
though Christ had not sent his Apostells
euen as his Father sent hym,<note place="margin">Io. 20.</note> or S. Paule
had not geauen warnyng vnto the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4</note>
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cernyng such as he was hym
<pb facs="tcp:22571:70"/>
selfe, that they should take them so, as the
ministers of God, and dispensators or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributours
of his misteries. Againe,
<q>This ys it,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> that hath discoraged Christen
people from the often vse and frequenting
of the Sacrament.</q>
As though that,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> if there were no priestes
at all, there would be continuall recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
or that priestes would receaue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
oft then they do, if they were free and
not bound vnto it. The people (say you)
is left free to come as seldome as they wil.
You speake cuttedly and vntruly: Vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
because yourselfe confesse, that the
church hath take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> order, that the people re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue
at Easter, and then are thei not left
free to come as seldome as thei wyll, which
must come ones a yeare: And cuttedlie,
because thei are left free to come in one
yeare, not as seldome as thei wyll, but all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
and rather as oft as they will. And if
it be in their wil and power, to come eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
weeke or daie, in which masse is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
how should the state of the priest
be the cause of stopping their libertie?</p>
               <p>You shall goe with hym for his wysedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:22571:70"/>
which being condempned for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie,
sayed, that if he had neuer praied
to Sainct, he had neuer come to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ging.
As you do now put the cause of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
fault, in the holye order and office
of priesthode. But, I trust, you had som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that moued you against priestes,
about their office of sacrificing. Where
vpon it foloweth:
<q>Sure I am, that neither the institution of Christ
maketh mention of any oblation or sacrifice
to be done by the minister, sauing only the
sacrifice of thankesgeauing, nor yet the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
apointeth any bounden duetie for the
priest, more to vse the sacrament, then other
godlie and well disposed Christians.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Whether the priest ys bound to vse the
sacrament, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> other good people,
it is nothing to the purpose to aske it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
you take the word <hi>(vse)</hi> for sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
I tell you so oft of your euill maner
herein, because you should hereafter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it. But for the other matter, which
in deed ys now in question, what if you
reade not in the institution of Christ,
speciall mention, of oblation to be done
by the priest, are you straitwaies at your
<pb facs="tcp:22571:71"/>
wittes end, that you can not tell where
to seeke further for the truth? Doe yow
not know, that our Sauior was found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
iij.<note place="margin">Luc. 2.</note> dayes seeking, in the middle of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours?
and, doe not holy men interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
vs our Sauiors meanyng, such as our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
should neuer find in scripture, yf
we loked till our eies were out, in the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
only and text of it? Allso where find
you in the institution of Christ, any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
mention made of the sacrifice of tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
geauing? which onlie sacrifice yow
find there, or els you lie. Then, as you
might thinke vs of very small iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t,
if we would denie the sacrifice of thankes
geauyng, because we doe reade no such
word (sacrifice) in the text of Christe his
institution of the sacrament: so, (as we
may be content, that you shew vnto your
selfe therein, some part of fauor, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue
that which is not expressie writen)
yet do ye not vse, such argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tations by
negatiues, with vs hereafter, except we
should reason, only for makyng of sport,
or spending of tyme. Yet to declare vnto
you shortly, that some see more then you
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:22571:71"/>
doe in this matter, I answer that <hi>(hoc fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite)</hi>
which is to saie, <hi>doe this</hi> or <hi>make this,</hi>
standeth emong other his significations
there, allso for <hi>sacrificare.</hi> For so is <hi>facere</hi>

there is nothing more conuenient, then
to haue a sacrifice for hym, and nothing

<hi>we haue sucked</hi> (you saie) <hi>our error,

old father or young brother hath taught
you, the mightie contrarietie (which you
speake of) betweene sacrifice and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Yet goe to, if we haue mistaken
the old fathers, how well doe you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them? you can not denie, but the
old fathers do call the sacrament an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
or sacrifice, but you will expound
their meanyng vnto vs. Wherevpon, you
tell vs, that in the beginnyng, the people
at the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the Lord his supper,
offered vp, wyne, breade, and other victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,

of the common people) that the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of the sacrament of this offering, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

                     <p>After,<note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> the fathers called euerie good action

of the Sacrament:</p>
                     <p>An other cause that the holie fathers call the
sacrament an oblation or sacrifice,<note place="margin">Fol. 32.</note> is, because
according to Christes ordenance, we celebrate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the remembrance of his death and passion,
which was the onlie and true sacrifice.</p>
                  </q>

               <p>Where I may begyn to speake against
you,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> for this your diuision of sacrifice, I
can not readelie tell, there are so many
thinges, which are to be moued and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued.
First the imperfectnes, that you
haue vsed in it<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> because you haue not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
the full cumpasse of this word,
<hi>sacrifice,</hi> as the holie Fathers haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode
it. Then your superfluousnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you make many partes of that, which
you should haue concluded in one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
<pb facs="tcp:22571:74"/>
As, if euerie good action be called a
sacrifice, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> should you haue well brought
the other kindes which you speake of, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this one signification, as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
largest, aboue all other. Allthough
you, in deuising three maners, after which
the fathers take the word <hi>sacrifice,</hi> do lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
this one out of the number, by which
euerie good action (as you report) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a sacrifice, which yet deserueth to haue
the first place emong them, if that which
is most generall, should not be omitted
in diuiding. Thirdlie your diuision is to
be reproued, for the greate vntruth which
is conteined in it, as I shall declare vnto
you hereafter. If first you will consider,
what an other maner of diuision was to
be lerned out of the Doctours, and in
what sense it is spoken and beleiued of
vs, that a sacrifice propiciatorie is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in our misteries.<note place="margin">what a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is.</note> Vnderstand you the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refor,

visible. The inward and internall sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:22571:74"/>
may be thus defined: <hi>It is that worshipp
and seruice,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">what an internal sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crifice is.</note> 
                  <hi>in which our hart and will is gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto God,</hi> and this is done vpon the
aultar of our hart, when either we burne
the incense of holie and deuoute loue in
his sight, or when we vowe to hym our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
and his giftes in vs, or when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
his benefites in solempne feastes
and holidaies, or when vpon the aultar of
our hart, with the fyer of charitie, we bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the offeringes of humilitie and praise,
vnto hym. And this is the pure and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
sacrifice, which onlie God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
of vs, not because of his owne
profit and vantage, but that we, by vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of ourselues to hym, might liue and
continue for euer with hym. But how
shall a man know, that there is such a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
inuisible, and acceptable sacrifice?
Of his owne doing a man perchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>se may
know, but of an others mynd, who can
tell, without some externall signe or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
shewed? Againe, if a man would vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his owne inward deuotion, how can
he exemplifie it, without some externall
signe, either of bowing of knees, or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:22571:75"/>
vp of handes, or lifting vp of eyes,
or knocking of breast, or offering vp of
some gift? yea rather the soule and bodie
being so nigh togeather as they are, it
ys impossible, that the hart &amp; soule, shold
entierlie be occupied, in the true worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
of God, and that by no maner of si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
it shold be perceaued in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
Therefor, by necessarie and naturall
consequence and folowing, there must
be an externall sacrifice. And that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
of S. Augustine, by these wordes,
<hi>The visible sacrifice ys a sacrament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">what an externall sacrifice is</note> 
                  <hi>that ys
to saie, an holie signe of the inuisible sacrifice.</hi>
Of this second kind of sacrifice if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ples, you may easelie find them
in the sacrificies of Abel, Noe, Abraham,
and others in the law of nature,<note place="margin">Gene. 4. 8. 13. &amp;. 20</note> and in the
boke of <hi>Leuiticus,</hi> as concerning the old
law, and in the churches and deuotions
of Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s in this tyme of grace, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
thei offer candells, burne frankincense,
take ashes, beare palme, and do anything
outwardlie to the honor of God. In
which thinges, except the offerer haue an
internall deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and pietie, all those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:22571:75"/>
ceremonies are not to him worth
the vsing, and if he be in hart and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
fullie disposed and aduised to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
his owne miserie, and god his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
then are these outwarde actions and
obseruations, holie signes and tokens of
the internall sacrifice, and may be called
externall sacrificies. But let vs speake of
one singular example for all. The visible
and bitter death of our Sauior Christ v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the crosse, was an external aud blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
sacrifice. But in what sense and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?
vndoubtedlie as it was and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
visible. But what meane I by <hi>visible?</hi>
I meane, that so painefull maner of hys
hanging by the handes and fcete vpon
the crosse, and so vniuersall a wounding
of euerie part of his pretiouse bodie, so
that from the croune of his heade to the
soele of his feete, there was no whole pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
in hym, and the panting of euerie vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and stretching of euerie ioynt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
torment in all his blessed fleshe,
these thinges with manie other, were (I
meane) holie signes of his inward sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
in which he offered vp (before hym
<pb facs="tcp:22571:76"/>
and to hym which seeth all secreates) his
liffe, his hart, his will, his thankes, his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and praiers, and all that was his, for
the sauing of mankind, and satisfieing of
his fathers Iustice. Yea, concernyng the
eies of men, not onlie the sight of God,
who may doubt of his patience, which in
all those torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes dyd neuer once mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur?
who can mistrust or suspect his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
which emong so manie cruellties
done to hym, forgat not to loue his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
who should not but consider hys
endlesse obedience, whose soule could
not be remoued from the keeping of his
fathers will, when the bodie was disioyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
the one member from the other? In
verie deed, this was an holie signe and
sacrament, of the inuisible and principal
sacrifice of his pure hart and mynd, and
by this we vnderstand, that God exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie
loued man, which of mere good
will and compassion, was content so to
suffer for man. What shall we geaue then
againe vnto God, for all this, which he
hath done for vs? we owe to hym reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of these benefites: we owe vnto
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:22571:76"/>
hym thankes: we owe vnto him loue. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
is moued by representation
and signe: Thankes require a present and
gift to be vttered by: Loue desireth to be
made one with that which is loued.</p>
               <p>To keepe his benefites in remembrance,
we might vse, either reading, or hearing
of his actes out of bokes, or painting of
his passion, and expressing of his liffe in
colours. But images, we knowe are simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes
only, and are farr from the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
themselues. To the signifieing of our
thankes, we might either sing them by
mouth, or sound them by instrumentes,
of shew them in the buylding of chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and decking of them with ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
And as concernyng Loue, we might
fetch deepe sigthes, and haue ernest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
but as the seruantes of holie Iob
saied by theire master, in token of their
exceding loue, <hi>who might geaue vs to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
our full of his flesshe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 31.</note> We ought to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
singular deuotions, because we haue
receaued singular benefites, but our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
ys so vnstable, our power so litle,
and our charitie so faint, that allthough
<pb facs="tcp:22571:77"/>
verie reason persuadeth, that we, after a
most best manner, shoulde remember,
thanke, and loue, so mercifull and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiefull
a Sauior as Iesus ys, yet the miserie
of nature declareth, that we are not able
to doe, either as we should, either, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunse,
as we would.</p>
               <p>In this doubt therefor, who shall helpe
vs, but he, which hath dyed for vs? which
because he is made our heade, hath ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
this office to direct and rule the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
And so trulie he hath done. For in his
last supper he toke bread, and saied <hi>This
ys my bodie,</hi> he toke the cupp, and saied,
<hi>This ys my bloud of the new testament,</hi> and
with this bodie and bloud which he hath
and doth geaue vnto vs, we are able to
discharge all our duties, and make a full
and perfect offering. Of which bodie,
and the misteries and treasures thereof,
if I would particularlie speake, all tyme
and studie were to litle for the greatnes
of the matter. But for those three poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
the which I make mention of, thei
may be perfectlie brought to passe, in the
hauing and enioying of his true bodie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:22571:77"/>
For as concernyng our charitie and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
it is the most that we can desire in the
state of his liffe, to be corporallie, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallie,
reallie, faithfullie, bodilie, and

to be loued.<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munio.</note> Of which our coniunction

and thankes which thei gaue vnto

God: how much more acceptablie, are
we now able to offer vnto God a most
worthie and pretiouse gift, which haue
receaued for that purpose the bodie and
bloud of Christ, in whose only bodie, the
particular values and prices, of all other
presentes, that euer were vnder any law,
are shortlie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>prised, and reckened sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marelie?
And so in this respect, the body
of our Sauior is vnto vs <hi>Eucharistia,</hi> or a
sacrifice of thankes geauing.</p>
               <p>But now, for the third point, who than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
hym, whom he remembreth not? or
who remembreth hym, whom he is not
warned of? or what warning can be grea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter,
then the reall presence of the partie?
and the partie being present, what is first
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sidered but his cheefest and worthiest
benefite? That we should therefor all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
remember our Sauyor hys deathe,
which he so openly suffered, that all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
should behold it, he left vnto vs the
same bodie that suffered for vs.</p>
               <p>In presence of which, yf we wyll not be
brought to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ber him, we wil neuer be
brought. And in this respect, our Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:22571:78"/>
is called a Sacrifice,<note place="margin">Sacrifice.</note> because it is,
vnto all such as haue the true and sincere
faith, a most holy signe and token of that
sacrifice of the crosse, which so long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
sence is ended, as concerning the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefullnes
and bloudnies of his crucified
bodie, and yet continueth styll in fresshe
memorie, by reason of the reall presence
of the same bodie which then suffered.</p>
               <p>And lyke as when Easter draweth nygh,
we saye, to morowe or the next daye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
is the passion of our Lord, because it
is a lyke daye vnto that in which he suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hys passion: so, because that in the
misteries of Christians, the representatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of Christs perfect sacrifice, which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
once for all, ys perfectlie worked,
therfor it beareth the name of that blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
sacrifice, which it representeth. For
in deed, we doe not at this daye, sacrifice
Christ bloudelie, but rather celebrate the
memorie of his paineful sacrifice, which
memorie is by no meane, more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
preserued, then by this, that the same
bodie is now made reallie present before
vs, which at that tyme was sensiblie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:22571:79"/>
for vs. But how then is it propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie?
forsoth, because of the offering of
one selfesame bodye. for allthough we
make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>memoration only of his death,
&amp; not put Christ to death in deed, yet we
haue (thorough hys gyft) the selfesame
body, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> being put to death rose
againe to lyffe, that it might neuer more
die, which then was offered vpp bloude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and now is offered misticallie, and is
in both maners the same Christ verelie,
and to the same effect dispensatiuelie.
Therefor, as Christ is the true fontaine
of lyffe, and the euerlasting and shyning
light of cumfort, and as his pretiouse sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
after it hath ben once opened, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

and mercie, by it. And as the word
<hi>propitiation,</hi> doth signifie nothing els, but
graciousnes, fauor, cause of fauor, or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
such like, so the misticall offering of
his reall person, which is the deseruer and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:22571:79"/>
geauer of all perdon, can not be but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie

               <p>Thus I haue shortlie declared, what a

And that all good externall actions, done

the name of externall sacrifice, with

to doe your thinges, in better order.
For the oblations, which the people ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,

act and consequentlie the action of the
priest at the aultar, should haue ben putt
of you, vnder the title or member of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
sacrifice. And then you should ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
spoken sumwhat of internall sacrifice:
And before you had come vnto that, you
should haue defined vnto vs, what a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
had ben, that we might haue a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
perceaued your good iudgement in
the doctors. But let vs forgeaue you this
vnskillfullnes, and consider now, whether
that, which you haue spoken without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
be not spoken allso of you, without
trueth or reason.</p>
               <p>First we agree with you, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
made such offeringes as you speake
of.<note place="margin">the oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the people, in bread, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, was not the cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se why the doctours call the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament a sacrifice.</note> But we denie, that the offering of the
people, was cause vnto the holie fathers,
that they should geaue the title of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
vnto the sacrament. For it is vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that the Sacrament should bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the name of oblation, of the peoples
offering, and not rather the peoples wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and bread, be honored with that title<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:22571:80"/>
because of the Sacrament. For in euerie
kind of thing, the first and cheifest in
that kind, is first and formest to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted.
As for example, the offering of
Christ, which he made of hymselfe vpon
the crosse, because it was the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest
and best that euer was made, you
should not therefor saie, that by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
taken of the offering vpp of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
sheepe, or lambes, Christ is saied to
be offered, but rather because of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
sacrifice, all other must from thence
haue and borow their name. And so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the oblation, which ys made in the
misteries, is of more excellencie, and of
higher degree, then the offeringes of the
people: no doctour of the church wold be
so vnlike hym selfe, as to call that, which
the priest co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>secrated at the aultar, by the
name of sacrifice, because it was a selec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
portion out of the peoples offering.
Againe, yf yt were true, that in respect
that the bread and wyne was taken out
of the peoples offering, therfor the bread
and wine consecrated, should haue the
name of an oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, yet you could neuer
<pb facs="tcp:22571:81"/>
call the priest an offerer, except for some
action, in which his offering might be
perceaued. And this shall be the better
proued, by considering of your example,
which, to shewe your purpose, you bring
out of S. Irenei, which speaking of the
bread and wine, of which Christ saied,
<hi>Thys ys my bodie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iren. lib. 4 cap. 32</note> 
                  <hi>thys ys my bloud,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth,
<hi>that Christ therein taught them</hi>
(not vs, as you conster it, but the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
first, and after them, and by them, vs)
<hi>a new oblation of the new testament, which
the church taking of the Apostles, offereth
vpp to God in all the world.</hi> Here loe in
this sentence, if it were possible that the
terme <hi>(oblation)</hi> should be applied, not
properlie vnto the sacrament, but in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
(as you thinke) of the oblation of
the people, yet how doth the church of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
when by your saying, there is nothing
to offer. But consider for shame the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of S. Irenei: <hi>He taught</hi> (saieth he)
<hi>the Apostels, a new oblation of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Yf Christ taught them, thei were
to lerning of it: if he taught them a new
oblation, it was such as thei neuer had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:22571:81"/>
Yet of the offering of bread and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
and such like,<note place="margin">Leu. 23.</note> thei had not onlie hard
of before, but were allso offerers of it
them selues, because all the nation of
Iewes had example or commaundement
of it, in the law. Againe, if it were a new
oblation of the new testament, it is plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
it was more worth, and more royall,
and more true, then any of the old law,
what tyme all thinges chaunsed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
in figures,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.</note> and were done for vs, which
lyue now in the later end of the world.</p>
               <p>And therefor, if in the old law, the priests
oblations were true oblations, and had
not that name or title, because thei were
offered vp before of the people: what a
vile reproche is this, to the euerlasting
and new testament, to saie, that when the
Doctours do speake of the oblation ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
at the masse, thei meane thereby, that
the common people made offeringes of
bread and wyne, to serue therewith the
aultar, the priests, and poore beggars.</p>
               <p>Allso, this holie father saieth, <hi>That the
church, receauing</hi> (that oblation) <hi>of the
Apostles, doth offer it vpp to God, in all the
<pb facs="tcp:22571:82"/>
world.</hi> Furthermore he bringeth in, the
testimonie of the Prophete Malachie, to
proue that the sacrificies of the old law
should be abolisshed, and one pure and
cleane sacrifice succede them, and please
God more then all thei had done. <hi>I haue
no mynd to you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mala. 1.</note> (saieth God, by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,
vnto the Iewes, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerning their
sacrificies) <hi>because, from the East to the
weast, my name is greate emong the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
and in all places there is sacrificed and
offered vpp vnto my name, a pure oblation
or offering, because my name is greate emong
the Gentiles.</hi> This testimonie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete,
S. Irenei alleageth, to proue the
new testament of which he spake. And by
all this, which the church hath receaued,
the Apostles haue delyuered, the Sonn of
God hath taught, the Prophete hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed,
the whole world doth celebrate,
is this (trow you) vnderstanded, that the
people should in the tyme of the new law
and kingdome of Messias, come in to the
churches with bread, wyne, butter, egges,
and cheese, and other good victualls, that
of the bread and wine, which thei offer,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:22571:82"/>
a portion should be taken, to serue at the
communion? I will be short with you,
we the Christians, either haue no externall
sacrifice, and then we be in more worse
and discumfortable case, then euer any
before haue ben, in any kind of religion,
or els we haue an excellent oblation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuered
vnto vs, as the Prophete Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie
foreshewed, and Christ exhibited,
and the church obserueth. But this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
oblation, and so much spoken of,
is not the oblation, which the people ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
(for the offering of come, wyne, and
victualls, was more largelie and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vsed emong Iewes and Panimes both,
then it is with vs) Ergo the Prophete Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachie
spake of an other and better kind
of offering. Ergo allso S. Irenei, dyd not
meane in his sentence by you alleaged,
the simple and obscure oblations of the
people, because he speake of that, which
the Prophete Malachie had writen of.</p>
               <p>Yet to shew the grace which you haue in
vnderstanding of the Doctours, whereas
this present testimonie of S. Irenei ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
so plainely against you, you saye, that
<pb facs="tcp:22571:83"/>
he expoundeth hymselfe in an other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
as in the .34. chap. of the forsaied boke,
<q>And signifieth, that he speaketh not of the
offering of the sacrament consecrated,<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 30.</note> but
of the bread and wyne, offered partlie to
the vse of the supper, partlie to the finding
of the poore.</q>
It is wonder to see your boldnes.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> For the
place of S. Irenei, by which you would
proue this your comment, doth neither
make mention of <hi>the vse of the supper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">An aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctour foulie abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>M.</hi> of the defence.</note> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

saieth, <hi>we make offering vpp to God, &amp;c. of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
vnto hym the firstfructes of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
&amp;c. and this pure offering, the church
only offereth to our maker, &amp;c.</hi> But where
doth he saie in that place (which either
should haue serued your purpose, or els
not at all haue ben alleaged) that the
new oblation of the new testament, and
the prophesie of Malachie, of which he
had spoken in the 32. Chapiter before,
were to be vnderstanded of the bread
and wyne, offered to the vse of the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and finding of the poore? we do not
denie, but that the people offered bread
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:22571:83"/>
and wine for such intentes, but you shold
haue proued, that same to be the pure
offering, which the church onlie offereth,
as S. Irenei saieth. Which can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
be euer concluded, because neither
the offering of the people singularlie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
neither the Church onlie doth offer
bread, wyne, and firstfructes, which the
verie panymes, &amp; that naturallie, do offer
vp, against reason, vnto their false God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
&amp; Idolls. wherefor you haue brought
S. Ierenei out of place, not to expound
hymselfe, but to confound your miserable
lying. And thus much for the first signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which you make of the word <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
and <hi>sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as concernyng the second, we
graunt, and the church allso hath taught
it you, that there is a sactifice of praier,
and a sacrifice of thankes geauing. But
how can you proue, that the sacrament it
selfe is not allso a sacrifice, that is to saie,
an externall and visible signe, of our tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
geauing and praier? for not onlie <hi>Te

and humble praying, but most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

must not by one truth take awaye an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as, because no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wil deny, that the
praiers to God, and prayses of God vsed
in the masse, are true sacrificies, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
therefor, that the bodie and bloud
of Christ, are for vs no sacrifice. Further,
where you saie, concerning the prayers
and thankes geauen at the celebration of
the sacrament:
<q>That the Doctours in infinite places affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 31.</note>
that to be the true and onlie sacrifice of

               </p>
               <p>It ys most false and vnreasonable.<note place="margin">Reply.</note> For
thankes and praiers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>nion sacrificies

if we should speake exactlie, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
true and pure sacrifice,<note place="margin">Our than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes &amp; prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not the onlie and true sacrifice.</note> but onlie that
which our Sauior maketh of hymselfe, in

pleaseth hym to be offered. For all our
Iustice, considered by it selfe, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation made vnto the holines and meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

<q>

as S. Augustine may proue vnto you. For
he saieth not,<note place="margin">Not euery good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but:</note> that euerie good worke ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutelie,
<hi>but euerie worke that is done to

the geauing of it vnto that supreme
end and point, which is God hymselfe, all
though the act be good morallie, yet can
it not be called a sacrifice. After this you

<pb facs="tcp:22571:85"/>
of that great sacrifice of the

I tell you againe, that (to goe no further

<hi>we offer a ful, a sweete, and holie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,

Eusebius, true it is, <hi>we celebrate the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of that great sacrifice,</hi> but yet we ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
that which foloweth, <hi>according to the
misteries instituted by Christ hymselfe.</hi> By
which wordes he geaueth you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that the matter hangeth not vpon
your newlie deuised apprehension, by
which we represent vnto our memorie,
the passion and merites of the Soun of
God, but thorough the institution of the
misteries, which the fatihfull haue allwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
honored, that remembrance of the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:22571:85"/>
and bloudie sacrifice, ys continued
and celebrated accordinglie.</p>
               <p>We hold furthermore,<note place="margin">Lib. 22. de ciuit. Dei cap. 10.</note> with S. Austine,
that the Martirs are the misticall body of
Christ, but yet we hold allso with hym,
that, at the sacrifice which we offer vnto
God, the Martirs in their place and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
are named. For as our Sauyor hath
true bodies, one misticall, an other natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
so the offering of the misticall, must
not exclude the presence and offering of
the naturall. Yea rather, how can the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
bodie be offered, except it be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the presence of the naturall? For
the offering of ourselues, is not the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Christ his whole misticall bodie,
although you affirme it. And if the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
parisshe would ioyne itselfe neuer so
stronglie togeather, how doe thei offer
S. Peter, S. Paule, and all the rest of the
elect and chosen? But when the naturall
bodie of Christ is offered, (vnto whom,
as the head, all the elect, as members, are
ioyned, and not onlie thei which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
this world, or which are in it at this
present, but all thei which euer hereafter
<pb facs="tcp:22571:86"/>
shall be borne, vntill all the number be
fullfilled) then loe and onlie then it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
that Christ his misticall bodie is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered:
because he the head is offered,
which, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerning God his euerlasting
apointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, will, and pleasure, neuer wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
any one part of hys perfect and full
misticall bodie. Otherwyse how can the
bodie be well offered without the head,
which for that cause onlie is an accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
bodie, and worthe offering, because it
cleaueth vnto such an head. Againe, S.
Austine in this place, allthough he deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that the priest offereth sacrifice vnto
the Martirs, yet he confesseth, that the
Martirs are named at our sacrifice, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
thereby most plainelie against you,
that we haue a sacrifice, which thei are
not, but at which thei haue a due and
conuenient commemoration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewyse againe, we saie with Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome

that</hi> we do not offer vpp now one, tomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

For els, because it is offered vpp in manie

Christ is euerie where one, being whole both

yet in his first boke and .ix. epistle,<note place="margin">Lib. 1. ep. 9</note> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
that there is an oblation which the

were no martirs, and he testifieth allso of
a deprecatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> and praier which the church
vseth in their names. For in chargeing
the clergie, vnto which he there writeth,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:88"/>
to make no oblation and praier, for the
soule of one Victor, which had transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

he sheweth therewithall, what the clergie
would haue done, had not his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
staied them, and he proueth that,
for some kind of such as were departed,
not onlie praises and thankes, but suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
rather and praiers were offered.</p>
               <p>Then as concerning the greeke Canon,
which of them you did meane, I cold not
tel, but now, by reason of M. Grindal ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
which he made not long sence at
an Englisshe funerall, of Ferdinand the

made for our ladie, the prophetes,
or Apostles, (allthough that a comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration

for them,) yet if it were true, that in one
place of that greek Canon, an oblation
were made for our ladie, that doth not
proue, but in an other place of the same

was made for the deade, such as were not

               <p>Now againe, allthough you alleage a
true saying out of S. Chrisostome, vpon
the .viij. Chapiter of S. Mathew, that the

sacrifice is sett furth, commaundeth the
standers by, to offer vp thankes to God
for the world (in which testimonie it ys
<pb facs="tcp:22571:89"/>
playne to see, that the sacrifice proposed
is one thing, and the sacrifice of thankes
an other) yet, (to lett goe this vantage)
you can not denie but he in an other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
saieth,<note place="margin">Chris. ho. 3 ad Philip.</note> 
                  <hi>It was decreed by the Apostles,

knew, that much commoditie and much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
dyd come hereof vnto them. For the who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

               </p>
               <p>Therefor it is cleare, that your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is verie vnlerned and childissh, to
saie, that Chrisostome vpon the .viij. of

geauing for all men which are passed,
or which are to come, ergo there is no
other sacrifice but thankes, to be offered
for the soules departed: or els, (to decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

that in the presence of the reuerend mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,

to cause God to be mercifull vnto

shortlie, there was dailie sacrifice in
S. Chrisostoms tyme, and there was not
<pb facs="tcp:22571:92"/>
daylie receiuing with the priest, ergo to
haue communicantes, is not of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

for your defence, of which the first
ys, that

which dyd come to the communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>? then
dyd he not stand in vaine at the Aultar,
except you can proue, that in that world,
such a canon was made, that there should
be no communion without .iij. to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
at it: on the other side, if in any one
daie at all, there was found no one to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
the sacrifice being offered eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
daie, it was celebrated some tymes
without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municants. For, it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall
vnto vs, whether the people recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
some at Easter, some at tweluetyde,

authorities which you bring of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,
Austine, Chrisostome, and <hi>Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium
Elibertinum,</hi> to proue that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
dyd communicate more then once in
the yeare, and that greate fault was found
with manies slacknes in that behalfe:<note place="margin">The <hi>M.</hi> of the defence speaketh out of his purpose, to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>likes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.</note> as
thei do make directly against hym, which

thei confirme rather our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clusion, which
is, that communicantes are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
at euery tyme of masse to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
For, whereas the Bisshopes or Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
as you confesse, apointed and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the Christians to receiue once, twyse,
thryse, or fowre tymes in the yeare, and
whereas the councell called <hi>Elibertinum,</hi>
decreed that all the faithfull should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
at the least, thrise in the yeare,
it may be verie well gathered hereof, that
there was no daylie receauing with the
priest. Because the councell, in charging
them to receiue thrise at the least, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thereby conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tlie, that thei came
<pb facs="tcp:22571:93"/>
not so oft, as thrise in the yeare. And S.
Ambrose, in that he reproueth the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
in the East partes,<note place="margin">Amb. li. 4. de Sacra.</note> of receiuing no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
then once a yeare, he proueth therein
vnto you, necessarilie, that there was such
a custome. Wherfor, to graunt vnto you,
that S. Chrisostome, in saying <hi>there is none
to communicate,</hi> vseth a certen exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and meaneth that there are verie few
and seldome which communicate, yet the
sacrifice being dailie, he offered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
some tymes without communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants.
For allthough a few might haue
come dailie, and so haue made vp a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
yet when S. Chrisostome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
(after your comment vpon hym)
that they came seldome allso, there were
vndoubtedlie some vacant daies betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
in which the dailie sacrifice was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and yet none dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate with
the priest.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to your second answer,
in which you saie, that allthough this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
dyd proue,<note place="margin">the second answer.</note> that none of the common

we haue concluded, that the priest recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:22571:93"/>
alone, for any cummyng of theirs)
yet, saie you to vs:
<q>Ye can not,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 37.</note> by this testimonie, declare, that
none of the ministers and clergie receiued
with hym, being Bisshope there. &amp;c. for the
maner was not then, as you do vse it now.
&amp;c. but all the ministers and clergie dyd
communicate togeather with the Bisshope,
or chiefe minister that celebrated.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You speake herein verie reasonablie,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
that the Bisshope hymselfe celebrating,
had (according vnto the manner of that
tyme) not all the cleargie, I beleeue, but
allwaies some of them to communicate
with hym. And lykewyse in Cathedrall
and principall churches, it is verie credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that some of the clergie dyd receaue
with the chiefe minister. Such was the
order then, and manner in the churche.
But how can you proue, that the Bishope
hymselfe, celebrated euerie daie, solemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie?
or that he said masse allwaies in a
greate or Cathedrall churche, with his
priestes, archedeaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, deacons, and other

no small and litle parisshe churches; ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories,

world, whiche one priest and a clarke

if the populous cities of Antioche or

dyd bestowe the most of his life and
lernyng,) had either but one Cathedrall
church, (which is as conuenient and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
as one citie to haue one Bissho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,)
or if they had a number of faire and
greate churches, and them all furnisshed,
with priestes, archdeacons, deacons, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons,
readers, singers, exorcistes, and
other officers perteinyng to the clergie:
yet, that the clergie and ministers, dyd
euerie daie receiue with the priest at the
aultar, (as we graunt that somtymes they
dyd so in deede,) or that the sacrifice
went not forward, except some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicantes
were prepared, (which proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
ys our question,) I denie it flattlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, vntill you can proue the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
For I see no vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t cause, why I might
not thinke, that the clergie allso of that
tyme, was slacke in the dailie cummyng
to the communion, and that thei hauyng
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:22571:94"/>
one to exequute and to offer the dailie
sacrifice, for the rest, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tended them sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
with communicating in praier onlie
and spirituall eating, and not in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
receiuing. Especiallie if it be
considered, how vehementlie S. Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
noteth and reproueth his clergie,
for laughing not onlie abrode with good
merie felowes, but allso in the church it
self,<note place="margin">Chr. ho. 15. Epist. ad Hebr.</note> at the tyme of praier. Against whom
emong other strange argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ts, and well
worth deepe consideration, this ys one,
that he saieth, <hi>The priest of God doth stand
offering vp the praiers of all, and thow doest
laugh, and he trulie doth tremble in offering
praiers for the, and thou settest light by the
matter.</hi> By which, it is credible, that not
only the people, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> canons had need to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>straine to come thrise a yeare to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
their maker, did suffer the priest to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
alone, but that allso in the clergie,
there was such lacke of consideration (as
it ys in manie Catholikes now, whose fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the
is stedfastinough) that thei were not
in hast to accumpanie dailie the prieste
which celebrated, nor glad to make them
<pb facs="tcp:22571:95"/>
selues readie to communicate with him,
but talked or laughed (the more pytie) to
geather, thinking perchaunse that all will
be well inough, because the priest, in all
their names, offereth a most acceptable
sacrifice for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>. The which fault, I would
it were not emong the Catholikes, and
that thei would keepe themselues as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and deuoute, when thei heare mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
onlie, mynding not to communicate
sacramentallie, as the truth is, that their
part is in the oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, and remember that
not onlie the priest must behaue hymself
reuerentlie, but all the clergie and laietie
present, though thei stand neuer so farr
from the aultar. Therefor, as we will not
stryue against you in this one poynt, that
the ministers receiued with the Bisshope
or chiefe priest, so we bydd you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
it, that allwaies the ministers dyd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
when the daylie sacrifice was
offered. Which, because you thought (as
I gesse) that it shold be ouer hard for you,
therefor you inuent a third shift, for your
defence, which is this:
<q>But if I should flatlie denie,<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 38.</note> that the minister
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:22571:95"/>
receaued, when none of the people were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers,
how could you proue it,<note place="margin">A third answer or shift.</note> by this place?</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is your third answer to S. Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome.
As who should saie,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> if I can not
proue, first, that the people dyd commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with the priestes, or secondly, that
the clergie did allwaies communicate, yet
thirdlye will I answer, that the priest at
the aultar dyd not receaue, when he saw
that none wold come and eate with him.
And here, you require our proufe against
our saying: vnto which I answer, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the oblation and sacrifice was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
therefor it was offered and taken of
the priest, allthough none were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to receaue with hym. But you are
not pleased with this, and therefor you
interprete S. Chrisostome, that
<q>He named it oblationem,<note place="margin">Defence. fol. 38.</note> either for that it
was done in remembrance of Christs sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
or for the offering vp of the bread
and wyne, to the celebration of the Lords
supper.</q>
Well Syr,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> first of all, what vnderstand you
by that, <hi>which,</hi> you saie, <hi>was doone, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Christs saerifice?</hi> Can, you
vnderstand any other thing but the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb facs="tcp:22571:96"/>
and blessing and breaking of bread?
for in doing these thinges, we folow
Christs example, and remember his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Yf then, according vnto your first
sense of this terme, <hi>oblation,</hi> you graunt,
that, <hi>without anie to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate,</hi> the priest
alone dyd offer, ergo you graunt as much
as we require, that the priest dyd take,
blesse, and breake, in remembrance of
Christs sacrifice.</p>
               <p>But on the other side, if you take the
word,<note place="margin">The M. of the defence put to the foile on bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> the sides.</note> oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, for the offering vp of bread
and wine for the prouision of the Lords
supper, that was not the priests offering,
of whiche S. Chrisostome speaketh, but
it was the offering of the people. And
according vnto this your sense, S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
could not saie, that there was
none to communicate, because the good
people, which offered the bread and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
towardes the supper of the Lords, we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
in that point, not onlie communican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
but allso chiefe ministers and doers.
Or, at the least, the priestes and poore
folke, which were susteined by such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
were neuer so euill taught, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:22571:96"/>
they would not remember their dailie
bread, or so wel fedd otherwyse, that they
needed not to care for the welthiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
and make S. Chrisostome to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
vpon it, that there is no bodie to
communicate. And further more, none
of these .ij. kindes of oblations, of which
you now speake, were in vaine or fruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
vnto the people, but as concernyng
the oblation which S. Chrisostome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
his wordes be plaine, <hi>that the dailie
oblation ys in vaine offered.</hi> Allso, if these
wordes, (<hi>dailie oblation and sacrifice,</hi>) by
putting the case that none at all dyd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue,
are to be vnderstanded for that
which is done in remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce of Christs
passion, or for the offering vp of bread
and wine to the celebration of the Lords
supper, you leaue (I do trust) a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
sense of these wordes (<hi>dailie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>)
for that tyme and place, <hi>when the
people doe communicate with the priest.</hi> For
if you doenot, then is the oblation all
one, whether some or none do receaue:
and if you doe, then must you tell vs of
one waie more, of taking this word ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:97"/>
then you haue yet vttered. Againe
if a man will consider how royallie, and

you, fo. 33. of your defence, do make that

to the imitation of the sacrifice of

an that sense to no dispraise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

of the old law, (for that soundeth to no

hardines of this M. of defence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
by this one example, how wickedly
the lerned and holy doctours are abused.
Dyd the seruice then of the church, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
vpon the cummyng of the people?
or dyd some one or other allwaies recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue,
when the dayly oblation was offered?
where should we seeke more better for
the truth of this question, then in Saint
Chrisostome hys owne masse and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes?
for as concernyng the daylie saying
of masse in the latin church, it ys plainely
concluded by the testimonie of S. Austi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
which reporteth of hys mother, that
she serued and honored God at hys aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
<hi>nullius diei pretermissione,</hi>

one day passe. But let vs be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with that which S. Chrisostome alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
shall geaue vs. It appeareth then in
hys masse, that they had for euerie ferie
<pb facs="tcp:22571:99"/>
in the weeke, a certen song in the prayse
of our ladie, S. Michel, S. Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,
and other,<note place="margin">Chrisost. in Liturg.</note> which they vsed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after the Ghospell, and called it <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticion.</hi>
Further it appeareth, that they
dyd not first aske emong the people who
were disposed to receiue, and vppon the
answer geauen,<note place="margin">That the sacrifice of the church was dailie in deed, &amp; not dailie, that is to saie often.</note> frame the matter to a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
but first of all they went to the

was finisshed, and the priest with such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
hym as would, had receyued, then
dydd the Deacon turne hymselfe to the
people, and saie, <hi>Come you neere in the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
of God.</hi> Which is confirmed by Sainct
Chrisostome againe, in hys Homelies v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the Epistle vnto the Hebreus, where
he fayeth, that the Deacon cryeth out,
and calleth vnto the people with these
wordes, <hi>sancta sanctu,</hi> which ys, <hi>these ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

Wherfor as the offering of the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
did not then hang vncertenly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the

cummyng or going of the people, so, it
ys vnreasonablie and vnlernedlie spoken,
that the daylie sacrifice had that name,
not because of the daily celebration, but
because of the seldome vsing of it, when
the people dyd gather themselues vnto
the churche. Furthermore, yf for your
pleasure sake, (<hi>Quotidiana</hi>) when we talke
of oblation, doth not signifie <hi>dailie,</hi> what

                  <note place="margin">ho. 17. ad Hebr.</note> sayeth Chrisostome,
<hi>Doe we not offer vpp daie by daie?</hi> how can
so expresse mention of offering daye by
daye, be interpreted of you, (without a
manifest lie) to signifie a sacrifice cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
not daylie, but oftentymes? you
haue readen allso, (yf you remember it,)
that the greeke church in the lent season
dyd not celebrate but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> saturdaie only
and Sunday, vsing for the rest of the wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
those hostes which were consecrated
before. And what other thing ys this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
obseruation of theirs,<note place="margin">Concil. Const. 6. can. 52.</note> in the lent,
but a manifest argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t that all the yere
<pb facs="tcp:22571:100"/>
before and after, they vsed daylie conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration?
Therefor trulie Syr, you were
to hardie in ventering vpon so strainge
and vntrue interpretation of quotidian
sacrifice, especiallie whereas in so doing
you are come within daunger of much fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.
For whereas by dryuing of your dailie
oblation vnto seldome, you would seeme
to gather cumpany for euery such seldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
oblation, you forget the Sundaies and
manie feastes of our blessed Ladie, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels,
and Martirs, which in the primitiue
church were deuoutlie obserued, by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
watching, lying on the ground, and
praying, vnto all which, the people resor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
if thei dyd receaue at them all, then
make you S. Chrisostome, yea and S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,
S. Austine, and the councell named
<hi>Elibertinum,</hi> verye forgetfull and hastie,
which either reproued the people, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
thei dyd communicate onlie at Easter,
or at some one or two feastes more in the
yere, either prouided against their slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that thei should receaue at the least
thrise a yere. Whereas, (after your say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
there failed no such daie, in which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:22571:100"/>
the people assembled togeather for praier
sake, but that ordinarilie communicants
were readie to go vp and receiue with the
priest. Which yet is so vnlikelie, (that, I
meane, at euerie holydaie, the cummyng
togeather of the people, dyd allwaies ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municants) that you maie
well doubt, whether the best emong the
people dyd receaue at the verie principall
feastes and solemnities. For, by S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
hymselfe it appeareth, that the
end of his veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t calling vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
was not, to haue them in all hast to
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate, but to make them prouyde
for cleanes of lyffe and conscience, that
thei might safelie and profitablie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate.
For,<note place="margin">Hom. 17. ad Hebr.</note> sayeth he, <hi>we doe alowe, neither
those which receaue once, nor those which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
nor those which seldome, but those which
come with a pure conscience.</hi> And the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
which thei were bydd to make,
was of such reuerent manner, that euen
the honest maried men should absteine
from the cumpanie of their lawful wiues,
certen daies before thei receaued, as it is
manifest by a decree of <hi>Concilium Eliber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:22571:101"/>
and by S. Austyne in his sermons
vnto the people.<note place="margin">Ser. 2. do. 10. post tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitatem.</note> What would S. Austine
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, or the fathers of the primitiue church
haue thought of your maried priestes,
which within an houre, two, or three, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thei are departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> their paramours,
doe come vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion table with
heades full of wordlie cares and nightes
fansies, and there dare to call for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and presse them, (if thei come not)
with the institution of Christ, and Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
the first vnto the Corinthians the .xj.
chapiter? Whereas, if there were any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
or regard of Christ, in this new
law of yours, the example should neuer
be suffered, by which his speciall ministers
might be prouoked vnto carnalitie. For
if laie men, before thei communicated,
were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maunded to absteine from their
lawful wyues, what doth a minister, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of God, and quicke of the sprite, with an
vnlawfull woman or yokefelow, which
shold exhort others to the right and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
manner of receiuing? And againe,
if such cleanes was required in them,
whose life was occupied in worldlie bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:22571:101"/>
and labor, how could thei receaue
dailie, which could not be readie dailie?
And yet the dailie seruice of the church
failed not, because that peculiar and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ministers were found to intend vpon
it, and the sacrifice depended not vpon
the cummyng of the laitie, because it is
a principall and singular part, of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
dutie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But this,</hi> you saye, <hi>ys dallying, to stand
vpon the proper signification of the word,
quotidianum.</hi> As though it were in you,
true dealing, to bring by your exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a quartan to a quotidian, or by your
extenuation a quotidian to a quartan, as
to saie, that the sacrifice is named, dailie,
in respect of the peoples receauing, which
perchaunse was but quarterlie, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that the sacrifice was dailie, because
the people were not readie but at prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
and quaterlie feastes of the yeare.
And herein, to greue vs againe, you pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
vs with the word <hi>frustra, in vayne,</hi> yet
you doe it so manerlie, that allthough
much wrong be done therein vnto vs, we
should not, for al that, be iustlie or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie

you shold not vse it. For we both doe see

is had in vayne.</hi> And as we require, that
(<hi>Quotidiana</hi>) be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in his proper signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
of <hi>daily,</hi> so do we graunt vnto you
that you shall vse the worde <hi>frustra</hi> in his
most proper signification, neither do we
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trarye you in it, but that <hi>frustra</hi> in this
place, is taken for vayne. Therfor, you
can vrge the worde <hi>frustra</hi> no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
then we doe, except you can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
worse of it then vayne. <hi>Yea,</hi> (say you
further) <hi>it was done in vayne, because it
was done without cumpany,</hi> but we thinke
rather it was in vayne, as concerning the
priest his looking for the people. And so
it appeareth that you doe not hurt vs in
alleagyng of (<hi>frustra</hi>), which we take in
the proper signification of it as well as
you, but our stryuing must now be vpon
the referring of that worde, vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
receauing, or vnto the offering of the
sacrifice. And further, it appeareth, as we
doe vrge the worde <hi>Quotidiana,</hi> that you
doe not so vrge the worde <hi>frustra,</hi> (as you
<pb facs="tcp:22571:103"/>
asked leaue to do) but quyte leauing the
signification of the worde, (as vpon the
which we do not disagree) you runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the constrewyng of the worde. And if
we will haue the oblation to be daylye,
you will haue it so vnderstanded, that, by
Sainct Chrisostome his owne wordes, it
should seeme to be done in vayne, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
it was done without cumpany, which
how well it may follow, I require but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
iudgement. For if it were (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng
to your thinking) done in vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the people did not receiue: ergo
yet it was done. In vayne, you say. Be it
so, for a while. But yet it was done. For
of that which is not done at all, you can
not say any thing, the one way or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to the prayse or disprayse of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Now, if the sacrifice were offered in
vayne, when no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municantes were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
doe you make such a trifle of Sainct
Chrisostome, that he wolde do any thing
which he was persuaded, should be in vay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?
And if he did thinke, that all was to
no purpose, which he did in the sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng,
except the people did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:22571:103"/>
wolde he not first of all, haue ben assured
to haue communicantes, before he wold
enter vnto the act of offering? And in so
hygh matters, wolde he haue entred in to
the celebratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of masse, of which he could
not presentlye tell, whether he should say
it in vayne or no? Nay, the church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
yet is more wyser then so. For, left
their paynes should be lost, in the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
supper, the ministers must be warned
before hand, yf any will communicate,
that (according vnto your interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>)
the oblation be not in vayne, if they shall
haue no cumpany to receiue with them.
And yet, your wisedome, to proue that
our dayly oblation, which we gather owt
of S. Chrisostome, should not be as we
vnderstand it, doth bring S. Chrisostomes
saying vnto such a sense, which doth not
become any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon witt and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
For by you S. Chrisostome might
haue this meaning: Here good people,
I haue stode all this while at the aulter,
and haue prayed for all states, and haue
consecrated the sacrament of the Lordes
body, which you should receaue with than
<pb facs="tcp:22571:104"/>
kes geauing: and now I perceiue, all that
I haue done, is in vayne, because there is
none to receiue with me. But, phye vpon
such a sense, in that lerned and godly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
of Chrisostome. For we might say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hym: Syr, you which do make so greate
pryce of the misteryes, why did you goe
vnto them, before you were sure to make
a fructfull end of them? why did you not
send your Deacon, to know how many
would receiue with you, lest you might
procede further in vayne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you should
in the end lacke communicantes? And if
you were perswaded, that you did receiue
in vayne, except some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municated with
you, whi wolde you receiue at all? or how
doe you, but receiue that to your owne
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>demnation, in which you doe not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
the institution of Christ, and take
cumpany with you? This, with much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
mighte be iustely sayed against Sainct
Chrisostome, if the dayly sacrifice, which
we reade so playnelye in hym, could be
thowght of hym to be done in vayne, yf
none did communicate, as you full cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelye
doe vrge the two syllabes <hi>frustra.</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:22571:104"/>
Then besides this, I answer, that how so
euer you will take the worde sacrifice, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
none, either of the clergye or lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie,
wolde communicate with the priest,
yet the act of sacrificyng can not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blye
be therfor vayne, because there lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
cumpany to receiue. For, yf you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
by <hi>dayly oblation,</hi> either daylye
almes, or daylye prayses and thankes, or
dayly remembrance of Christes passion,
or the very bodye and bloude of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior,
what one of all these are vayne, only
because the people do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate?
Therfore in grawnting vnto vs, (which
you can not deny) but that the oblation
was daylye, how can you vse the worde
<hi>frustra,</hi> to proue (as it were by S. Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
owne meaning) that it was to no
purpose, when the people did not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue?
Whereas euery kynde of Christian
mens oblation, ys good and acceptable
in it self, by reason, either of the good will
with which it is offered, or the pryce and
purenes of the thing which is offered, as
in the example, of the body and bloud of
Christ. Who, but vnsensible, can thinke
<pb facs="tcp:22571:105"/>
that S. Chrisostome dyd iudge, at the end
of his masse, when cumpany did not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
to receiue, that all his supplications
and prayers, which he had made before
with all his harte and power, for the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
and the deade, and all his praysinges of
God in the memorye of his Sayntes, and
all his prayers vnto Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he might not receiue hym to
his condempnation, which sitteth at the
ryght hand of God his father in heauen,
and yet was ther inuisibly present before
him: who (say I) can thinke, that S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome
did eo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clude all those thinges to
haue ben done in vayne, because the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did not receiue? How then? Yf the
people doe receiue, are all thinges strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
trymlye wrought? Ergo it is the
peoples wyll, which geaueth strength vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the sacramentes, and not the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ. And the consecration ys
perfyted, not by the allmightynes of the
<hi>worde</hi> (as S. Cypriane sayeth),<note place="margin">Cypri. de coena Domini.</note> nor by the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
wordes of our Lorde, <hi>This is my body,</hi>

after that the priest had receiued,
and had fully ended his office in offering,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> were the people called, and then were
they serued without the chauncell, in a
place meeter for them. Now, these thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
not with standing, you be so vayne in
your two syllabes <hi>frustra,</hi> that allthowgh
at the begynnyng you asked leaue to vse
them, and toke leaue also to doe it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionallye,
yf we wolde abyde by it, that
the worde <hi>Quotidianum</hi> signifyeth dayly,
and not seldome, yet in further reasonyng
you doe so farr passe your owne self in
knowledge, that you affirme absolutelye,
that these wordes, (<hi>the dayly oblation is
had in vayne</hi>) declare playnelye S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes
mynde, that he thought it to be
of the substance of the sacrament, that a
number should be partakers of it. As who
should say, that in the thirde Hom. vpon
the Epistle to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>phesians, he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
against sole receiuing, and not rather
signifyed vnto them, that he labored, not
vpon their dayly cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>myng, but onlie their
deuoute and worthye cummyng. For,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:106"/>
after he had sayd:<note place="margin">Chr. ho. 3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  <hi>we stande at the aultar in

now, that their receiuing parteyned to
the substance of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, he addeth:
<hi>I speake not these thinges, because ye should
simplelie communicate, but that you should
make your selfes worthye.</hi> Doe we then
deny, that the dayly sacrifice was done in
vayne? No. But we vnderstande it, how
it was done in vayne. Not in respect of
the sacrifice it self, but in respect of the
people, for whom the meate was readye,
and for whom preparance was made, but
they wolde not come vnto it. As in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, speakyng agaynste certayne,
which did not consider and beare awaye
the textes of scripture, which were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in the church twyse or thryse in the
weeke, the reader allwaies telling them
the name and place of the Prophet which
was then in hande:<note place="margin">Chr. ho. 9. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>

                  <hi>Therfore</hi> (sayeth he)
<hi>they owght to be more clearer vnto you, and
you owght to know not onlie the text, but the
cawses allso, of the thinges which are wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and his name which wrote them. But all
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:22571:106"/>
is in vayne, and without fruct.</hi> Yet he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not absolutelye, that all the labor of
the reader was in vayne, nor that all the
hearers were fructlesse, (of which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth
a few in that very place) but that
as concerning the peoples common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytt,
which was intended in those lessons,
all was vayne and fructlesse. Which being
so reasonable, and so conuenient a sense,
it is wonder that you would not se it, but
folow rather your owne inuention, and
leese the meaning of S. Chrisostome. And
trulye no greate meruell, yf you mistake
an other mans mynd, wheras in your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
inuentions you may be proued so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull.
For in this last end of your fifth
chapiter, you conclude playnelie, that S.
Chrisostome vnderstandeth, the oblation
to be vayne, which hath no cumpany to
receiue at it: and that cumpany is taken
of hym, to be of the substance of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
to which purpose you alleage,
that who so euer is not partaker of the
misteryes, doth impudentlie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
to stand there by in presence. Well
Syr, if you call this vayne, how doth S.
<pb facs="tcp:22571:107"/>
Chrisostome saye trulye, that the obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is had in vayne? For now you call it
vayne,<note place="margin">the M. of the defen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce is ouer cast in his owne tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyng.</note> because of lacke of cumpany, and
by your answers in this chapiter before,
you proued that he neuer lacked cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
How can you make these your two
deuyses to agree togeather? <hi>Our daylie sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi>
sayeth S. Chrisostome, <hi>is had in
vayne. He meaneth</hi> (say you) <hi>that he had
no cumpany, the hauing of which being a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciall
poynt, ergo that must be in vayne,
which was done without it.</hi> But (say I now
against you) S. Chrisostome dyd neuer
lacke cumpany, when he receaued, ergo
it is not trulye sayed of hym, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
was in vayne. Either he then, so
good a Bisshopp, lyeth, which so sayeth
that the oblation was in vayne: or you do
lye, in the interpreting of hym, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
hym to haue such a sence of this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<hi>vayne,</hi> as destroyeth a certayne other
veritie, as you do make it. But how proue
I, that he neuer receiued alone? Trulye
not by my owne knowledge, but by your
answers. For, your second answer, vnto
the Catholikes obiection, was, that in S.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:22571:107"/>
Chrisostomes tyme, the clergie did all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
receiue with the Bishope, or cheife
ministre. And this you promised to proue
more largelye hereafter. But the better
you proue it hereafter, the worse it is for
you in this present place. You sayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
that <hi>daylye</hi> was taken for, often,
and that at those tymes, in which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did not daylye, but often come, he all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
had either some of the people, or
the residew of the ministres and clergie,
to communicate with hym. So then, by
these your owne conclusions, I proue,
that the priest did, at that tyme, neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue
alone. How haue you then now so
forgoten your selfe, in this end of your
chapiter, that you make S. Chrisostome
to saye, that none doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate with
hym, and that the oblation is therfor in
vayne? wheras at the begynning of this
chapiter, you would haue it cleere and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident,
that the priest neuer lacked cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
to communicate with hym solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye.
Syr, I confesse playnely, we shall be
ouercummed, if we stryue long with you,
or if we can not be ouercummed, because
<pb facs="tcp:22571:108"/>
fayth doth not referr herselfe, vnto the
euent of disputations, yet we shall be (I
trow) confownded, because we can not
tell where to haue you. For, when we
thinke, that vpon the sight of S. Chriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
wordes, which we haue so much
spoken of, you would saye, that we had at
the least some colour of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t for sole
receauyng, you make shift by and by, with
all the learning that you haue, to proue
that ther was allwayes some cumpany or
of clergie, or of layetie, to receiue with
the Bishop, or cheife minister. And when
we thinke to fynde you standing in that
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clusion, and draw neerer vnto you, strait
wayes you fall besides your self, and runne
in to a contrarye corner, where you fight
against your owne saying, and proue, that
allthowgh there were oblation and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
daylye, which, by force of the worde
<hi>Quotidianum,</hi> you could not denye vnto
vs, yet that graunted, none receiued with
the priest, (say you) and therfore it was
<hi>frustra.</hi> Wherfore (good Syr) take the
counsell vnto your selfe, which you doe
geaue vnto vs, and vse not to ground do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:22571:108"/>
vpon the coniecture of a few sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables:
and (with further counsell vnto
you) beware that you geaue not your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary
so much, that you make your ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
case the worse: as to permitt vs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye
<hi>Quotidianum,</hi> in his proper sense, by
which we proued daily sacrifice, and then
to labor to proue that it was in vayne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of lacke of cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany, as thowgh you
had not concluded before, that no obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was without cumpany. Which to
tell you of, allthough it be a litle disauan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage

But, as all the Christians generallye, can
not by vertue of these wordes, (<hi>diuyde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you</hi>) challenge their part in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
yf the priest should thinke them
vnworthye, euen so, neyther Christ had
this meaning in them, that they should
<pb facs="tcp:22571:110"/>
be as a necessarie commaundement to
charge therby his priestes, allwayes to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
and distribute his sacrament, but for
that present cumpanye of his most dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Apostles, he said, <hi>Take and diuide it
emong you.</hi> How then? Maye not the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
be diuided emong the people?
Yes trulye. But that it should be diuided
emong the people, such necessitie is not
gathered out of, <hi>Take ye, and diuide it
emong you.</hi> But saye you
<q>How can it be taken at the minister his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,<note place="margin">Defence.</note>
and diuided or distributed emong them,
vnlesse there be a cumpanye?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But what talke you,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> of, <hi>to be taken at the
minister his handes,</hi> as though that S. Luke
did make thereof any signification? He
telleth vs, that Christ our Sauyor saide vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Apostles, <hi>Take this:</hi> but he maketh
no worde at all, of taking at the minister
his handes. But, this would serue well your
purpose, if that when Christ said distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
vnto his twelue, <hi>Take this,</hi> you could
perswade the rude, that he spake vnto the
people, and commaunded them to take
his sacrament at the minister his handes.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:22571:110"/>
Then further, where you aske, how it can
be distributed emong them, except there
be a cumpanye? For whom you do spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
I can not redely tell. For if you mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the Apostles, there was a good cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of them, to take that which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed:
and if you meane the people,
I wonder whye you call them vnto this
matter, the Euangelistes speaking of the
Apostles onlye. You alleage the text of
the scripture: goe not then, I praye you,
from the text. The wordes be playne:
<hi>Take and diuide emong you.</hi> Yf it had bene
sayd indefinitelie, <hi>diuide,</hi> you might haue
thought with some reason, that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
of distributing the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for euer afterwarde, had ben gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
in those wordes. But, our Sauyor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth
the worde <hi>diuide,</hi> in saying,
<hi>Diuide this emong you.</hi> Which wordes yet
if you thinke to haue ben spoken, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to the Apostles personallie, but to all
Bishopes and high Priestes, which should
haue in tyme to come, the place or office
of the Apostles, as I graunte this sense,
because it is conuenient and true, so yet
<pb facs="tcp:22571:111"/>
the people (you see) are not comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
within the text of which we speake.
For,<note place="margin">The M. of the defence hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised more then he can performe<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> of theis three pointes, <hi>Take you, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
you, emong you,</hi> no one can be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed,
as spoken vnto the people. And
if one maye, why not all, as well as one,
seing that in those three pointes, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are not varyed? Where then do you
fynde now any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundement of distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
the sacrament vnto the people?
It can no be diuided, (saye you) except
there be cumpany. You speake somewhat
therein, but tell vs fyrst, what cumpanye
you meane?<note place="margin">The sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diuided emong vs euerie day.</note> For I say, that vnto this daye,
if you consider the whole church, as one
howse, and euerye aultar in the world, as
one table, and the body of Christ, as it is
one, allthough the mysticall signes of it
be in many places, so shall you see it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that which you be so glad to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
that the sacrament is daylye taken, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and diuided emong vs. But now, tell
vs further, what necessitie you fynde, why
it should be diuided? In deede distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
presupposeth cumpanye. But we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
what necessitie doth requyre distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:22571:111"/>
For the wordes of our Sauior doe
not absolutelye commaunde it,<note place="margin">Let the M. of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke to the question.</note> but vnto
the Apostles especyallie his wordes were
directed, because thei were with hym, to
receiue at his handes. And so, the same
wordes maye appertayne to all that cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
masse, when some are readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.
But as, if twelue be not readie to
receiue, yet fower maye: so, if fower be not
readie, one maye receiue alone. But then
you complayne vpon vs, and saye, that we
maye as well leaue out, <hi>eatyng, drynkyng,
and doyng in remembraunce of Christ,</hi> as we
doe dispense with <hi>distributing.</hi> Feare not
(I warrant you) we be nothing so folish.
For meates are necessarye, but not distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution,
and without other mens mouthes
we can eate: but we can not distribute,
without others handes or mouthes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
it. Also, the remembrance of Christ
his passion, is and maye be allwaies vsed:
but distribution of the Sacrament, is not
allwaies possible. And (to be shorte) the
sole receiuing can not be without eating,
&amp;c.: but the sole receiuing at masse, is and
maye be without distributing. And here
<pb facs="tcp:22571:112"/>
now, for feare least we should not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
the institution of Christ, you tell vs
againe, out of Sainct Cypriane, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must be altered in the preceptes of
Christ, which saying you extende vnto so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
receiuing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and receiuing vnder one kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
(which S. Cypriane neuer thought
vpon in that epistle,) and you forget to
mengle water and wine togeather at the
communion, which S. Cypriane in that
place so earnestly requyreth to be done,
as I haue before declared at large. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Syr, haue no mistrust, but that God
the Holyghost prouideth abundantlye,
that Christes and his owne institution,
shall neuer be broken of the church: and
when you be deliuered of this feare, see
whether you can proue any better, then
you haue done hitherto, that the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of cumpany to receiue with the priest,
is determined in scripture. And if it be
not determined expreslie, it standeth as
a thing indifferent, by your owne vayne
principle, and then it is no breache of
Christ his institution, to vse sole recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.
How saye you then? Will you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:22571:112"/>
that fonde principle of yours, that
nothing is of necessitie to be credited,
but that which is expreslie in the scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res?
No, you will not, I know, your harte
is so great against traditions. Make then
no more a doe, but graunt, that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
of number and cumpanye, is no
more requisite, then the obseruing of the
tyme, place, kynde of persons, and other
circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>stances, which the Ghospell sheweth
to haue ben vsed at the institution of the
Sacrament. No saye you, that
<q>Many circumstances of place, person, and
tyme, maye be altered &amp;c. we graunte you:
but, that cumpanye in receyuyng is one of
those circumstances, that we can not graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,
as well for the reasons before declared,
as allso that we haue none example of the
Apostles, or primitiue church, that we maye
so doe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Consider, I praye you Syr, the maner of
your reasonyng. We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clude vpon your
owne principle, (which againe we must
call vayne, leste anye should thinke, that
we doe allow it) that cumpanie in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
is by expresse scripture, of no more
necessitie, then the circumstances of tyme
<pb facs="tcp:22571:113"/>
and place, which Christ vsed in the dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
of his sacrament: and you answer,
that it is not founde in the example of
the Apostles, or primitiue churche, that
the cumpanie in receiuing was omitted,
as tyme and place are founde to haue ben
altered, in which saying you doe but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
your vayne principle, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of which our argument proceeded.
Cumpany in receiuing, in respect of the
sacrament receiued, is no greater matter
then the circumstance of tyme and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
but yet of sole receiuing (saye you)
we haue none examples of the Apostles,
or primitiue church, as though nothing
might be vsed otherwise then as of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
example it maye be gathered, which
addition, if you thinke good to vse, to
make your foresaid principle vayne abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelye,
lett it be so then, and according
to this reformed principle, our argument
shall thus come against you. What so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
Christ did, at the institution of the
sacrament, which we fynde not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by the authoritie or example of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
or primitiue churche, that is of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:22571:113"/>
necessitie to be obserued. But, our Sauior
delyuered the sacrament at night, and the
Apostles with the primitiue churche of
their tyme, haue no example or manner
to warrant vs to doe otherwyse: ergo, we
must of necessitie receiue at night. But,
it is vnreasonable to bring in such a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie:
ergo it is a vayne principle which
maintayneth such absurditie. And what
you might aunswer vnto this, I can not
diuise, except you will take examples of
the primitiue church which folowed the
Apostles. But then remembre what you
be wonte to saye out of Tertullian, how
that is best which was fyrst: and agayne
out of S. Cypriane, Christ is most to be
followed, which was the first of all. And
consider allso,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> whether the church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth
dyd not receiue the sacrament at
night,<note place="margin">Acto. 20.</note> and reade in the actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels,
whether there was not breaking of
bread at night: and fynde, if you can, in
all scripture, that ministring of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
was vsed in the mornyng. Are you
wiser then Christ? can you better dispose
the tymes, then the maker of tyme hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?
<pb facs="tcp:22571:114"/>
Did not the Corinthians receiue
at night?<note place="margin">An easie matter it is to troble the church if me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wold folowe the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes.</note> Is there anye mention in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
of receiuing before none? These,
loe, be your common places, which if I
would follow, I could make as great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
at the breaking of Christ his
institution in the tyme, as you doe make
for the lacking of communicantes. For it
is no matter to vs, whether you do bring
two or three causes, wherefore the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
at night, is or maye be altered, (for
if good causes would haue preuailed, you
would neuer haue plaied so madd partes
in crying out against sole receiuing) but,
all thinges (you saie) must be brought to
the institution of Christ, and as he gaue
example, so must we follow: and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then, might not one first breake his
fast, and afterwarde come to the Lorde
his table? And, if busynes lett a Merchant
all the daye, why might he not receiue at
night? If you can dispense with one thing,
you maye do the lyke with all. If you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the tyme, you maye alter the maner,
the place, the bread, the wyne, and all that
Christ did. This kynde, Syr, of Rhetory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:22571:114"/>
and Logike we learne of you, which
if you do greatly myslyke, when you hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
it of an other besides your selfe, looke
then vpon your selfe better, and correcte
that vayne glorious principle, which hath
a shewe of learning and pietie, but is in
deede most rude and wycked, when you
saye, that nothing should be necessarylie
obserued, which is not expreslie in scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
or, nothing thereof might be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
without auctoritie or example of the
Apostles and primitiue church. Which
example of Apostles or primitiue church
you neede not to passe vpon in this kynde
of matter. For if you be most surely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded,
by the very text of the scripture,
that companye to receiue with the priest,
is of the substance of the sacrament, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
example might be founde in the
primitiue church of sole receiuing, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
vnder one kynde, you would yet
condempne that example, by the playne
institution of Christ, as you would take
it: what good then should an example do
to you, which, although it were neuer so
playne, yet you would not be persuaded,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:115"/>
but that the cumpany at the communyon
is allwaies of necessitie?<note place="margin">Note this point.</note> But, of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
we shall speake hereafter, in the
meane tyme, what bring you, to shewe
that the hauing of company, is of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
of the sacrament? And marke,
that we aske you not of companye, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be laudable, conuenient, or hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
at the celebration of euerie masse,
but whether it be necessarie. Of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
our question is, and of expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
and you tell vs of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schall
lambe of the Iewes, and applye it
vnto our Sacrament, that lyke as cumpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
was of necessitie to the eating of the
Paschall lambe, so that it should be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to the receiuing of the sacrament.
After which argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, you triumphe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
victorie, and aske of vs:
<q>VVyll you saie,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> that companye to eate vpp
the Paschall lambe was not of the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the sacrament? &amp;c.</q>
If you meane by the worde (sacrament)
in this place,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> the Paschall lambe it selfe,
cumpanye (you know) was no more of
the substances of the lambe, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> you with
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:22571:115"/>
your bydden gestes, be of the substance of
your meate, when you haue prouided for
your selfe and them a fatt goose and a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon.
But, if you vnderstand by <hi>sacrament,</hi>
al the act and ceremonie of preparing and
eating the lambe, the calling of company
vnto it was in some case materyal. For if
the numbre be lesse, then shall be able to
eate vpp the lambe,<note place="margin">Exo. 12.</note> then (saieth God) he,
whosoeuer he be, shal take his next neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bor.
But you may say, although the calling
of company were conditionall,<note place="margin">Cumpanie in eating of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>schal lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be was not of absolute necessitie.</note> yet the
hauing of companye was of the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
of the sacrament, It was so of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staunce,
as other things were which God
in that place commaunded, I meane gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of their loynes, and hauing of shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
on their feete, and holding of staffes in
their han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es. But if by reason of some
wounde or dysease, anye one of them had
not ben able to suffer hys shooe on hys
foote, although his feete would not bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
hym, yet if his stomache serued hym,
could he not haue eaten with his fello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
and eate as fast as the best, without
breaking of the matter? Lykewise if one
<pb facs="tcp:22571:116"/>
had ben borne without ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>des, or had lost
his handes in fighting for his countrey, so
that he could not hold any staff in the
hand which he had not, was he to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from his parte in the lambe? Yf
these pointes then, which God so distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlie
commaunded, haue their interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and are not so absolutely to be
obserued, but that, for considerations,
thei maye be omitted, I see no cawse,
whye the hauing of numbre in eating of
the lambe, should be so necessarye, that it
could not be omitted. But the matter
would be playner, if we were once agreed
how the terme of (<hi>substance</hi>) is to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
when you speake of it. For if you meane,
that to be of the substance of a precept,
which<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>, without case of necessitie, and
without dispensatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the cheife gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
can not be rashlye omitted, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
priuate man shall thinke good in hym
selfe, then I graunt, that all those poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
which are comprehended within the
ceremonye of eating the paschall lambe,
were of the substance of it: But, if sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
shall signifye such partes of any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:22571:116"/>
as which no man for any res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
maye omitt or chainge (in which
sence we doe take it, in speaking of the
necessarye forme and matter of euerye
sacrament) then doe I denye vnto you,
that euerie point comprehended within
the ceremonye of eating the lambe, was
of the substance of that matter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for
if your comparing of all Christendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
vnto all the Iewes, and our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
churches vnto their sundrye houses,
and the eating of our Sacrament vnto
their lambe, did neuer so well agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather,
yet, because it is not proued of
you, that euerie point commaunded of
God, about the eating of the lambe, is so
essentiallie of the sustance therof, that in
no case it maye be omitted or altered,
therfore you come nothing nigh to the
aunswer of our question, which is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that of necessitie there must be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panye
allwaies, to receiue at the masse?
Then againe, it is to be noted, that in the
old law, God did not commaunde them
to haue companye at the eating of the
lambe, but, rather then anye parte shold
<pb facs="tcp:22571:117"/>
be lefte vneaten, he willeth them to call
more conpanye, presupposing that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
would be in euerie household compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
inough to eate a lambe, but yet gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
no commaundement of companye
to be at it. For if one by hym selfe alone,
had eaten a whole lambe, his wife and
children rounde about hym, not louing
that kinde of meate, and yet delighting
in the histories which he would tell them
of Egipt and the redd sea, I see not that
you were able to burden hym with the
breache of Goddes institution. Besides
this, whereas the lambe of God which is
eaten of the Christians, is not more mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
vnto a thousande then vnto one alone,
and one alone receyueth the whole, that
he needeth not to send for his neighbor,
your proportion betwyxt the lambe of
the lewes, and our Sacrament was not
rightly deuised of you. Also, if I could fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
no faulte with your application, yet,
except you brought greater aucthoritie
for the defence of it then your owne, I
would lykewise of myne owne head, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
an other sence besides yours, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:22571:117"/>
saie that my vnderstanding of that place,
serueth better to the purpose then yours.
In which case, as both of vs, might vse
perchaunce probable interpretations, so
yet none of vs both should conclude any
thing of necessitie. And yet, I neede not
to runne vnto myne owne wytt for this
matter, because that, long sence, Sainct
Denyse the Carthusyan doth saie in his
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mentaries vpon Exodus,<note place="margin">Dionisius Carth. in 12. ca. Exp.</note> that the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of a neighbor to eate of the lambe,
if howsehold cumpanie were not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
doth signifie that euerie Christian,
which is neuer able by hymselfe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
sufficientlie, the mercyes of God,
shewed vnto vs in the death and sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
of his Sonn, should call his neighbor to
hym, and prouoke him to helpe forward
that all thankes and praises might be gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vnto the author of so excellent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites.
Now, to speake somewhat more of
this lambe, (whilest you are of so good a
mynd and remembrance, to confesse that
ther is a proportion and lykenes betwyxt
our sacrament and it,) consider that the
lambe was offered vpp to God before it
<pb facs="tcp:22571:118"/>
was eaten,<note place="margin">An allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall expo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the paschall lambe.</note> which proueth that Christ of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
his bodie and bloode in his last sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
before the Apostles did receiue hym.
The blood also of the lambe, was put v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
both postes of the doores, which si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifieth,
that good Christians do receiue
Christ in the mouth and in the hart. <hi>And
they which receyue vnworthely,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Euseb. Emi scenus in hom. feriae 2. post Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scha.</note> 
                  <hi>or els in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuing,
doe not beleiue it to be the blood of
Christ, these put the blood vpon one poste on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye.</hi>
You are commaunded also, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure
the head with the feete, and the
appourtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ces, that you shold not be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and nyce in your feeding, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
and humblie receiue his diuinitie,
his humanitie, and all other profond and
secrete mysteries. In which, if any thing
shall seeme absurde vnto your grosse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
you must referr all vnto the
working of the Holyeghost, and so you

not euerie sacrament matter and forme,<note place="margin">The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and for me of the sacrament.</note>
of which two it is constituted? Is not the
sensible thing and element (as bread, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
oyle. &amp;c.) called the matter of them:
and the wordes, which are added to those
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:22571:119"/>
elementes, are not thei called the formes?
<hi>The worde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. tract. 80. super loan.</note> sayeth S. Augustyne, <hi>commeth

Bread,</hi> is the matter of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the aultar, and the wordes <hi>This

two, when thei are brought togeather by
the intention of such as are called right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
to the office, straitwaies there is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
consisting of the visible signe,
and of the inuisible and naturall body of
our Sauyor. And whether it be receiued
or reserued, God doth not pull back his
worde at the departing, or not comming
of men. But goe to. what saye you of the
matter of the sacrament, as it is in vse?</p>
               <q>The matter,<note place="margin">Defence. fo. 45.</note> is bread and the bodye, wyne
and the blood of Christ.</q>
               <p>Yf the bodye of Christ be the matter,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
as you separate the matter from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
how commeth it to passe, I pray you,
that there is the bodye of Christ to hym
which will vse the bread? Do you thinke,
that where so euer any breade is, there is
allso the bodye of Christ, to hym which
will vse the bread? Yf this be false, (as it
<pb facs="tcp:22571:120"/>
is) then I saye that the body, with which
(and the bread) you make vpp the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the sacrament, as it is in vse, doth
not come to the breade without some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

operation. Except you thinke, that
any power of creature is able to exhibite
the body of his creator and maker. What
operation then is that, by which this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which you saye is bread and the body
of Christ, doth come to that perfection,
to be the bodye of our Sauior. For we
know, that breade may be had from the
bakers, or if (as your selfes now do misly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
with bakers bread) you will haue clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and fyne cakes, to be made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
thei are men or women which make
them, and their howses are not inuisible.
But how come you to haue that bodye,<note place="margin">Let this be distin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ctlie and directlie answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note>
with which (and the bread) you make vpp
the matter of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t as it is in vse?</p>
               <p>For you can not vse the wordes of the
Ghospell to bring that to passe, because
thei are the forme of the sacrament, and
you in this place do so speake of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as it is distincted from the proper for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.
Then agayne, how ignorantlie<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:22571:120"/>
vnreuerently is it deuised of you, to make
the bodye of Christ, the materiall parte
of the sacrament as it is in vse, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
of which bodye, all matter and
forme serueth which is requyred to the
sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t? But if this be the matter, what
is the forme?
<q>The forme of ministration is,<note place="margin">Defence fo. 45.</note> that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
should take the matter, and with the

as Christ did.</q>
God send you better memorie,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> or if me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie

Did you not begynne to tell vs of
the matter and forme of the sacrament,
as it is in vse? make then an end of that
which you beganne. The matter you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
defyned. what is the forme of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament?
<hi>The forme</hi> (saye you) <hi>of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
is, &amp;c.</hi> The forme of ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>?
Whoe requyred it of you? You must tell
vs of the forme of the sacrament as it is
in vse, and not the forme of ministration.
And whereas among all learned men, the
forme is the perfection of the matter, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
els you shold neuer haue made such

a diuision of the sacrament as it is in vse,<note place="margin">Consider, by this one place, what proper scho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lemen the new gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell hath created.</note>
or els you should haue told vs of such a

                  </gap>)
a grace vnto the matter. Is the forme of
the sacrament and forme of ministration
all one with you? or the forme of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
as it is in vse, and the forme of
ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, is it all one? what you might
make of the first you could not tell, and
therefor you turned out of your purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
vnto the seconde. And although you
speake nothing of the matter of ministra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion,
you expounde yet the forme of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
vnto vs, and whereas you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
with the matter of the Sacrament,
you refuse to declare vnto vs the forme
of yt, which we looked for. Now, if your
iudgement serued you, to make all one
thing of the sacrament as it is in vse, and
of the ministration of yt, then must the
breade and bodye (as you lye) of Christ,
be the matter of ministration, lyke as it
is the matter of the sacrament as it is in
vse: which if it be true, I put the case, that
the minister would not delyuer that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
matter vnto the people with his ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:22571:121"/>
handes, but bydd them take it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfes,
and distribute it emong them? we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
it not the bodye of Christ? It could be
no otherwise, because you saye, that the
matter of the sacrament, as it is in vse, and
as it is considered as a seperate parte from
the forme, is breade and the bodye. But
how can it be hys bodye before the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the ghospell do come vnto it? and
how are the wordes of the ghospell vsed
to that purpose, whereas you saie that the
minister taketh the matter in to his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
(which is by your interpretation the
breade and the bodye) and delyuereth it
with the wordes of the ghospell. So that
the wordes come after, and the bodie is
allreadie in his handes before. Also what
wordes of the ghospell are those, which
you meane, when you saye, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
must be deliuered with the wordes of
the ghospell? Yf you meane the wordes
of consecration (<hi>this is my bodye, this is my
bloud &amp;c.</hi>) Then is the English ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
vnperfecte, which vsed not those
wordes in the delyuering of their, what
shall I call it. And except you meane tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<pb facs="tcp:22571:122"/>
wordes, what other in the ghospell
maye serue to that purpose, I can not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise?
For as concernyng those wordes,
<hi>Take, eate, diuide yt emong you, doe this in
my remembrance,</hi> they neede no repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
by mouth, but onlye expressing of them
in deede. And then, as concerning the
worde (<hi>diuide</hi>) when yt is spoken to eche
one of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municantes, to whom shall
eche one of them diuide any part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of that
the which he receyueth wholye hymsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe?
Yet if the worde (<hi>diuidite, diuide yt</hi>)
be an essentiall and formall parte, of the
sacrament as it is in vse, then must euery
one which shall rightlye vse it, make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
and diuision of it, except you meane,
that the vse of the sacrament perteyneth
only vnto the minister, or that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
must take and eate, as the Ghospell
commaundeth them, and that, to diuide
it, was not spoken to them, although that
worde doth also folowe in the ghospell.
But to what purpose haue you, so scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastically,

with all his partes, according vnto
your newlie deuised diuision? what if the
<pb facs="tcp:22571:123"/>
priest alone receyue the matter with his
owne handes, and vse the wordes of the
ghospell, doth he not fulfill all that which
is to be requyred? The priest, you know,
doth fyrst receyue hym selfe, before he
geaueth vnto other. And what doth he
receyue, I praye you? doth there lack ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter or forme, or anye essentiall
parte, vnto that which he receyueth? Or
will you saye, that the sacrament which he
hath allready taken and eaten, hath not his
iust forme, before the people also haue
receyued? yf the case be so harde, then
were it necessarye, that when the matter
is taken into the handes of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicantes,
a watchworde should be gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
when all they at once with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the ghospell, should receyue that
matter. But if this be but a folysh toye,
meete for an idle brayne, to thinke that
eche one doth not receyue the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
with all the partes of yt, except his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
eate with hym, how doe the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes
take awaye that very forme which
you speake of, in vsing of sole receyuing?
for your forme (which you haue inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ted)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:22571:123"/>
is, to delyuer the matter with the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of the ghospell, but the matter maye
be delyuered vnto one alone, or recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
of one alone, with the wordes of the
ghospell, ergo, the allowing of sole recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
doth not take awaye your forme.
And this I speake, as though it were true,
that which you bable of the forme of the
sacrament. For as concerning the verye
forme of the sacrament, the church hath
allwayes taught, and in all scholes it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
declared, that these wordes (<hi>This
is my bodye</hi>) are the forme of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<hi>But</hi> (saye you) <hi>I talke of the forme of
the ministration of the sacrament.</hi> Why dyd
you not tell vs so much of your mynde at
the beginnyng? And if we did not keepe
the forme of ministratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, how could you
proue thereby, that we altered the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
parte of the Lorde his supper? For
(I trust) you be not so voyde of naturall
sense, but that you vnderstand, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and forme of a good dyshe of meate,
and the seruing in of the same meate, to
be sundrye thinges and different? And, as
the man and the meate are different, so
<pb facs="tcp:22571:124"/>
is the matter and forme of either man or
meate seperately to be distincted and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
of. Yet you, in so playne a matter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
so forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> your selfe, that begynning
to speake of the matter and forme of the
sacrament as it is in vse, and hauing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the definyng of the matter, you skyp
straytwayes to an other thing, and tell vs
of the forme of the ministration. Much
lyke as if you would saye, I will tell you,
my masters, the matter and forme of a
marchepane, when it is come to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>:
the matter of it is, suger, rosewater, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondes.
&amp;c. The forme is, not that you
should fetch it out of the ouen your sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes,
but tarye vntyll one cleane fellow or
other, bring it to the table, and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diuyde vnto euery geste a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

no more the forme of a marchepane, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
it is of a rosted pece of beefe, when it is
cleanely brought vnto the table, and diui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g the gestes. But make an end of
your accusation, and declare how we doe
chainge the other substanciall parte of

               <p>This is a most euident lye.<note place="margin">Replye.</note> For all our

matter of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Note the lye of the <hi>M.</hi> defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the truthe.</note> is, breade and
wyne, and the most due and conuenyent
matter, is, vnleauened bread and wyne
mixed with water. Yea we be so earnest
in the defence of this truth, that we be
angrye very much with a certayne kynde
of heretikes, which will vse no water in
the celebrating of the misteries. I meruail
therefore much, what reason you maye
alleage, to proue this fault by vs. Yet
you saye:
<q>For to receyue the Sacrament of the bloud
is not of the substance of Christ his instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Defence</note>
for if it were, the churche could not alter
yt, as you doe comonly in the ministryng to
the people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yf this be true,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> tell vs, what name that
hath, which the geaue to the people in
steed of the blood? Doe we geaue them
the sacrament of blood, either in ale, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,
mylke, or any other liquor, besides wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?
yf we do not, how can you saye, that
we chainge the matter? <hi>no mary,</hi> (saye
<pb facs="tcp:22571:125"/>
you) <hi>you geaue them no sacrament of the
bloud at all.</hi> That which we doe, we haue
receyued from antiquitie and authoritie,
and the receyuer taketh no losse therein,
except he thinke that Christ his Sauior is
not perfectlie vnder the forme of bread.
And againe, if you consider, that the
people with vs, doe allwayes receyue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consecrated
wyne, after they haue eaten
the bodye of Christ in forme of bread,
and that the cupp which you geaue is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consecrated,
they did receyue in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of wyne as much good as you mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
vnto then, and so by indifferent rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenyng,
you can not complayne that the
Catholikes take any thing from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which geaue them as much as you
doe, that is to saye, cleane wyne and no
more. But, doe you call this an altering
of the matter of the sacrament, when we
vse none other matter at all besydes that
which Christ appointed, but only admitt
a good dispensation and order, in the vse
of it? yf there might be any faulte founde
with vs in this point, for ministring the
sacrament, at one tyme vnder the forme
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:22571:125"/>
of bread, at an other tyme vnder the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of wyne, yet it is not proued hereby,
that we chainge the matter of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For how so euer we doe it, yet we
minister in none other matter then bread
or wyne, how then do you proue that we
chainge not only the forme, but also the
matter? maye not euery reasonable man
then see, that you proue your selfe, what
you are? doe you make any regard, eyther
what you promyse, eyther what you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme?
here I challendge you, to make
good your worde, or els, if you be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
man, to reuoke your worde.<note place="margin">Answer if you can.</note> Where
is that matter of the sacrament, which the

that we vse in our ministeries, anye other
thing then breade, wyne, and water, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing more or lesse, for the matter of
the sacrament? But this can neuer be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
Yet you, as though it were proued,
so ye conclude most wyckedlye and slau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouslye,
that the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of the Lord

that we haue the aucthoritie to chaynge
<pb facs="tcp:22571:126"/>
euerye parte of it. Whiche conclusion of

diuided, yet this your conclusion will
not follow. For all that which you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande
by the termes, of (matter and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the sacrament) perteyneth only to
the manner of ministryng the bread and
the bodie, wyne and the bloud, with the
wordes of the ghospell. In which poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
if I would (for spedines sake) graunt,
that we obserued nothing of that which
you requyer, yet you should not so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and boldely reporte of vs, that we
leaue eyther no part of substance, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the sacrament, either chainge it,
at our pleasures, and take awaye Christe
his institution. For, (as I saye againe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you) we holde the wordes of Christ,
<hi>This is my bodye,</hi> as the forme, and <hi>bread,
wyne, and water,</hi> as the matter, which can
not be altered. We beleiue also, after the
wordes are spoken by a lawfull priest, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the breade, wyne, and water, that
Christ is really present, vnder eche of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:22571:126"/>
formes, to be vnto vs, a sacrifice for
synne, a foode for our hunger, a confort
in this miserie, a pledge of the euerlasting
glorie. And we beleiue his wordes to be
so true, that if none will receiue hym,
when he cometh before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, yet that their
incredulitie, or their lack of charity, doth
not make his presence nothing. How
saie you then now, for shame? do we lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
no parte that is of substance in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
because we doe not agree with
you in such kynde of substanciall partes
as you haue inuented? Do we make our
gouernors omnipotent (as you saye) in
transposing and altering the sacramentes
instituted by Christ? or maye we defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
the people of the whole sacrament?
I would you did no more harme to the
people, or take no more vpon you, then
the church hath done. They should not
be serued with signes and figures, in stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of verities, and the wordes of Christ
should stand as he ment them, saying <hi>This
ys my bodye, which is geauen for you,</hi> and
<hi>This is my bloud of the newe testament.</hi> But
for this matter we shall haue an other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

considering that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaryes
doe so egerly stryue
for the hauing of companye
to receyue with the minister, because
thei would make vpp a communion, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
directly, and truly, that although
none doth visiblie receyue at the same
aultar with the priest, yet neuer the lesse,
that there is a communion. For lyke as in
prayer, when I am alone, I praye togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all them which be of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me

tell your selfe how lyke they are? For as
prayer is made for other, so in lyke man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
is the bodye of Christ offred by him
for other. Offred (I saye) once vppon
the crosse immediatlye by hym selfe in a
bloudy and visible maner, to the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of mankynde: and yet daylye styll
offred by hym, through the ministery of
his priestes, in mysticall and vnbloudy fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion,
to the employing of that redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
But who goeth about to proue
that praying and receiuing should be both
in all pointes a lyke? <hi>Prayer</hi> (you saye)
<hi>is a common action,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Defence.</note> 
                  <hi>which done of one maye

               </p>
               <p>The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>moditie of prayer is allwayes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon:
but it the acte of praying is more
oft priuate then common. The recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of the sacrament is a personall and
singular action: but the commoditye,
when it foloweth, is communicated with
the whole bodye.</p>
               <q>One maye praye without a guyde: one can not
baptize hymselfe without a minister. A mans
prayer also maye profyt hym which prayeth
<pb facs="tcp:22571:128"/>
not, but any ones baptisme may not profyt hym
that is not baptized. <hi>And what of all this?</hi>
Christ <hi>(saye you)</hi> taught vs to praye one for

or be baptized one for an other.</q>
               <p>O Syr,<note place="margin">Replye.</note> remembre your selfe. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
against whom you write, doth
not medle with this question, of which
you speake. He saieth not, that one maye
be baptized or houseled for an other: but
he sayeth (if you will marke) that lyke as
in our praying alone,<note place="margin">a perfect co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> is in all thinges emong Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes.</note> we communicate
with all Christendome, so in receiuing
alone, we communicate with the whole
body of Christ. And to make this his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
playne vnto your runnyng wytt, he
alleageth the article of our <hi>Crede,</hi> which
is, that we beleiue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion of sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.
And to make the matter further yet
out of all doubt, he reciteth a testimonie
of S. Denyse the Areopagite, in which it
is proued vnto you, that the supper of our
Lorde is therefore called a communion,
because all the lyuelye membres of the
church are brought thereby to an vnitie
with Christ their head. And if all this be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:22571:128"/>
not sufficient, then do you further vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
that, lyke as in our naturall bodye,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> one parte reioyseth, all the rest is glad
of it, and if anye one be payned, all the
rest doth feele it: so, in the mysticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
of Christe, there is a diuine, entiere,
and charytable communion, of all the
fructfull paynes, actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s, and graces, which
any one of the singuler membres, either
receyueth, eyther practiseth. And this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is not only in respect of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
of the church in Sacramentes
and scriptures, (as you saye,) but also, as
concerning the communicating of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefytes,
vvhich are receyued by those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes,
or deserued by good deedes,
and meritoryous. Of which fellowshipp,
it commeth to passe, that the obedience
of Abraham, and pacience of Iob, vvith
all their vertues vvhich lyued in the feare
and knowledge of God before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
of Christ, and the humilitie of the
most blessed virgyn, labors of the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
constancie of martyrs, and holynes of
all good Sowles, sence the Ascention of
our Sauyor, goe forth without enuye, to
<pb facs="tcp:22571:129"/>
the bewtifying and comforting of euery
ioynt of the whole mysticall bodye. Of
which,<note place="margin">Io. 1.</note> Christ is the head, which is blessed
for euer, which is full of grace and truth;
of whose fullness euery membre receiueth
a portion,<note place="margin">Psal. 48.</note> whom the holy ghost hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
with the oyle of gladnes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioysing,
which oyle from the head drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
downe into the berde,<note place="margin">Psal. 132.</note> and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth
in communicating his graces, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll
that the very skyrte of his vestimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and the leste of all his church, recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
of his influence. And this heades ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
all the membres doe folow, eche
of them gladly communicating with his
next felow, some parte and measure of
his merites and glorye, vnto whom agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the inferiors do ascende with a swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
sauor of thanke and prayses, so that in
the whole bodye, there is no one parte
for it selfe, but as God is for all, so all they
are for God, and are, both for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning
and ending, in most perfect so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyetie.
Therefor in this bodye, how can
any parte doe anye thing for it selfe alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne?
or how can there be but a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:22571:129"/>
betwixt all the membres of so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect

about to proue, that as one maye praye
for an other, so one might receyue for an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>other.

and some to be angrie, that you reason so

that lyke as one alone maye praye for

shold haue proued, if he had fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
good order, that lyke as one may
praye for a multitude, so lykewise that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
may receyue for a greate number. For
it was not said vnto you, that receyuing

the strength of communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, which goeth

And therefor, concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
which is in this respect betwyxt
prayer and receyuing of the sacrament,
you haue to answer, why there is not a
communion to be graunted, when one
alone receiueth, as you can not denie, a
plaine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion, when one alone pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.

                  </gap> you, why one maye

                  </gap>nes
and brothers. by what reason then maye
you saie, that he which receiueth alone,
(to your sight) hath no communion with
other of the faith, hope, and charitie? It
is two thinges, to saye, I praye for other,
and I praie with other,<note place="margin">Note, to receiue for other and with other</note> or, I receiue for

<pb facs="tcp:22571:132"/>
which doe so fully occupie vs, yet a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

because he is in that bodie, whose partes

of an other tyme, and in some sense
vnpossible, but to receiue with other, is

               <p>And now, what foloweth hereof? Truly
this, first of all, that you which make your

doe verye much range out from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

againe, seeing there is such a felowshipp

               <p>You be allwaies lyke your selfe,<note place="margin">Replie.</note> in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
your selfe. For here you denye
the argument, and the cause of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall

if the faulte be only in the propositions;
why denye you the argument? And if the

do you proue that, by the denying of the

be interpreted as you would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
it, and lett vs then repete the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t,
saying, <hi>Thei which receiue in diuers places,
according to the institution of Christ do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
togeather. But Syr Thomas. &amp;c.</hi>
(as before) <hi>doe so: Ergo thei communicate

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:22571:133"/>
please you? yea truly I thinke it doth:
why then dyd you deny the former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was altogeather of the same
forme and making with this? But such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputors
they be, with whom the church
hath to doe. Now againe, if you admitt
the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cerning the forme of it,
what saie you to any of the propositions?
Mary, you deny the second proposition,
and say, that none of those two priestes,
whom I named, do worke according to
the institution of Christ. And why so?
Forsoth (saie you) because thei receiue
alone by them selfes. Yea but herein you
say falsely, because the one of them at the
least, receiueth with the other, and so thei
haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion, and obserue the institu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion
of Christ. Naie, saie you againe:
<q>There should be a particular communion
(as I maye terme it) betwene the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of one congregation.<note place="margin">Defence fol. 50.</note>
                  </q>
You do wisely to mitigat the matter, and
as it were,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> to aske leaue that you may call
it a particular communion. But you must
haue none, your request is so vnprofitable.
For this particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion is nothing
<pb facs="tcp:22571:134"/>
worth, yea it is no communion at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be referred vnto the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
communion in deede. And if the
communicating in the most perfect and
best maner,<note place="margin">The need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and vpstart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> be fulfilled, will you bring vs
so fair downevvarde, that we must haue
the particular, or els saie the whole is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?
Maye I not, because of your
fancyes, rest in the end, when I am at it,
but come back againe to the beginning,
or myddle of the matter? The ende of
a Christians desier, is, to be vnited vnto
God, through Christ our head in the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of his body, and to this end I receiue
his body in the sacrament, which, because
he is both God an man, is therfor able to
ioyne vs togeather in vnitie with God &amp;
man. And therefor when I receiue hym,
I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate both naturallie and mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie
with his bodie. Can I desyer any
more, and is any thing vnperfect herein?</p>
               <q>Yea mary (<hi>saye you</hi>) Christ would haue
vs make a particular communion also.</q>
               <p>But how proue you that by Christ? he
which was wysedome it selfe, would he
make such an accompt of a particular,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:22571:134"/>
that although the whole some and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
might be obtayned without it,
yet he would haue a particular commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
He which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municateth with the
whole bodye, communicateth also with
particulars, and therefor what talke you
of a particular communion, as though
that coulde want, when the whole is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned?
If you would denye, that there
is a perfecte commonion betwene men
of one religion, notwithstanding thei be
not in one tyme and place togeather, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you should speake vntrulie, yet
you should speake not most absurdelie:
but, when you graunt the generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and yet besydes requyre of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
a particular, you speake so farr out
of all forme and fasshion, that no reason
or probabilitie, may be perceiued in your
saying. Yes (saye you) <hi>vnitie and concord is
lyuely represented, as well for the multitude,
which doe communicate, as for the apte signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the external elementes.</hi> But what
of this? for, euerie thing of which a good
meanyng may be gathered, is not, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie,
to be obserued of vs. To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
<pb facs="tcp:22571:135"/>
with Christ our head and his
mysticall bodye, is a thing most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
if we thinke to receiue hym worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
but to haue a particular communion,
(as you terme it) although it be very lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
yet is it not necessarie, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
of Christ doth not requyre it of
vs. For if his blessed will had ben, as you
do seme to interprete it, that there should
be a visible company to receiue togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at his table, that the beholding of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the other, might lyuelie represent the
vnitie, which Christ with them and thei
haue with Christ, and that, without this
particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion, there might be no
receiuing of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, woe then vnto
poore blynde folkes, which can not see
how many receiue with them. Whom, if
the mercy of our Sauior hath not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from commyng to his table, it must
folow then necessarilye, that it was not
Christ his institution and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that without a visible cumpany of
communicantes, his sacramentes could
not be ministred. And as such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
dyd not become his wysedome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:22571:135"/>
and his bountefullnes, so would it haue
ben a greate foyle and disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fort vnto his
church, if the neighbors slacknes should
haue letted the deuotion of the well wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
persons, or if no receiuyng at all,
might be suffred without a particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
whereas any one Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
all alone, doth yet therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with Christ his whole mysticall
body. Now, because this generall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of which we speake, doth greaue you
very sore, which loue to make partes and
separations, you complayne that excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
seemeth to be taken awaie,
by this our deuise (as you call it) of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion
betweene such as are absent and
distant. But, as you are allwaies very dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
and wittye, so you geaue a reason
hereof, to excuse you from folye. And
what reason is that? Marye,
<q>After your deuise, a priest, that is excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
of the Byshopp,<note place="margin">Defence.</note> maye saye masse
in his chamber, and affirme that he wyll co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with hym, whether he will or no.</q>
Yf you thinke as you say, you be very dull
of vnderstanding,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> or short of memorie,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:136"/>
because our opinion proueth the cleane
contrarie. For whereas we tell you, that
he which receiueth alone, doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
yet, with the rest of the bodye of
which he is a parte, how farr and wyde so
euer the whole be dilated: so he which is
separated by excommunication from the
body, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municateth with no parte of it,
whether he receiue alone, or receiue with
many. But, if your sentence were true, as
concerning particular, communion, then
would it straitwaies be very hard, to haue
any excommunication. For if England
would not receiue one, he might seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the congregation of Scotland. If thei
would reiect hym, he might seeke many
corners of Germany and Hungary. If Lu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>therans
would defye hym, he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayned
of the Zuinglians. If thei both
were to honest for hym, he might recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
after the institution of Christ (as thei
would saie) with Anabaptistes, Arrians,
and such other. But with vs, how can it
come to passe by any deuise of yours, that
he, which is excommunicated by the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
and therefor quyte separated from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:22571:136"/>
the communion of all Sainctes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,
should communicate with the
Byshop, or any other, whether thei would
or no? Naye truly Syr, if Christ his insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
had specially commaunded a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
communion, as you saye it doth,
so in deede if the Bishope should excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
you, yet you might call halfe a
dozen of good fellowes vnto you, and in
chamber, orcharde, groue, denne, stable,
or vnder hedges, celebrate a memory of
Christ his passion, and challendge vnto
your selfes the folowing of his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
which institution whilest you vnderstand
so grossely as you doe, you must further
expounde vnto vs, in what quantitie of
numbre, tyme, and place, a communion
may be celebrated. And if for al your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying
of particular communion, you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
no ioye to speake of such particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
albeit you may tell vs, that you haue
weightie matters in hand, and can not
therfore dallie, yet we see playnelie, that
you haue not what to answer vs, lest you
should be dryuen vnto many absurde fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes.
And therefor to shifte your handes
<pb facs="tcp:22571:137"/>
of those questions, in which your spirites
might be tryed, you tell vs, that you see in
the Euangelist and S. Paule, that Christ
tooke bread, brake it, gaue it. &amp;c. and that
he did his thinges, in conuenient tyme
and place, and that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany, which
if we either did not know, either would
denie vnto you, then had you said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
But our principall question is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
such a company and numbre, as he
vsed, be necessarie, or no: as yourselfe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
before confessed, that the obseruation
of place and tyme, which Christ vsed, is
not necessarie. And because you styffelie
holde, that cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>pany is necessarie, we would
vnderstande your mynde further, within
how greate and how small numbre, that
necessarie company consisteth. For it is
written in the Englysh seruice, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
three, no communion maye be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated,
except vpon the speciall request
of the syck person, and in tyme of plagues,
when one maye receiue with the priest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
But yet, (I trow) the institution of
Christ, doth permit well inough two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
to receiue togeather at all tymes.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:22571:137"/>
Now if you be to seeking, for your answe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res
in such questions, which would declare
vnto us the full meaning of your opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s,
how dare you sett vpp a religion,<note place="margin">Blynde guides.</note> which

are so subtile and curyous, that a good

of our reasoning,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> and appoint vs to
proue that, which we take not vpon vs.
This is it, which I haue wysshed before to
be well remembred, that our question is
not, whether any priest then did receiue
alone, but whether he might doe it lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie,
or no, that is our question. And as
the Catholike in his Apologie fol. 8. war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you most playnelie, that there is an
open difference betweene these two sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences:
<hi>There was no priuate masse at that

                  <hi>There ought to be no priuate

agayne, that we labor to proue, not
what thing was then commonlie doone,
but what maye now, and might then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue

we take not vpon vs to proue, but what
he might do, that we can shew vnto you.
Do not you allwaies appeale vnto Christ
<pb facs="tcp:22571:141"/>
his institution? Doe not you make your
selfes so cunnyng in it, that you can tell vs
of the indifferent partes, and of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanciall
partes of it? Haue not you defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, that, to receiue with cumpany is a
substanciall parte of it? And do not you
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clude herevpon, that the priest can not
receiue by hymselfe alone, without breach
of Christ his institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>? These being your
principles, if we do disproue any of them,
then is your conclusion destroyed. But
how can we more playnelie do it, then by
reciting the examples of the primitiue
church, by which you are contented to
be tryed, in which age sole receiuing was
vsed, and yet Christ his institution not
thought to be violated? Can you denye
that sole receiuing was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vsed? you can
not. But you make this limitation, that it
was vsed in case of necessitie, and of laye
men, not of priestes. Well, make the case
how harde so euer you will, we aske no
more, but that all men should know, that
sole receiuing was lawfullie then vsed.
<hi>Now therfor</hi> (saie you) <hi>let vs see, how aptly
vpon this graunt you conclude your purpose?</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:22571:141"/>
More aptly (I trust) then you haue doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
it for vs, which behaue your selfe so vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,
that all is the worse for your han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deling.
We therefore doe not straitwaies
looke for a priest at an aultar, but first, we
take your confessyon that sole receiuing
is lawfull, as being vsed in the primitiue
church: and then we inferr that Christ his
institution doth not requyre of necessitie
a numbre to receiue allwaies togeather:
Ergo then Christ his institution is not
broken, when a priest alone by hymself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
receiueth: Ergo you should amend your
needeles appealing vnto that institution
which you doe not vnderstand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that there is no impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t wherfor
a priest maye not saie masse, and receiue
alone. For if it had ben a substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ciall point
of Christ his institution, to haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>muni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cantes,
no necessitie might haue made for
sole receiuing, but in the primitiue church
ther was sole receiuing: Ergo that, which
you terme particular communion, is not
of the necessitie of Christ his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.
For as concerning the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of those tymes, which caused that
<pb facs="tcp:22571:142"/>
the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s could not come togeather,
thei serued well, to delyuer mens co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
from the scruples, which thei might
haue had, for not receiuing, but thei doe
not lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce them, to receiue against Christ
his institution. As for example, at an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
tyme, when all Christians do receiue
of dutie, if through persecution, certaine
of them were dryuen vnto such extremy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
that thei could haue neither wheaten
breade, nor wyne, nor priest to minister
the communion vnto them, this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
doth not make it laufull, that thei ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
in oten cakes and whey, or that
with their laycall handes thei take, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
and receiue, in the remembrance that
Christ dyed for them, and be thankefull:
but only it maketh for their quyetnes of
mynde and conscience, that thei thinke
not them selfes to haue transgressed the
law of the church, because of the present
necessitie, which hath none other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
but pacience. And so lykewise, if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Bishopes which gouerned the church in
those persecutions, had thought it to be

                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>f the substance of Christ his institution,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:22571:142"/>
that without your particular co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>munion
the sacrament might not haue ben recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
thei would not haue sent it home to
Christians howses, there to be receiued
of them priuately, but thei would rather
haue exhorted them, not to be discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
for all the lack of the visible sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t,
and willed them to praye for a quyet
and good tyme, in which thei might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
after Christ his institution. But
for all the trobles of persecution, thei did
not so, Ergo it is plaine to perceiue, that
thei thought not as you do of Christ his
institution. And this being once confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that the institution of Christ doth
not requyre of necessitie, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municantes,
we doe rightly inferr, that a priest maye
receiue alone, without any iniuire done
to the institution of our Sauyor. But,
(good Lord) how miserablie are you tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
within your selfes, as it maye see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me?
You graunt sole receiuing in some

deliuered hymselfe vnder those two kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,

               <q>Therfore the fayth of the communicantes

And then further, where you say that the

(shame to thinke it) or else as the bodye
of the soune of God? Christ our Sauior

that in the name of bread is vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
also wyne, and why so? Mary because
that some tymes emong the Doctors (of
which hereafter we shall speake more)
both kyndes are vnderstanded, when but
one is expressed: ergo Tertullian in this
place is in lyke maner to be construed.
But our collection is otherwise, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we reade but one kynde specifyed,
therefore without any necessitie we doe
not make coniectures that he meaneth
both. And we see, that Tertullian in this
booke, was not in such hast that he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to speake by figures vnto his wyfe, or
to number syx for the dozen. Then by
common reason, we see that wyne, in so
lyttle a quantitie as ones parte commeth
vnto in the distributing of the mysteries,
was not to be reserued of any person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the quyck alteration of it. Allso
we beleiue, that vnder one kynde Christ
wholye is geauen, and therefor that the
gouernors of the church were not so fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysh
or scrupulous, as to make a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of both. And whereas you perceyue
<pb facs="tcp:22571:156"/>
by this testimonye, that sole receyuing
was then vsed, (which by your sayeing
Christ his institution doth not permit)
we had no iust occasion to mystrust the
receyuing vnder one kynde, which we
know to be of no greater force then the
receyuing with company. And you also
(if you had good wyttes) might for good
cause feare, least you were deceyued in
the question of receiuing vnder both kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
whereas in the controuersie of sole
receyuing, you be so openly confounded,
which yet you doe as earnestile endeuor
to proue, as you doe shifte to vnderstand
both kyndes in Tertullian, whereas he
mencioneth but one.<note place="margin">Note the chaingea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes of heretikes.</note> Note further, that
when Christ said, This is my bodye, you
will haue no bloud to appertaine vnto it,
and when any Doctor doth speake onlie
of bread, you will at your pleasure make
wyne to be vnderstanded. Iniurious in
the one, and superfluous in the other.</p>

For we bring you furth good examples,

a nouice in our fayth,</hi> wherein you saye ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie

if he, which was not yet fully instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted

you alleage that <hi>it doth not appeare whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

were ministers or other.</hi> Why Syr,
to what purpose would it serue, if you

Doe you thinke, that vpon the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne,

thei prepared them selues to a comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and had not the Sacrament prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to tye the Sacrament about his neck

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:22571:159"/>
of doubt, thei were no ministers. For the
historie saieth, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> holy Satyrus had
escaped drouning him selfe, and him selfe
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ming first to lande had either holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to
saue other, or sawe them all to be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then he straytwaies asked where the
church was, there to geaue thankes, and
receiue also <hi>those euerlasting misteries, aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
mysteria.</hi> Also, prouing so great defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
to haue come vnto him, by hauing the
heauenly misterie folded vpp in a cloth,
how much (thought he) shall I wyn, if I
doe receyue him in my mouth and with
all the botome of my hart? But although
he were desirous, yet he was not folish ven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terous.
Therfor he calling the Bishop vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, asked whether he did agree with
the Catholike Bishopps, that is to saye,
with the church of Rome, for the church
of that countrey, as concerning that pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
was in a schisme. Which being well
considered of hym, and that allthough
they of those quarters had beleife in
God, yet they were not faythfull vnto
the churche, he departed from thens,
differring the payment of his thankes,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:160"/>
                  <hi>&amp;</hi> the debt which he was in for receiuing
the Sacrament, and went forth vntyll he
came to such place where he might be
safely discharged. Now therefore, if thei
had ben ministers, which deliuerd the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
vnto S. Satyrus in the shipp, he
might haue receiued it at their handes
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> he was now come to lande, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue sought further for the matter,
but whiles he was so desyrous to receyue
his Lorde and defendor (<hi>Praesulem suum</hi>

bolde as to receyue him in that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trey,

that we shold not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municate with schys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

that Christ deliuered the Sacrament of

Doth the history geaue you any occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

his bloud about them, it doth not folow
that in Sainct Ambrose his tyme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the
church was more enlarged and better set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teled,
the lyke manner was allwaies vsed.
You tell vs, that <hi>in taking of a long iorney
<pb facs="tcp:22571:161"/>
some caryed the sacrament of the blould with
them, and because they could not conuenietly
carye wyne with them, they soked the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lorde his bodye in the bloode.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As whoe should saye, that thei might not

wyne, vsed only water. Some other vsed
mylke for wyne.</hi> But what of this? Can
you inferr, vpon these perticular cases,
that it is lykely that they which delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Sacrament vnto Satyrus, (as S.
Ambrose writeth) had the Sacrament of
bloud also about them as you doe sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
As well it will folow then, that thei
had the Sacrament of Christ his bloud,
eyther in forme of water only or of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
because that you haue readen that in

if <hi>orarium</hi> shall not be englysshed a <hi>stole,</hi>
yet that you maye not thinke, that it was
a bottle to carye wyne in, I haue shewed
you two places out of Saint Ambrose, in
which it is taken for a lynnen cloth. And
now, if holy Satyrus dyd put that sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
which he receiued, in a lynnen cloth,
and wrapped it about his neck, it is very
probable vnto vs, that it was in forme of
bread onlye, except you will yet styll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynew
in your imagination, and make a
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:22571:162"/>
gesse, that it was either a mylkesopp or a
wynesopp, or a lynne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> cloth moysted with
wyne, which he folded vpp in a kerchey,
napkyn, or stole. And then lett any indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
man be iudge, which of vs two
speaketh most reasonably, you which thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
that he had the sacrament of bloud to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
with the sacrament of Christ his
bodye, or we, which can not deuyse how
wyne should be there inclosed, where we
reade no mencion of other thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a lynen cloth. Now, as concernyng
that, where you saye, that lerned and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
men did wynke and beare with many
thinges in the begynnyng, (as though the
reseruation of the blessed Sacrament, or
vsing of it in suchesorte as that holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus
dyd, were to be numbred in that
kynde of thinges) you make S. Ambrose
therein to lack a greate part of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of mynde and wysedome. For he,
such a Bishop, would neuer haue suffred
any substanciall parte of our fayth to be
defaced within his knowledge, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciallye
with his brother he might and
would haue ben so bolde, as to reforme
<pb facs="tcp:22571:163"/>
his simplicitie and superstitious zeale of
mynde towardes the sacrament. And if
you will ymagine, that he was loth to tell
his owne brother the perfect truth of thin
ges in his lyfe tyme, yet at least, after his
death he should neuer haue praysed hym,
(as he doeth in a most exquysite maner)
for that, which (according to your saying)
was to be tolerated onlye in the quyck,
and not praysed and commended in the
dead. Saint Ambrose therfore, in a most
sadd maner and tyme, praysing his good
brother, which then was departed this
world, for many and sundrye vertues, of
iustice, clemencie, temperancie, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie,
and especiallie commending hym,
for his fayth and pietie, which shewed it
selfe in the shipwrack of which we haue
spoken, how can it be thought, that so
wise and constant a Bishop would allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
that historie to proue the pietie of his
brother, which rather (after your inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation)
was to be wynked at and kept
vnder silence, least he should seeme to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
&amp; vtter his superstitious behauiour
and folie? You myngle also mylke, wyne,

as though there were no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce,
whether one did celebrate in milke
alone, or wyne alone, or as though that,
if the soking of the sacrament of Christ
his bodye in his bloud was by Iulis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
reproued, therefore also receyuing
vnder one kynde, or sole receiuing should
be in lyke case myslyked. And yet, against
water alone, or mylke in steede of wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,
you haue the expresse institution of
Christ, and the expresse canons of Bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops

no such proufe against vs, that the sole
receiuing or receiuing vnder one kynde
is in no case lawful. One thing I must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
vnto you, that in deed you haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

you conclude thereby that it was also the

I haue not to contende with hym vpon

his subtyle collection, but to graunt hym
that I see so much in the Sonne and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,

that the residue of the sacrament not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,

of S. Clement, (whom you contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie

that the ministers must with feare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
eate vpp the remaynent of the

that reseruation was not generally

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:22571:176"/>
And lyke as we should proue our

and trulie, that thei are madd men,
which make no price of the sacrament, if
it be once reserued. In the later end of
the chapiter, you presse vs with S. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
his authoritie, as though we had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
graunted vnto you, that all is to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
now of necessitie, which was once
obserued in the primitiue church, or as
though our answer had not euer ben, that
receiuing alone or with cumpany is in it

you were well apaied, that you had shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

You protested to admit the Doctors, in
such degree as S. Augustyne teaceth you,
which is to saie, if they bring either scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

you to the reason, which S. Cyril maketh,
that the sacrament, if it be reserued, is
for all that of one state and strength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the vertue and power of consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>
                  <hi>This canon</hi> (saye you) <hi>doth not proue sole

<hi>all sole receyuing is by this testimonye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</hi>
I deny your argument, for as we

some tymes and places, so we beleiue and
haue proued it before, that sole receiuing
hath sometymes ben allowed. Wher now

conclude that sole receyuing is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

you in this place of sole receyuing? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
rather vnto our argument, which
proueth reseruacion. The Deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s could
not consecrate, the Bishops and Priestes
being absent, in this case then (sayeth the
holy Councell) lett the Deacons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
bring furth the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, and eate
it. But how should they eate it, except
they had it? and how should they haue it,
except it were first consecrated? or how
could it be presentlye consecrated, when

               <p>Must it not folow necessarily, that it was
reserued, in that they are licensed to take
it furth them selues, and eate it? Yf you
can denye, reseruation to be proued by
this place, we must wonder at your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancie:
and if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fesse it playnlie, wher
is your proper answer vnto it? Oh (saye
you) in these Deacons, which receyued
in absence of the Bishop and Priestes,
<q>There appeareth an extraordinary case.<note place="margin">Defence fol. 77.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:22571:183"/>
Such is your ordinary answer, but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
is the case extraordinary?<note place="margin">Reply.</note> In that the
Deacons receyue it in absence of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and Priestes, or in that it was reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued?
It was ordinarye, that the Priestes
should geaue the sacrament to the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
but what if no Priest had ben pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent?
then, sayeth the Councell, the Dea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cons
may bring it furth, and serue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
And in this respect, you saye truly,
that here is an extraordinary case. But as
concernyng the reseruation of the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
how can you deuise that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarye?
Doe you thinke when the
Bisshops or Priestes were sure to tarye at
home vntyll the morow, that they then
did not make any store of the sacrament,<note place="margin">The .xiiij. Canon of the Nicene Councell confirmed to make for reseruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>.</note>
but presently bestow it emong the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municantes,
and when they could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the mysteries the next day folowing,
thinke you, that they consecrated more
hostes then needed for that tyme pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and sayd vnto the Deacons: Syrs,
here is the sacrament for you in store vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyll
to morow? But what necessitie was
there for the Deacons to receyue on the
<pb facs="tcp:22571:184"/>
morow, that the breache of Christ his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
might be somewhat thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused?
Truly the Deacons should tarye,
not only one daye, but one whole yeare,
rather then reseruation should be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if so greate fault (as you saye) be in
it. Now, if the sacrament were not reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vpon such a speciall case, how can
you saye, that the reseruation was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarye?
And if the reseruation were
ordinary, (as vndoubtedlye it was,) make
the case then of the Deacons receyuing
as extraordinary as you will, and it letteth
our purpose nothing. For we consider,
not the acte of the Deacons in any other
sense or meanyng, then as it proueth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.
And here you shall note fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the sacrament was reserued not
onlye for such which laye in their death
beddes, and were not reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cyled vnto the
churche,<note place="margin">Fol. 73.</note> (as you said in the chapiter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
but also that it serued the vncorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
and faythfull Christians, whiles thei
were yet in good health, except you can
thinke that the Deacons, whom the Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene
Councell permitteth to take furth
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:22571:184"/>
the sacrament, and eate it, were either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>municated
persons, either such as could
not go abrode for weakenes. Now, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the receiuing vnder one kynd, as
it might be shewed out of this place, if

(as though any of vs did make a tryfle of
Christ his institution, and not rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue

her selfe hyther and thyther for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyshe

But who suspected anye harme thereof?
or who did collect thereby, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

appeared first when the bloud of

had ben bewrayed, before she had com to

allthough the child were vexed before

of the bodye would no more haue

As concerning the formost of these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
it is very credible. for that it seemeth
by S. Cyprian, that it was a sucking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de

is very vnlyke, for as the resistence

but that he powred the bloud into
her mouth, so although she would not
haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the sacrament of the body, yet
she might as well haue ben enforced the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revnto,
as to receyue of the chalice. And
allso, if that opinyon which you holde
now, had then ben in the church, that it
is against Christ his institution, to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
vnder one kynde, they would neuer
haue profered the chalice vnto any such
as would not haue receyued first and for
<pb facs="tcp:22571:187"/>
most the bodye, as you are wont to recite
a fragment out of Gelasius, which you
vnderstand not, that the diuision of one
and the selfe same misterie, can not be
done without great sacrilege. But lett
both your reasons stande, is it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
then sufficiently, that to receyue in
both kindes is not of the necessitie of
Christ his institution? And where then
is your witt, to graunt us that, by which
our purpose is brought to passe? For all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
you think, that you shall take no

kynde might be vsed, and that necessitie
which hath no law, maye cause a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
of God to be omitted, and
allthough you maye be so easily entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to permit receiuyng in one kynde,
that because the childe, of whom we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
spoken, would not or could not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of Christ his bodye, you
think it to be a case of necessity, in which
the institution and law of Christ should
or might be omitted: yet if you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sider,
that your selfe do take the receiuing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
both kyndes to be of the substance
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:22571:187"/>
of Christ his institution, and not of the
circumstance, and to be, not an orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t
only but an expresse commaundement,
certainly when you graunt vs, that in any
kinde of case, it maye be allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the Sacrament vnder one forme,
either of bread or wyne, you be straitwai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es

such principal matters are moued, that if

For we haue to reason about the conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce
of the church, the authority of the

in the sacrament, which are so necessarye

your great crakes, so we may wonder not
a lytle, why you make exception against
these last nyne hundred yeares, by the

Is this (thinke you) a small and weeke ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
to confirme and staye our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences

onlye, of a religion .900. yeares<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
without interruption, is a very probable
argument not lightlie to passe away from
it. But when it is considered, how many
learned and godlie men, how great Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities,
how mighty Princes lyued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:22571:189"/>

did anye thing write or preache a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, and none of the Princes either
would either could resist it, who but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,

<pb facs="tcp:22571:190"/>
abandoned the sea of Rome, and adioyned
themselues to the Ghospell of Christ, are not

how great an argument would you thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke

how madd would he haue said
all such to be as resist a religion confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by such authoritie and contynuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce?
But this is your practise, to denye all

And so, in the Apologye of your Englysh

                  </gap>ound, and
comfortable, that because many Kynges
had abandoned the sea of Rome, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they might seeme not to be madd,
which did folow them: and now in this
your defence of the truth, (as you call it)
when we alleage contynuance, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie

that multitude maketh not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and you thinke your selfe not a lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le

But how wise you proue your selfe the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein,
it is worthwhile to consider. First,
you say, that the prescription of .xv. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

of Christendome, the holynes and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of so many fathers as haue ben these

               <p>Stode you by the Apostles at their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
when they wrote their ghospells
or epistles? or were you then present with
Christ, when he walked visibly vpon the

hym selfe to be the soune of God? Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
because your eye was not present at

you must therefor resort vnto such

to be our masters: therefore no reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and wyse man will suspect the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
of the world, and falsely persuade
hym selfe, that he beleiueth Christ or his

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:22571:191"/>
voyce of Christendome, which caused him
to beleiue in Christ, and credit his Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.
For how know you what doctryne
Christ or his Apostles haue taught in the
world? Yf you know it by the scriptures,
what perswadeth you these scriptures to
be true? <hi>For when any new scripture and
vnherd of vs before, is alleaged or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mended
vnto vs by a few, without any reason which

                  <note place="margin">Aug. de vtilitate credendi cap. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>we beleiue not first the

that these be true scriptures? If you na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
Luther, and such as he was, you haue
done very rashly to beleiue incredible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
at the report of an vpstart renne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,
which confirmed his authoritie by
no myracle. But on the other syde, if Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

receiue the scriptures of the Catholikes,
lest you should be accompted ouer fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke
or scrupulous, in doubting whether

by what reason then can you suspect
the contynuance, pietye, learnyng, and
multitude of Catholikes in the church of
<pb facs="tcp:22571:192"/>
God, and referr your selfe vnto Christ,

but the name of one for your side against

of predecessors you haue had in your
religion, and what maner of credit you
geaue to holy &amp; blessed men, or els what
a greate and open lye you haue made in
this matter. For to make this more plaine
in one short example: In S. Bernardes ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
we reade of certaine, which named the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
selues <hi>Apostolicos,</hi> as if you should saie, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of the Apostles, and some of their

               <p>

How say you then by these felowes? shall
they be in the numbre of them, whom
God styrred vpp againste our doctrines
for that age, in which S. Bernard was?
Yf you saye, they were of God, then doe

there were such, as you report some to

that by such meanes our doctrine hath
ben maintayned, against the wil of God,
and labors of his seruantes. As for the
donation of Constantyne, (although it
appertayne to no article of our fayth,
who so euer gaue it, so that the church
lawfully haue it,) yet we haue to saye
further therein against you, when you

by the possession of Rome with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
Seignioryes belonging vnto it, or
what Constantyn the Emperor did with
the olde and auncient Rome, when he
buylded his palace at Byzant, and called
it Constantinople and new Rome? Then
for your recityng of places out of the
Decrees, such as are not found in the
Doctors vpon whom they are fathered,
except any place in all the Decrees, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
an vntrue and vngodly doctrine, it
is no matter of my faith, (I assure you,)
if the author be mistaken, and if the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
or the printer doe fayll in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
or attention. And last of all, where you
saye, that <hi>the east church hath not allowed
our errors,</hi> I will make no other replie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that your saying at this tyme, but
desyer you to consider quyetly, how well
they are rewarded for their labor. For
whilest thei, contentiously and wyckedly
endeuored to make them selues and their
Archebishopp as high as the Bishop and

<pb facs="tcp:22571:195"/>
and affecting the first place, whilest they
florished in the seconde, they are long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe

all. And if you thinke it more sure, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leiue
the Greeke then the Latyne church,
tell vs, I praye you, what you beleiue of
the holye ghost? And so, whereas the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Constantyne, and quotations
of the decrees do make nothing for you,
so should the example of Grece geaue an
occasion to amende you. When you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that the whole West church within

libertie, of body, by reason of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes,

See,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> loe, how you be deceyued? For I
would saye, first, not that a multitude of
Turkes are better then a few Christians,
or that a long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tynued Idolatrie, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then a new religion,<note place="margin">In what sense, the multitude of folowers and the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinuance of a religion, are to be considered.</note> but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ferring
Turke with Turke, Iew with Iew, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
with Christian, and so furth, I saye,
if the Mahometes law were good, and
that schismes and diuisions should aryse
emong the professors of it, that then, the
surest waye should be, so to vnderstand
and receiue that law, as it hath ben taken
of longest tyme before, and of the most
parte of all Turkes. And in lyke maner,
when so euer emong vs which professe
one Christ, diuisions and taking of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
doe trouble mens consciences, the
best waye is, by all good reason, to folow
that syde which hath longest continued,
and which hath most voyces for it. And
so, it a Turke or panyme, would alleage
continuance of tyme to proue thereby
his religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> to be good, the next and wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
waye to aunswer hym, is not to call
him vnreasonable and folysh for the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of that argument, (for vndoubtedly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:22571:196"/>
vnto our naturall and common reason it
is no tryfeling persuasion to see conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and multitude of folowers to be
with vs,) but the right waye of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>uerting
or confounding them in that argument,
is, either to shew that naturall reason is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
against them, (as it was in their worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of stockes and stones,) either by
myracle to persuade them, (as the Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
in their dayes haue done, or as good
and religious persons doe in this our ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
emong the Indians,) or else to shew,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
that it is no wonder, if the religion of
which thei be, hath allreadie long conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and shall from hense forward en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace
daylie, because it geaueth libertie
vnto the flesh, and vnto all bodely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
But the continuance and multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
of folowers which commend the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the church are so notable and
myraculouse, that except the finger of
God were here, it is vnpossible it should
be regarded. For prescript fastinges, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges,
prayers, preferring of virginitie
before wedlock, submitting of our owne
willes vnto the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t of others,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:197"/>
confessing of our secrete faultes, quiet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring
of harde penance, these are verye
much against the nature and appetyte of
our flesh: on the other syde, that which
the church teacheth,<note place="margin">the miracle of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynuing of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like fayth.</note> of sainctes, of sowles
departed, of seuen sacramentes, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallye
of that one, in whiche allmightie
God is receyued, all this is so farr beyon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
the capacitie of carnall reason, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
fayth be infunded, it is neuer rightly
beleiued. Yet this religion so repugnant
vnto naturall appetyte, so much surmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all reason, hath ben embraced of the
poore and ryche, the symple and the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the stout and the tender, the beggers
and the Cesars, and in spite of the dyuell,
the world, the flesh, and heretikes, hath
contynued these .xv. hundred yeares, as
we beleiue, and as you be sorye for it, these
nyne hundred yeares togeather. It is no
wonder, if a Turkyshe religion be much
made of and cherisshed, for they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to haue here carnall pleasures, &amp;
for the worlde to come, they are promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to haue their full of them. Againe, I
doe not maruayll, if many follow Luther
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:22571:197"/>
the Father, or anye of his euyll fauored
broode and children, for the flesshe doth
well allow it, to eate what it will at all ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
to be free from earely rysing, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
short seruice in the churche, to haue
matrymonye no sacrament, to be bounde
to no ceremonye, and to be subiect vnto
none other authoritie, then the expresse
scripture. But, that the Catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which is so exacte, so deuout, and
so graue, that it maketh the carnall men
to wyssh that it were out of the worlde,
should haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tynuall folowers of it, and
before so long tyme preserued, it is not
for flessh and bloud to bring it to passe,
but it is the verye worke of God, whom
nothing can resyst and withstande. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
also their lyues and maners, which
haue ben emong other, the maynteyners
of it. And because none are more odious
vnto the world, then prelates, monkes,
and fryars, I wysh that some of them were
rightly considered. For if you can beleiue
historyes and monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes, what fault do
you fynde in S. Francys, and S. Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke,
if you will reade their bookes, what
<pb facs="tcp:22571:198"/>
can you saye against S. Bernard, S. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauenture,
S. Thomas of Aquyne, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertus,
Anselmus, Dionysius the Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian,
with a numbre of such holy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerende
fathers? whose writinges suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
declare, how much they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Christ, how diligently they did rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
the scriptures, how freely they repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
faultes, and lamented the euill lyfe
of Christians, how much they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted
with the sweete spirite of God,
and practysed in fightyng for the sowle
against the dyuell. The doctrine therfor
of our church, hath not only contynued
meruaylouslye, but contynued in many,
and in those many no few haue ben ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
and in such sort excellent, that,
if not before, it might our religion haue
ben now alowed, because such godly and
graue heades did vse it. Whereas on your
syde, if your inuentions were tollerable,
yet those Apostles of yours, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> in these
latter dayes (you say) God hath styrred
to reproue our vice and irreligion, and to
reuyue his truth and testament, haue ben
so vyle themselues, that vndoubtedly God
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:22571:198"/>
dyd neuer sende them, and a reasonable
man should neuer folow them. What an
Apostle was Luther? who gaue hym lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
to break his vow, which those holye
men, whom euen now I named, did kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
vnto death? who moued hym to lye
with a noune? If he lyued chaste, being
yet within his ordre, what spirite (trow
you) was that, which could not afterwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
keepe hym chaste, when he was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to preache a Ghospell? Then,<note place="margin">Luther.</note> if
he lyued abominably when he was kept
in Cloyster, was he a meete instrument
for God, to worke the redemption of his
church so long deceaued? And if God
had forgeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> his former great offences,
that he should be more humble in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
of grace and mercie, would he so
sone haue forsake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> hym, that in the heate
of his preachementes, he could not but
take a noune to his bedfellow? And as
he was in his doinges, so is he in his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinges,
so shameles, so fylthy, so vncleane,
so slaunderous, so mutable, so presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and so desperate, that it is wonder
that he is accompted for a man, &amp; much
<pb facs="tcp:22571:199"/>
lesse, for a man of God. I speake these
thinges, to declare, what difference ther
is betweene our holy Abbates, and your
rennegate fryars, the folowers of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and the founders of yours, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
you hereby, to shew what you thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
of S. Bernard, S. Bonauenture, S. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyse,
and others, and to signifye hereby
vnto you, that as we staye vpon conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
and numbre, so yet we reioyce at
the vertues and graces, which haue and
do appeare playnly in many of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre.
wherefore, it is not without cause,
that we are confirmed in our fayth and
doctryne, because of such a contynuance
of it. Note, that I saye, such a contynuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be.
For Turkes, Sarracenes, and Panymes
may alleage contynuance, but such a con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynuance,
in which the doctrine taught,
is greauous vnto the carnall man, and yet
receyued, and the greatest professors of
it, are hated of all heretikes, and yet for
conscience and wordlye shame are not
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>demned: such a one (I say) is much to
be regarded, and such a one is not found,
but onlye emong the Catholikes. whose
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:22571:199"/>
waies in doctrine, if they be not open &amp;
secure, especially so great cumpany for so
long tyme going in them with prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
faring to their iourneyes end, then
will I neuer trust any waye, but be, as the
cumpany is, indifferent to go with euery
one, vntyll I am wery. But thankes be to
God, he hath better prouyded for vs, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
his catholike churche to be the
pyller and staye of true religion.<note place="margin">1. Timo. 3.</note> Which,
although it is quyckly to be founde out,
because it is in deede Catholike, yet you
thinke it necessarye to examyne what is
the church, and how it maye be knowen.
Goe to then, we will follow you to the
end of your defence, in euery conclusion
which you make against vs.
<q>
                     <p>The Scripture (<hi>saye you</hi>) speaketh of the

You performe more then you promysed.<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
We looked but for two wayes, and you
haue declared three, in which the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
speaketh of the church, by which it
appeareth, that you haue pretye know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but you keepe lytle good ordre in
setting furth your diuisions. Yet goe to,
as concerning the first sense, which you
make of the church, what make you of
her? Can it err, or no? <hi>No</hi> (say you) <hi>this
church is the pyller of truth, that neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
in error. This church is neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
of the spirite of God. In to this church
none be receyued but onlye the children of
grace and adoption.</hi> How might a man
then (I praye you) know this church?
Verely neither you, neither any other can
tell.<note place="margin">Of the churche as it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>sis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eth of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen whom God only knoweth, litle profit is to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</note> For whereas it consisteth of such, as
be the elect and chosen, who can saye ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of hymselfe, that he is one of them,
or how can one say that of an other, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
hart he seeth not, which he can not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
of his owne case, which is best
knowen vnto hymselfe? Therfore as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the profyt and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>moditye which

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:22571:200"/>
which is the pyller of truth, we can
receyue very lytle of it, because she is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible
vnto man, and knowen onlye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God. And if you dare saye, that this
churche may also be knowen vnto man,
I would you had showen one token or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of her, that we might be sure where
to fynde the pyller of truthe.</p>
               <p>Now as concerning the church, which
is dispersed through the worlde, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
one Christ, and is <hi>Through
baptisme admitted thervnto, and by the vse
of the Lordes supper, openlye professeth the
vnitie therof in doctryne and charitie:</hi> Is
this church (trow you) the pyller of tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the,
or what other opinion shall we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
of her?
<q>This church, (saye you) is resembled vnto
a nett,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 91.</note> which hath good and bad in it, it is
resembled vnto a field which hath pure cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
and cockle also in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>You saye herein trulye, and you agree
now very wel with the catholike church,<note place="margin">Reply.</note>
which teacheth vs, that in this world,
the good and euyll Christians are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
togeather. You make also much, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb facs="tcp:22571:201"/>
certayne heretikes, which stand in
it stoutly, that onely the elect are of the
howsehold and familye of God, which
yet (as you haue clerkely defined it,) can
not be so, because the good and the badd
which acknowledge one Christ, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes, are the true church
of Christ. Graunting therefor vnto you,
that the church hath good men and euill
in her, I aske now the cause of you, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you labor to proue that this church
maye goe out of the waye for some part
of her? you tell vs of Noe, of the .x. try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes
of Israell, of the Prophetes, of the
captiuitie of Babilon, and other such hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storyes.
But to what end and purpose?
yf you wil proue thereby, that thei which
beare the name of the people of God
haue often tymes forsaken his law, and
destroyed his Prophetes, you haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that, for proufe wherof I wold ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
haue gone to the flood of Noe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
so many examples at home, to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
this conclusion manifest. For all they
which be Christened, doe beare the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of the people of God, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:22571:201"/>
are made only vnto them, yet this
world maye declare how many coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rars,
dissemblers, wycked lyuers, faithlesse
ministers, lecherous friars and desperate
peruerters of all law and honestie, doe
lyue in the churche. But if you would
proue, that, because a great numbre was
deceyued, therefore the whole churche
was subuerted, you speake alltogeather
without booke. For, (to consider one
example for all,) in the tyme of Elias the
Prophet, when he, good man, thought,
that all had forsaken God besydes hym
selfe, yet said God vnto hym, I haue lefte
my selfe seuen thousand in Israell,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 19.</note> which
haue not bowed their knees before Baal.
And before that, it is playne by the booke
of kynges, that Abdyas the stewarde of
kyng Achab his house,<note place="margin">3. Reg. 18.</note> dyd hyde a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Prophetes of God from the sight
of Iezabell the quene, and fedd the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with
bread and water. Therefore, as it can not
be denyed, but that they which haue bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
the name of the people of God, haue
not allwayes and wholy folowed hym, so
yet it can neuer be proued, that the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb facs="tcp:22571:202"/>
church of God hath ben in all her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
subuerted. And yet in the old law, the
church was not then so richely endowed
as it was afterward in the commyng of
Christ and his holie ghost, neither were
those wordes spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> then, which haue ben
spoken sence and now presently doe take
place, our Sauior faythfully promysing
vnto Sainct Peter,<note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> that <hi>Thow art Peter</hi>
(which is to saye) <hi>a rock, and vpon this
rock I will buyld my church, and the gates
of hell shall not preuayll against it.</hi> So that
if nothing might be said to the contrary,
but that in the olde law the church of
God was not to be founde, (which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be proued,<note place="margin">Psal. 2.</note>) yet in this tyme
of grace, when all nations of the world
are in the heritage of Christ, as only the

so harde and pynching rekoning, that

of the church of Christ. But because
we maye have a better tyme and leysure,
to speake against you in this matter, if
this visible church, which hath conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
so long in one maner of doctrine
and sacramentes, be not the true church
of God, because the visible church of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Iewes had not allwayes the truthe of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctryne,
And if it must follow, because the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
kynges of Iuda were some tymes Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
that the clergie of those tymes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
vnto them,<note place="margin">Vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequencies</note> and if some did so in
deede, that all therefore without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did it, or if, because the Prophetes
<pb facs="tcp:22571:203"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> reproued the maners of the high Priestes,
therefore they condemned theyr doctry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and religyon, or if Christ, because he
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>demned of the high Priestes, sayed
not vnto the people concerning the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of Moyses law: <hi>Doe that which they

                  <hi>but doe not after theyr doin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</hi>
And, (to be short) if all these unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>cies (which would plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se
you very well) should be graunted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, tell vs then, for conscience sake,
what church we shall follow? If the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
of Rome, which hath ben and is so
well receyued, hath ben and may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trulye
perswaded, maye not that church,
which you perchanse, shall point out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

good lykelyhood very fowlie deceyued?
And maye not one thirde person, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vnto vs an other church, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with none of our two, and yet is
nothing the better? In this doubt, which
doth so necessarilye aryse, what is your
ghostly counsell vnto such as are feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of conscience?
<q>The right church therfore,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 98.</note> as the fold of

After this maner, you shall haue some ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
the symple idiotes of the countrey

which they would come vnto. For, (saye
they) you must goe by my grandsyres
close, and then keepe the straytwaye, and
you shall neuer mysse. Or else, lyke as a

deede, so yet euery mysbegotten congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>,
will chalendge them vnto herselfe.
Except you thinke, that Luther and Zuin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>glius,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:204"/>
with all their forked tayles of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies,
doe not eche of them stande in yt,
that they haue the true worde of God,
and right vse of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes on eche
of their sydes, which yet are contrary the
one to the other. I had thought, you
would haue tolde of one such marke and
signe to come by the knowledge of the
true church, that in all the controuersies
of opinions, and all the euill conditions
of lyuing, we might haue ben directed
vnto one certayne and approued staye
of our consciences, and you, (to declare
your wysedome and vnderstanding) haue
named two such markes, as euery kynde
of religion will boldely chalendge vnto
her selfe. First, <hi>the true worde of God</hi> (saye
you) <hi>is one true marke of the church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>what meane you then, by the worde of
God? for if you meane the volume of the
olde and new testament, and that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resoeuer
we fynde the byble in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
handes, that we must thereby strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
take this for a certayne toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, that
he which hath the byble in his hande is
one of the right churche, so shal you haue
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:22571:204"/>
not only your selfe, but Arrians, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistes,
and all the rabell of myscreantes,
to be of the true churche, by good lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhod.
On the otherside, if you meane by
the worde of God, the two testamentes,
not as they are to be solde at bookebyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
shopps, but as they are expounded
of sincere and true preachers, what toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> shall we haue of you, to know readily
who is a true preacher? And as I haue
said of this first marke which you geaue,
so maye I saye againe of your seconde,
which is, the right vse of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes.
Which as I will graunt vnto you, to be
rightlye practized onlye within the true
churche, so yet you haue to shewe vs fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
how I maye know such as doe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
them accordinglye. You would
proue by S. Augustine, S. Cyprian, Saint
Chrisostome, and Origine, that the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
is the true tryall of the churche.
Yea Syr, in one sense that is true in deed,
as also that the church maketh the tryall
and declaration of the true scripture.
But, that euer any good and reasonable
man had this meanyng, that who so euer
<pb facs="tcp:22571:205"/>
would, might take the scriptures into his
handes, and sytt iudge ouer the church,
I denye it vtterly, and I am sure, you can
neuer proue it. For as the scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth
which is the true church, so doeth
the churche shewe the authoritie of the
scripture, and the scripture and the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
are the better, the one for the other
of them. Do you thinke to make vs afer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
by the appealing vnto scripture? or
doe you labor to moue a suspition, that
you only haue the Ghospell for you? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely
we are content to be tryed, not only
by the scriptures, but euen by those holy
fathers, which you depraue in this place
towardes your purpose. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trouersie
now, betwene vs and you, is the same,<note place="margin">Marke this place.</note>
which was betwene S. Augustine and the
Donatistes. We seeke for the church, and
the place where she resteth. You say, that
it hath ben vnknowen, defaced, obscured,
and coarcted, you saye that it is now in
England, and before these last .lx. yeares,
you knew not where she was to be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.
On the other syde, we beleiue that it
hath ben and shall be continually visible,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:22571:205"/>
tholike, vpon the topp of the hill, not in
gardens or chambers, not in corners of
countreyes, but in the open sight of the
worlde. And here now at this point we
shal haue no other thing, but our yea and
our nay. <hi>Yes</hi> (saye you) <hi>lett the matter be

that you will make vs altogeather igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,

                  <pb facs="tcp:22571:206"/>
But what of all this? Marye Syr, that you
shold reade in these scriptures, how playn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
it was promysed, that the whole world
should be Christ his inheritage, and that
his churche should be sought for, not in
pelting corners of <hi>Africa,</hi> of <hi>Europa,</hi> or
<hi>Asia,</hi> not in <hi>wyttenberge, Geneua,</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
but in all nations and in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes
of the world. And if you myslyke
this our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clusion gathered out of these
places of scripture, consider then, better
then you haue done, S. Augustins reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
against Petilian, and against all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Donatistes, when so euer he wrote
against them, as in his. 162. 166. 170. 171.
and other of his epistles. In all which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
he proueth, that it is vnpossible, that
Donate, which was an vpstart heretike
in <hi>Africa,</hi> should haue the truth on his
syde, because the scriptures do so playn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
promyse vs, that the church of Christ
should be enlarged ouer the whole worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,
and because it was so sensibly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that euery one might see that chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,
which was extended through all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Now, if you haue any scriptures, or
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:22571:206"/>
authorityes, or reasons, to proue that the
church should not be openly knowen for
900. yeares togeather, or that about the
yeare of our Lorde God .1500. the light
of the Ghospell should begynne to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
or that the churche may be in one
countrey only, or that Christ shold leese
his inheritage, which was promysed hym
ouer the world, or that all the dryfte of
S. Augustyns reasoning against the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natistes,
doth not expresly make against
you, then shall you speake somewhat
worth the answering. Against which ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
prouyde also to tell vs, how S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
(whom you alleage,<note place="margin">S. Cyprian alleaged agaynst the <hi>M.</hi> of the defence hymselfe.</note> to proue that
recourse should be had to the scriptures)
doth make any thing for you? Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he maketh cleane against you, and if
you had taken but small leysure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
hym, he teacheth you, that to come
vnto the truth, and to be sure of it, there
is an other and better waye then you ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
yet inuented. For after those wordes,
<hi>Hereof aryse schysmes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cyp. tract. 3. de simpl. praelat.</note> 
                  <hi>because we seeke

heauenly master.</hi> After which wordes, you
make a full point, as though you had tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
all his meanyng) he saieth further that
to proue this, there is no neede of long
talke or reasonyng. <hi>Our Lorde spake vnto
Peter, and sayed: I tell the, thow art. Peter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 16.</note>
                  <hi>and vpon this rock I wyll buyld my church,
and the gates of hell shall not overcome it.
&amp;c. And allthough he gaue lyke authoritie
vnto all his Apostles after his resurrection,
and said:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Io. 20,</note> 
                  <hi>Euen as my father sent me, I also

hym, yf you reteyne them, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned,
yet that he might make playne, and
set furth an vnitie, he disposed by his owne
authoritie the head and spring of that vnitie
which beginneth of one.</hi> And a lytle after
he sayeth: <hi>Doeth he beleiue, that he holdeth
and keepeth his fayth, which keepth not this
vnitie of the church?</hi> How then could you
bring in S. Cyprian in the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon
of anye of your two markes of the
church, which so expressely warneth you
to consider the vnitie thereof, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
which was geauen vnto S. Peter,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:22571:207"/>
in which vnitie who so euer is not found

But now, because it is not inough, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that your markes of the church are
vncertayne and controuersious, except
we geaue some better signes, which may
leade all men vnto the true church, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to considered, what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse

                  <hi>one, holye, Catholike, and Apostolike church:</hi>
and if he knoweth also what he speaketh,
then shall he neuer be to seeking of the

by which one worde, thei be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
tryed for no good Christians, which
can neuer agree vpon their fayth, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
no certayne head or gouernour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlye,
the church is <hi>holye,</hi> in this sense,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
either because none are holye which are

<pb facs="tcp:22571:208"/>
either because she is stable and inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Which note doth warne vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

at euery new preachers inuention.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, the church must be <hi>Catholike,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Catholike.</note>
which is to say, she must goe through the
whole world, not only in respect of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
but also of persons and tyme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it foloweth, that all such religion
as lurketh only in particular countreyes,
or which hath no antiquitie and conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
at all, is to be reiected as a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
naught, and no Catholike or good

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> must be <hi>Apostolike,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apostolike</note> by which worde I
meane, that if they of England now, or

to be dyscredited. Loe Syr, if you be of a

your diuine logike,) it is only an inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:22571:211"/>
of the papistes, that God hym selfe
did suffre a most paineful death for man.
It is wysedome for vs, rather to beleiue
the church, then to allow such argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
by which we maye destroye all true
religion. And yet not only the church
teacheth, but the scripture also wytnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
that this which the Christians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
in the Sacrament, is the bodye of
Christ hym selfe, as he said most playnly,
<hi>This is my bodye which is geuen for you.</hi>
Now whether the verbe substa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tiue <hi>Sum,

                  <note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> might be interpreted by <hi>transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiare,</hi>
tell me fyrst, I praye you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Sum, es, fui,</hi> maye be taken emong
the grammaryans <hi>Assumere naturam, non
personam?</hi> which sense of the verbe sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiue,
<hi>Sum, es, fui,</hi> after you haue
not founde in any dictionary of the best
making, how will it sounde in your ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
to say, <hi>Deus est homo, God is man?</hi> The
worde was made flesh,<note place="margin">Io. 1.</note> sayeth the blessed
Apostle and Euangelist, by which we
confesse and beleiue, that God the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
was not changed into flessh, or min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
and confounded with it, or in any
<pb facs="tcp:22571:212"/>
part altered, but that he tooke vnto his
person, the verye nature of man, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it vnto his Godhed. Which sense if
you repyne against, because the propriety
of the tongue can not beare it, that (<hi>factu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
est,</hi>) might be interpreted by, <hi>vnita est di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina
persona humanae naturae, the person of
God was vnited vnto the nature of man:</hi>
trulye then, as your learning perchanse
is such that you maye be suffred to reade
an open lesson in some grammer schole,
so without all doubt you are to be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the vnright construyng of our
Christian rules. But, (saye you) <hi>we must
search the scriptures as Christ and his Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
taught vs, and as the holye Fathers dyd
vse against the Arrians, and other hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes.</hi>
As who should saye, that (<hi>This is my
bodye which shal be delyuered for you</hi>) were
not scripture playne inough, or as though
the Arrians had not in sight, more places
of scripture then the Catholike Fathers,
or else as though the most holy men of
these fyftene hundred yeares, whom we
folow in the fayth of the sacrament, had
written whole and large treatyses of it,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:22571:212"/>
and vsed no scripture at all. Well Syr, if
we lack scripture, you, perchaunse, doe
abounde in it, and therefore what is your
opinion of the sacrament?</p>
               <q>when we interprete Christ his wordes, we
saye,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 106.</note> it is a figuratiue speache, and such as
the Holyghoste often vseth in the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sacramentes and ceremonyes.</q>
               <p>It is most true that figurative speaches
are often vsed in the scripture,<note place="margin">Reply.</note> as when
Christ said: <hi>I am the vyne. &amp;c.</hi> but can you
therfor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>clude,<note place="margin">Io. 15.</note> that they are allwayes v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed?
and if, <hi>I am the vyne,</hi> be figuratyue,
is, <hi>This is my body,</hi> lyke vnto it? When the
high Priestes of the Iewes asked Christ,
whether he were the soune of God, he
aunswered,<note place="margin">Mare. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I am,</hi> he sayed againe vnto his
dysciples,<note place="margin">Io. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the waye, the truth, and lyfe,</hi>
and yet he was not a figuratyue lyfe, but
reall lyfe in deede. And although that
Christ speaking of S. Iohn the Baptyst,
and sayeing, <hi>Yf you wyll receyue hym, he
is Helyas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 11.</note> meaned not yet that he was
Helyas in deed, but that he represented
Helyas for some pointes, neuertheles say<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
of hym selfe,<note place="margin">Io. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>I am the beginnyng which
<pb facs="tcp:22571:213"/>
speake vnto you,</hi> he willeth vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
not that he representeth onlye or
signifyeth the begynnyng which is God,
but that in very nature and substance,<note place="margin">Of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses to conclude generallie it ys no good fas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion.</note> he
is the author of all thinges. Whereby you
maye or should rather perceyue, that this
argument which you gather out of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
phrases in the scriptures, doth helpe
nothing your purpose, except you could
proue them to be generall. Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these wordes of S. Luke and S.
Paule,<note place="margin">Luc. 22. 1. Cor. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the new testame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t in my bloud,</hi>
by which you vnderstande, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment
is a testimony or pledge of his last
will and gyfte: concerning also the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
of testimonyes which you bring out
of the auncient Doctors, to proue that
Christ gaue a memorye, token, signe, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
and similitude of his bodye. I will
not speake against them, because they be
true sayinges &amp; Catholike. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> wyll
you leaue to proue that which we denye
not, and shewe directly vnto the purpose
that Christ gaue no body at all, but a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
only vnto vs? The catholike fayth
is this, that the externall signes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:22571:213"/>
of bread and wyne are figures of the
naturall body and bloud of Christ which
are vnder them, (for as bread is the most
naturall and necessarie foode, so we vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the flesh of the soune of God,
to be vnto the faythfull,) Also, that the
very naturall body of Christ in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is a figure of the glorye to come,
and representeth that vnitie which shall
be betweene him and his elect in heauen,
(for he which communicateth hym selfe
so freely and fully in earth vnto synners,<note place="margin">the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse signes &amp; figures in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

what wyll not he do to the holye ones in
heauen?) Furthermore, both the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
visible sygnes of bread and wyne, and
the true body of our Sauyor which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the visible sacramentes, are a figure
and signe of the mutuall vnitie of Christ
with his churche, (for she is made one
bread, through Christ, as it were of many
graynes, and one body consisting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
members.) Agayne, the breaking of
the visible sacrament, and the reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the body of Christ, are in signe
and memorie of his passion, (for if a man
should seeke a thousand wayes to styrre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men
<pb facs="tcp:22571:214"/>
vp to thinke on Christ, this passeth
all other without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>parison, to bring the

all these figures and signes which are foun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
in the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, we confesse also, that
there is a reall presence, not spirituall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,<note place="margin">Lib. 8. de trinitate</note> but corporall. For S. Hilarye proueth

                  <note place="margin">Christ is reallie in the sacra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> 
                  <hi>because that
man, which dyd so eate it, was also God: euen
so, the breade of our mysteries, is conuerted
into the flesh of the worde.</hi> Furthermore S.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:22571:214"/>
to be also in his Sainctes, so that it is one

neyther so beleiue the presence of Christ

so magnifie signes and figures, that we ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke
awaye all reall presence,<note place="margin">De con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrat. 2. cap. Vtrum.</note> S. Augustine
teaching vs, <hi>That the body of Christ, is both
a veritie, and a figure: a veritie, whiles the
substance of bread and wyne is made his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
and bloud by the power of the holyghost:
and a figure, because of that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
seene and perceyued.</hi> And so against
the next tyme, (if you can haue any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,)
prouide to proue, not that Christ
gaue a figure, but that he gaue nothing
else but a figure. For if you will so graunt
a figure, that yet you will not denye the
reall presence, then will all our other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
which you despyse now, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of the principle of Christ his
reall presence, that you neede to make no
further question about them. As for the
kynges brode seale, vnto which you resem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble
the sacrament, it may be well and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
sayd, that in deede the sacrament is a
most sure confirmation of all the actes
which Christ dyd worke for vs, in the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:22571:215"/>
of his visible conuersation emong vs.
For how might we haue his verye true
bodye emong vs, except he receyued a
true nature of man vpon hym? or how
might we Christians doubt of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be rysen from death to immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
whose flessh and bloud is daily gea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to such as will, to saue them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?
But, if you make no more of it,
then that, as the king his brode seale doth
geaue a force to his letters patentes,<note place="margin">Goodlie greate wordes emong the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testantes but small and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sense.</note> so
lykewyse the sacramentall bread should
confirme the testament and promyses of
Christ, and that in such a sense, that as
truly as our body is fedd with that bread,
so truly our sowle is norysshed with his
spirite: verely you haue taken a great
wonder at a common and easye matter.
For euery man, when he will, not only in
the church, but at home and else where,
and not only by bread or wyne, but also,
by euery thing that is true, maye vse the
lyke phrase, and saye: as truly as I stand,
as I sytt, as this fyer burneth, as the son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
shineth, as I lyue, as I eate, &amp;c. so tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
God dyed once for vs to saue vs from
<pb facs="tcp:22571:216"/>
death euerlasting. And if you wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tend,
that although one maye so say of al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which are true, yet that there is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
regarde to be had vnto bread &amp; wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
which Christ him selfe appointed for
that purpose, yet you haue no great cause
of wonder, no more then you shold mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
in some weighty accompt which the
kyng himselfe would sett for some profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
effect, that one such peece of golde
which right now stood but for a shilling,
should be sodainly remoued and made to
signifie. 1000000. Li. For if al the dignity
and price of the Sacrament consisteth
herein, that it representeth a most won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
gyfte and benefyte, which the
soune of God bestowed vpon vs: then are
you very much to blame for defacing,
spoyling, breaking, and burning of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixes,
which did more lyuely represent
the death of Christ, then any externall
forme of bread and wyne can doe. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reunto
if you will answer, that Christ ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the one and not the other, you
maye yet gather thereby, that (according
vnto your imagination) there is no such
great excellencye in the institution of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:22571:216"/>
bread and wyne to represent and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
vnto vs the veritie of Christ his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses,
but that a paynter or caruer maye
as euidently expresse them by his arte and
colours, and more effectually also per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunse,
for the playne, symple, deuout
and good men of the world. Wherefor
that the holye doctors and fathers of

they doe showe the effecte of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and seale vpp vnto vs the promy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Christ: it is a very abiect and vyle
mysconstruyng of them. For they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
most expreslye, that in the externall

the chainge is onely in the substance of
the bread into Christ his bodye, which
at an other tyme is to be proued more

vs, that it should not be vncredible, that

yet, (saye you) they speake of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

this similitude, <hi>Lyke as wax being

remaineth, no ouerplus resteth: so doe thow
thinke, the misteries to be consumed by the

it is not so, or els it is to be vnderstanded
after this maner, that lyke as when the
king his broad seale is sett vnto his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tes, then haue those letters their

should be lyke a pece of wax to confirme

I can not tell what letters. For if you

contrition, confession, and satisfaction,
therefore it is but superfluous cost, and
a torment vnto the conscience. Colde
meate shall serve vs well inough, and we
shalbe as merye with bread and drink in
the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ce that Christ dyed for vs,
as with all the prouision which the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
saie Christ to haue made. In which
similitude, you haue as rightly expressed
your inward thoughtes, as maye be. And
we truly, if we make greate prouisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, we
doe no other then we are commaunded,
because we be his seruantes which euery
daye geaueth the fatt calfe, for ioye of
his sounes which were lost and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
agayne, which was neuer a nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of his meate and drinke, in so much
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:22571:218"/>
that when he had none other, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes
in his howse, yett he prouyded
so royally for them, that as euerye one of
them wysshed, so dyd his meate taste in
his mouth. For consider onlye the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencye
of Manna of the olde law.
First of all it came from heauen without
any labor of the Israelites: it came dayly,
(except one daye in the weeke) that they
should haue it fressh and fressh:<note place="margin">Exod. 16.</note> it came
so plentyfullye, that yt couered all the
grounde about theyr tentes: and yet so
equallye, that he which gathered more
dyd not abounde, and he which gathered
lesse did not want it came so simply as if
it had ben the seedes of coryander:<note place="margin">Num. 11.</note> and it
tasted so wonderfully that it conteyned

surely as their bodyes were noryshed with
that bread, so sure thei might be, that their
sowles &amp; mindes were fed with the grace
of Christ. And all this yet, was bestowed
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> the Iewes, before the incarnation of
the sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e of God, before the comming
of the holyghost, in the law of bondage,
<pb facs="tcp:22571:219"/>
in the tyme of figures, and when God
(as I may saye) did not yet keepe open
householde in all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>treyes of the world,
neither make so great cheare, as he myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to doe afterwarde. Therefor, if such
thinges were geaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> vnto the Iewes,<note place="margin">Christians are worse fed then the Iewes were, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they receiue the true bodie of Christ.</note> what
was to be reserued for Christians? and if
we haue not in deede the reall body of
Christ emong vs, what lyke thing haue
we, vnto their Manna. Yf there were no
other argument but this one, which is
gathered upon the conferring of tyme
with tyme, state with state, figures with
truthes, Moyses with Christ, Iewes with
Christians, yet of very congruence and
conscience, we should looke to fare bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then the Israelites dyd in the barren
wyldernes. But, except our Sauior his
wordes, (<hi>this is my bodye, this is my bloud</hi>)
be vnderstanded literally and really, we
fare a thousand partes worse. For as in
our bread vnitie is represented, so might
it haue ben in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> Manna: and as you
be as verely assured, that your sowle doth
participate Christ in spirite, as your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye
doth receyue the externall bread, so
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:22571:219"/>
likewise they, which were spirituall emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>g
the Israelites, did, in their Manna, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
and receyue the bread of lyfe and
the Sauior of the world: and againe, as
your sacramentall bread is a token and
seale vnto you of the goodnes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses
of God, so was Manna vnto them;
and that with much more myracle and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fort. So that you haue nothing in this
your Sacrament of the new law, (which
should be most excellent,) which one
maye not fynde in the Manna of the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
law, which yet was but a shadow and
figure of the bodye of Christ in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
but Manna of that tyme, had
many wonderful prerogaty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>es, by which
it farr passeth in estimation, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ his bodye and bloud, if
there be no more in it, then you doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
and vtter. Which because it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable,
therefore we can not but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
Christ his wordes, (<hi>This is my
bodye, &amp;c.</hi>) in that sense which we doe,
and we doe not feare least we shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende
in making to great a price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t, but rather we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>fesse
<pb facs="tcp:22571:220"/>
that we shall neuer be able to expresse
the maiestie, the miracles, and the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of it. As for you, if you be delighted
with cold rost, and would not, (if you
might) haue Christ really and naturally
God and man, bodye and sowle, to be
geauen vnto you, but can satisfye your
appetyte, with only figures, sygnes and
similitudes, you shal sytt by your selfe for
the Catholikes, vntyll God shall sende
you more charitie. Which if it were, (as
it should be in you) you could not fynde
fault with the reall presence of Christ in
his Sacrament,<note place="margin">Defence fol. 118.</note> and call it a <hi>torment</hi> vnto
your conscience, but rather you would
be werye of all scrappes and leauinges of
an yesterdayes feast, and contemne all
counterfait dyshes, which haue more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance
then substance. When you were
a childe, if one had brought vnto you a
byrde or a fysh made in fyne and sweete
paste with a figg or such lyke thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
you would haue ben more delighted
in it, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> with the true meate of the byrde
or fysh, but after that you be come to
the state of a man, you should couet the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:22571:220"/>
sounde and strong meates, and lett all
such creekes and knackes alone, to serue
for children. God graunt that you fynde
not hereafter, fault also with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
that they teache you to beleiue a
true and natural flesh and sowle in Christ
and that you reproue not the charges and
cost which God hath bestowed vpon the
redemption of mankynde, because the
only worde of his blessed will, was able
to saue vs, so that his incarnation needed
not, but only a similitude of a body.</p>
               <p>But for this tyme, let this be an end
of this Replye, and I would to God, here
might be an end of all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>trouersie, which
because it is not verye credible, in such
confusion and vnrulynes of sectes and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions,
therfor some answer is to be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for, or rather some similitude of it.
For as concerning any true answer in the
defence of your part, you can neuer make
it in those pointes, which you are burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
withall in this Replye, as, your mys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construyng
of holye Fathers, and reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
out of the purpose with many ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surde
and vnlearned conclusion. Yet no
<pb facs="tcp:22571:221"/>
doubt, but you will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tinew styll in your
stoutnes, and by one meane or other,
mayntayne your Capitaynes against vs.
For if Goliath be stroken downe, yet you
sett vpp an Achilles, and by chainging
of the name you thinke to chainge the
cause. But if your bastard brauery, had
not ben sufficiently exemplified, by the
fact of the vncircumcided Goliath, yet
now by the crake, which you sett vpon
your prophane Achilles, you proue your
selfes more lyke that fell Gyant the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> euer
you were before. For allthough Goliath
was bygg in stature and wordes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
the simple staffe and scripp with
which the loueable Dauyd came against
hym, yet after the stone once fastened in
his forehead, and the overthrow geuen
vnto hym, the Philistians hartes were in
their heeles, and they fledd awaye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further bragging. But he, whom
you nyckname Parys, allthough he hath
vtterlye kylled your Achilles, shooting (as
you saye) his arrowes out of a corner pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely,
but how so euer they were shott,
hitting (as we beleiue) the marke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlye,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:22571:221"/>
yet you make your Achilles so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible,
as though he could not be wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded
at all in this quarrell, and as though
he passed no more of any shott of ours
then if benettes or strawes should be cast
agayne hym. Which is so exceading and
vayne glorious a crake, that it maye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be thought that your Achilles would
be very gladd, if he might neuer hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
heare any more wordes, about his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
and loude challendge. For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the manifest obiections, which
are made against hym, they are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad
in playne prent, which he hath not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
yet in haste to answer (as far as we know)
because perchaunse he knoweth his ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
imbecillitie. And if this Apologye of
the priuate Masse had ben allso putt in
prent, that it might haue come vnto his
sight, he would (I thinke) haue dyssem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
the matter or despysed the argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
to shifte awaye from hym all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
of answering. But how so euer your
Achilles be dysposed, you haue shewed
your selfe a frindlye Patroclus, which to
saue his worshipp, haue taken vpon you
<pb facs="tcp:22571:222"/>
to answer in his behalfe. Which although
you haue done, with much infelicitie, yet
you haue declared, your good hart and
fidelitie. You shall cause Achilles himsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe,
to take the matter into his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
partly for the chalenge sake, which
he fyrst of all pronunced, partly for you
his frendes sake, whom he wil be loth to
see vndefended. God sende you of his gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
abundantly, that you fyght not for an
<hi>Helena</hi> in deede, mainteyning the lustes
and appetytes of your carnall reason, stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
for your owne inuentions, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
your owne prayses. The church
and spouse of Christ is shamefast, chaste,
gentle, faythfull, obedient, without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
and spitefullnes, full of good vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes,
stedfast in her profession, allwayes
desyrous of vnitie, which vertues whiles
some haue neglected, they haue themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
ben contemned of God, and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to folow their owne frowardnes, to
the increasing of their iust dampnation.
Of this kynde was Luther and his folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers,
which as though they had nothing
els to study vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>, but only how thei might
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:22571:222"/>
inuent sectes and diuisyons, so they lefte
no one thing which the church taught
them, vncontrolled, or vncorrupted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
at their will and pleasure, of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
necessarye, no matter at all, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
in the seauen sacramentes, which
they haue brought to two only or three,
and them corrupted,) of vniuersall and
autentyke, so indifferent, that euerye one
might omitt them, (as prescript fastin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
orders of praying, and ceremonies)
and of indifferent in the nature of them,
so necessary and absolute, that no dispen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sation
may serue for the altering of them,
(as in sole receyuing, receauing in one
kynde, and reseruation of the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t.)
So that nothing pleased them, that the
churche, in which they toke their fayth,
delyuered vnto them, because they loued
them selues to much, and their owne dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<hi>Cate</hi> and <hi>Helena.</hi> Whom, God shall at
length, destroye with the spyrite of his
mouth, and by sending of his feare into
their hartes which honor her, dryue away
that wycked one, which maynteyneth the
battayle, and make such peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie
<pb facs="tcp:22571:223"/>
in their conscience, that it maye
haue good space and mynde to consider
the securitie which is in the catholike
church, and learne emong many other,
this one point of charitie, that neither so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le
receyuing vnder one kynde, neyther
receyuing vnder both kyndes with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
doth commende vs vnto God, but
the keeping of his commaundementes,
and obeying of his ordynances, which
he hath or shal vtter, eyther by him
selfe immedyatly, or by the
Catholike church his
interpretour.</p>
