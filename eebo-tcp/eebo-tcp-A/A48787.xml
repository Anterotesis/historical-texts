            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Right Presbyters! scripture at one end, and hypocrisie at the other; <hi>reproach â€”affliction â€”sin â€”suffering â€”</hi> out of the Concordance; <hi>glad to see you,</hi> out of the bottom of your heart; why? thou hast not seen that that made thee glad these sixteen years? â€” But why here at <hi>Amsterdam!</hi>

               <p>Many wayes! as firstâ€”none can come to a house and see our Meeting without a Warrant from two Justices of the Peace. 2.

                  </note> Warrant. 3. The Militia cannot as formerly distarbe us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Warrant. 4. Our Meeting places may be contrived at distance enough from any Justice of Peace. 5. The Justices must meet before they can proceed against us. 6. They may punish us for the three first offences we are convicted of as little as they please, and its odds but we can make friends to them; and as we may meet often before we are convicted the first time, it will go very hard if we be convicted the fourth. 7. We may meet and confer, and yet nothing proved against us concerning the worship of God. 8. We may walk into the Fields, and never come within the compass of the Act. 9. Our Ministers may go from house to house, and visit, &amp; so instruct too, &amp; we may visit them. To all this I may add that many of the Magistrates in the Land are not so zealously affected to prosecute the people of God.</p>

                  <p>O Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> it is you that sent an admonition to

the Parliament concerning grievances with a remedy, <hi>viz. The admiting of a platforme of discipline by you prescribed.</hi>

                  <p>What is that! an admonition? that is the lowest of Ecclesiastical Censures, and a preparative if neglected to suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and excommunication; what? If the Parliament comply not with your admonitions, they must be suspended and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated! you have brought things to a fair pass. We intreat you Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> give in some further evidences concerning these persons.</p>

                  <p>When two admonitions made by Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> had been answered by Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and defended again by Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and at last unanswerably confuted by Dr. <hi>Whitgift;</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> either scorning, or not able, or not daring to answer, attempts some other designes, and particularly at <hi>Wandsworth</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> they presuming upon Parliament favour, set up their Discipline privately, which they could not establish publickly, with the assistance of Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Field</hi> Lecturer there, living in <hi>London, Wilcox, Standen, Jackson, Bonham, Smith</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eham, Serretloe, Cram</hi> of <hi>Roe-hampton, Edmonds, Clark, Travers, Barber, Gardiner, Cheston, Crooke, Egerton; r. r. r. r.</hi> Under whose wings a Congregation of <hi>Dutch Anabaptists</hi> assembled themselves without <hi>All-gate</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> who being discovered, eight of them were banished, and two not withstanding Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> and other Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists intercession for them, were burnt at <hi>Smithfield,</hi> by the Statute <hi>de Heretico comburendo.</hi>

In a word these men grew so extravagant that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> and others were deserted by them as lukewarme, and remiss in the cause. And among these rigid men, <hi>Coleman, Furton, Hallingham,</hi> and <hi>Benson,</hi> exceeded all of their own opinion.</p>

                  <p>It was this, That the Nonconformists under pretence of suppressing <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> were able to be revenged of Master <hi>Mountague</hi> for some tart expressions against them, notwithstanding his Majesties protection of his own Chaplain, so that the King was faine to leave him to himself, and to stand or fall (as he told the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who sounded him to that purpose) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the justice of his Cause.</p>

                  <p>As the great Champions of truth forsooth they procure two conferences at <hi>Yorkehouse</hi> before the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> by the mediation of <hi>R.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100061:22"/>
on their side against <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> until they had got such a party as might be able to carry all before them; for they knew that those learned Gentlemen, and Ministers who were of their mind in some points, would, being provoked by their adversaries, be of their mind in all. â€”</p>

                  <speaker>L.</speaker>
                  <p>No; but being intent upon their Design, and knowing that the King was well setled and resolved against all Innovations, they intend to weaken his power, and to that purpose they retrenched his Prerogative by many Laws and Statutes; and questioned Dr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> for preaching up his Prerogative, being resolved to put all power in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> hands, who were too well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to their way.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, they were so bold as to employ two persons, <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> to hinder Bishop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Confirmation by alledging against him some frivolous exceptions, so much did they prevaile now they had joyned themselves to the discontented, the <hi>Antiarminian, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But while the wisemen of this party were driving on their design covertly, and politickly, one <hi>Leighton</hi> was to break the Ice, and feel the pulse of the times, and to that purpose he sets out a Book called <hi>Zions Plea,</hi> rayling against the Queen as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and exhorting men to kill the Bishops, and to smite them under the fifth rib.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>No; when his party saw that he was not suffered, they let him shift for himself, and they go on in a more prudent method.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>That they might engage the Clergy to themselves, they set up a Committee for buying in impropriations; <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Gouge, Sibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Offspring, Davenport, &amp;c.</hi> who were to buy so many Livings to be bestowed on the Favourers of the new way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of nine thousand Ministers, three thousand and nine hundred might be sure to their side, beside those presented by the many Patrons that were devoted to their party.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Court.</speaker>
                  <p>Here they took care to prefer their friends; how did they bring men up still in their way; notwithstanding the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of publick authority?</p>

                  <speaker>P. H.</speaker>
                  <p>When they had preferment they were sure to have friends; yet they had persons of their way in both Universities, very vigilant for their Interest, as appeared in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where one <hi>Thorne</hi> of <hi>Baliol,</hi> and <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall broke out into bitter invectives in their Sermons on this Text, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Let us make us a Captain, and let us return into</hi> Egypt. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>And be cried against the Altar in the word of the Lord; and said, O Altar, Altar.</hi>

                  <speaker>Court.</speaker>
                  <p>It was a notable way to buy out impropriations to set up Lecturers, knowing that they who hold the helm of the Pulpit in <hi>England, alwaies steer peoples hearts whether they please,</hi> whereby they might have more Chaplains depending upon them then either King or Bishops; but the great plot lay in securing the Universities, where if young men were tainted with their way, <hi>they would not depart from it when they were old:</hi> But did any Countenance these persons?</p>

                  <p>Yes, the Proctors and Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Wilkinson,</hi> untill the King appeared against them at <hi>Woodstock.</hi>

                  <speaker>E. G.</speaker>
                  <p>By no meanes; for the expelling of these Preaches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled not, but encreased the differences in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which burnt the more for blazing the less.</p>

                  <p>His love to the Predestinarian way which these men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in an high degree; this was these mens policy to joyne with some eminent men in some opinions that they might have their favour and assistance in other things.</p>

                  <p>They set up the Sbabatarian controversies again by one <hi>Bradbourne,</hi> which if the Church allowed of, she went against her own judgement; if she disallowed, she was looked upon as an enemy of Godliness, and a friend to all prophaneness, yea so high did they raise these controversies, that they made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Judges and the Bishops, the one allowing a liberty on the Lords day, the other punishing it. And when the Church declared her judgement moderately, they procured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand many reproaches and hard speeches to be cast upon her,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100061:23"/>
as if she intended to destroy that Godliness which she taught, and to undermine that Religion she professed.</p>

                  <p>No; for they resolved upon other wayes of undermining the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and upon her fall they would raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; â€”but some hot-headed persons, as <hi>Bastwicke, Burton,</hi> and others break out to some excesses, for which they are severely punished.</p>

                  <p>And to make sure work, the Rabble were stirred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to the danger of their lives, and strange Petitions procured, in so much that the poor men were in a streight; to keep the House was dangerous; to leave it at this time was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>

to death who they knew must otherwise avenge on them these abominations; (for these people had the face too before the world to lay violent hands upon the Lords Annointed;) they made an Act wherein it was not lawful for an Orthodox man by any meanes to exercise his Ministry, being made uncapable either of performing the duty, or of enjoyning the maintenance of a Minister, either as Chaplain, Tutor, Schoolmaster, Curate, Vicar, or Pastor.</p>

                  <p>The same with all others of that nature, whence both parties go away as firme in their several Opinions as they came; it was not very likely that a day or two's conference should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them out of that way, out of which the last hundred years law, power, and reason could not force them.</p>

                  <p>Yet what these men could not do by argument, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by policy; using all meanes to secure to themselves the next Parliament, by the most notorious canvasing that was seen this twenty years; elections being carried with much partiality and popular heats in most places by the last endeavour of a gasping faction.</p>

                  <p>Not so; for at first all the lesser factions were hid in Presbytery, till time and military success discovering to every one his own advantage, invited them to part into several parties, as <hi>Independents, Anabaptists, Quakers, Fifth-Monarchy</hi> men, who all before the King came drove on their several designes; but were united since as against a common enemy.</p>

                  <p>Not so neither; for we have our slanting and back-strokes that are more effectual; as to pass by many others, they preach and write for serious holiness as they call it, as if it were now leaving the Land; <hi>now or never</hi> they cry, a Saint or a Brute, in the preface or conclusions whereof they had their dogged insinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that the Church was an enemy to holiness, and the Professors of it, when it discourageth nothing but hypocrisie; and when the men of the <hi>nose</hi> smell out that, out-comes a Book of hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie preached at the Abbey at <hi>Westminster,</hi> (for the brethren have the thriving way of selling their Sermons first from the Pulpit, and then from the Press,) wherein the Cavaliers who had been formerly the profane, were now the Hypocrites; But he that made all sure, is the man that writes the sighs and groans of the Church, that party paleman, that speakes high <hi>Fullam</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Book, and <hi>Colemanstreet</hi> in the end of it; this maus Masters stabbed the King with his own power, and he (a good proficient I'le warrant him) the Church with her own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: But above all the Legerdemaines of this party commend me to their Sermons of persecution, and their preparation of

                  <p>No more, but that they encouraged their party to go on, and stand out against the Act, that they might appear so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable as to prevaile either with his Majesty for an indulgence against, or with the Parliament for a repeal of the said Act; to which end they sent their Letters all over the Kingdome to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise every man to stand to his principles, not doubting of a Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon his Majesties promise at <hi>Breda,</hi> with other arguments they could make use of; And in order hereunto they oppose not the Act in Parliament, lest they should exasperate the noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots to severer courses, but they stand it out, that they might know their strength and power, not doubting but their consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number and interest, which will appear by the publick and general dissent to the Uniformity enjoyned, might gain them an indulgence, that will vacate and make void all former Lawes;

and accordingly we find them with their bed-roll of those that were to be ejected, rather threatning then petitioning his Majesty, (after some tumults raised in Dr. <hi>Seamans</hi> and other Churches, through which they would have his Majesty see the inclination of the people) as if they had said, <hi>May it please your most excellent Majesty,</hi> 
                     <q>Whereas we are many, and our party very considerable for their interest with God and men, as you would enjoy peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity in your Kingdomes, or any quiet in your Throne, we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to let us do what we please, and set no law or government over us, for we cannot in conscience endure any; and upon condition we have what we desire, your Petitioners shall pray for you.</q>

They take the subscriptions of several well affected persons towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of those persons, especially the elect Ladies; 3. They have Country and City Committees for that purpose, together with their Treasurers in both places, by whose order the money is delivered to the respective ejected men according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, provided that they have good Certificates of their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and faithfulness.</p>

                  <p>Yes; 1. The young sisters and widowes are bound to marry them, and so they as well as the Apostles in time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution lead about their sisters their wives; 2. They keep Boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and under the pretence of a poor schollar, teach them to debauch all the youths of the Kingdome, whereby the Schisme is propagated and made perpetual; 3. They print their own Bookes and dedicate them to all the faithful; 4. They turn solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors and Tradesmen; 5. They visit from house to house; 6. They have their Churches as entire now as ever they had,â€”having the conveniency of <hi>Moorfields, Islington,</hi> and <hi>Hickney</hi> to entertaine them; 7. They have concealed the table of Tythes and duties from the Orthodox Ministers, and look what the people can cheat the one of, they bestow it on the other.</p>

                  <speaker>B. D.</speaker>
                  <p>It is, but the brethren will tire out an honest man with a common stock, or put him out of countenance with a common clamour.</p>

                  <speaker>D. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Why? 1. They have private houses whereinto the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are dark, and from which there are several passages into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houses; 2. They meet at unusual houres, as at twelve at noon and about five at night; 3. They are but few at a time; 4. Those that meet are invited to a Feast, and if you surprize them, the table is laid and they go to dinner, only a Chapter is read, and O what times do we live in, that a man cannot read a Chapter without the danger of a <hi>Premunire!</hi> 5.

                  <p>They that have been there say (how truly I know not) that first they bewaile their apostacy from the old cause; 2. They pray that the Kings heart may be turned, and the Councel of the wicked may be overthrown; 3. They bewaile their neglect of the many opportunities put into their hands; 4. They wish an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between all parties; 5. They take in all intelligence, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise communicate all those scandals that lie upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 6. They teach perseverance; 7. They take order about any new occurrences that happen; As first if there be a new Law, how to evade it; 2. If any brother is taken in a snare, how to get him out by purse, interest, or importunity.</p>

                  <speaker>B. D.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> hath taken care of that by teaching that the people ought not to separate from the Church as hearers, though the Ministers do as Preachers; the Presbyterian <hi>Rabbies</hi> (saith my Author) must leave the Church, lest Presbytery be swallowed up of Episcopacy; the people must not leave the Church, lest Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery should be brought to nothing by Independency.</p>

                  <p>Why first they watch the vacancies in this Parliament; and tugg hard in the new elections; 2. They clap their hands at the little plots and the great quarels, and are observed to ride up and down incessantly at that time; 3. They engross the stock, and stop the trade of the Nation; 4. They have active Agents in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they are very troublesomeâ€”and unpeaceable; 5. There is (as it appears from the late Plotters examination here at <hi>York</hi>) a constant Committee to manage all affaires yonder at <hi>London;</hi> 6. Forreign Warrs; 7. Yea they promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (good Christians the whilest) great matters from the <hi>Turk,</hi> and bless themselves when they consider what liberty they shall enjoy under that good man, <hi>Calvino Turcismus;</hi> Right! 8.

They care not for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; for a Nonconformist in our parts durst come to Church even before the Judges, though he was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; 4.

                  <p>Now the question will be whether the dissenting brethren (considering their carriage and behaviour since the fancy began in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, of which we have given an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to this hour) are to complain if they are restrained by laws, and kept from meeting or acting by publick constitutions?</p>
                  <p>For answer to this, it is the observation of all men;
<list>
                        <item>1. That private men must be checked rather then the publick Government violated.</item>
                        <item>2. That it is not safe or reasonable for any private opinion or fancy to controule or guide a publick authority.</item>
                        <item>3. That the King must either violate his own <hi>Conscience,</hi> and so not have the <hi>liberty</hi> of it, which they insist on for themselves, or else check their pretences of theirs.</item>
                        <item>4. That they were never satisfied with any thing that was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; he that allowed them a little, doth but give them a <hi>power to take more;</hi> Could all the late Kings concessions keep them from his blood? first its Liberty, but at last it is a Warr: they are a party not to be gained by Obligations.</item>

5. That neither <hi>Scotland</hi> nor <hi>England</hi> had an houres peace or quiet since <hi>Knox</hi> set footing in the one, or they who had conferred notes with him in the other; but that blood, rapine, violence, malice, animosities, and plots have been the attendants of the good old cause since it was in the cradle.</item>
                        <item>6. That the Law must not be ruled by a faction, and yet that the question is now whether they who overthrowed the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly may now controule, and they who raised a Warr against it may be free from it in peace.</item>
                        <item>7. That the indulging of men because they are many, is rather an encouragement to <hi>Villany,</hi> then a provision for <hi>tenderness.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>8. That to ask liberty of Conscience is to ask liberty to what they please, which they may call conscience; for who shall judge what is really Conscience, and what is really malice?</item>
                        <item>9. That to grant these people what they desire, is to allow the reason of the reason of their requests, and so at once to reward one injury, and justifie another.</item>
                        <item>10. That the late Warr begun with calling that <hi>Christian liberty</hi> which the Law calleth <hi>treason,</hi> that Religion which the Church calleth Schisme.</item>
                        <item>11. That no Oathes or Vowes but one to rebell can tye these people.</item>
                        <item>12. That they would never trust others with the least indulgence.</item>
                        <item>13. That they are a people that rather then submit, exposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; whose Addresses look like mutinies, and their Petitions like threats.</item>
                        <item>14. That the whole business and bustle is but a contest between a <hi>Law</hi> and a <hi>Faction.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now considering these things, we must conclude that either the Government must be again banished, or the Faction; that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King for upholding the Church according to Law must be an exile, or they for supporting Conventicles against the Law must be proscribed; and which is fittest, let the World judge.â€”</p>

            <p n="1">1. The first whereof was from the concernment of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the publick peace and welfare, and the great advantages men had from all Governments in general, and every <hi>English</hi> mans Interest under this Government in particular; which I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily evaded with the maximes of a Commonwealth which possess more men then are publickly observed, and carry them to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and weakening of all the rules, lawes and principles of Monarchy that are now extant in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second was from the great Obligations laid upon men to peace and obedience in great rules and examples, by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity above all the Religions in the World, it being not the least part of its glory &amp; renown that it provides best for Government and obedience, for the security of Princes, and the peace of the people, of any perswasion under Heaven, is the Reverend person

instanced in many of its Theorems and principles, especially <hi>Rom. 13. a Pet.</hi> 2. to which I had my replies ready from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral discourses in justification of the late War, and the Kings death, <hi>still extant,</hi> and <hi>still someting mens dangerous and discontented thoughts:</hi> especially the sermons before the Parliament from 1641. to 1649.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third, and so much the <hi>more</hi> cogent argument (as <hi>Fear</hi> is more prevailing then <hi>Conscience)</hi> and <hi>a care of our selves,</hi> of more force with us then a sense of our <hi>duty,</hi> was the dreadful event of all attempts against Government, mentioned in Holy Scripture: which the good man urged with much <hi>earnestness</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> As, <hi>Had Zimri peace that flew his Master?</hi> Can a man <hi>touch the Lords Annointed, and be guiltless? My Son fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them who are given to change: for their calamity shall arise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruine of them both? Whosoever loveth Rebellion, a cruel Messenger shall be sent unto him. Curse not the King, no not in thy thought; for a Bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</hi> The terrour of which words was yet much allayed by the immunity and indulgence we already had, and might alwaies expect; only one day considering with my self that the events and issues of things in the World were exactly correspondent with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and predictions in the Scripture; that Heaven and Earth might pass away, and the Government of the Creation be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not one jot or title of the Word of God should fall to the ground: I resumed the last argument, examined those say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Scriptures aforementioned, comparing them with what happened upon that occasion in the World, and particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected such Memoires and observations of that nature as occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>English</hi> Nation from the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerer to our Age; out of which to my great astonishment I gathered this great Conclusion; (which I think it the interest of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age and posterity to take notice of,) that as the Scriptures have foretold some 3000. years Since, so we find it true in every age that Government is so secured by the ordinance and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that all attempts against it have come to nought, and all open and secret conspiraties and plots have had only this remarkable issue, <hi>That they ended in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
