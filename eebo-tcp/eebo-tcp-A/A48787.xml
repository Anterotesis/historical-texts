            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Right Presbyters! scripture at one end, and hypocrisie at the other; <hi>reproach —affliction —sin —suffering —</hi> out of the Concordance; <hi>glad to see you,</hi> out of the bottom of your heart; why? thou hast not seen that that made thee glad these sixteen years? — But why here at <hi>Amsterdam!</hi>

               <p>Many wayes! as first—none can come to a house and see our Meeting without a Warrant from two Justices of the Peace. 2.

                  </note> Warrant. 3. The Militia cannot as formerly distarbe us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that Warrant. 4. Our Meeting places may be contrived at distance enough from any Justice of Peace. 5. The Justices must meet before they can proceed against us. 6. They may punish us for the three first offences we are convicted of as little as they please, and its odds but we can make friends to them; and as we may meet often before we are convicted the first time, it will go very hard if we be convicted the fourth. 7. We may meet and confer, and yet nothing proved against us concerning the worship of God. 8. We may walk into the Fields, and never come within the compass of the Act. 9. Our Ministers may go from house to house, and visit, &amp; so instruct too, &amp; we may visit them. To all this I may add that many of the Magistrates in the Land are not so zealously affected to prosecute the people of God.</p>

Your exact institutions of Christian Religion. 2. Your no less industrious exposition of Scripture according <note place="margin">Bancroft Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline p. 106.</note> to those institutions; in which two things, whosoever bestowed their labour after you, you gained the advantage of prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them if they gainsaid you, or of glory above them if they consented; yea, that which you did in the establishment of,

                        <hi>That in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Liturgie there was not that purity which was desired to be; and although these things were at first tolerated, yet it behooved the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Grave, and Godly Ministers of Christ to enterprize further, and to set forth something more filed from Rust and purer.</hi>

                  <p>O Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> it is you that sent an admonition to

the Parliament concerning grievances with a remedy, <hi>viz. The admiting of a platforme of discipline by you prescribed.</hi>

                  <p>What is that! an admonition? that is the lowest of Ecclesiastical Censures, and a preparative if neglected to suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and excommunication; what? If the Parliament comply not with your admonitions, they must be suspended and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated! you have brought things to a fair pass. We intreat you Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> give in some further evidences concerning these persons.</p>

                  <p>When two admonitions made by Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> had been answered by Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and defended again by Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> and at last unanswerably confuted by Dr. <hi>Whitgift;</hi> Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> either scorning, or not able, or not daring to answer, attempts some other designes, and particularly at <hi>Wandsworth</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> they presuming upon Parliament favour, set up their Discipline privately, which they could not establish publickly, with the assistance of Mr. <hi>Cartwright,</hi> Mr. <hi>Field</hi> Lecturer there, living in <hi>London, Wilcox, Standen, Jackson, Bonham, Smith</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eham, Serretloe, Cram</hi> of <hi>Roe-hampton, Edmonds, Clark, Travers, Barber, Gardiner, Cheston, Crooke, Egerton; r. r. r. r.</hi> Under whose wings a Congregation of <hi>Dutch Anabaptists</hi> assembled themselves without <hi>All-gate</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> who being discovered, eight of them were banished, and two not withstanding Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> and other Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists intercession for them, were burnt at <hi>Smithfield,</hi> by the Statute <hi>de Heretico comburendo.</hi>

                  <p>Yea, to countenance their way they pretended to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess several persons of Devils untill a trick was put upon them by one <hi>Rachel Pindor</hi> aged 12. years, who deceived the Ministers of <hi>London,</hi> from whom more prudence and less credulity might have been expected; what prayer! what fasting! what preaching! In a word these men grew so extravagant that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> and others were deserted by them as lukewarme, and remiss in the cause. And among these rigid men, <hi>Coleman, Furton, Hallingham,</hi> and <hi>Benson,</hi> exceeded all of their own opinion.</p>

                  <p>It is a strange thing to see how the vigilance and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of these men infinuated their Cause to the favour of the chief men in Church and State: how with good words and fair spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches they deceived the hearts of the simple.</p>

                  <p>They produced this effect, (that notwithstanding my Lord of <hi>Canterburies</hi> resolution to stand to the Rules of the Church) the Nonconformists at several meetings above said, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed a new Platform, <hi>which they said consisted of things that might well stand with the peace of the Church.</hi> Where they resolve first, That Schollars should not offer themselves, but stay untill they be called to the Ministry in certain charge by the Classis upon the recommendation of the Brethren. 2.

                  <p>They divided themselves into four Classes; The first whereof framed a new Liturgy after the forme of <hi>Geneva:</hi> The second altered it in 600. particulars: The third resolved on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther model: The fourth dissented from the former: And so that wise Statesman put them off for the present untill they should agree.</p>

                  <p>It was this, That the Nonconformists under pretence of suppressing <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> were able to be revenged of Master <hi>Mountague</hi> for some tart expressions against them, notwithstanding his Majesties protection of his own Chaplain, so that the King was faine to leave him to himself, and to stand or fall (as he told the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who sounded him to that purpose) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the justice of his Cause.</p>

                  <p>As the great Champions of truth forsooth they procure two conferences at <hi>Yorkehouse</hi> before the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> by the mediation of <hi>R.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100061:22"/>
on their side against <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> until they had got such a party as might be able to carry all before them; for they knew that those learned Gentlemen, and Ministers who were of their mind in some points, would, being provoked by their adversaries, be of their mind in all. —</p>

                  <speaker>L.</speaker>
                  <p>No; but being intent upon their Design, and knowing that the King was well setled and resolved against all Innovations, they intend to weaken his power, and to that purpose they retrenched his Prerogative by many Laws and Statutes; and questioned Dr. <hi>Manwaring</hi> for preaching up his Prerogative, being resolved to put all power in the <hi>Parliaments</hi> hands, who were too well affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to their way.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>Yea, they were so bold as to employ two persons, <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> to hinder Bishop <hi>Mountagues</hi> Confirmation by alledging against him some frivolous exceptions, so much did they prevaile now they had joyned themselves to the discontented, the <hi>Antiarminian, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But while the wisemen of this party were driving on their design covertly, and politickly, one <hi>Leighton</hi> was to break the Ice, and feel the pulse of the times, and to that purpose he sets out a Book called <hi>Zions Plea,</hi> rayling against the Queen as Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, and exhorting men to kill the Bishops, and to smite them under the fifth rib.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>No; when his party saw that he was not suffered, they let him shift for himself, and they go on in a more prudent method.</p>

                  <speaker>F.</speaker>
                  <p>That they might engage the Clergy to themselves, they set up a Committee for buying in impropriations; <hi>viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Gouge, Sibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Offspring, Davenport, &amp;c.</hi> who were to buy so many Livings to be bestowed on the Favourers of the new way; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of nine thousand Ministers, three thousand and nine hundred might be sure to their side, beside those presented by the many Patrons that were devoted to their party.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Court.</speaker>
                  <p>Here they took care to prefer their friends; how did they bring men up still in their way; notwithstanding the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of publick authority?</p>

                  <speaker>P. H.</speaker>
                  <p>When they had preferment they were sure to have friends; yet they had persons of their way in both Universities, very vigilant for their Interest, as appeared in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where one <hi>Thorne</hi> of <hi>Baliol,</hi> and <hi>Ford</hi> of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall broke out into bitter invectives in their Sermons on this Text, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>Let us make us a Captain, and let us return into</hi> Egypt. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>And be cried against the Altar in the word of the Lord; and said, O Altar, Altar.</hi>

                  <speaker>Court.</speaker>
                  <p>It was a notable way to buy out impropriations to set up Lecturers, knowing that they who hold the helm of the Pulpit in <hi>England, alwaies steer peoples hearts whether they please,</hi> whereby they might have more Chaplains depending upon them then either King or Bishops; but the great plot lay in securing the Universities, where if young men were tainted with their way, <hi>they would not depart from it when they were old:</hi> But did any Countenance these persons?</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, the Proctors and Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> with Dr. <hi>Wilkinson,</hi> untill the King appeared against them at <hi>Woodstock.</hi>

                  <p>Now the King interposed his authority, we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume this faction was quite dashed.</p>

                  <speaker>E. G.</speaker>
                  <p>By no meanes; for the expelling of these Preaches ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled not, but encreased the differences in <hi>Oxford,</hi> which burnt the more for blazing the less.</p>

                  <speaker>A. H.</speaker>
                  <p>His love to the Predestinarian way which these men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted in an high degree; this was these mens policy to joyne with some eminent men in some opinions that they might have their favour and assistance in other things.</p>

                  <p>They set up the Sbabatarian controversies again by one <hi>Bradbourne,</hi> which if the Church allowed of, she went against her own judgement; if she disallowed, she was looked upon as an enemy of Godliness, and a friend to all prophaneness, yea so high did they raise these controversies, that they made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Judges and the Bishops, the one allowing a liberty on the Lords day, the other punishing it. And when the Church declared her judgement moderately, they procured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand many reproaches and hard speeches to be cast upon her,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100061:23"/>
as if she intended to destroy that Godliness which she taught, and to undermine that Religion she professed.</p>

                  <p>No; for they resolved upon other wayes of undermining the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and upon her fall they would raise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; —but some hot-headed persons, as <hi>Bastwicke, Burton,</hi> and others break out to some excesses, for which they are severely punished.</p>

                  <p>And to make sure work, the Rabble were stirred up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to the danger of their lives, and strange Petitions procured, in so much that the poor men were in a streight; to keep the House was dangerous; to leave it at this time was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy.</p>

                  <p>They were trepanned by Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> to a Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance, for which they were all committed to the Tower, and Impeached of High Treason; and now the Bishops were safe in the Tower, the Bill against them passed the House, and they were for ever excluded the House.</p>

to death who they knew must otherwise avenge on them these abominations; (for these people had the face too before the world to lay violent hands upon the Lords Annointed;) they made an Act wherein it was not lawful for an Orthodox man by any meanes to exercise his Ministry, being made uncapable either of performing the duty, or of enjoyning the maintenance of a Minister, either as Chaplain, Tutor, Schoolmaster, Curate, Vicar, or Pastor.</p>

                  <p>The same with all others of that nature, whence both parties go away as firme in their several Opinions as they came; it was not very likely that a day or two's conference should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them out of that way, out of which the last hundred years law, power, and reason could not force them.</p>

                  <p>Yet what these men could not do by argument, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by policy; using all meanes to secure to themselves the next Parliament, by the most notorious canvasing that was seen this twenty years; elections being carried with much partiality and popular heats in most places by the last endeavour of a gasping faction.</p>

                  <p>Not so; for at first all the lesser factions were hid in Presbytery, till time and military success discovering to every one his own advantage, invited them to part into several parties, as <hi>Independents, Anabaptists, Quakers, Fifth-Monarchy</hi> men, who all before the King came drove on their several designes; but were united since as against a common enemy.</p>

                  <p>They contrived a design so comprehensive as might take in the whole stream and strength of discontent and faction in the Nation, a design for liberty of Conscience in Religion, for ease of all payments, as Taxes, Tythes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in estate, for recovery of King and Bishops Lands to the thousands that bought them; of selling all in common to all the poor people that in quiet times could not live.</p>

                     <q>Whereas we are many, and our party very considerable for their interest with God and men, as you would enjoy peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity in your Kingdomes, or any quiet in your Throne, we must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to let us do what we please, and set no law or government over us, for we cannot in conscience endure any; and upon condition we have what we desire, your Petitioners shall pray for you.</q>

They take the subscriptions of several well affected persons towards the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of those persons, especially the elect Ladies; 3. They have Country and City Committees for that purpose, together with their Treasurers in both places, by whose order the money is delivered to the respective ejected men according to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, provided that they have good Certificates of their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and faithfulness.</p>
                  <p>And then to keep the cause in heart and life, the Farewell Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous are Printed, first singly, and then in Volums, as the dying words of the faithful Pastors, whose heads are set before their Sermons just as they looked from the Pulpit, wrapped in their reverend white and black Caps like the twelve Apostles before the Bible; <hi>For though we worship not Images, we adore imaginations.</hi>

3. By their setting poor Readers to make the Common Prayer contemptible, and then praying an hour themselves, as if that Prayer were inconsiderable.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By their preaching over the old ones notes, Ah, precious are those <hi>Elishaes</hi> that have the spirit of the <hi>Eliah's</hi> upon them!</p>

                  <speaker>B. D.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; 1. The young sisters and widowes are bound to marry them, and so they as well as the Apostles in time of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution lead about their sisters their wives; 2. They keep Boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and under the pretence of a poor schollar, teach them to debauch all the youths of the Kingdome, whereby the Schisme is propagated and made perpetual; 3. They print their own Bookes and dedicate them to all the faithful; 4. They turn solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors and Tradesmen; 5. They visit from house to house; 6. They have their Churches as entire now as ever they had,—having the conveniency of <hi>Moorfields, Islington,</hi> and <hi>Hickney</hi> to entertaine them; 7. They have concealed the table of Tythes and duties from the Orthodox Ministers, and look what the people can cheat the one of, they bestow it on the other.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>B. D.</speaker>
                  <p>It is, but the brethren will tire out an honest man with a common stock, or put him out of countenance with a common clamour.</p>

                  <speaker>D. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Why? 1. They have private houses whereinto the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are dark, and from which there are several passages into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther houses; 2. They meet at unusual houres, as at twelve at noon and about five at night; 3. They are but few at a time; 4. Those that meet are invited to a Feast, and if you surprize them, the table is laid and they go to dinner, only a Chapter is read, and O what times do we live in, that a man cannot read a Chapter without the danger of a <hi>Premunire!</hi> 5.

                  <p>They that have been there say (how truly I know not) that first they bewaile their apostacy from the old cause; 2. They pray that the Kings heart may be turned, and the Councel of the wicked may be overthrown; 3. They bewaile their neglect of the many opportunities put into their hands; 4. They wish an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between all parties; 5. They take in all intelligence, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise communicate all those scandals that lie upon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 6. They teach perseverance; 7. They take order about any new occurrences that happen; As first if there be a new Law, how to evade it; 2. If any brother is taken in a snare, how to get him out by purse, interest, or importunity.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>B. D.</speaker>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Crofton</hi> hath taken care of that by teaching that the people ought not to separate from the Church as hearers, though the Ministers do as Preachers; the Presbyterian <hi>Rabbies</hi> (saith my Author) must leave the Church, lest Presbytery be swallowed up of Episcopacy; the people must not leave the Church, lest Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery should be brought to nothing by Independency.</p>

                  <p>Why first they watch the vacancies in this Parliament; and tugg hard in the new elections; 2. They clap their hands at the little plots and the great quarels, and are observed to ride up and down incessantly at that time; 3. They engross the stock, and stop the trade of the Nation; 4. They have active Agents in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they are very troublesome—and unpeaceable; 5. There is (as it appears from the late Plotters examination here at <hi>York</hi>) a constant Committee to manage all affaires yonder at <hi>London;</hi> 6. Forreign Warrs; 7. Yea they promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves (good Christians the whilest) great matters from the <hi>Turk,</hi> and bless themselves when they consider what liberty they shall enjoy under that good man, <hi>Calvino Turcismus;</hi> Right! 8.

They care not for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication; for a Nonconformist in our parts durst come to Church even before the Judges, though he was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; 4. They make the Church Wardens their own, therefore it is they busle so much at the election of them; As at <hi>Newbury</hi> where the faction was so unruly in <hi>Easter</hi> week, that nothing but the Train-bands could keep them in order; they shift their dwellings and live in a corner that may be in two Counties or Diocesses, or at the worst they hide themselves in <hi>London</hi> where they are most secure, and most serviceable.</p>

                  <p>Now the question will be whether the dissenting brethren (considering their carriage and behaviour since the fancy began in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighths time, of which we have given an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to this hour) are to complain if they are restrained by laws, and kept from meeting or acting by publick constitutions?</p>
                  <p>For answer to this, it is the observation of all men;
<list>
                        <item>1. That private men must be checked rather then the publick Government violated.</item>
                        <item>2. That it is not safe or reasonable for any private opinion or fancy to controule or guide a publick authority.</item>
                        <item>3. That the King must either violate his own <hi>Conscience,</hi> and so not have the <hi>liberty</hi> of it, which they insist on for themselves, or else check their pretences of theirs.</item>
                        <item>4. That they were never satisfied with any thing that was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them; he that allowed them a little, doth but give them a <hi>power to take more;</hi> Could all the late Kings concessions keep them from his blood? first its Liberty, but at last it is a Warr: they are a party not to be gained by Obligations.</item>

5. That neither <hi>Scotland</hi> nor <hi>England</hi> had an houres peace or quiet since <hi>Knox</hi> set footing in the one, or they who had conferred notes with him in the other; but that blood, rapine, violence, malice, animosities, and plots have been the attendants of the good old cause since it was in the cradle.</item>
                        <item>6. That the Law must not be ruled by a faction, and yet that the question is now whether they who overthrowed the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly may now controule, and they who raised a Warr against it may be free from it in peace.</item>
                        <item>7. That the indulging of men because they are many, is rather an encouragement to <hi>Villany,</hi> then a provision for <hi>tenderness.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>8. That to ask liberty of Conscience is to ask liberty to what they please, which they may call conscience; for who shall judge what is really Conscience, and what is really malice?</item>
                        <item>9. That to grant these people what they desire, is to allow the reason of the reason of their requests, and so at once to reward one injury, and justifie another.</item>
                        <item>10. That the late Warr begun with calling that <hi>Christian liberty</hi> which the Law calleth <hi>treason,</hi> that Religion which the Church calleth Schisme.</item>
                        <item>11. That no Oathes or Vowes but one to rebell can tye these people.</item>
                        <item>12. That they would never trust others with the least indulgence.</item>
                        <item>13. That they are a people that rather then submit, exposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; whose Addresses look like mutinies, and their Petitions like threats.</item>
                        <item>14. That the whole business and bustle is but a contest between a <hi>Law</hi> and a <hi>Faction.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now considering these things, we must conclude that either the Government must be again banished, or the Faction; that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King for upholding the Church according to Law must be an exile, or they for supporting Conventicles against the Law must be proscribed; and which is fittest, let the World judge.—</p>

            <p n="1">1. The first whereof was from the concernment of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the publick peace and welfare, and the great advantages men had from all Governments in general, and every <hi>English</hi> mans Interest under this Government in particular; which I ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily evaded with the maximes of a Commonwealth which possess more men then are publickly observed, and carry them to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, and weakening of all the rules, lawes and principles of Monarchy that are now extant in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second was from the great Obligations laid upon men to peace and obedience in great rules and examples, by Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity above all the Religions in the World, it being not the least part of its glory &amp; renown that it provides best for Government and obedience, for the security of Princes, and the peace of the people, of any perswasion under Heaven, is the Reverend person

instanced in many of its Theorems and principles, especially <hi>Rom. 13. a Pet.</hi> 2. to which I had my replies ready from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral discourses in justification of the late War, and the Kings death, <hi>still extant,</hi> and <hi>still someting mens dangerous and discontented thoughts:</hi> especially the sermons before the Parliament from 1641. to 1649.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third, and so much the <hi>more</hi> cogent argument (as <hi>Fear</hi> is more prevailing then <hi>Conscience)</hi> and <hi>a care of our selves,</hi> of more force with us then a sense of our <hi>duty,</hi> was the dreadful event of all attempts against Government, mentioned in Holy Scripture: which the good man urged with much <hi>earnestness</hi> and <hi>power.</hi> As, <hi>Had Zimri peace that flew his Master?</hi> Can a man <hi>touch the Lords Annointed, and be guiltless? My Son fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them who are given to change: for their calamity shall arise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruine of them both? Whosoever loveth Rebellion, a cruel Messenger shall be sent unto him. Curse not the King, no not in thy thought; for a Bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</hi> The terrour of which words was yet much allayed by the immunity and indulgence we already had, and might alwaies expect; only one day considering with my self that the events and issues of things in the World were exactly correspondent with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies and predictions in the Scripture; that Heaven and Earth might pass away, and the Government of the Creation be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not one jot or title of the Word of God should fall to the ground: I resumed the last argument, examined those say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Scriptures aforementioned, comparing them with what happened upon that occasion in the World, and particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected such Memoires and observations of that nature as occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>English</hi> Nation from the time of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerer to our Age; out of which to my great astonishment I gathered this great Conclusion; (which I think it the interest of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent age and posterity to take notice of,) that as the Scriptures have foretold some 3000. years Since, so we find it true in every age that Government is so secured by the ordinance and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that all attempts against it have come to nought, and all open and secret conspiraties and plots have had only this remarkable issue, <hi>That they ended in the <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </note> Ancestors, by all the establishments that are as yet discovered to the World, when the Lord <hi>Cobbam,</hi> Sir <hi>VValter Rawleigb,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>VVilton,</hi> and others, some Protestants, some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, some Priests, some Lay-men, some upon discontent, <note place="margin">Cabala.</note> some for Conscience, some Noble-men, some Knights, some Gentlemen, and these backed by the <hi>Popes Bull,</hi> seconded by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> endeavoured to alter Religion, and change the Government; but with what fortune? why, their Plot is discovered, they themselves are apprehended, arraigned and condemned; <hi>VVatson, Clarke,</hi> and <hi>Brooke</hi> are executed, and the rest come to miserable ends within a while after.</p>
            <p>Yet the discontented will take no warning; for not long after <hi>Catesby, Percy, VVinter,</hi> Sir <hi>Everard Digby, Garnet,</hi> contrive to blow up the Royall Family, the Clergy, Nobility, and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> sitting in <hi>Parliament;</hi> they are encouraged by the <hi>Pope,</hi> set on by their own Ghostly Fathers, assisted from <hi>Spain,</hi> take an Oath of secresie, hire a convenient Room under the Parliament House, furnish it with Materials for the blow, as Powder, Faggots, Iron; the Villain is ready, his Candle and his Match light; but doth it succeed?

adjourned, and the very night before they were to sit, a Letter must be sent from one of the Conspirators to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> to save himself; yet the Court understood not the Letter, —but the King laying hold upon some odde expressions as this, <hi>There is no danger as soon as the Letter is burned, &amp;c.</hi> ordereth a more diligent search; the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house is found, 36. Barrels of Pouder are discovered, <hi>Faux</hi> that should have fired them is apprehended; the other Catholiques that made the Hunting match to surprize the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> are amazed at the discovery, and commit Outrages, are pursued by the high Sheriffes of <hi>Warwick</hi> and <hi>Worcestershire; Catesby</hi> and <hi>Piercy</hi> are slain, the rest are hanged, drawn and quartered, several Lords are fined; the Government is firmely setled, the Oath of Allegiance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised; two thirds of Papists Estates are forfeited to the King; most severe Lawes are made against the Papists, who lye under the dismal consequences of this treason to this day.</p>

the ill humour of the Nation meets in Parliament as in the Common-Shore, where some would reforme Religion, others would reforme Grievances, all would embroyle the State; the King parts with his most faithful Councellours; it becomes dangerous to serve him; he gives away his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, the <hi>Tower,</hi> the Militia of <hi>London,</hi> a power to the Parliament to sit as long as they pleased, suffers the <hi>Scots</hi> to rage and domineer; leaves the City, —the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is up against him for Religion, Law, Liberty, and the removal of ill Councellors; the Treasure, the Magazines and Militia is in his enemies hands, with whom yet he contested four or five years. When they prevailed, they seized on the whole Kingdome, imprison the King, defeat all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for his release, and at last put him to death, reduce his three Kingdomes under their Tyranny, Banish all his Family; and notwithstanding all forreign assistance, all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours at home, all the resolutions of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> with thirty thousand men to restore his Son at several times, as 1649. 1650. 1651. 1654. 1655. 1657. 1658. they settle first a Commonwealth, then a Protector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; the first Protector carryeth all before him, dieth a natural death, and succeeded by his Son, <hi>Credimus esse deos?</hi> And now you will say Treason prospereth, and Rebellion thrives, —but alas! nothing less; the first party is divided into <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> they are first jealous of one another; the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Officers are displaced, as <hi>Essex, &amp;c.</hi> they plot against one another in the House; the Old Officers fall off, the City of <hi>London</hi> and the old Puritans revolt, close with the Kings party for peace, —Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> marcheth in order to that peace in the head of 30000 men. <hi>Waller, Brown,</hi> and <hi>Massey,</hi> correspond with him; the Ministers preach against the present Proceedings; the <hi>Scotch</hi> stand by the K.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100061:47"/>
they watch the opportunity of his death, and with the countenance of the people lay aside his Son and Interest; they Quarrel among themselves, call in General <hi>MONK,</hi> who suppresseth them all, makes way for his most Excellent Majesty, —and puts a period to twenty years Treason: what was the effect of all these Treasons? was it Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Religion? No, some three hundred thousand Soules perish; an hundred Millions of Treasure is spent; —some five thousand Families are undone, the principal men are brought to shameful ends; —some eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand persons are ruined by publick faith, King and Bishops Lands; <hi>Vane</hi> glozeth, but dieth on a Scaffold; <hi>Pym</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheth the Parliament, but ends his dayes miserably; <hi>Hampden</hi> takes Armes, but falleth on that place where he first Rebelled; <hi>Lenthal</hi> Collogues, but dieth in much hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> his Excellent History.</note> and trouble of Conscience; <hi>Cromwell, Ireton, Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Scot, Carew,</hi> and others domineer, but are hanged, drawn and quartered, and set up, to assure the World that the punishment of <hi>Treason may be slow, but is very sure, and that a Rebell labours in vaine:</hi> The late Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasers lived nobly, and now begge their Bread; the approving, ejecting, and sequestring Ministers, are now si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced themselves; the Church Government is most firmly setled; the tender-Conscienced are more closely held in; and the Reformation it self become a by-word and an hissing among all Nations; <hi>Argile</hi> and <hi>Warreston</hi> had their time, and now in the place of Traytors, scattered up and down in several places of their Country. —</p>

whatsoever; they agree upon such rules, maximes and Principles as suited with most mens humours; they pray'd and preached themselves to very great resolutions, and all this very closely; upon Sunday <hi>Twelfnight</hi> 1660. they continue at their exercise in <hi>Coleman</hi> street till late at night, when they arme themselves to attacque a secure City in the dead of night, being assured that one man should chase an hundred, and ten men a thousand; —but alas! do they promote their cause, or advance the Kingdome of Jesus Christ? nothing less, they are discovered by the Owner of the meeting house; yet they march through the City without controule; —but Sir <hi>Rich.

            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1662. when some severe Lawes were made against dissatisfied persons, and the Government grew towards a settlement, <hi>Tongue, Philips, Stubes, Sallows, Gibbs, Baker,</hi> and others lay a Plot to deliver themselves from those at <hi>Whitehall;</hi> they first set up a Councel of forty for satisfying all Interests, and reconciling all differences, and out of this Councel they chose another of 8. which was not to sit twice in any one place, to consider of Officers, Ammunition, Musters, and particular designes; upon whose dissolution the Plot was to begin, <hi>viz.</hi> to secure <hi>Windsor</hi> Castle by a Gunner there, and the <hi>Tower</hi> by a party following the Lords Mayors Coach late at night; to admit of <hi>Ludlow</hi> for General, to engage some of the Trained Bands, to spread abroad a rumour of a Popish Massacre; to buy up all the Armes that could be met with; to list their Country friends under the old Officers of the Army that were then scattered up and down; to set up a Magazine in <hi>Crutched</hi> Friers, and seize the City Magazine, to seize <hi>Whitehall</hi> by

the way of the Privy-Garden; the General and Sir <hi>Rich. Brown</hi> being beforehand dispatched, to set up the old Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Kingdome of Jesus Christ: But is any of these things done? or were not these men betrayed by their own brethren, <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Riggs?</hi> hanged, drawn and quartered by the Common Hangman, and made a prey for the Foules of the aire, rotting upon the face of the Earth: are not their Families undone; and their parties under more severe Lawes and confinements to this day, their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty lost, their meetings dispersed, and all his Majesties Indulgence towards them forfeited?—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1663. Yet some <hi>Anabaptists</hi> taking advantage of some generall discontents, lay a Plot in the Bishoprick of <hi>Durham</hi> in <hi>March.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. To reconcile all their Brethren of different perswasions.</p>
