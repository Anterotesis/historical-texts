            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great deſire I have to ſee you happy both here and hereafter enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth me to do all that is in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for the promotion both of your Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal Intereſt. It has pleaſed God to give you a fair Portion of Worldly Goods, and a very large ſhare of Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Endowments, whereby you are put into a Capacity of providing for your ſelf both in this World and that which is to come. Your onely care therefore muſt be to employ theſe good Gifts of God to his Glory, and the Salvation of your own Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57502:3"/>
'Tis Religion onely, Dear Sir, which can carry you ſafe through this Valley of Tears, and can at laſt advance you into that place where all Tears ſhall be wip'd from your Eyes. 'Tis this alone which will make you the love of Men and Angels, nay, and what is infinitely more valuable, of God himſelf. In fine, it is this alone which can make this preſent Liſe eaſie and pleaſant, and ſecure you from Eternal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in a Life after this.</p>
            <p>Let Religion therefore, Dear Sir, be your firſt and early care, that ſo you may be wiſe betimes, and avoid thoſe Follies which too commonly attend the young Gentlemen of this Age. You are juſt now entring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that vaſt Stage the World, you have Good and Evil ſet before you, and the Eyes of all Men are upon you to ſee what manner of Choice you will make. Your preſent and future Happineſs is at ſtake, and therefore it highly concerns you to
<pb facs="tcp:57502:3"/>
make ſuch a Choice as you may never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after have cauſe to repent of.</p>
            <p>You have had the advantage of a Sober and Religious Education from your very Gradle, and the Examples of as good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as ever any Child was bleſt with. Your Deceas'd Father, whoſe Memory will live as long as Piety and Vertue are Sacred here on Earth, was an admirable Pattern of unblemiſh'd Goodneſs: And your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Mother is ſtill, God be thanked, a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Pattern of all that is Vertuous and Praiſe-worthy.</p>
            <p>What then will you be able to ſay for your ſelf if you degenerate from ſuch Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Progenitors? What Excuſes will you be able to make even to this World if you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their expectations by becoming the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Son of Two ſuch Incomparable Parents? But alaſs! There is ſtill a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion which is infinitely more weighty, and that is, What will you be able to plead for
<pb facs="tcp:57502:4"/>
your ſelf at the great Day of Judgment, if you have behav'd your ſelf ſo wickedly here, that even your Father and Mother muſt riſe up and condemn you?</p>
            <p>But I am perſwaded better things of you, and cannot give my ſelf leave to think you will ever be a Diſgrace to your Worthy Family. You have hitherto given us great hopes of ſeeing your Father again alive in you. I beſeech God of his Infinite Mercy to preſerve you in all Vertue and Goodneſs, and to make you a Great and Glorious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of doing good here on Earth.</p>
            <p>Having told you that Religion is the greateſt wiſedom, or, as the wiſe man ſpeaks, the beginning of wiſedom, I muſt now tell you that the beginning of all Religion is the acknowledgment of God, the owning of a Supreme Power who made us and every thing that has been made from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World out of nothing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57502:4"/>
This great and fundamental Truth muſt be neceſſarily well eſtabliſh'd in us before we can come to any ſuch thing as Religion. For as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>He that cometh to God must believe that he is.</hi> You cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore better imploy your time than in reading ſuch Treatiſes as ſerve to make out this weighty Truth. Such are the preſent Arch-Biſhops Sermon concerning <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> Dr. <hi>Barrows</hi> Sermons on the firſt Article of the <hi>Creed,</hi> and <hi>Grotius de Veritate Chriſtianae Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionis;</hi> any one of which Three will ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſatisfie any unprejudic'd Man who has not made his reaſon a Slave to his paſſions.</p>
            <p>After having named theſe great Men, I know not how to adviſe you to read the following Poem of my own. I can only recommend it to your Reading when you are more inclin'd to read Verſe than Proſe. And I begg of you, if you find any thing in it that you think well ſaid, not to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb facs="tcp:57502:5"/>
it to me but to thoſe great Men whom I nam'd but now, whoſe Works I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſcrib'd to their Authors great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
            <p>If this ſmall piece ſhall contribute any thing towards the confirming you in the belief of a Godhead, I ſhall think my time vvell ſpent in Writing it. If not, I ſhall hovvever have this to comfort me, that I vvrote it vvith a ſincere deſign to do you good, and to performe the Office that I ovve to you of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I wrote this Poem I deſign'd to have put all the Articles of our Chriſtian Faith into Verſe, that ſo I might entice thoſe Men to look upon a Book of Poetry, who have not fixedneſs and ſolidity enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the many Excellent Treatiſes on this Subject in Proſe. And therefore I did intend to make uſe of common and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Arguments, thereby to make each Article as clear and plain as poſſibly I could.</p>
            <p>But conſidering with my ſelf that this would be a work of time, and would require great Learning and Induſtry I began to deſpair of ever compaſſing it, and therefore reſolved to let this Poem come out into the World by its ſelf, and try its fortune.</p>
            <p>I think I need not make any Apology for printing a Diſcourſe on this Subject. For if ever any thing of this Nature was neceſſary, it is certainly ſo now, When Men
<pb facs="tcp:57502:6"/>
are arriv'd to that pitch of Impudence and Prophaneneſs, that they think it a piece of Wit to deny the Being of a God, and to laugh at that which they cannot argue againſt: Or at leaſt, when Men live at ſuch a Licentious rate, that we may eaſily ſee they are like the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> Fool, and ſay in their hearts, <hi>There is no God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am therefore well ſatisfy'd that I made choice of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Subject, I only wiſh the Poem may be found wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it, and ſtrong enough to defend ſo Important a Truth.</p>
            <p>Many Reaſons I have for the publiſhing of it, which I think it may not be improper here to mention.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this, that there are many Copies of it gone abroad which are in danger of being ſent to the Preſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrected.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is, becauſe I know nothing of this Nature extant in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, I mean no particular Poem purpoſely wrote on this Subject.</p>
            <p>My laſt and main Reaſon is, becauſe ſome judicious Men have thought it not altogether unfit to do ſome good in the World.</p>
            <p>If it be well accepted of, and has its deſign'd effect I may perhaps be encourag'd to publiſh ſomething elſe of the ſame Nature. In the mean while, till I ſee what Fortune it has.</p>
