            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the ORPHANS of the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of <hi>London</hi> for the time being, by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Uſage and Cuſtom of the ſaid City, confirmed by ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſaved to them by the Statute of 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>Cay.</hi> 24. That enables the Fathers to appoint Guardians for their Children by Deed or Will, Have been and are Guardians to the Children of all Free-men of <hi>London,</hi> being Orphans, under the Age of One and twenty years, at the time of the Deceaſe of their Parents, till they attain ſuch Age; and hold a Court before themſelves for the good Government of the Eſtates and Perſons of ſuch Orphans. The Executor or Adminiſtrator of every Freeman, leaving any Orphan, by the ſaid Cuſtom is obliged on pain of Impriſonment, forthwith after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of the Free-man, to deliver into the ſaid Court upon Oath, a perfect Inventory of the Eſtate of ſuch Free-man, and within two Months after to pay into the Chamber of, <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> ſuch part thereof as ſhall belong to any Orphan, or to become bound to the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain of <hi>London,</hi> with Three ſufficient Sureties, Free men of <hi>London,</hi> for payment of the ſame at such time as the Orphan ſhall attain the Age of one and twenty years, be married, or die; and that in caſe any of the Security die or become inſolvent before the Money be paid, to bring in so many other good and ſfficient Sureties as the ſaid Court ſhould, accept and allow of to be Security for the Payment as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>The hardſhip of the ſaid Cuſtom, in relation to the Security required, rendred it difficult in all Orphans Caſes, and in moſt of them impoſſible to prevent their Eſtates being put into the Chamber of <hi>London.</hi> And there is now due from the City of <hi>London</hi> to about Fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of Orphans, whoſe Eſtates, ſince the Burning of <hi>London</hi> in the year 1666. and before the bringing of the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the ſaid City, purſuant to the ſaid Cuſtom; and by Proceſs and Compulſion of the ſaid Court of Orphans, and for want of Security, were paid into the ſaid Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> the Sum of 508314 <hi>li.</hi> 12 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> Principal Money, beſides Finding Money, the non-payment whereof hath reduced the greateſt part of the ſaid Orphans, their whole Fortunes being in the ſaid Chamber, to extream want and Miſery.</p>
            <p>This Honourable Houſe were pleaſed the laſt Seſſion, to order a Bill to be prepared and brought in by a Committee of the Houſe, for Relief of the Orphans, upon the Heads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-mentioned; which Bill was accordingly brought in, and twice read in the Houſe, and committed to a Committee of the whole Houſe, and once read there, and thereupon the Houſe Adjourned, and afterwards was Prorogued, and thereby the ſaid Bill abated.</p>
            <p>To Appropriate the City Lands towards payment of Four pounds <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> for ever, for every Hundred pounds of the Orphans principal Debt.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Duty of Trovage, or Weighing of Un-freemens Goods.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Duty or Water-bailage for Un-freemens Goods imported or exported to and from <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Outropers Office for Goods ſold by Out-cry or Auction in <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duty belonging to the Fifteen Cole-meeters of <hi>London</hi> after their Death.</p>
            <p>For Eight pence <hi>per</hi> Chaldron on all Coals imported to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For One Penny <hi>per</hi> Quarter on all Corn, Grain, Seed, Mault, Meal or Flower imported or brought to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For one Moiety of the Duties ariſing by Hackney-Coaches. All theſe with the City-Lands to be applyed for the Purpoſe aboveſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> For the Uſe of the ſaid Orphans.</p>
            <p>Since the ſaid Orphans are reduced to this Deplorable Condition without any default in themſelves, their Eſtates having been forced into the Chamber of the ſaid City by the Law of the Land, and not voluntarily paid in, and it not having been in their powers to prevent miſ-applying the ſame by the Perſons the Law had fixed to be their Guardians,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is humbly hoped, That the</hi> Parliament <hi>in commiſeration thereof, will by their</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Power <hi>provide ſuch</hi> Relief <hi>to the</hi> Diſtreſſed Orphans, <hi>that they may not remain ſo great</hi> Sufferers <hi>by their having yielded obedience to the known Laws of the Land.</hi>
