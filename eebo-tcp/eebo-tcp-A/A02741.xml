         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost lamentable it is to see
mens eager pursuit of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vanities, and their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
neglect, and contempt
of true saving grace, which
is <hi>durable riches.</hi> To which two, may
be fitly applyed that which was said of
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> (the two first Kings of
<hi>Israel) sc.</hi> that the one hath slaine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,
and the other tenne thousands: both
which arise chiefely (as I conceive) from
mens ignorance, or the want of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
of the worth and excellency of piety
<pb facs="tcp:4060:4"/>
and true feare of God, or saving grace.
For (as our Saviour said to the woman of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> Ioh. 4. 10.) <hi>If thou knewest
the gift of God, &amp;c.</hi> So if they knew
these gifts of God, in the true resplendent
nature of them; if men were but acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the worth, and excellency of this
precious, and golden commodity of true
saving grace, they would not <hi>labour</hi> so
immoderately for the <hi>meat that perisheth,</hi>
but for the <hi>meate that endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life</hi> (as our Saviour himselfe speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 29.) yea, they would not be so
<hi>cumbred</hi> (with <hi>Martha) about many
things,</hi> whilest, in the meane time, the
<hi>one thing needfull</hi> is neglected; but
rather (with <hi>Mary) choose the better
part, which should never be taken from
them, Luk.</hi> 10. 42. To this end, I at
first fastened my meditation upon this por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Scripture, and tooke into my seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consideration this clause of holy Writ,
yea, and have still fixed my saddest
thoughts upon this golden Counsell of our
blessed Saviour, wherein the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor
of heaven and earth doth give his
blessed advise to the sonnes of men, whom
hee generally findeth like the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:4060:4"/>
                     <hi>Laodicea, sc.</hi> wretched, and miserable
and poore, and blinde, and naked; now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all such, whom he findeth in this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and wretched condition, He propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this sweete and heavenly counsell and
direction (which is the ground of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
discourse) contained in the words of
this Text, <hi>Rev. 3. 18. I counsell thee
to buy of mee gold tryed in the fire,
that thou mayest be rich.</hi> Wherein our
Saviour directeth us unto the true riches
indeed, and commendeth unto us, the worth
and excellency of Himselfe, his merits, and
graces of his Spirit, that they are all of a
right precious nature, and of great worth
and value, even <hi>gold tryed in the fire,</hi>
and such as will truely enrich us unto life
eternall. In prosecuting of which Text, I
have runne this course, and endeavoured
to shew the great worth, and transcendent
excellency of true saving grace, that it is
most fitly resembled to Gold tryed in the
fire, yea, indeed to be farre preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it, and that in sundry respects; yea,
not only the worth and excellency of grace it
selfe, but also the admirable worth of such
as do enjoy this precious Iewell, that all such
are most excellent, and <hi>golden</hi> persons
<pb facs="tcp:4060:5"/>
indeed, as comming of <hi>golden</hi> parentage,
having a <hi>golden</hi> portion and inheritance,
and also <hi>golden</hi> attendants, having the
holy Angels of God daily to <hi>pitch their
Tents round about them,</hi> for their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Farther, by way of application, I have
earnestly pressed, and perswaded unto the
duty of examination, that wee should all
try, what metall our graces are made of;
whether they be of a right golden nature,
yea, or no. And because herein we are all
of us naturally backward, I have therefore
endeavoured to enforce the duty by sundry
Motives, drawne from the consideration
of the difficulty of the duty, the danger of
being mistaken, as also, the possibility of
performance, and comfort that will hereby
redound unto us, when the worke is once
throughly performed. And that we may
not bee deceived about it, nor gul'd with
Sathans devices, in a businesse of such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
I have therefore also endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to manifest and discover the true
markes and characters of this <hi>golden</hi>
metall; together with the comfortable,
and happy estate and condition of all such,
as doe enjoy this precious commodity.
2. I have endeavoured to prove, that all
<pb facs="tcp:4060:5"/>
such as have true grace, are absolutely, and
incomparably the richest persons in the
world; and that piety is the best, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
way to make us truly and spiritually
rich. So that, if there be any that are ready
to say; <hi>Who will shew us any good?</hi>
Let such come, and see the shortest, and yet
the surest way to get wealth, yea, <hi>durable
riches,</hi> and righteousnesse. Lastly, if any
be so farre wrought upon, as to cry out with
those in the Gospell, <hi>Lord, evermore give
us this bread,</hi> this wealth, this precious
treasure; I have therefore, in the last
place, endeavoured to discover the direct
meanes to obtaine it, and that is, Buying.
And the rather to encourage us, to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this happie bargaine for our soules;
I have here described the excellency of the
Chapman, that is readie to sell us this rare
commoditie of saving grace. Here you shall
also finde a description of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
requisite to the making up of this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with <hi>Christ.</hi> Here you shall finde the
price of true grace, and the great varietie
of such customers, as are readie (in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance)
to bargaine with this spirituall and
heavenly Chapman: Here have you the
summe and substance of this <hi>TREATISE.</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:4060:6"/>
Whereunto I have adjoyned another of like
argument; shewing the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the time that is spent in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
or in the use of the means to get grace;
which seemeth fitly annexed to the former
Treatise: for if true saving grace be a jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
of such worth; then time spent in the use
of the best meanes to get grace, must needs
be the best spent time: For how can any
(that earnestly thirst after saving grace)
spend their time better, then in diligent
attendance upon the Word of Gods grace,
which is <hi>able to build us up</hi> farther and
farther, and <hi>to give us an inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all them that are sanctified,</hi> as the
Apostle speaketh, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32? Oh how just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
may a man take up a lamentation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the general defect amongst men,
in the wofull mis-spending of their precious
time! Men doe even take care, how to passe
away that precious time, which is never to
be recalled, but of it selfe passeth away as
the most swift Ships. Now the desire of my
soule, is not onely to bewaile this dangerous
sinne of wasting and mis-spending of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
time; but also to doe my best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
to reform this generall and monstrous
abuse this way. To this end, I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb facs="tcp:4060:6"/>
to stop the streame, and to turne the
water into the right channell, by giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
for the right spending of our preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
time; and have earnestly laboured to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thus much, <hi>sc.</hi> That time spent in
Gods service, is absolutely and incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the best spent time; and therefore have
earnestly perswaded, that we should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begin to serve God betimes, even in our
youth, &amp;c. but also that we should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and abundant in the duties of Gods
worship and service, after we have once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.
Concerning all which, I have given
sundry motives and directions. Loe here
the summe and substance of the whole booke,
and of both these Treatises; which as they
seeme fitly united together; so being (upon
occasion) to look abroad in publike, they seem
to be most fitly Dedicated to you, the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull
Company, or bodie of the Company
of the mysterie of Mercers. To you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
(Right Worshipfull, the Master, and
Head of this beautifull and comely bodie,
consisting of great varietie of Worshipfull
and worthy members,) doe I offer and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
this my poore and unworthy present:
which (notwithstanding) if the manner of
handling, was correspondent to the matter
<pb facs="tcp:4060:7"/>
it selfe, I durst then presume to say, t'was
right worthy of you; though in respect of the
manner of illustration of them, I have just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fitly called unworthy. To you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are these fruits of my poore labours
dedicated, by whose encouragement, the
Author himselfe hath beene supported, and
better enabled to proceede in the worke of
his Ministery. Accept therefore, I pray
you, of this poore paper, as a publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
to the world, of my thankefull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of your noble favours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
me, and kinde and speciall respect
unto me. By perusall whereof, you may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
be encouraged to proceede in the good
worke, which you have begunne, so maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
importing, not onely my good in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but also the good of sundry others,
who will have cause (I hope) to blesse God
for you, that he hath beene pleased to make
you the worthy instruments of upholding
the meanes of grace among them; yea, and
to establish for their good, the spirituall
Market of their soules, that they may now
come and <hi>buy freely, bread, milke, and
wine, without money, and without
price,</hi> as the Prophet speaketh, <hi>Isa. 55. 1,
2.</hi> Yea, the desire of my soule is, that these
<pb facs="tcp:4060:7"/>
first fruits of my labours may taste and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
so sweetly in the palate of your soules,
that you may hereby see cause, never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
you of the pains which you have take,
and the cost which you have this way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended;
but may still be perswaded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
your loving respects towards me, and
your zeale to the cause of God, which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
greatly advanced and furthered by you,
and so discharge the trust committed to you
by that late famous, and admirably chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and worthy Gentleman, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard
Fishburne,</hi> who committed money to your
trust, to be both religiously and charitably
employed. Which trust, how faithfully you
have discharged, (as it is best knowne to
God, and to your owne consciences, which
are as so many thousand witnesses) so I my
selfe am not ignorant of your noble &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
proceedings; but out of my experience,
to my comfort, and your credit, am able
both to speake, and to write of your fidelitie
and liberalitie, which you are wont to use
in these cases: besides also, that I am well
acquainted with your dealings with others
besides my selfe, on this behalfe. Most glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore do I take hold on this opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to manifest unto the world, my thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb facs="tcp:4060:8"/>
acknowledgment of your speciall respect
to me, in this case, and of this your noble
courtesie. As the benefits therefore which
I have received from you are publike, and
manifest unto so many: so likewise doe I
desire, that my acknowledgement hereof
should not onely be reall and heartie, but
publike also. For I have not yet forgotten
(though so many yeares agoe) how freely
and kindely I was chosen by you, to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
in the fruits and pledges of your love,
after (with all diligence) you had sufficient
tryall, both of my sufficiency, and also of the
unblameablenesse of my life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as touching both which, I trust you
have ever since been fully satisfied. In most
gratefull manner also I doe acknowledge,
with what peace and quietnesse, for sundry
yeares together, I freely did partake in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he
fruits of your love towards me; neither was
I ever at any time sithence disturbed, or
molested by you; but rather most kindely
supported by you, against the molestation of
others; yea, and for the present, amidst the
dangers and difficulties, wherewith I am
not only pressed, but oppressed also, my chiefe
hope and expectation of reliefe in this case,
(next under God) is wholly from you; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:4060:8"/>
doe I well know what to doe, but mine
eyes are upon you; and not onely mine, but
also the eyes of sundry others, both in Citie,
and Countrey, are steadily fixed on you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
what the issue and event will be.
Goe on therefore nobly still, and with your
wisedome and undaunted courage, vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the cause in hand, and cleere those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and great encumbrances, which
are lately fallen upon the Rectorie (which
I do enjoy) and consequently, upon my selfe:
whereunto let these poore labours of mine
encourage you, together with the goodnesse
and amiable beautie of the cause it selfe.
For if true saving grace, be of such rare
worth and value; then surely the cost and
paines that is bestowed to uphold the means
of grace, must likewise needs be well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.
These Treatises were severall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
preached in the Countrey among the
people committed to my Charge: and good
reason me thinketh it is, that I should give
some speciall account of my labours to you,
from whose hands, I have received the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of my maintenance, and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly,
for more then seven yeares toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Which endeavours of mine, if plaine
and homely, are notwithstanding thus far
<pb facs="tcp:4060:9"/>
justly to be excused, namely, that they
were preached to a plaine Countrey people,
which though of good affection and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
towards pietie, (I hope) are yet but
of meane and small capacitie, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in the things of God. Besides, my
care hath ever beene, rather to speake to the
hid man of the heart, in a plaine way, then
tickle the eare with a neat discourse, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not understood, and therefore without
all benefit and profit. Besides, no marvell
if these Sermons want ornaments, when
the Anthour himselfe was scarce supplyed
with necessaries; the greatest part of my
meanes, at that time, being wholly taken
from me; so that some small pittance onely
of outward meanes was left me; though
God in his goodnesse hath graciously (by
your hands principally) provided for me.
This I propound, not onely by way of just
excuse, for these my impolished labours,
but also to preserve alive, and keepe awake
your pitie and compassion towards me, and
to stirre up your zealous care and diligence
in the cause of God, which seemeth some
way endangered: yea, hereby you shall deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engage a number of poore soules to pray
for you, when they perceive the constancie
<pb facs="tcp:4060:9"/>
of your love, towards both them, and me,
in supporting of me, by way of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that I may still impart the Word of
life among them, and goe on still to fulfill
the Ministery, which I have received of
the Lord <hi>IESUS.</hi> Thus leaving these
things to your grave and loving considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
I commend the booke unto your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and your Worships to the protection of
the Almightie, and both your selves, and
it, unto his blessing. I humbly take leave,
and rest</p>

chap. 1. 4. Iohn, to the seven Churches
of Asia:</hi> and unto each of these he directeth
(as from <hi>Christ</hi>) a severall Epistle.</p>
                  <p>Now the words which I have read, are part
of the Epistle written to the Church of <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cea;</hi>
which continueth from <hi>ver.</hi> 14. to the
end of the Chapter. The Epistle it selfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
of three parts.</p>
                  <p>1. A Proemium, or inscription of the
Epistle, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>
                  <p>2. A Narration, or subject matter of the
Epistle, unto <hi>ver.</hi> 22.</p>
                  <p>3. A Peroration, or conclusion, Verse
the last.</p>
                  <p>Againe, in the second part, or Narration,
we have three things.</p>
                  <p>1. A Reprehension, increpation, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurgation,
<hi>ver.</hi> 15. 16, 17.</p>
                  <p>2. An Exhortation, or direction, <hi>v.</hi> 18. 19.</p>
                  <p>3. A solemne promise, or protestation,
<hi>ver.</hi> 20. 21.</p>
                  <p>Now the words which I have read, are
part of the exhortation, or direction. And in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4060:11"/>
generall, they hold out our Saviours advise, or
Counsell to the Church, wherein he fitly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes,
severall remedies for all their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
a salve for every sore: They were <hi>wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and miserable, and poore, and blind, and naked.</hi>
Now in this verse wee have a remedy for all
these.</p>
                  <p>1. Here is gold, to enrich them.</p>
                  <p>2. White Rayment, to cover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse.</p>
                  <p>3. Eye salve, to anoint their eyes, that
they might see.</p>
                  <p>I intend to insist only upon the first of these,
which containeth a remedy for their poverty,
and wretchednesse. <hi>I counsell thee to buy of me
gold, tryed in the fire, that thou mayest bee rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words are the advise and counsell of
our blessed Saviour (the great Counsellor, <hi>Isa.</hi>
9. 6.) to this Church of <hi>Lao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>icea,</hi> and in them
to us also, and to all true Christians to the end
of the world.</p>
                  <p>Now (mee thinkes) in this I should have
every mans attention; for behold, wee have
here a Lecture of thrift, a way, nay the onely
way to be made truely rich: <hi>There bee many
that say, who will shew us any good, Psal.</hi> 4. 6?
Behold, here's for you <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> the
chiefest good, Gold, yea, <hi>Gold tried in the fire,</hi>
gold to enrich you; gold and better then
gold, <hi>durable riches,</hi> that which will make
you rich indeed, rich towards God, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
speakes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 21.</p>
                  <p>Now for the parts of the Text. Here is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4060:12"/>
direction to get a precious and excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,<note place="margin">Division &amp; parts of the Text.</note>
metaphorically set out unto us, under
the name of gold. Wherein we have more
particularly described. 1. The worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of it, <hi>gold tryed in the fire;</hi> that is, a
precious, rare, spirituall commoditie, which is
like <hi>gold tryed in the fire.</hi> 2. The meanes to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it, and that is, buying; it must be bought.
3. The Chapman of whom we must buy it,
and that is <hi>Christ, buy of me,</hi> saith our Saviour.
4. The end of buying, that thou mayest be
rich, which argueth still the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the commodity. And so you see the
parts of the Text, and the words divided.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">Explication</note> For the explication and sense of the
words. The words are metaphoricall; the
Chapman, the Commodity, the Bargaine, the
Profit, all is spirituall. 1. The Chapman is
<hi>Christ,</hi> even <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that sendeth the Epistle
to this Church, He is the Chapman. 2. The
commodities to be bought here, are the graces
of Gods Spirit, or (if you please) <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and the graces of his Spirit; that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
salvation; which are fitly compared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>gold tryed in the fire;</hi> and that in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
(as wee shall see by and by) The bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
or buying, is spirituall, and so are the
riches here mentioned, spirituall riches, such
as will make us rich towards God.</p>
                  <p>The words thus opened and explained,<note place="margin">3. Doct.</note> doe
hold out unto us these three Propositions, or
points of Instruction, or Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>1. That <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Doct.</note> and the saving graces
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4060:12"/>
of his Spirit, are fitly resembled and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
unto gold, yea pure gold, <hi>Gold tryed in
the fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That this gold,<note place="margin">2. Doct.</note> is the only meanes, to
make us spiritually, and truly rich.</p>
                  <p>3. That all that would have this precious
commodity,<note place="margin">3. Doct.</note> must buy it of <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, of the first of these, <hi>sc.</hi> this,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. That Christ and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving graces of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are fitly compared unto Gold, tried in the fire.</note> That
<hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> and his merits, together with the
saving graces of his Spirit, are fitly resembled
unto gold, yea, <hi>gold tryed in the fire.</hi> Hereupon
it is, that the Tabernacle and the Temple were
both so adorned with gold, because they were
the Types of our Saviour, and the graces of
his Spirit, <hi>Exod.</hi> 37. 6. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 48. There
was the Table of gold, and the Altar of gold,
and the Bowles, and the Tongs, and the
Snuffers, all of pure gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And why all
this, but to teach us, that <hi>Christ,</hi> and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of his Spirit, are fitly resembled to gold.
Marke the answer of <hi>Christ's</hi> Spouse, to the
daughters of <hi>Jerusalem, Cant.</hi> 5. when they
asked, <hi>What is thy beloved more than another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved?</hi>
observe her answer, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. <hi>My belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Ver. 11. <hi>His head is as the most fine gold,</hi>
He is like unto <hi>most fine gold, yea, gold tryed in
the fire.</hi> So the Church cloathed with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of <hi>Christ,</hi> and adorned with the graces of
his Spirit, is covered (as it were) with cloth of
gold, <hi>Vpon thy right hand did stand the Queene,
in gold of Ophyr,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 9.
that is, cloathed with <hi>Christ,</hi> and the graces of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4060:13"/>
his Spirit, which are pure and precious, like
the gold of <hi>Ophyr.</hi> And so againe, <hi>Ver.</hi> 13.
<hi>The Kings Daughter is all glorious within,</hi> (that
is, the Church is glorious in Gods account)
<hi>Her cloathing is of wrought gold;</hi> this is very
direct.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reasons of the poynt might be
many;<note place="margin">Reason.</note> I will but instance in some few of
many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>Gold tryed in the fire,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Precious, like gold.</note> is very precious, of
great worth and value: so is <hi>Christ,</hi> even in
his lowest estate, when he seemeth most despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,
and worthles; yet is he, even then,
most precious; <hi>disallowed indeed of men,</hi> but <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
of God,</hi> and precious, sayth the Apostle,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. and <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a
chiefe corner stone, elect, and precious;</hi> though
the <hi>Jewish</hi> builders rejected this Stone, yet
was he exceeding precious in Gods account.
And as <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe is precious, so are the
graces of his Spirit; such as wisdome, and
knowledge, and faith, and love, &amp;c. these are
precious jewels, and therefore fitly resembled
unto gold. See what the holy Ghost sayth of
Wisedome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 13, 14. <hi>Happie is the man
that findeth Wisdome, and the man that getteth
understanding: for the merchandise thereof, is
better then the merchandise of silver; and the
gaine thereof, is better then fine gold: shee is more
precious then Rubies, &amp;c.</hi> See here the precious
nature of spirituall, and heavenly Wisdome.
The like may be said of faith, and other graces.
Hence that phrase, of <hi>precious faith: To all that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4060:13"/>
have obtained like precious faith with us,</hi> sayth
the Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 1. If you aske, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
this grace is: He answereth, That the
<hi>tryall of our faith is much more precious then of
gold that perisheth,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Reason.</hi> Fit to pay debts, or keepe out of prison.</note> Gold is of especiall use to pay
debts, to keepe, or redeeme out of prison: so
are the merits and blood of <hi>Christ;</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
us from hell, and death: <hi>yee are bought
with a price,</hi> sayth the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20.
What price? not silver and gold, but <hi>with the
precious blood of Christ, as of a Lambe without
spot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Of him are yee in Christ
Jesus,</hi> sayth the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. <hi>Who of
God is made unto us, wisdome, and righteousnesse,
and sanctification, and redemption;</hi> O golden
Christ! by the helpe of whose merits, we pay
the Debts which we owe to our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
yea, by this gold are we redeemed, and
set at libertie from the prison of hell, and
from the bondage and slavery of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gold tryed in the fire,</hi> is very pure,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because pure, like gold.</note>
and cleane, there is no drosse left in it: so is
<hi>Christ</hi> pure, as well as precious: so are the
graces of Gods Spirit, true grace is pure grace,

it commandeth what the earth can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord:
so doe <hi>Christ,</hi> and his merits, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

He purchaseth Heaven for us, and in

So that <hi>Christ,</hi> and his merits, are in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect

an ornament indeed, and that of
great price, even in the esteeme and account
of God himselfe: observe it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3, 4. see
the Apostles direction to wives, how to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorne
themselves, with better ornaments, then

wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparell,</hi> that
is, costly apparell; these are poore ornaments;

what then? that we shall see, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>but the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

even the ornament of a meeke, and

of great price; loe, a man or womans chiefe
ornament! If we would (in stead of rich and

wrongs and injuries, as are offered unto us,
it would be a farre better, and a much cheaper
ornament, then gold, and silver, and all the

unto gold?<note place="margin">The worth, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of true grace.</note> This sheweth then the worth and

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:4060:16"/>
men usually account it; else our Saviour would
never have called it Gold, yea, <hi>gold tryed in the
fire.</hi> So that an heart full of saving grace, is
worth a purse full of precious gold; it is as
precious as gold, yea, much more precious
then the most fine gold. Thus much the wisest
<hi>Solomon,</hi> (that knew the worth of both) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
telleth us, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 14. where speaking
of wisdome, (that is, spirituall and heavenly

faith, <hi>It is much more precious then gold.</hi> Give
me leave to shew you the worth of true saving
grace, that it is more precious then the most
precious gold and silver in the world: and this
I will manifest in these sixe particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. Gold is but of a fading,<note place="margin">Grace better then gold.</note> perishing nature
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and condition, hence is that phrase of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>That the tryall of your faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Gold is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing, but grace is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and lasting.</note> 
                     <hi>being
much more precious, then gold that perisheth:</hi> but
on the contrary, Grace is that which <hi>endureth
unto everlasting life.</hi> Ioh. 6. 27. Hereupon the
wise man calleth it <hi>durable riches,</hi> Pro. 3. 18.
So that in this case, that of the Psalme may be
fitly applyed, <hi>Psal.</hi> 102. 26. <hi>They shall perish,</hi>
(that is, all sublunary things are of a perishing
condition,) <hi>but thou, O Lord,</hi> and thy saving
grace, <hi>shall endure even for ever.</hi> Riches, and
gold, and silver are very fickle, and uncertaine,
they doe often <hi>betake them to their wings, and
fly away, as an Eagle towards heaven,</hi> sayth the
Wise man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 5. And <hi>charge the rich, that
they trust not in uncertaine riches,</hi> sayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:4060:16"/>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. Riches, and gold, and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
are very uncertaine, but grace is very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
and lasting; it is that good part which
shall not be taken from him, or her, that hath
it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 42. Therefore true saving grace
is better then gold, even in this respect.</p>
                  <p>2. Gold and silver, can neither comfort <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
nor deliver him that hath it,<note place="margin">2. Grace is able to help in the day of wrath.</note> in the day of
Gods wrath: many do make gold their hope,
in this case, and trust in the multitude of their
riches, but they are all utterly deluded in this
case; see <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>I will bring distresse upon
men,</hi> sayth the text; yea but I have abundance
of gold and silver, (sayth the rich man) marke
now, what followeth even in the very next
verse, (as it were on purpose to prevent, and
blow away this vaine confidence) vers. 18.
<hi>Their silver and their gold, shall not be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them in the day of the Lords wrath; but the
whole Land shall be devoured by the fire of his jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie.</hi>
No, no, Riches availe not in the day
of wrath, but <hi>Righteousnesse onely delivereth
from death,</hi> as the Wise man hath told us long
agoe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 11. 4. True saving grace, will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord
both comfort in, and also deliverance
from the fury of Gods wrath. When the Lord
hath a purpose to bring an overflowing scourg
upon any Nation, or people; he hath a speciall
respect (not to the rich, and wealthy, but) to
such as are godly and religious; <hi>The Lord hath
chosen to himselfe the man that is godly,</hi> Psal. 4. 3.
He hath set such an one apart for his own use,
all such must have a <hi>marke set upon their fore-</hi>

store of gold and silver, and yet be hated and
abhorred of God for all that, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi>
but he that hath true saving grace, such
as faith, and love, and the feare of God, &amp;c.
hath ever speciall favour and acceptance with
God. It is an excellent speech of the Apostle
to this purpose, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 35. <hi>Of a truth I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that God is no respecter of persons; but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Nation,</hi> (not he that is rich, and full of
gold and silver, but) <hi>he that feareth God, and
worketh righteousnesse, is accepted with him.</hi>
See here, that righteousnesse, and the true feare
of God, are farre better then gold and silver
in this respect. Indeed, among men, riches
prevaile much, gold and silver are in great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme;
for men <hi>looke onely upon the outward
appearance;</hi> but the <hi>Lord seeth not as man seeth,</hi>
but <hi>beholdeth the heart,</hi> if that be well qualified,
there is hope of acceptance with God; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
all the gold and silver in the world
will not doe it. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 6. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Lastly,<note place="margin">Grace lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> A man may have great store of gold
and silver, and yet perish eternally, and loose
his soule for ever: but so cannot he doe, that
hath true saving grace, as faith, and such like,
and persevereth therein unto the end: <hi>He that
beleeveth shall never perish, but have everlasting
life,</hi> Ioh. 3. 16. As <hi>he that beleeveth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
alreadie;</hi> so he that truely beleeveth
shall never be condemned, but hath alreadie
<hi>passed from death to life.</hi> Oh the precious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of saving grace, in this regard, it saveth
the soule! <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. last. <hi>We are not of them that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:4060:17"/>
draw backe to perdition, but of them that beleeve
to the saving of the soule.</hi> What were a man
better, if he had all the gold and silver in the
world, if he loose his soule; according to that
of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. <hi>What is a man
profited if he should gaine the whole world, and
loose his own soule?</hi> as the rich Glutton, <hi>Luk.</hi>
16. and the Churle, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 19, 20. but God
sayd unto him, <hi>Thou foole, this night shall they
fetch away thy soule,</hi> and then what art thou
the better for all thy gold and silver, &amp;c? But
rather, <hi>giving all diligence, adde to thy faith, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
and to thy vertue, knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. for so an
<hi>entrance shall be made unto thee,</hi> exceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
<hi>into the everlasting kingdome of Jesus
Christ,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. with <hi>v.</hi> 11. Grace there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is farre better then gold also in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect;
it is able to save a soule from death, and
<hi>cover a multitude of sinnes, Jam.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Instruct.</hi> Gracious &amp; Religious people most excellent.</note> Is true saving grace so fitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled
unto gold? This sheweth the worth
and excellency of all true Christians; such as
have store of true saving grace, they are the
excellent upon earth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 3. In a word,
they are golden persons, they weare cloth of
gold for their apparell; their <hi>cloathing is of
wrought gold, Psal.</hi> 45. 13. they are even gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
persons. <hi>Job</hi> 23. 10. <hi>He knoweth the way
that I take, and when he hath tryed me, I shall
come forth like gold;</hi> golden <hi>Job!</hi> So that in
these cases, most true is that of <hi>Salomon, Prov:</hi>
12. 26. <hi>The righteous is more excellent then his
neighbour:</hi> I tell you, there is as much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4060:18"/>
as betweene gold and drosse; <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
119. <hi>Thou shalt cast away the wicked like drosse:</hi>
Drosse is scarce good enough for the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill,
when the gold is layd up in the chest.
So that in this case, it is evident, that every
godly poore man, is better then any ungodly
rich man whatsoever. See upon what ground
and warrant I speake it; <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 6. <hi>Better is
the poore, that walketh in his integritie, then he
that is perverse in his wayes, although he be rich:</hi>
there is as much difference betweene them, as
betweene the chaffe and the wheat, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3.
and <hi>what is the chaffe to the wheat?</hi> sayth the
Prophet, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 20. Yea, as betweene <hi>gold

though in the poore barren wildernesse; but
drossie <hi>Nabal,</hi> though in rich and plenteous
<hi>Carmel:</hi> drossie <hi>Dives,</hi> but golden, because
godly, <hi>Lazarus.</hi> By this we see, who are the
noblest and richest persons in the world, even
they that are most godly, and religious. Grace

Galathians! Gal.</hi> 3. 1. Here is the very
picture of all such, as preferre sinne, and
wealth, and the trash of this world, before
saving grace and the power of godlinesse,
looke upon the prophane worldlings that
were bidden to the mariage feast of the Kings
Sonne, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>They all with one consent,
began to make excuse,</hi> (they were all just of
one minde, they were resolved not one of
them to come at the feast,) the first said, <hi>I have
bought a peece of ground, and I must needs goe

and another said,<note place="margin">Folly of such as neglect to get grace.</note> 
                     <hi>I have bought five yoke of

<hi>I have maryed a Wife, and therefore I cannot

folly of these men, to preferre such vaine and
triviall things, before such a rare and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

are a thousand things that we preferre before
<hi>Christ,</hi> and grace, and therefore are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

all mightily to blame this way, we are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and <hi>cumbred about many things,</hi> when the

for revenge; another, for his lusts: and the
golden wedge of true saving grace, in the

meane time is wholly neglected. What would
you thinke of that man, that is all for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and nothing for the future? all for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
nothing for Winter? Here is the case of
all such as are wholly for the body, but not at
all for the soule: looke into the glasse of the
Gospell, and there yee shall see the picture of
such a foole set out to the full, by our blessed
Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. There was a rich man (and
therefore perhaps a wise man in his owne, and
the worlds account,) yea, he did not thinke to
spend all his time in getting, but at last, when
he thought he had enough, he resolved to bee
merry with it, and sucke the sweete of it,
<hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>He said unto his soule, soule, thou hast
goods layed up for many yeares, eate, drinke, and
be merry:</hi> here was 1. Wit, to get wealth.
2. Wit, to enjoy it, and sucke the sweete of
it: and yet marke what the Lords opinion
was of this man, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. But God said unto
him, <hi>Thou foole, this night shall thy soule be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of thee, and then what shall become of the
goods which thou hast provided?</hi> where was
his folly? surely in this, that he had spent all
his time to get wealth, in the neglect of his
soule, in the neglect and contempt of true and
saving grace, and therefore he was a most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
foole in the Lords account. Nay, what
shall we say of such then, as are so farre from
seeking grace, in the use of the meanes; that
they doe reject the meanes of grace, when it
is offered; and thrust it from them, and doe ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
despise and hate it: mark the condition of

<hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 155. <hi>Salvation is farre from the

So that he that regardeth not the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of God, is farre from salvation: a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing, if it be but duely considered: Oh
the wofull estate of all such! They doe judge
themselves unworthy of everlasting life. A
strange place we have to this purpose, <hi>Acts</hi>
13. 47. <hi>It was necessary, that the Word of God
should be first preached unto you; but since yee
thrust it from you, and doe judge your selves
unworthy of everlasting life; behold, we turne
to the Gentiles.</hi> So that here we see plainely,
that they that have the Word of God preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the meanes of grace offered, and yet
reject it, and thrust it from them, they doe
judge themselves unworthy of everlasting
life, and at last, the meanes shall be taken from
them: yea, the estate of these men is so fearefull,
and lamentable; that had I the tongue of men,

could never set it out to the full: see the inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible

                  <p>2. Some markes, to direct us in this tryall.</p>
                  <p>1. The Motives that may perswade us, to
this exact tryall and examination of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
are principally these foure.</p>
                  <p>1. The difficulty of the worke.</p>
                  <p>2. The danger of being mistaken.</p>
                  <p>3. The possibility of prevaileing.</p>
                  <p>4. The comfort that will redound to a
man, when the worke is once throughly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>And first for the difficultie of the worke,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Motive</hi> 1. Toperswade us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have true grace, sc. the difficulty. All sorts of men apt to be deceived in judging in this case.</note>
wee had need to use all diligence to make sure
worke in this case, because it is a worke of
great difficulty, for a man to be assured in his
soule, that the graces which he hath, and the
gold he possesseth, are saving graces, and pure
gold, yea, or no: for if we looke into expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
we shall finde some men utterly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
in judging of the estates and condition
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:4060:25"/>
of their owne hearts; some judging better
of themselves then there is cause; and some
againe thinking worse of themselves then
they need to doe: so that of both these,
that of the Proverbe may be fitly verified:
<hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 7. <hi>There is that maketh himselfe
rich,</hi> (as if he had a whole purse full of gold)
<hi>and yet hath nothing: and there is againe,
that maketh himselfe poore</hi> (as if hee had no
gold at all) <hi>and yet hath great riches,</hi> the
one fearefull, and timorous, without cause;
and the other bold and confident, upon a
false ground: according to that of the
Wiseman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>A wiseman</hi> (that
is a godly man, and one that truely feareth
God) <hi>feareth, and departeth from evill.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The wicked deceived.</note>
Hee feareth, and hee doubteth; that his
estate is not so good, as all this while hee
hath taken it to bee; and thereupon hee
like a wise man, taketh occasion, more
and more to depart from evill: he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and <hi>maketh straight steps to his feet,
Hebrewes</hi> 12. 13. But the foole, (that is
the prophane person, the beggar, that is
utterly destitute of true <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aving grace, that
hath not so much as one peece of true
gold in his heart) rageth, and is confident;
he rageth, and hee rayleth, and hee swag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth,
and yet hee is confident, hee shall
goe to heaven, as soone as the best of
them all; for thus hee reasoneth for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
I confesse, I speake amisse many times,
I speake idlely, and wantonly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:4060:26"/>
and sweare sometimes, when
I am angry, and now and then, I doe
that which is naught; but I thanke God,
I have as good an heart towards God, as
the best of them all, therein I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:
so this man is utterly deceived in
judging of the state and condition of his
heart towards God. So that yee see the
worke is exceeding difficult: yea, see an
experiment of this, in this Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,
Revelations</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Godly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in thinking he hath no grace, when indeed hee hath.</note> what she thought of
her selfe, is evident, <hi>Verse 17. Because thou
sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods,
and have need of nothing; and knowest not
that thou art wretched, and miserable, and
poore, and blinde, and naked:</hi> this is the
condition of many a poore soule in the
world. On the other side, many an one
thinketh farre worse of himselfe, then there
is cause: how many a sincere heart doth
deepely charge it selfe with hypocrisie, and
thinketh himselfe to be a very beggar, or a
bankrupt, in respect of any gold of true
grace? None so apt to complaine of the
want of true grace, as hee that hath the
greatest measure, at least, he that hath good
store in sincerity. And the reason of this
difficulty, is partly the devils cunning,
and partly the deceitfulnesse of our owne
hearts; these are two notable juglers, and
they often concurre, to deceive all sorts of
people in this case.</p>
                  <p>Besides, grace is a very secret thing,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:4060:26"/>
it is very rare and precious;<note place="margin">Grace a Treasure, hid in the field.</note> he is a man
of a thousand that hath it: Saint <hi>Peter</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it, <hi>The hid man of the heart, 1 Peter</hi> 3. 4.
And <hi>a treasure hid in the field, Matth.</hi> 13. 44.
Gold while it is in the Oare, is not so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerned, untill it bee melted; so is true
grace: but corruption is manifest (especially
to such as have true saving grace) therefore
saith the Apostle, <hi>Galathians</hi> 5. 19. <hi>The
workes of the flesh are manifest.</hi> But when
hee speakes of the fruits of the Spirit,
<hi>verse</hi> 22. hee saith no such thing of their
manifestation, but onely describeth what
they are. So that an humble Christian,
especially in case of temptation, or some
spirituall desertion, hath such an eye to his
corruptions, is so intent upon them, that he
discerneth not the worke of grace in his
owne heart, which to the judicious eye of
another, is very manifest; hee seeth so
great an heape of Chaffe in his soule, that
hee thinketh the graine of true grace is
wholly absent, because it is <hi>hidden;</hi> hee
seeth such a great heape of Ashes in his
heart, that hee thinketh the fire of true
grace is utterly extinguished, and gone.
See an experiment of both these, in the
<hi>Pharisee,</hi> and the <hi>Publican, Luke</hi> 18. 11.
&amp;c. what a rich man was hee in his owne
conceit? But the <hi>Publican,</hi> how poore
was he in his owne opinion? he could see
in himselfe nothing but s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and therefore hee cryeth out, <hi>ver. 13.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:4060:27"/>
ô God, bee mercifull to mee a sinner:</hi> as if
hee had said, ô Lord, I am a sinner, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
grievous sinner, nothing but a very
lumpe of sinne, a fardle of corruption,
and if thou bee not mercifull unto mee,
I shall perish for ever. But what is the
opinion of our Saviour as touching both
these? that yee shall see, <hi>verse</hi> 14. <hi>I tell
you; this man</hi> (that is the <hi>Publican) went
downe to his house, justified rather than the
other,</hi> that is, but not the other. Besides,
there is another thing that maketh it so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
difficult,<note place="margin">Much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit grace in the world</note> that is, that there is
such a deale of counterfeit grace in the
world; as yee know there is much coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
gold in the world, and that so like
true gold, that it cannot be discerned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
it come to bee melted: so there is a
great deale of counterfeit knowledge, and
faith, and obedience, which cannot be well
discerned, untill it come to the melting, in
the fire of affliction: the Formalist com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
so neare to the state of grace, that he
is tryed onely in time of temptation, as
our Saviour intimateth: <hi>Matthew</hi> 13. 21.
<hi>For when tribulation, or persecution ariseth
because of the Word, by and by hee is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi>
yea; this is the only way to try them,
as the Lord himselfe seemeth to intimate,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 7. <hi>Behold, I will melt them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Melting, the chiefe meanes to discerne which is the true gold.</note> 
                     <hi>and
try them, for how shall I doe for the daughter
of my people?</hi> I will try them, by melting
of them. If wee see a serving man follow
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:4060:27"/>
two Gentlemen, it is hard to say, whose
man hee is, untill they part: so, while
the Gospell and prosperity goe together, it
is hard to know, which of these we serve,
untill they part, as in time of persecution;
then hee that cleaveth to a naked <hi>Christ,</hi> a
naked persecuted Gospell, hee is the man
that hath true grace indeed. This maketh
it to bee so exceeding difficult, for a man
to be sure that he hath true grace, because
there is so much counterfeit grace, and
Copper-gold in the world. There is a
knowledge that puffeth up, which a man
may have in abundance, and yet be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
charity, and saving grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2.
Counterfeit faith, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had,
<hi>Acts</hi> 8. and yet an hypocrite. Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
sorrow for sinne, and repentance, such
as <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi>
had, and yet was but the sorrow of the
world, causing death. And so for love,<note place="margin">Some kinde of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out true grace.</note>
and feare, and joy, and the like. Yea,
(which is most strange) it is possible for a
man to have a kinde of integrity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
and yet bee destitute of true sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
grace, for all that, as <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> before his conversion. 1. For <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi>
when God told him, that <hi>hee was
but a dead man, because of Sarah, because
shee was another mans wife:</hi> what saith he to
God in that case? <hi>Genesis</hi> 20. 5. <hi>In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of my heart, and Innocencie of my
hands have I done this;</hi> yea, the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:4060:28"/>
granteth, it <hi>verse</hi> 6. <hi>Yea, I know, that
thou didst this, in the integrity of thy heart,</hi>
that is, his heart was upright thus farre,
that what hee did, hee did it ignorantly,
and through mistake; for hee confessed,
that hee knew adultery to bee so hainous
a sinne, that hee would not have taken her,
if hee had knowne shee had beene <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
wife: but indeed, <hi>Abraham</hi> was
chiefely to blame, in saying, at best by way
of concealement, that <hi>She was his Sister.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So, see what <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe,
<hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1. <hi>I have lived in all good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
untill this day.</hi> How could that be,
considering that hee had beene such a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
persecutor, and one that even <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
out threatnings, and slaughter against
the servants of God?</hi> Yes sure: because,
alas! all this hee <hi>did it ignorantly, in unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe,</hi>
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. Hee did not know them to
be the Saints of God, but he thought them
to bee a <hi>Sect, that was every where</hi> persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and <hi>spoken against;</hi> and therefore hee
thought it was his duty, to doe what hee
did in that case, as appeareth, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9.
<hi>I also my selfe thought that I ought to doe many
things contrary to the Name of Iesus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;</hi>
so that thus far his heart was alwayes
upright, that he thought, even in persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
and kil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ing the Saints, that <hi>hee did
God service,</hi> as our Saviour foretold, <hi>Iohn</hi>
16. 3. And therefore in this regard also it
must need be exceeding difficult, for a man
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:4060:28"/>
to be sure his gold is good metall, &amp; that his
grace is true, and it is easie to be mistaken.
And this is the first Motive to perswade us
to this examination, in regard of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie;
which I have at large manifested
unto you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Motive.</hi> The danger of being mistaken.</note> The second Motive that may
perswade us, to this diligent search, and
examination, is, the danger of being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in this case. If a man be mistaken
in a trifle, in a small piece of silver, a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of small moment, he careth not for it:
but for a man to be mistaken in a great
piece of gold, that is dangerous; much
more, if a man turne all his wealth into
gold, and then be cozened in that, he is
utterly undone. Now here is our very
case, all our spirituall wealth, and riches,
doth consist in the gold of our graces;
and therefore if they be counterfeit, a man
is utterly undone for ever; for a man that
is deceived with counterfeit gold, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth
a double danger especially; first,
That it will not pay, nor passe currant in
purchase, and bargaining, and so he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
his purchase. I remember what is
said of the silver, that <hi>Abraham</hi> weighed
to <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> whereby he purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the field and cave of <hi>Machpelah, Gen.</hi>
23. 16. <hi>Abraham</hi> (before witnesse) <hi>weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him the silver, even foure hundred Shekels
of silver, currant money with the Merchants.</hi>
So our gold of graces, must be good gold,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:4060:29"/>
of good weight; else they will not passe
currant in bargaining, which is a great
losse. But this is not all. For secondly,
a man that hath counterfeit gold, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be called in question about it, how he
came by it, and perhaps he had it of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
parties, and they strangers too, and so
hee may be accused of counterfeiting the
Kings coyne, and loose his eares, yea, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
his life, and soule too, in this case.
O what a wofull thing will it be, when a
man cometh at the last day (as he thinkes)
with a purse full of gold, that is, an heart
full of grace, and it prove false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit!
he is then undone for ever. See how
some will shew their gold at the last day,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 21, 22. Lord, Lord, here is my
gold, here is my grace. He will say; <hi>Depart
from me, I know ye not,</hi> I allow not of your
grace, your gold is counterfeit; here is a
wofull estate.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Motive.</hi> The possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</note> because as the dutie is difficult,
and it is a dangerous thing to be mistaken:
so (on the other side) notwithstanding the
difficultie, yet it is possible, for a man that
hath true grace, to be sure that he hath it.
Though it be very difficult, to know which
gold is good, and will passe for currant, it
is not impossible; else God would never
require this dutie, of searching of us, under
the time of the Gospell, if it were a thing
altogether impossible; <hi>Let every man prove
his owne worke, Gal.</hi> 6. 4. And <hi>let a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:4060:29"/>
himselfe, (sc.</hi> whether he have any
true saving grace, yea, or no, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.
28.) This appeareth also by experience,
and the examples of Gods Saints, that have
beene rich towards God, they have beene
assured upon good grounds, that their gold
was good, their graces were such as did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
salvation. <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> and others, were assured that they
had saving grace, that they were <hi>filled with
the fruits of Righteousnesse,</hi> and that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the great store of counterfeit
gold, that was in the world in their dayes,
yet they were sure, that theirs was currant:
and so may we, by the same priviledge of
mercy, be as well as they. Besides, the truth
of this appeareth farther; because it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a Christian to be assured of sundry
other, as great matters as this, such as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
vocation, justification, adoption,
and redemption, and heaven it selfe.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> It is possible for a man to be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

                        </gap> be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of our vocation, &amp; election.</note> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.
4. <hi>Knowing, brethren, beloved, your election
of God.</hi> They knew they were elected and
become <hi>vessels of mercy:</hi> and how did they
come by this assurance? surely not by any
speciall revelation onely, but by an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
meanes, <hi>sc.</hi> their effectuall vocation, and
yeelding sincere and heartie obedience unto
the Gospel; for so it followeth, <hi>Ver.</hi> 5. <hi>For
our Gospel came not unto you, in word onely,
but in power, and in the holy Ghost:</hi> they had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:4060:30"/>
                     <hi>obeyed from the heart the Gospel that was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
unto them,</hi> and by that they might know
they were elected. And why may not we
be assured of our election, upon the like
ground, as well as they? So, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12.
<hi>Put upon you (as the elect of God, holy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved)
bowels of mercy, humblenes of minde,
&amp;c.</hi> It is possible, for a man to be assured
that he is elected, and beloved of GOD.
How? surely, if he can finde those markes
of election (in himselfe,) which are there
manifested and expressed. So, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.
<hi>Give diligence, to make your calling and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sure.</hi> Where the Apostle sheweth, that if
we give diligence, it is possible for us to
be assured of our election. But how? Surely
by making our vocation sure, by the holy
fruits, and effects of it. So then, if a man
may be assured of his election, and that by
his effectuall calling and conversion: then
much more may a man be assured of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that they are sincere; of his spirituall
gold, &amp;c. that it is sound, and good, and
not counterfeit. He that may be assured of
his election, may, much more, be assured,
that he hath true saving grace in him, that
his gold is right, and pure, and not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reason. 2. Of our justification.</note> It is possible for a man to be
assured of his justification, and of the free
and full pardon, and forgivenes of all his
sinnes. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Being justified by faith,
we have peace with God.</hi> Yea, but were they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:4060:30"/>
assured of it? for they might be justified
(<hi>in foro Dei</hi>) and yet not know it? Yes,<note place="margin">Certitudo spei.</note>
they were assured of it, to their joy and
comfort, <hi>Ver. 2. And we rejoyce. in hope of the
glory of God.</hi> So, <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 24. <hi>Surely, shall
one say, in the Lord have I righteousnesse and
strength.</hi> So that a man may be assured of his
justification, much more, that his gold is
not counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reason. Because we may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of our Adoption.</note> A man may be assured of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
that God in <hi>Christ</hi> is his Father,
and that, notwithstanding all his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he is the deare childe of God, and in
speciall favour with him: I say, it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for a man to be assured of this, and out
of doubt, in this case of so great importance.
<hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Doubtlesse, thou art our Father,
though Abraham know us not, and Israel be
ignorant of us, yet thou art our Father.</hi> Ye see
how confidently they speake, they were out
of doubt of it; and so may we, as well as
they, by the testimony of Gods blessed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that neither can, nor will deceive us.
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>The Spirit (of God) it selfe bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
witnesse, with our spirit, that wee are the
children of God.</hi> And if a man may be assured
he is Gods childe; why should it not be
possible, for him to be sure, that the gold
of his saving graces, is sincere, and will not
deceive him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Reason.</hi> Because we may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> It is possible for a man to be
assured of his redemption, that even his soule
is washed in the blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and of his
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:4060:31"/>
interest in the great worke of <hi>Christs</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.<note place="margin">We may be assured of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note>
                     <hi>Iob</hi> was assured of his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that <hi>Christ</hi> was his living Redeemer,
<hi>Iob</hi> 19. 25. <hi>For I know that my Redeemer liveth,
and that he shall stand at the later day upon the
earth.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> was assured, that <hi>Christ</hi> was
his Redeemer, and that he gave himselfe for
him in particular, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>The life that I
now live, I live by the faith of the Sonne of God,
who loved me, and gave himselfe for me,</hi> sayth
the Apostle. If a man may be assured of his
redemption, much more that his graces are
sincere &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Reason.</hi> That when wee die wee shall goe to heaven.</note> A man may be assured, that when
he dieth, he shall goe to heaven: see what
the Apostle sayth, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>We know that
when this earthly house of our Tabernacle, shall
be dissolved, we have an house of God, not made
with hands, eternall in the heavens. (i. e.</hi>) We
know, that when these bodies of ours,
which are made of earth, shall turne to dust,
the soule shall goe to heaven, to that place
which <hi>Christ</hi> hath prepared for us. So the
Apostle S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>We know, that we
are translated from death to life,</hi> (wee are as
sure when we die, we shall goe to heaven)
But how? What? by revelation? No sure,
but <hi>because we love the brethren.</hi> He that is
assured that he loveth the brethren, may be
sure when he dieth, he shall goe to heaven;
much more, that he hath true grace.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Reason.</note> A man may be sure, that the
goodnesse and mercy of God, shall follow
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:4060:31"/>
him,<note place="margin">That Gods goodnesse and mercy shall follow us all our dayes.</note> all the dayes of his life; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
of his continuance in the state of
grace; much more, that his graces are sound
and sincere; <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 6. <hi>Surely, Goodnesse
and Mercy shall follow me all the dayes of my
life.</hi> He that can be assured of this, may be
much more sure, that the gold of his graces
are not counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>And so I come to the fourth,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Motive.</hi> The comfort that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the soule, when the worke is once throughly performed.</note> and the last
Motive, that may perswade us to this tryall,
<hi>sc.</hi> the comfort that will hereby redound
unto our soules, when the worke is once
throughly performed: <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Let every
one prove his owne worke,</hi> sayth the Apostle,
<hi>and then shall he have rejoycing in himselfe,
(sc.</hi> that his graces are sincere) <hi>and not in
another.</hi> A man that hath had his gold cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in question, and yet proveth sound, and
currant, oh it filleth him full of joy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.
Let this perswade us to try our
graces, that wee may partake of that joy
and comfort, which will hereby redound
unto us; which is (as the Apostle speakes,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.) <hi>A joy unspeakable, and full of
glory. A peace that passeth all understanding,
Phil.</hi> 4. 7. Let the expectation of this sweet
fruit of joy, which will accompany our
endeavours this way, make us fall to this
worke, of searching our selves with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.
O what a comfort to <hi>Hezechiah</hi>
(in that extremitie) that he was assured,
and durst appeale to God, that his heart was
upright! <hi>Isay</hi> 38. 3. <hi>Remember, Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:4060:32"/>
thee, how I have walked before thee, in
truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> So this also
supported <hi>Iob, Iob</hi> 23. 10. <hi>He knoweth the
way that I take; and when he hath tryed me,
I shall come out like gold:</hi> there was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that his graces were of a right golden
metall, though his friends conceived other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of him, and charged him deeply with
hypocrisie; yet he knew, that God knew
his graces were sound, and upright: oh let
us, in time, make the like search, and tryall
of our graces, that he did, that we may have
the like comfort, and ground of rejoycing,
that he had. So, this was the Apostles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at all times, whatsoever befell him, yet
he knew that he was truely gracious, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the testimony of our
conscience, that in simplicitie, and godly since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
not with fleshly wisdome, but by the grace
of God, we have had our conversation in the
world:</hi> A man that is assured, that he hath
an heart full of true saving grace, will have
more true comfort in it, and more solid joy,
then if he had a great chest full of gold.
An heart full of grace, will affoord farre
more joy, and comfort, then a purse full of
gold. And this is the last Motive, that may
perswade us to this tryall, and diligent exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
whether our grace be sincere, and
such as will not deceive us.</p>
                  <p>Now for the second generall poynt,<note place="margin">The Nature and Markes of true grace.</note> that
I propounded for the perfecting of this
poynt, <hi>sc.</hi> the Markes and Signes of true
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:4060:32"/>
grace; they are indeede many; but I will
keepe close to the Metaphor, which wee
have in hand, and give you some few, for
your satisfaction in this case.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Marke.</hi> True grace will make a mans face to shine in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition.</note> true and pure gold, <hi>gold tryed in
the fire,</hi> will shew the lustre and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
both in the fire, and water: so
true grace, will teach a man how to cary
himselfe in every estate and condition.
Here was the tryall of <hi>Pauls</hi> grace, gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<hi>Paul</hi> (after his conversion) in all estates,
<hi>Philippians</hi> 4. 11. <hi>I have learnd in what
estate soever I am, therewith to be content;
both to bee full, and to be hungry; to abound,
and to suffer need.</hi> Though it bee a more
blessed thing to give, rather then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive;
yet hee that hath true grace, is
skilfull in both, his face will shine in every
condition.</p>
                  <p>He that hath true grace, will manifest
it by his gracious cariage in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both in prosperity, and adversity; if
he be rich, hee is bountifull, and liberall, he
is <hi>Rich in good workes, and layeth up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a good foundation,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. If he
be poore, he sheweth his golden nature in
another kinde, in humble submitting to the
will of God, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe
what seemeth him good,</hi> said golden <hi>Ely,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 18. In his patience, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse,
he kisseth the rod, and thankes his
father, even for his love in correcting. He
is like a well cut Dye, every way square,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:4060:33"/>
which way soever ye cast it, cast it easily, it
will be square; cast it violently, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
square still: so will a gracious heart,
shew its puritie, in all estates, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.
Looke upon <hi>Job,</hi> in his twofold
condition, and yee shall finde him pure
gold, in both; looke upon his demeanour,
in the water of prosperity, when hee even
swome in Rivers of prosperity; oh how
bountifull was hee, how full of good
workes? <hi>Job</hi> 30. <hi>Chap.</hi> 31. By the Lords
owne testimony, <hi>A man that feared God, and
eschewed evill: none like him in all the earth,
Iob</hi> 1. 1. 7. What a gracious testimony from
God himselfe? Then looke upon him in the
fire of adversitie; rich <hi>Iob,</hi> bountifull and
liberall; poore <hi>Job,</hi> patient, and thankefull,
<hi>Iob</hi> 1. 21. <hi>The Lord hath given, and the Lord
hath taken, blessed be the Name of the Lord.</hi>
True it is, he shewed some drosse in the
melting; but looke upon him when he came
out of the fire, oh then he was pure gold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed!
this he was assured of while he was
melting, <hi>Iob</hi> 23. 10. <hi>He knoweth the way
that I take, and when he hath tryed me, I shall
come out like gold:</hi> golden <hi>Iob</hi> indeed, when
hee came out of the furnace of affliction.
But now the wicked, as they are but drosse,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 119. so they shew their drossie
nature in every estate: if they be rich and
wealthy, then they are proud, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and given to oppression, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
God, and trust in their wealth: and if
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:4060:33"/>
they be poore, then they <hi>steale, and take the
Name of the Lord in vaine, Pro.</hi> 30. 8, 9. They
are drosse still in every condition; the more
<hi>God</hi> melteth them, the worse they are: <hi>Why
should they be smitten any more, for they do fall
away more and more? Isa.</hi> 1. 5. See an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of this, in that close-hearted hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
<hi>Ahaz</hi> (for all his faire shewes) he did
shew himselfe but drosse, both in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and adversitie: the more he prospered,
the more he sinned: if he be victorious, he
ascribeth the victory to himselfe, and his
friends, and the gods of <hi>Damascus</hi> must be
sacrificed unto, and a patterne of a new
Altar must be fetched from thence, 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
16. 10. Well, if God take him in hand, and
begin to melt him in the fire of affliction,
he findeth him drosse still; so that hee was
forced at last to cast him away, and set a
marke upon him, for notorious drosse alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
that none should ever take him for
gold any more, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 28. 22. <hi>And in the time
of his distresse, he sinned yet more, against the
Lord. This is that King Ahaz:</hi> brand him up,
score him up, set a marke upon him for ever,
for most notorious d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>osse indeed; because,
the more hee was afflicted, the worse hee
was; the more hee was melted, the
more plainely hee appeared still to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a plaine lumpe of drosse. I pray
let us try our selves by this marke, if wee
can cary our selves aright in every estate,
it is a signe we are pure gold; if not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:4060:34"/>
have cause to suspect our selves, to bee but
drosse. Looke upon the golden Martyrs,
in all ages; see what pure gold they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
themselves, especially, in the fire of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction:
consider these golden Christians,
<hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 34. <hi>They suffered with joy, the
spoyling of their goods, knowing that they had
in heaven, a better, and a more enduring sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
wee glory in tribulation.</hi> Here was
bright shining gold indeed, <hi>gold tryed in the
fire,</hi> as it is in our Text.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Marke.</hi> True grace gotten by Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> Right currant gold, is that
which commeth from the right place, from
the Kings Minting house, and hath his
Majesties stampe upon it; when they
brought the Tribute money to <hi>Christ, Mat.</hi>
22. 20. he enquireth immediately, <hi>Whose
Image, or superscription hath it?</hi> and they tell
him, <hi>Caesar's:</hi> So look upon the gold of those
graces which thou hast, and seriously consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whence thou hadst them, and how
thou camest by them: Did they come from
the Minte of Gods Ordinance? Were they
begotten at first, and are they still nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in thee, by these meanes? Didst thou
get them, by prayer, and attending at the
postes of Wisedomes gates? then it is a
good s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gne, thy gold is good, thy graces
are sincere; because they are begotten, and
increased by the Word of Gods grace,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> sendeth them still
to the Minte, to get more grace, and to try
their graces. <hi>And now, brethren, I commend
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:4060:34"/>
you to God, and to the Word of his grace,
which is able to build you up farther, &amp;c.</hi>
And so for the Throne of grace, <hi>Hebr.</hi>
4. <hi>verse</hi> 16. <hi>Let us goe boldly to the Throne
of grace, whereby wee may finde mercy,
and grace, to helpe in time of need;</hi> I
pray let us try our graces by this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.
How did we come by our graces?
By what meanes were they begotten in
thee? And how are they nourished, if not
by these meanes? And it may be, thou canst
give no account how thou camest by them:
I begin straight to suspect them; for you
know it is suspicious, for a man to have
goods, and know not how he got them.
Consider thy faith then, Art thou sure it is
precious? Of the right stampe? More pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
then gold? Then sure it came from
the Minte, it was given thee from above,
<hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>To you it is given, not onely
to believe, but also suffer,</hi> &amp;c. If it be right
faith, it was begotten by the Word of faith;
<hi>Romans</hi> 10. 8. <hi>For faith commeth by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> But he
that boasts of his faith, and telleth me that
he hath beleeved ever since he could remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
as if the gold of faith, grew there by
nature; I would no more beleeve, he had
true faith, then I should thinke he said true,
that should boast, that he had a purse full
of gold, which came out of his purse bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
and grew there by nature. I pray
let us examine our selves by this mark, true
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:4060:35"/>
gold commeth from the Minte: and so doth
true grace, from the Minte of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances:
if it grew in thine heart by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or is begotten, and nourished in thy
heart by any other meanes, thou hast great
reason to suspect, that such gold is but
counterfeit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Marke.</hi> True grace is full weight, and will make a man univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall in his obedience.</note> 
                     <hi>Gold tryed in the fire,</hi> if it come
from the right Minte, is currant money
with the Merchants, As <hi>Abraham's</hi> silver
was, which hee weighed to <hi>Hephron</hi> the
<hi>Hittite, Genesis</hi> 23. 16. Now gold is not
currant with the Merchant, (though it
seeme pure for the matter) if it want
weight, and therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> weighed
his silver, before the people of <hi>Ephron:</hi> so
true grace is good weight, give it but the
allowance of the imperfection, in respect
of degrees, and it is full weight, in respect
of parts; both in regard of the subject,
wherein it is, and the object of it; weigh
it in the <hi>ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> and it
will be found weight; for hee that hath
true grace in every part, grace in the head,
or understanding facultie of the soule, and
grace in the heart, in the will, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
he is <hi>sanctified throughout,</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi>
5. 23. <hi>in his whole spirit, soule, and body;</hi>
so that true grace is universall. Now an
hypocrite, whose grace is but counterfeit,
whose gold is Copper, sheweth it selfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in one kinde or other. If he have a
little knowledge swimming in the braine,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4060:35"/>
and therefore is able to speake well, as if he
had grace; yet this worketh no reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the outward man, there it wanteth
weight; he is prophane still, he liveth in
the secret practise of some knowne ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
he hath some <hi>Rimmon,</hi> with <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;</hi>
some <hi>Delilah,</hi> with <hi>Sampson:</hi> but the
golden Christian, is universally gracious,
head, and heart, and life: as a child new
borne, hath all the members of a man,
though they be but weake, and it is long
before he can use them. Or if the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
have so much seeming goodnesse, to
gild over his outward behaviour, that he
seemeth to be a right golden Christian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
yet if it be not true grace, it refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
not the heart; whereas true <hi>grace pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth
the heart, Acts</hi> 15. 9. If God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to wash a man, he beginneth with the
heart, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Wash thy heart from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse,
ô Ierusalem:</hi> true grace washes, not
only the hands, but also the heart. Here
was <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his defects, if ye look
upon his outward profession, he is turned
Christian, he keepeth company with the
Christian Apostles, he was also baptized,
as a badge of Christian profession, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
where was the fault? Surely within: his
heart was unsound, and rotten, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
his gilded out side, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21.
<hi>Thine heart is not right in the sight of God;</hi>
And <hi>pray God, if it be possible, the thoughts
of thine heart, may be forgiven.</hi> He was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:4060:36"/>
but like a faire Aple, that was, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
rotten at core.</p>
                  <p>2. True grace is universall, and full
weight in respect of the object of it, that
is, it will cause a man to yeeld obedience to
all Gods Commandements. He that hath
true grace indeed, will desire, and <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in all things to live honestly, Heb.</hi> 13. 18.
But counterfeit grace is not currant, in this
regard; also, herein it wanteth weight, as
it did before; an hypocrite is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall
in his obedience, he is no good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
in this respect, hee doth but picke and
choose; some duties he liketh, but other he
careth not for; some sinnes he avoydeth,
but other he maketh no conscience of. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
<hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iehu</hi> together, and they
seeme, at first, to be both golden Kings, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
men, and couragious Magistrates; but
then againe, weigh their gold severally, in
the <hi>ballance of the Sanctuary,</hi> and then yee
shall finde, that <hi>Iehu's</hi> wanted weight.
First, looke upon <hi>Davids</hi> aime in his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and ye shall finde it universall, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 6. <hi>Then shall I not be confounded, when
I have respect to all thy Commandements:</hi> here
is downe weight.</p>
                  <p>But now weigh <hi>Iehu's</hi> gold, in the same
ballance, and yee shall easily perceive that
it was found too light; like <hi>Balthasar,
Daniel</hi> 5. observe it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. When
the Spirit of GOD had set out <hi>Jehu's</hi>
zeale to the full, and given him his allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:4060:36"/>
and all, yet he cryeth out still, that it
was too light, <hi>verse</hi> 31. <hi>But Iehu tooke no
heed to walke in the Law of the Lord with all
his heart; for he departed not from the sinnes
of Ieroboam;</hi> and therefore GOD giveth
him his temporall reward, <hi>sc.</hi> the thing
that he chiefely aimed at, <hi>sc.</hi> the kingdome
for himselfe, and his children for a time,
and so sendeth him packing.</p>
                  <p>Let us try our gold by this marke, let us
weigh it in the <hi>Ballance of the Sanctuary.</hi>
Doth our grace shew it selfe in every part?
Are we like the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 11. <hi>All
glorious,</hi> both within, and without? All
gracious, in heart, and life? Here is a good
signe our gold will passe currant, with the
Merchant, because it is full weight, in this
regard. Then againe, are we universall in
our obedience? Doe wee endeavour to
walke in all the Ordinances, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of God blamelesse? as was
said of <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luk.</hi> 1. 6.
Doe wee desire in all things to live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly?
Here is precious gold indeed, even
<hi>gold tryed in the fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Marke.</hi> True grace will abide the fiery try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, will make a man hold out in time of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.</note> True gold will abide the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tryall. Here is the true tryall of gold,
when it cometh to be melted: <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 7.
<hi>I will melt them, and try them, for what should
I doe for the daughter of my people?</hi> So that is
true grace, that holdeth out in the fire of
affliction; hence that phrase of the Apostle,
in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Beloved, thinke it not strange,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:4060:37"/>
concerning the fiery tryall, as if some strange
thing happened, but rejoyce rather,</hi> &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
here is the true tryall of your graces,
that they are of a right golden nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
This was <hi>Iobs</hi> comfort, <hi>Job</hi> 23. 10.
<hi>He knoweth the way that I take, and when he
hath tryed me, I shall come out like gold.</hi> O
golden <hi>Job,</hi> that was able to abide the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
tryall! So looke upon the Apostles in the
fiery tryall, when they were mocked, and
threatned, and imprisoned, yea, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously
scourged too, yet see how chearefull,
and constant they were, for all that? <hi>Acts</hi>
5. 40, 41. <hi>They departed from the presence of
the Councell, rejoycing, that they were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
worthy to suffer shame, for his Name.</hi>
Here was right <hi>gold, tryed in the fire;</hi> see
how bright they shine, when they newly
come out of the furnace. Of such a golden
temper was <hi>Paul:</hi> How couragious, and
undaunted in tribulation? Troubles for
Gods cause, did not trouble this good man;
for when the Holy Ghost testified of him,
that bonds, and afflictions abode for him,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 23. <hi>But this doth not trouble me,
neither is my life deare unto me, that I may
finish my course with joy, and fulfill the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
which I have received of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi>
Yea, when <hi>Agabus</hi> the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told
his afflictions, so that his friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
(even with teares) to disswade him
from going up to <hi>Jerusalem, Acts</hi> 21. 11,
12, 13. Marke his couragious answere, a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:4060:37"/>
golden resolution: <hi>What doe yee weeping,
and breaking my heart? I am readie, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be bound, but to die at Jerusalem, for the
Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> True gold will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the fire; he that hath true grace, will
be constant and faithfull even unto death,
and will cleave unto Gods service in time
of danger, as well as in time of safetie. See
an experiment of this, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the
three noble <hi>Jewes.</hi> First, for <hi>Daniel,</hi> he did not
content himselfe, to serve God onely in
time of safetie, but also in time of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
perill and danger, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 10.) for
when he knew that the writing was sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
he went into his house, &amp;c. and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and gave thankes before his God, as he
did aforetime; though he adventured his
very life in this case, to be cast into the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
den. So that ye see, that <hi>Daniels</hi> graces
were pure gold indeed; he was the same in
time of danger, that he was before time, in
time of safetie. So for the three noble <hi>Iewes,
Daniel</hi> 3. When they were threatned with
the fiery furnace, if they would not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
the Kings golden Image; marke their
couragious answere, that same golden reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of theirs, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. <hi>Our God, whom
wee serve, is able to deliver us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if
hee will not, be it knowne unto thee, O King,
that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the
golden Image which thou hast set up:</hi> and so
were cast into the hot fiery furnace. Here
were three precious pieces of gold, that

were readie to abide the fiery tryall.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>as for the wicked, it is not so with them:</hi>
they may have a faire golden shew, untill
they come to the melting; but no hypocrite
can abide this fiery tryall: herein the true
Christian out-strippeth the temporarie; as
our Saviour sheweth evidently, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.
with <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>Yet hath he no roote in
himselfe, but endureth for a season:</hi> Why so?
He answereth, <hi>For when tribulation, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
ariseth, because of the Word, by and by
he is offended.</hi> He is not able to abide the
scorching heate of persecution, in, and for
the good cause of God. So that this fire of
persecution, is fit to try every mans worke,
whether it be gold, and silver, or hay, and
straw, or stubble. Pertinent is that of the
Apostle, to this purpose, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 12, 13.
<hi>Now if any man build upon this foundation,
gold, silver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or wood, hay, or stubble; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
mans worke shall be made manifest.</hi> How?
Because <hi>it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire
shall try every mans worke, of what sort it is.</hi>
That is true grace indeed, that abideth the
fiery tryall.</p>
                  <p>But a question may here,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> not unfitly, be
moved, <hi>sc.</hi> Whether an hypocrite may not
hold out, even unto death, and abide the
tryall of the fire?</p>
                  <p>Yes. He may stifly hold out,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and persist
in some course that he hath begunne, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give his body to be burned, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it. This the Apostle seemeth to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:4060:38"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Though I give my body
to be burned, and have not charitie, it profiteth
me nothing.</hi> But yet, first, it is not in, or
properly for the good Word of God, that
he thus suffereth; but <hi>as a busie body,</hi> out of
some odde humour, or proud factious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Now it is properly the cause,<note place="margin">Causa, non poena facit Martyr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>

                     </note> and
not the punishment, that maketh a martyr;
and therefore sayth our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
21. <hi>When tribulation, or persecution ariseth
because of the Word, he is offended.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
suffering, is, and must be well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the Word, else he suffereth not as
a Christian, but <hi>as a busie body,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 15,
16. Secondly, If his cause, in which he snf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
be good, yet he suffereth without cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
not out of love, either to God, or his
truth; but out of selfe-love, and so is worth
nothing. So that he that will hold out in a
good cause, even unto death, and that in
obedience to God, and out of love to his
truth, the graces of such a man are pure gold
indeed.</p>

thee in that regard; for he regardeth not
the rich, more then the poore, <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 19.

Yea, he thinketh better, of every godly

rich man whatsoever, <hi>Pro.</hi> 28. 6. <hi>Better is
the poore, that walketh in his integritie, then he
that is perverse in his wayes, though he be rich.</hi>
A godly poore man is able to say with the
Apostle, in some measure, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Wee
know, that when the earthly house, of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
shall be dissolved; we have a building
of God, not made with hands, eternall in the

endued with the true feare of God, findeth
better acceptance with God, then any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
rich man whatsoever, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 35.
<hi>Of a truth I perceive, that God is no respecter
of persons, but in every Nation, he that feareth
God, and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted
with him,</hi> sayth the Apostle. Oh how this
should comfort us, against the reproaches,
and aspersions of the world, <hi>sc.</hi> that in the

his Sonnes sake; yea, will manifest this love
one day, before men, and Angels, in bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

12. 32. <hi>Feare not little flocke, for it is my

(sayth the Apostle) <hi>hath not God chosen
the poore of the world, rich in faith, and heires
of the kingdome, which he hath promised to them
that love him?</hi> Oh how this may comfort us,
in regard of outward poverty? It will keepe
no man out of heaven, that hath an heart full
of the golden graces of Gods Spirit, no more
then outward wealth, of it selfe, can keepe a
man out of hell. <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. The rich man (there)
notwithstanding all his wealth, was deeply
plunged into hell, and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> even poore
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> was caried, by the Angels, into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
bosome. Onely be sure, that the gold
which thou hast, is true and right gold, and
not counterfeit. And therefore againe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
I exhort every one, that desireth to
have interest in the comfort now propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that he be sure, he be not deluded, nor
gulled in this case, with feigned gold, and
counterfeit metall, in stead of true saving
grace indeed. Now, because it is, on the one
side, so easie a thing to be deceived, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
so exceeding hard and difficult for a man
to be well assured, that his graces are sincere,
(besides what you have already heard in the
former use) I will give you two or three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
signes, by which you may understand,
that the golden graces of Gods Spirit in
you, are sound, and not counterfeit.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Signe.</hi> He that hath true grace, will use it to Gods glory, &amp; the good of others.</note> He that hath true grace, right gold
indeed, will be carefull to use it to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the good of others; he is no niggard
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:4060:40"/>
of it, nor layeth it up in a Napkin, but is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
free, and liberall, in communicating what
he hath, for the benefit of others: he is not
content to be religious himselfe alone, but
doth earnestly desire, &amp; carefully endeavour,
that others may have true grace, and become
religious, as well as himselfe; and his very
speeches, and whole cariage, will manifest
no lesse. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 30, 31. <hi>The mouth of the
righteous speaketh wisedome, his tongue will be
talking of judgement, the Law of his God is in
his heart, none of his steps slide.</hi> Such a man,
followeth that golden rule of the Apostle,
<hi>Col.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Let your speech be alwayes gracious,
seasoned with salt, such as may minister grace to
the hearers; when thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32.
Loe the concomitant, and inseparable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
of true conversion. See this dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in divers. That man, that hath true grace
himselfe, earnestly desires and endeavoureth
that others may be truely good, as well as
himselfe. See it in one, that had very little
time to live after his conversion, and that is,
the Thiefe on the Crosse, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 40. He vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicateth
our Saviours innocency, confesseth
his own, and his fellowes just punishment,
earnestly laboureth the conversion of his
companion, that as they had lived wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so his earnest desire was, that they might
both die penitently; <hi>Fearest thou not God,</hi>
(sayth he, rebuking his fellow) <hi>seeing thou
art in the same condemnation? (i. e.)</hi> Oh, feare
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:4060:41"/>
God, repent, and turne truely to him, &amp;c.
So that, as he prayed for himselfe unto our
Saviour; so he sought earnestly the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion,
and spirituall good of his partner.
I might likewise instance in <hi>David, Psal.</hi>
51. 13. <hi>Then shall I teach thy wayes unto the
wicked, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.</hi>
No good man is content to goe to Heaven
alone, but earnestly desireth company. The
woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> telleth her neighbours
of our Saviour, when shee was throughly
wrought upon, and converted her selfe. I
might give you sundry instances to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
but I will content my selfe with one
onely, and that is the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi> see
what a speciall care, and respect he had for
the good of others; observe that speech of
his, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Brethren, my hearts desire,
and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might
be saved.</hi> This made him so abundant in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
especially in travelling to preach
the Gospell; because hee earnestly desired,
and endeavoured the conversion of others.
Yea, such was his earnest desire this way,
that he seemed to preferre the salvation, of
his Country-men the <hi>Iewes,</hi> before his own
eternall happinesse, and salvation. An ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
place to this purpose, is that which
we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 3. <hi>For I could wish my
selfe separate and accursed from Christ; for
my brethren, my kinsmen, according to the flesh,</hi>
yea, he sought earnestly the conversion, and
salvation both of <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> even
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:4060:41"/>
every man, if he could possible, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1. 28.
<hi>Teaching, and admonishing in all wisedome,
that I might present every man perfect in
Christ Iesus.</hi> Yea, consider the speech of his
to <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26. 27, 28, 29. <hi>Almost
thou perswadest mee to become a Christian,</hi>
saith the King. See what an admirable
answer hee returneth (speaking out of the
abundance of gracious love, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
affection that was in his heart) <hi>I
would to God, that not onely thou, but all
that heare me this day, were both almost, and
altogether such, as I am, except these bonds.</hi>
O golden <hi>Paul!</hi> Oh gracious soule, that
is desirous, that other, even all others
were truely religious, as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe!
I pray let us all try our selves by this
note. Where is our care, and earnest
desire for the good of others, especially our
families, and those that are committed to
our charge? Yea, what cause have they to
consider this, that are so farre from ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
the conversion of others, that they
doe labour to quench those beginnings of
true grace, which they see in any; Yea,
and are enemies to Gods people, only for
their piety; and hate them, because they
<hi>follow the thing that is good?</hi> Well, (to say
no more in this case) the truth is, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth,
that these men are not onely emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and voyde of all true grace, but even
full of the spirit of Sathan, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:
it is even unto such a fearefull to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4060:42"/>
of perdition, as the Apostle speaketh,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 28.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Signe.</hi> Hee that hath true grace, is still desirous of more.</note> hee that hath true grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
is not content with that measure of
grace, which he hath for the present, but
earnestly coveteth after more: for though
he be no niggard of it, yet he is withall a
good husband with it, and laboureth daily
to encrease it; yea, hee is the more liberall
in this case, and is the more ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to impart what graces hee hath,
for the good of others, because hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that it is one speciall way and meanes,
to augment, and increase his store. For as
a great deale layd up in a napkin, will
quickly come to just nothing: so a little
well improved, will quickly bee increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
as our Saviour saith fitly, in this very
case, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 31. <hi>For unto him that hath,
shall bee given, and hee shall have abundance,</hi>
None so desirous to grow and increase in
grace, as they that have good store of grace
already: he that hath thirtie, is very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of sixtie; and hee that hath attained
to sixtie, is not well contented, untill he
have an hundred fold. Oh that we would
try our selves by this note. Wouldest thou
be sure, that the grace which thou hast is
not counterfeit, but sound and good?
Where is then thy desire to grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in it? Doest thou daily <hi>labour to
grow in grace?</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 18. Doest thou
<hi>covet earnestly the best things?</hi> Art thou
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4060:42"/>
still desirous of more? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Certainely
this is a very comfortable signe that thy
graces are sincere.</p>
                  <p>See an experiment of this in <hi>Paul.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had once gotten some of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
gold of true grace, hee was never
satisfied with the measure which he had,
but was still desirous of more, alwayes
ayming at perfection; observe it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.
13. <hi>This one thing I doe, forgetting those
things which are behinde, and reaching forth
to those things that are before, verse</hi> 14. <hi>I
presse towards the marke, or the price of the
high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</hi> Let
such try themselves by this Signe. that
thinke that they have holinesse, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enough, and that it is not good to bee
too forward; none of these are afraid of
having too much gold, which is farre more
dangerous; for a man cannot have too
much true saving grace, though hee may
have more wealth, then he can well tell
how to use. He therefore that thinketh
that he hath grace enough already, and is
afraid of having too much, it is a shrewd
signe that he hath no true grace at all. Let
us therefore strive to manifest the truth of
our graces,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Signe.</hi> Hee that hath true grace, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

endeavour to get more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly, for conclusion of
this point. He that hath true grace, hath
respect to the Word of Gods grace, by
which it is begotten and encreased, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:4060:43"/>
2. 1. <hi>As new borne babes desire the sincere
milke of the Word, that yee may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by;</hi>
How doe wee stand affected to Gods
Ordinances? What account doe we make
of prayer, publike, and private? What
reckoning of the Sacraments, those seales of
righteousnesse? In what esteeme have we
the Word faithfully read and preached,
which is called, <hi>The Word of Gods grace,
Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>And now brethren, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
you to God, and to the Word of his grace,
which is able to build you up farther, &amp;c.</hi> He
that is carelesse and disregardfull of this,
can have little assurance of the worke of
true grace, being wrought in his heart.
They are scarce new borne, that love not
the meanes, and instruments of their new
birth, or regeneration. Looke upon all
those golden persons recorded in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and you shall finde what a singular
affection they have ever borne to the Word,
read, and preached. <hi>Iob esteemed it more

of his heart, Ier.</hi> 15. 16. and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid's</hi>
affection in this case was admirable,
and extraordinary, <hi>Oh how I love thy law!
It is my meditation continually, Psalme</hi> 119.

which God hath appointed for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

and increasing of true grace in the
hearts of his people; out of doubt he hath
not the spirit of <hi>David</hi> in him; hee is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
empty, and destitute of the golden
graces of Gods Spirit, then filled with the
fruits of righteousnesse. Let us therefore
try our selves impartially, and faithfully,
by these signes that wee have heard; that
we may be assured the gold of grace which
we have, or seeme to have, is true gold,
and not counterfeit, and such as will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us. You that finde your selves stored
with this precious commodity, blesse God
for it, and bee thankefull; for true saving
grace is, like <hi>Gold tryed in the fire,</hi> pure, and

the world is deceived, in judging, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring

to be the poorest, and basest, yea, and most
despicable people in the world; whereas
here you see, that they are best furnished
with that most precious commodity, which
is able to make them truely and spiritually
rich, even rich towards God. Doe but
consider of what rich parentage they come,
they have the God of heaven and earth for
their Father, the Lord for their portion,
and their helper, and heaven it selfe for their
inheritance; yea, and all the Ordinances,

are such, <hi>of whom the world was not worthy,
Heb.</hi> 11. 37, 38. See the high esteeme that

They are the most precious and honourable

then how the mis-judging world is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this case, in accounting Gods people
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4060:47"/>

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:4060:48"/>
disgrace, and contempt that is cast upon us,
by the world; <hi>sc.</hi> that God himselfe doth

The Lord maketh choice in speciall manner,

<hi>The Lord hath chosen,</hi> or set apart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,

<hi>Iam.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Hath not God chosen the poore of

be to be rich in faith, and then let us never
doubt of finding acceptance with God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

is the second ground of comfort for all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poore ones, <hi>sc.</hi> that they finde farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 31. We know (sayth the blind man)

                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:4060:48"/>
how poore soever he be for outward things.
See a direct proofe for this, <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 14.

<hi>he will heare their cry, and will helpe them.</hi>
Here is another speciall priviledge, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

sayth our blessed Saviour. It is marvellous
hard, and difficult for a rich man to enter

to be proud of their wealth, and riches,
and so <hi>deny God.</hi> This made holy <hi>Agur,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

wealth, and riches, that can neither helpe
a man to heaven, nor keepe him out of the

way discouraged, or out of heart, in regard
of his povertie, because it is no barre, nor
impediment to keepe him out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven: onely let a man be sure,
that he is poore in spirit, as well as poore
in estate, and labour to be as rich in faith,
and as abundant in grace, as he is poore,
and destitute of outward wealth, and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
and then let him never doubt, but
that the kingdome of heaven is as wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
for him, as for any the most wealthy
person in the world. Yea, consider farther
for thy comfort, that the Sonne of God
himselfe, the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> became
poore, to this very end and purpose, that
hee might enrich thee with his povertie,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For yee know the grace of our

with spirituall wealth and riches.</p>

onely, are truely and spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
rich, This serveth to exhort
us, unto sundry duties: and the
exhortation is directed unto two sorts of
people. First, Such as have some measure
of this spirituall wealth, and riches. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Such as for the present are utterly
destitute of this precious gold, here set out
in the Text.</p>
                  <p>First, This doctrine serveth to exhort
such as have true grace, (and are truely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,)
unto a two-fold dutie.</p>
                  <p>First, Vnto thankfulnesse to God for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
such a favour.<note place="margin">Such as have true grace, must labour to be thankfull for it.</note> Hath God given his Sonne
to enrich thee, and furnished thee with the
graces of his Spirit, to make thee truely
and spiritually rich and wealthy? Oh!
then (in any case) blesse God for it, and
strive to walke worthy of such a precious
favour. I tell thee, God hath not dealt so
with every person: how many thousand
hath God left poore, and blind, and naked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet hath set his love upon thee, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4060:51"/>
made thee truely and spiritually rich, who
wert by nature the childe of wrath, and as
poore and miserable as any other? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
the favours of God on this kinde,
should not be so much as mentioned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
speciall praise and thankesgiving unto
God. See the Apostolicall practise of Gods
people in this kinde; <hi>Blessed be God, and the
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath
blessed us with all spirituall blessings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things in Christ</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Paul,
Ephes.</hi> 1. 3. See the like practise in <hi>Peter,</hi>
to this purpose, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Blessed be God,
the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his abundant mercie, hath begotten
us againe, to a lively hope, by the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Iesus Christ from the dead, to an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
immortall,</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>David, Psalm.</hi>
103. 1, 2, 4. <hi>Blesse the Lord, O my soule,
and all that is within me, blesse his holy Name.
Blesse the Lord, O my soule, forget not all his
benefits:</hi> and <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Who did redeeme thy life
from destruction, and crowned thee with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and loving kindnesses.</hi> Blessed be God,
that daily more and more, even lodeth us
with his benefits, especially of this kinde,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 19. If wee did but seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
our former povertie, and misery, and
how freely, and undeservedly, the Lord
hath bestowed this spirituall wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
upon us, it cannot choose but presse us
to thankfulnesse. This made <hi>Paul</hi> thankfull,
1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13, 14. I thanke <hi>Christ Jesus our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4060:51"/>
Lord, that he hath judged me faithfull, and
hath put me into the Ministery, who was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a blasphemer, a persecutor, and injurious,</hi>
&amp;c. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) I was a poore, wretched, and
gracelesse persecutor of Gods blessed Saints;
but the Lord (according to the riches of his
grace and mercy) hath made me a rich,
and glorious Apostle, and Minister of <hi>Iesus
Christ.</hi> So in the like forme, and manner,
he maketh mention, of Gods singular good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to the <hi>Romans, Chap.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>But God
be thanked, that yee were the servants of sinne,
but yee have obeyed from the heart, the forme
of Doctrine which was delivered,</hi> &amp;c. Blessed
be God, that whereas once yee were poore
base slaves, and servants of sinne, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,
God hath enriched you with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
libertie of the Sonnes of God. It is
the Lord, that <hi>Raiseth up the poore out of the
dust, and setteth him with the Princes of his
people.</hi> It is the Lord, that <hi>maketh poore, and
maketh rich:</hi> oh then blesse God for his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
goodnesse towards thee, in that he
hath so enriched thee, with the golden me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of his dearest Sonne, and the excellent
graces of his holy and blessed Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Dutie.</hi> To grow in grace.</note> Seeing true saving grace is
the chiefe and onely meanes to make us
truely and spiritually rich; this serveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to exhort all such, as have any measure
of true saving grace, to labour to grow in
grace, and endeavour to increase in this
spirituall wealth and riches. O let us imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:4060:52"/>
the rich misers of the world, that are
never satisfied, with what they have, but
still hunger and thirst after more: here is
a most lawfull, and commendable kinde of
avarice; <hi>Covet after the best things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
12. 31. Covet after <hi>Christ,</hi> and earnestly
thirst after a more neare communion with
him, and the graces of his thrise blessed
Spirit. <hi>But grow in grace,</hi> sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. So <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Wee beseech you, brethren,
and exhort you, by the Lord Iesus Christ, that
as you have received of us, how yee ought to
walke, and to please God; so you would abound
still more and more.</hi> The like exhortation,
he directeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.
last, <hi>Alwayes abounding in the worke of the
Lord, for as much as yee know, how that your
labour is not in vaine in the Lord.</hi> Never
thinke that you shall loose your labour in
this kinde. Vp, therefore, and be doing,
labour to grow in grace, and the Lord will
be with us, and will blesse our endeavours.
Now for the perfecting of this point, give
me leave, briefly to shew unto you, first,
The Motives that may perswade us, and
secondly, The chiefe meanes to helpe and to
direct us to grow in grace.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Motive.</hi> To perswade us to labour to grow in grace.</note> Because God commands it; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
because the Lord commends it;
thirdly, the Lord is much honoured by it;
fourthly, the Lord will most surely reward
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:4060:52"/>
First, Let us labour to grow rich in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
grace,<note place="margin">1. Because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth it.</note> and not content our selves with
some small measure of pietie, because the
Lord (as you have heard) doth expresly
require it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>But grow in grace,</hi>
&amp;c. Now the very bare command of God,
should be unto us an argument of sufficient
strength, to perswade us to obedience.
See how the Lord propoundeth his very
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>are command to <hi>Iosuah,</hi> as an argument
of sufficient strength, to perswade him to
be of courage, and to abandon all carnall
feares, <hi>Ios.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Have not I commanded thee?
be strong, and of a good courage,</hi> &amp;c. So here:
Have not I commanded thee? Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
grow in grace, and labour to increase
in godlinesse. This is the Lords expresse
command, an evangelicall precept, and
therefore let us, in any case, make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of it, because the LORD requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Motive.</hi> Because the Lord expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth it.</note> Because the Lord himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
it, he looketh for it at our hands.
It is not enough to get some grace, but he
expecteth our growth, and increase in it.
When God hath once planted a Vineyard,
he looketh that it should bring forth grapes,
as, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 2. yea, he daily, and yearely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 7. yea, the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi>
goeth into his garden, of purpose, that he
may see how the trees flourish, and prosper,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>I went downe into the garden of
Nutts, to see the fruits of the valley, to see if
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:4060:53"/>
the Vine budded, and the Pomgranates flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</hi>
The Lord expecteth and looketh for
fruitfulnesse at the hands of his people.
Yea, further, the Lord expecteth, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for fruits, in some measure, answerable
to the meanes he hath used, and the paines
which he hath taken to make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>The earth that drinketh in
the raine, that cometh often upon it, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
forth fruit, meet for them by whom it is
dressed, receiveth blessing from God.</hi> Oh let
us therefore, let us labour to be rich in
grace, and full of good workes, that wee
may not frustrate the LORDS expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Motive.</hi> Because the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it.</note> As the Lord commandeth, and
expects it; so the Lord doth highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
and prize it, when it is so. See how
the Lord commendeth the diligence of
those servants, that had encreased their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,
by the holy employment of them,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Well done, good and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
thou hast beene faithfull in a few things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
I will make thee ruler over many things,</hi> &amp;c.
Oh what an encouragement in this? <hi>sc.</hi>
that though when we have done all that
we can, we doe but our dutie, neither can
we doe that perfectly, yet the Lord in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
is readie to encourage and commend us,
if we doe our best endeavour. Here is the
commendation of a right tree of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
that they are such as flourish, and
increase still more and more, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. 12,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:4060:53"/>
13. <hi>The righteous shall flourish like a Palme
tree, and grow like a Cedar in Lebanon. Such
as be planted in the house of the Lord, shall flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
in the Courts of the house of our God.
They shall bring forth fruit in their age, and
they shall be fat and flourishing.</hi> Here was the
commendation of the Church of <hi>Thyatyra,
Revel.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>I know thy workes, and thy love,
and thy faith, and patience, and thy workes,
that they are more at last, then at first.</hi> Thou
doest still grow in grace, and art every day
better and better. The Lord taketh notice
of our growth in grace, and doth most high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commend, and prize it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As the Lord commends it,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Motive.</hi> Because the Lord is much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by it.</note>
so he is much honoured by it. It is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Master of the Vineyard, that the
Vine flourisheth, and is fruitfull. It is the
glory of the husbandman, that the earth
bringeth forth fruit in abundance. It is the
glory of the chiefe Shepheard, when the
sheepe bring forth thousands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.
Hereupon is that speech of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 8. <hi>Herein is my Father glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
that yee bring forth much fruit.</hi> The more
fruitfull wee are in grace and pietie, the
more glory redoundeth to God; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.
16. <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that
they may see your good workes, and glorifie your
Father, which is in heaven.</hi> Hence is that
prayer of the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9. 11. <hi>And
this, I pray, that your love may abound, still
more, and more, in knowledge, and in all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:4060:54"/>
Why so? see that, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11. <hi>And that
yee may be filled, with the fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which are by Iesus Christ, to the prayse,
and glory of God.</hi> Oh this, above all other
considerations, should perswade us, to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to grow rich in grace, because it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
so expresly, to Gods glory, which is
the chiefe end of God himselfe, in all his
actions, and that which we should ayme at
especially, in all our proceedings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
10. 31. <hi>Whether yee eate, or drinke, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
yee doe, doe all to the glory of God,</hi> sayth
the Apostle; and therefore wee should (in
all equitie) ply that worke most, that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
most to his glory.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Motive.</hi> Because the Lord will most freely and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it.</note> The Lord will most surely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it. Let no man ever thinke, that it is
in vaine to serve God, but if wee be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in doing God service, let us never doubt
of his fidelitie, and bountie in paying our
wages. <hi>Alwayes abounding in the worke of
the Lord, for as much as yee know how that
your labour is not in vaine in the Lord,</hi> sayth
the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. last. He <hi>that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
in Gods service <hi>unto death,</hi> may be sure
of the <hi>Crowne of life, Revel.</hi> 2. 10. God is
absolutely the best Master, and pietie the
best Mistresse, that a man can possibly serve:
<hi>Godlinesse is profitable unto all things</hi> (sayth
the Apostle) <hi>having the promise of the life
that now is, and of that to come,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.
Let us but see the reward of pietie in some
few particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:4060:54"/>
First,<note place="margin">1. Benefits of growing in grace. 1. It will as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure us of our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> An earnest endeavour to grow in
grace, and thrive in godlinesse, will assure
a man of his election. It is the advise of the
Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Give diligence to make
your calling and election sure:</hi> no better
meanes to doe it, then by an earnest desire,
and carefull endeavour, to grow in grace;
our growth in grace, is not onely an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the truth of our grace, but also a
good pledge, and token of our election:
faith and holinesse is a fruit of our eternall
election. Hence it is, that true saving faith
is called, <hi>The faith of Gods elect, Titus</hi> 1. 1.
This should make us earnestly to cry out
with the Disciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>Lord increase
our faith,</hi> because it is such a pledge of our
election; for, <hi>As many as were ordained to
eternall life, beleeved, Acts</hi> 13. 48. Holines
is the very end of our election; <hi>Wee are
chosen in Christ Iesus, before the world, that
wee might be holy, and without blame before
him in love, Ephes.</hi> 1. 4. Hence is that sweet,
and excellent parenthesis of the Apostle,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Put upon you therefore (as the
elect of God, holy, and beloved) bowels of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
&amp;c. So that the more faith, the more
pietie, the more bowels of mercie, &amp;c. the
more evident pledges, and tokens of our
election. Oh how this should perswade us
to grow in grace, that wee may thereby
make our calling, and election sure unto
our selves; an admirable, and most desirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
benefit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:4060:55"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Benefit.</hi> The better able to doe good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> The richer we are in grace,
the better able shall we be to doe good to
others, and also to discharge the duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the places wherein God hath
set us. <hi>Wisedome is good with an inheritance,</hi>
sayth <hi>Salomon;</hi> so, no doubt it is without
an inheritance; but yet he that hath wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with an inheritance, is the best able
to expresse, and make use of his wisedome;
so, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>Charge those that be rich
in this world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they be rich in good
workes,</hi> as if they had the best opportunitie;
so, much more, they that are spiritually
rich, that are full of the golden graces of
Gods Spirit, they have an opportunitie to
be rich in good workes, and are, or may
be, the better fitted, and enabled, to doe
good to others. This made our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
so rich in good workes, so plentifull
in workes of pietie, and charitie: <hi>He went
about</hi> continually <hi>doing good, teaching, and
preaching the Gospell of the kingdome, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
every sicknesse, and every disease amongst
the people, Mat.</hi> 9. 35. And why so? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
because he was <hi>full of grace, Ioh.</hi> 1. 14.
This made <hi>Barnabas,</hi> such an admirable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of Gods glorie, in doing so much
good at <hi>Antioch;</hi> see how the Text reports
it, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23. <hi>Who when he was come, and
saw the grace of God, he was glad, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them all, that with purpose of heart they
would cleave unto the Lord:</hi> Why so? what
made him so zealous and ready to do good?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:4060:55"/>
That you may see, <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. <hi>For he was a good
man, and full of the holy Ghost, and of faith;
and much people joyned themselves unto the
Lord.</hi> He that is truely and really good
himselfe, is the fittest, and best able to doe
good to others. See here another benefit,
that may perswade us to grow in grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Benefit.</hi> Assurance of interest in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glorie.</note> An earnest desire, and carefull
endeavour to grow in grace, will give us,
not onely entrance into the kingdome of
grace, but also assurance of interest in the
kingdome of glorie. See a direct place for
this purpose, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. 11. <hi>Wherefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all diligence, adde to your faith, vertue;
and to your vertue, knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. adde one
grace to another, grow in the number of
graces, and grow in their measure too; If
<hi>these things be in you, and abound,</hi> sayth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 9. see the benefit of this, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11.
<hi>For so an entrance, shall be made unto you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
into the everlasting kingdome of our
Lord Jesus Christ:</hi> here is an entrance into
the kingdome of grace, which also assureth
us, of our interest in the kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. <hi>Having your fruit unto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and the end everlasting life.</hi> True ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
and growth in grace,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Benefit. Non prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sed se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum opera.</hi> The more grace here, the more glorie in heaven.</note> is the plaine,
and direct way to true happines, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and lastly, The more grace,
and holines, we attaine unto here, the more
glory and happinesse is reserved in heaven
for us: for though God doe not reward us
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:4060:56"/>
for our workes, yet he will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
us according to our workes; so that
the more diligence in Gods service, the
more glory hereafter. This seemeth most
clearely intimated, in that Parable of the
Talents, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. he that gained most,
had best reward: <hi>Vnto him that hath, shall
be given, and he shall have abundance, Ver.</hi> 29.
He that is most abundant in the worke of
the Lord, shall be sure to have abundance
of wages. Let this also perswade us to grow
in grace, that our reward in heaven, may
be the greater. They that doe much in Gods
service, and suffer much in the good cause of
God, shall have the greater reward in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<hi>Rejoyce, and be exceeding glad,</hi> sayth our
Saviour to his Disciples, <hi>for great is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in heaven, Mat.</hi> 5. 12. They that take
great paines in Gods service, shall have an
eternall, and an exceeding weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
for their reward, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 7. This en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<hi>Moses, Heb.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>He esteemed
the rebuke of Christ, greater riches, then the
treasures of Aegypt; for he had respect to the
recompence of reward,</hi> sayth the Text.</p>
                  <p>Now the meanes,<note place="margin">Meanes of growth in grace.</note> that we must use, that
we may grow in grace, are especially these
two; first, The right use of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances;
and, secondly, Holy meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Meanes</note> The right, and conscionable use
of Gods ordinances; The Word, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and Prayer. Loe, here the best
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:4060:56"/>
way, and meanes to grow rich in grace,
and full of spirituall wealth.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. The word preached the maanes to grow in grace.</note> The Ministery of the Word read,
and faithfully preached, it is the <hi>Word of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, Ioh.</hi> 6. 68. the meanes to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a dead soule at first, and the chiefe
meanes to preserve the same spirituall life,
and to helpe us to grow, and increase in
grace. Two singular, and most pertinent
testimonies wee have for this purpose. The
one, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>As new borne Babes, desire
the sincere milke of the Word, that you may
grow thereby.</hi> The ministery of the Word,
is not onely the meanes of our regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at first, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 18.) but,
is the meanes also to helpe us grow up unto
perfection; <hi>Desire the sincere milke of the
Word, that yee may grow thereby,</hi> sayth the
Apostle. The other testimony, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
is that of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in his vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to the Church of <hi>Ephesus, Acts</hi> 20.
when he was to depart from them, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw
that they should see his face no more,
never enjoy his bodily presence, or heare
him preach againe; see what he especially
commendeth to their daily use, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
practise, <hi>Ver.</hi> 32. <hi>And now brethren,
I commend you to God, and to the Word of his
grace, which is able to build you farther, and
to give you an inheritance among all them that
are sanctified,</hi>  (<hi>i. e.</hi>) give daily atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
to this, ply this taske, follow this
worke close; for the Word of his grace,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:4060:57"/>
will build you up still farther, and farther,
and will never cease working in you, untill
it bring you to heaven, and translate you
from grace to glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</note> The right, and religious use
of the Sacraments, of Baptisme, and of the
Lords Supper, (these seales of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
will exceedingly further our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
in pietie, and growth in grace. How
can a man, that is of a good constitution,
feed on dainties, and wholesome food, and
not grow strong, and well liking by that
meanes? so, how can a man, eat the very
body of <hi>Christ,</hi> and drinke his very blood,
in the Sacrament, (as every worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doth, spiritually) but he must needs
grow strong, in the grace of <hi>Christ Iesus;
For my flesh is meate indeede, and my blood is
drinke indeede,</hi> sayth our blessed Saviour?
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 35. And hereupon he inferreth, <hi>Ver.</hi>
56. <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my
blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> that is,
such an one hath speciall communion with
<hi>Christ,</hi> and interest in all his merits, and the
benefit of his obedience, active, and passive,
which how can he enjoy, but he must needs
grow in grace?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Prayer.</note> Prayer is a chiefe Ordinance
of God, by no meanes to be neglected, nay,
which must be used, as a meanes to bring
Gods blessing upon the former: this is the
way, and meanes to make the Word, and
Sacraments effectuall unto us: so that in the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:4060:57"/>
neglect of this meanes, little benefit is to be
expected from the diligent use of the former,
so that he that would grow in grace, must
be a daily petitioner at the Throne of
grace, and direct his course to the God of
all grace, by prayer, for the increase of
the graces of Gods Spirit in him. For, as
<hi>every good, and perfect gift, cometh from aboue,</hi>
at the first, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 17. So the increase of
those gifts, must needs also proceede from
above. He onely that beginneth the good
worke of grace in his Elect, at the first,
is onely able to perfect that worke which
he hath begunne; <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 6. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
as the Apostle was confident, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, so let us be fervent, and
importunate in our requests to him, for our
selves, that as he hath begunne the good
worke of grace in us, so he would encrease
it in us daily, and bring it unto perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus the Apostles direct their course
unto <hi>Christ,</hi> by prayer, for the increase of
their faith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 5. The Disciples sayd
unto the Lord, <hi>Lord increase our faith.</hi>
Thus <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>Philippians, Phil.</hi> 1. 9.
11. <hi>And this I pray, that your love may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
still more and more, in knowledge, and
in all judgement; and that yee might be filled
with the fruits of righteousnesse.</hi> Encrease of
grace (as well as grace it selfe) must needs
be the gift of God; <hi>For of him, and through
him, and from him, are all things.</hi> sayth the
Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:4060:58"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Meanes Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> The second generall meanes,
that we must use to grow in grace, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Meditations. This hath furthered the
growth of grace in Gods Saints heretofore,
they have beene abundant, and constant in
pious and holy meditations; <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 4. A
godly mans <hi>delight is in the Law of the Lord,</hi>
and it is his meditation day and night. So,
this was <hi>Davids</hi> constant practice, <hi>Psal.</hi>
119. 97. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law, it is my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
continually!</hi> But what are the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
things, whereof wee must meditate,
if wee desire to further our growth in
grace? I answere; they are especially these
foure.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Of the worth of true grace.</note> Let us seriously consider the
worth, and excellency of true saving grace,
which appeareth in the Text; it is like <hi>gold
tryed in the fire,</hi> the most pure, and most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
jewell, that is in the whole world:
all earthly things, in the want of this, are
but drosse, and dung, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. But for
your more full satisfaction, as touching the
worth of true grace, consider, the second
Chapter of this Treatise, being the first Vse
of the poynt. And surely, if men did but
once see the beautie, and truely understand
the worth of true grace, they could not
choose, but bee exceeding desirous of it.
They would covet after it, if they were
once perswaded, that it is the best and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
jewell in the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of it.</note> The necessitie of true grace,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:4060:58"/>
it is absolutely necessary, to the very being
of a Christian, and not to his well-being
onely. Oh then let us labour for grace, and
growth in grace, because it it so necessary,
that a man is no Christian, that is without
it; and it is also so necessary, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be saved without it: <hi>They must
have their fruit unto holinesse,</hi> that will have
the end everlasting life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
must needs goe before, if happinesse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after: grace and glorie are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
yea, they are the same, as some Divines
observe; for grace is glorie inchoate, and
glorie is grace consummate. It is so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
that it is impossible to see God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Follow peace with all
men, and holinesse, without which it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to see God. Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they</hi> (and they alone) <hi>shall see God,</hi> sayth
our blessed Saviour; see <hi>Psal.</hi> 24. 4, 5.
<hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 14, 15. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Motive.</hi> 3. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of it.</note> Consider the equitie of it,
it is very fit, and equall, that we that doe
professe our selves to be Gods children, shall
labour to become like unto our heavenly
Father. He is the God of all grace; oh let
us therefore labour to grow in grace, that
we may be like him, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Be yee
followers of God, as deare children, and walke
in love,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>As he that hath
called you, is holy, so be yee holy, in all manner
of conversation; for it is written, be yee holy,
for I am holy.</hi> Yea, we should labour to be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:4060:59"/>
perfect in holinesse, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Perfecting
holinesse in the feare of God;</hi> that herein espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
wee may resemble our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who is the God of all grace, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<hi>Be yee perfect, as your Father which is
in heaven is perfect,</hi> sayth our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. last. So that the more holinesse, the more
like to God, and the better evidence, and
assurance that we are his children.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Motive.</hi> To consider the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble growth of grace that hath beene in the Saints of old.</note> Let us meditate, and seriously
consider of that great measure of grace that
hath beene in Gods Saints of old, and how
farre we come short of them. There is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
renowmed for his faith, yea, he was
even <hi>strong in the faith, Rom.</hi> 4. 20. <hi>Samuel</hi>
for integritie, <hi>Moses</hi> for meeknesse, <hi>the
meekest man upon the earth, Numb.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
for wrestling with God in prayer, <hi>Hos.</hi>
12. 4. <hi>Iob</hi> for his patience, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 11.
<hi>David</hi> for sinceritie, <hi>A man after Gods own
heart, in all things, save onely in the matter of
Vriah;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> for courage, and all the
graces of Gods Spirit whatsoever, &amp;c.
Now, alas! how farre short doe wee come
of these Saints of God, in all these? What
a small measure of faith have we, in respect
of <hi>Abraham?</hi> How farre short are wee of
<hi>Jacob,</hi> for a gift in prayer, and a spirit of
supplication? How farre doe wee come
behinde <hi>Iob,</hi> for his patience? <hi>David,</hi> for
sinceritie? and <hi>Paul,</hi> for every thing? Oh
how this would whet us on to labour for
more grace, when wee see how farre the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:4060:59"/>
Saints of God have out-stripped us, and
gone before us. Oh how this would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
our diligent endeavour, to grow in
grace, if wee would forget such as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
us, and looke earnestly at those that
have gone before us, it would make us, to
<hi>presse earnestly, for the price of the marke of the
high calling of God in Christ Iesus, Phil.</hi> 3. 13,
13. These are the chiefe meanes that wee
must use, that we may be rich in the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
graces of Gods Spirit. Thus now for
the first sort, to whom the Exhortation is
directed, <hi>sc.</hi> such as have true grace, in
some measure, alreadie. Let such, first, be
thankfull, and blesse God for it, that hath
given them the graces of his Spirit, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
them; secondly, let them labour to
grow in grace, and thrive more and more
in this spirituall wealth and riches.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sort.</hi> Such as have no grace, must labour for it.</note> For such as have no grace,
for the present, let such be exhorted to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for it, let them see the worth of it,
is like <hi>gold tryed in the fire;</hi> that it is the
onely meanes to make them truely and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
rich: onely such as are truely god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
are truely rich, rich indeede, rich to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God: wicked rich men are wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
that are in the middest of all their
wealth, and riches: Oh therefore, you
that want true grace, labour for it: <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.
27. <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth,
but for durable riches, Pro.</hi> 3. 16. which
that you may attaine unto, attend with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:4060:60"/>
unto the next poynt, which is, to

Buy of me</hi> (sayth our Saviour) this <hi>gold try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the fire, that thou mayest be rich.</hi> In
handling this point, I will run this course.
First, I will speake some thing by way of
confirmation, that wee may beleeve it.
Secondly, By way of explication, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
that wee may understand, and
make a right use of it.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> For confirmation, observe a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proofe for this purpose; first, Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
secondly, Reasons and Arguments
to enforce the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</note> For Testimonies, observe it in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:4060:60"/>
these few particulars; first, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. <hi>v.</hi> 23.
<hi>Buy the truth, and sell it not,</hi> sayth the Wise
man. Truth of grace must be bought at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
rate, but sold at no rate. True saving
grace, is a precious commoditie, to bee
bought by all those, that desire to enjoy it.
To the like purpose is that we have, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55.
1. <hi>Hoe, every one that thirsteth, come yee to
the waters, buy wine, and milke, without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and without price;</hi> the water, and wine,
and milke of true saving grace, must come
by purchase: true it is in regard of it selfe,
it is the free gift of God, but in regard of
our owne endeavour to get it, it must be
bought: and to shew the truth of this, the
price it selfe is declared to be without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and without price: so <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44.
<hi>The kingdome of heaven, is like unto a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
hid in the field, which when a man hath
found,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he goeth, and selleth all that he hath,
and buyeth that field:</hi> which also doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
confirme the poynt that we have in
hand. To the same purpose is that speech of
the five wise Virgins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 9. <hi>But goe
yee rather to them that sell, and buy for your
selves;</hi> where we see, that they that want
the oyle of true saving grace, must not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
of others, but goe unto such as sell, and
buy for themselves; which is very direct
for the purpose. Now if any shall aske fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who is the chiefe-chapman, of whom
we must buy this precious commoditie? I
answere in the words of the Doctrine;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:4060:61"/>
That all that would have the gold of true
saving grace, must buy it of <hi>Christ,</hi> He is
the chiefe Chapman in this case. And so I
come to the second proofe, which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
at first, for the confirmation of this
poynt; <hi>sc.</hi> Reasons grounded upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> Now the Reasons are especially these five,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>(which are all drawne from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the excellencie of the Chapman,<note place="margin">The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Chapman, of whom wee must buy it, who is</note> that
is most fit and readie to sell this precious
commoditie, to such as want and desire it,)
so that as the excellencie and necessitie of it,
should perswade us to buy the commoditie:
so the excellencie of the Chapman, should
perswade us, to buy it of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is
absolutely, the rarest chapman in the world.
This I will endeavour to describe, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
in these five particulars.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reason.</hi> 1. A Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a most sweet disposition.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ</hi> is a Chapman of a most lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and sweet disposition, He is (even
in this respect,) <hi>The chiefest of ten thousand,
Cant.</hi> 5. 10. Men usually love to buy of such
Chapmen, as are of the best disposition; a
wise, meeke, and loving disposition in a
Chapman, will perswade many, at least to
cheapen a commoditie. If we would buy
of such an one, let us bargaine with <hi>Christ;</hi>
for he is a Chapman of a most sweet dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
for wisdome, for meeknesse, for love,
&amp;c. Wee may all goe to schoole to him;
yea, he himselfe inviteth us to learne, <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. 29. <hi>Learne of mee, for I am meeke, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:4060:61"/>
lowly in heart, and yee shall finde rest to your
soules.</hi> He is such a Chapman, as is readie to
lay downe his life for his customers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.
Let this rare disposition of his perswade us
to bargaine with <hi>Christ,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. <hi>Reason.</hi> Exceeding faithfull, and one in whom is no guile.</note> If any man want true saving
grace, let him buy it of <hi>Christ,</hi> because he is
an exceeding faithfull Chapman, to all that
shall deale with him. Some men drive away

<hi>Christ</hi> doth beseech us to buy his commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. Some againe loose their
custome, for want of fidelitie, they are apt
to cheat, and cozen such as relie upon them,
and want skill to discerne the worth of the
commoditie; but <hi>Christ</hi> is faithfull, if he
once passe his word, (that the commoditie
is good, and such as will serve thy turne,)
thou mayest safely relie upon him, for he is
faithfull, and will not deceive thee; there
was never any guile to bee found in his
mouth, he never deceived any. <hi>Salomon</hi>
cryeth out of the want of such chapmen,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 20. 6. <hi>But a faithfull man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who can

that will not deceive us: but see here a

nothing but fidelitie, and truth it selfe; <hi>God
is faithfull, who will not suffer you to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
above that you are able,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13.
So faithfull is he that hath called you to buy
this precious commoditie, and will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 24. He is such an <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi>

                     <hi>Christ</hi> is a very rich Chapman,
and full of wealth, so that hee hath great
choice for his customers; He hath a shop so
furnished, that we can desire, or want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but he is well furnished with it; He
is full of grace and truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>Yea, it
hath pleased the Father, that in him all fulnesse

the fulnesse of the Godhead bodily, Col.</hi> 2. 9.
there is a fulnesse of all kinde of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that we can stand in need of; fulnesse
of wisedome, and knowledge, fulnesse of
faith, and love, &amp;c. in a word, all fulnesse
dwelleth in him, doth constantly abide in
him for ever; here is a shop stored with
precious commodities of all sorts whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
Oh the <hi>unsearchable riches of Christ!
Ephes.</hi> 3. 8. Let this also perswade us, that
if we want true saving grace, in whole, or
in part, to goe to <hi>Christ</hi> for it, and buy it of
him; <hi>If any lacke wisedome, let him aske it of
God, Jam.</hi> 1. 5. So if any want true saving

furnished, abundantly to supply our
wants, for all the treasures of wisedome, and
knowledge, and all other saving graces of

let him buy it of <hi>Christ,</hi> because he is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:4060:62"/>
of persons, he regardeth not the rich
more then the poore. Worldly chapmen,
that have great dealings in the world, they
shew most respect unto those, that are great
ones, Lords, and Ladies, &amp;c. a poore man
is forced many times to stay long, before he
can be served, (neither doe I simply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
this among men) but it is not so
with <hi>Christ, Acts</hi> 10. 35. <hi>Of a truth, I per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceive
that there is no respect of persons with
God, but in every Nation, he that feareth God
and worketh righteousnesse, is accepted with
him.</hi> Yea, he regardeth not the rich, more
then the poore, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 19. Wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are of no validitie in this respect; nay,
which is most strange, he regardeth the
poore, more then the rich, in some cases;
he maketh choice especially of them, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2.
5. He bargaineth rarely with such, as are
great, and wealthy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Not many
noble, not many wise men after the flesh, are
called;</hi> He passeth by the wise, and prudent,
and great persons of the world, and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his best commodities, on those, that in
the worlds account, are very babes, <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. You would wonder to heare of such a
man, that having his shop full of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and spying some poore man stand wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
at doore, should neglect all the great
persons present, and speake to the poore
man, and say, What would'st thou have, ô
thou poore creature, I will dispatch and
serve thee first of all: yet, thus dealeth
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:4060:63"/>
                     <hi>Christ,</hi> many times, with his poore custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
that have nothing to pay, but onely
hunger and thrist after the commoditie.
See upon what warrant I speake it; <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.
53. <hi>He hath filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he hath sent emptie away.</hi> Who
ever heard of such a Chapman, that before
he will bargaine, will be sure he is poore to
whom he selleth his commoditie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth
him before those that are wealthy,
and rich? Yea, he will scarce so much as
once looke at the rest. See a strange place
for this purpose, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. <hi>But to this man
will I looke, even to him that is poore, and of a
contrite heart,</hi> &amp;c. The poore humbled soule,
that hath neither money, nor money worth,
is, of all others, the most welcome to <hi>Christ;</hi>
yea, such are especially invited to him, <hi>Mat.</hi>
11. 28. <hi>Come unto mee all yee that labour,
and are heavie laden, and I will refresh you,</hi>
saith our blessed Saviour. See what a strange
message our Saviour sendeth in answere to
<hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist, when he sent his Disciples
to know whether he was the <hi>Christ,</hi> that
should come into the world, or they should
still looke for another, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 4, 5.)
<hi>Goe, and tell John, what things yee have heard
and seene: The blinde see, the lame walke,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>lepers are cleansed, the deafe heare, the dead are
raised up, and the poore have the Gospell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
unto them.</hi> He came himselfe chiefly to
preach the glad Tidings of the Gospell to
the poore; <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:4060:63"/>
God is upon me, therefore hath the Lord an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
me, he hath sent me to preach good ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
unto the poore.</hi> He loveth especially to
part with his commodities unto the poore;
and therefore he is a rare Chapman, with
whom there is no respect of persons at all,
unlesse it be in this, that he regardeth the
poore more then the rich: wherein he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
from all other chapmen in the world,
that are of a contrarie practice and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Reason.</hi> Free and kinde, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foording good wares exceeding cheape.</note> He is a very free, and a most
kinde Chapman, to his poore customers,
he selleth his commoditie very cheape, if
he see that the partie be fit to receive it, and
stand in great need of it; he never breaketh
with him for price; yea, he is resolved, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he shall have it without money, and
without price. Men usually deale other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
if they see that a mans necessitie is
great, that it is such a commoditie, which
he cannot be without, nor attaine unto
otherwhere, they will make him pay for
his need; and if he want readie money,
he shall pay still the dearer: but so it is not
with <hi>Christ,</hi> the more he seeth that a man
standeth in neede of grace, and is sensible of
his want that way, the cheaper he selleth
his commoditie, to such a person: nay, he
will rather give it him freely, then send
him away emptie; <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Hoe, every
one that thirsteth, come yee to the waters; and
he that hath no money, come,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:4060:64"/>
and without price.</hi> So, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 17.
<hi>Whosoever will, let him take of the Well of the
water of life freely.</hi> You would all thinke
him a marvellous kinde man, that should
deale thus with a poore Customer; Here is
your commoditie, I assure you upon my
credit, it will serve your turne, but have
you any money to pay for it? No. Have
you any pawne, or money worth? No.
Will any sufficient man, passe his word for
you? No. I have no such credit in the
world. What then, will you worke it out?
No sure, I have no hands to worke, untill
I have this commoditie, I can doe nothing,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Without mee, yee can doe nothing,</hi>
sayth our Saviour. All this is very hard,
What, will you pay me, if I will take your
owne word to this purpose? No surely,
I dare not promise that, I am scarce ever
likely to pay you, if you doe trust me. Well
then, if there be no remedie, take it for God
have mercy, even take it freely for nothing:
He will eyther trust him, or give it him
freely without price, rather then send such
a poore soule emptie away. Thus you see
another strong reason to perswade us to
bargaine with <hi>Christ,</hi> he selleth cheape,
yea, he giveth freely to the poore soule,
that is sensible of his want of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie.
Indeed, if he meet with a rich chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that cometh rather to cheapen, (for
fashion sake, then buy for necessitie,) he
then setteth such a price upon his wares,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:4060:64"/>
that he is sure cannot be reached by such a
barterer. See an experiment of this, in the
young man that came to our Saviour, and
would needs know the price of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>Good Master, what
good thing shall I doe, that I may have eternall
life?</hi> Come Sir, I like your commoditie,
What is your price? What? I see, you
would be doing; come I will set you a
taske, I perceive you are full of money;
you will be buying; well, I will set you a
price; <hi>Keepe the Commandements, Ver.</hi> 17.
see <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. <hi>I have observed these things from
my youth, what lacke I yet?</hi> Here was a man
full of money, he will pay downe all upon
the nayle, before he stirre his foote. Sir, if
this be your price, here is your money: or
at least, the most of it; what must I pay
more? then see what a rate he setteth him,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, goe, and sell
that thou hast, and give to the poore; and thou
shalt have treasure in heaven, and follow me.</hi>
Here was a great price indeed, he thought
it would utterly undoe him, and so he went
away (grieved) without his commoditie.
But otherwise, his rates are very easie, to
such as have an earnest desire to bargaine.</p>

we must labour to be sensible of our want of

poore by nature, but we are not sensible of
our povertie: we have a conceit, we are
rich, and full of wealth, and are not so
poore and miserable, as we are indeede.
Here was the folly of this Church of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,
Ver.</hi> 17. of this Chapter: <hi>Thou sayest,
I am rich, and encreased with goods, and have
neede of nothing; and knowest not, that thou
art wretched, and miserable, and poore, and
blinde, and naked:</hi> she was poore, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
but she perceived it not, she was not
sensible of it, and this kept her from buying
of <hi>Christ:</hi> therefore sayth our Saviour, <hi>I

as well as poore, and not sensible of thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie.
A man is not fit for <hi>Christ,</hi> untill he

7. 24. <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who shal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

deliver me from this bodie of death? Ver. 25
Thankes be to God, through Iesus Christ.</hi>
Wee must know, out of our experience,
what it is to be a sinner, before wee be fit
for a Saviour. It is an excellent speech of
our Saviour, to this purpose, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 13.
<hi>I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance.</hi> Why? Are we not all sinners?
Yes sure, but all are not truely sensible of
sinne; all doe not groane under the weight
and burthen of it: by sinners, in this place,
our Saviour meaneth, humbled, distressed,
grieved, perplexed sinners; for such alone
he knew were fit to accept of a Saviour;
such as <hi>are wearie, and heavie loaden, Mat.</hi>
11. 28. Such an one was David, <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.
3. <hi>Mine iniquities are gone over mine head,
as a weightie burthen, they are too heavie for

such an one, as was fitted for mercie.
<hi>I came to seeke, and to save that which was

                  <p>Now all are indeed lost, both in <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
and in themselves; but all are not sensible
of the danger of a lost estate: but by lost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
our Saviour meaneth such as are lost
in their owne apprehensions: such an one
was the poore <hi>Publican, Luk.</hi> 18. 14. <hi>He
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4060:66"/>
stood a farre off,</hi> as not worthy to come
neare the place of Gods speciall presence:
he durst not so much as looke up to heaven,
against which he had sinned, but <hi>smote upon

Here was just such a sinner as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
there speaketh of: one qualified, and
fitted for mercie. Iust such another was the
Prodigall, what sendeth him to the market
of his fathers house, but the sight and sense
of his povertie, and extreame necessitie,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>How many hired servants in my

<hi>Ver.</hi> 17. <hi>I will arise,</hi> and goe to the

the market in any case, though the dayes be
short, the wayes fowle, and the weather
stormie, and tempestuous; for, sayth he, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
be wet to the skinne, then perish for
want of bread: yea, and such a man will
have bread, if it cost him all that he hath
in his purse, and can borrow: so in this
case, he is fit to bargaine with <hi>Christ,</hi> that
is sensible of his extreame neede of <hi>Christ,</hi>

the Prophet in another case, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>Woe

true saving grace, one dramme whereof is
more precious, then all the whole world

which will <hi>satisfie,</hi> and give full <hi>content to</hi>

world besides, yet he might, nay, he must
needs perish without this. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
this will bring a man to heaven, if he
were as poore as <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Now he is a fit

This our Saviour sheweth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.
44. <hi>The kingdome of heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>Christ,</hi>

<hi>compared to a treasure hid in the field, which
when a man hath found, sc.</hi> and seeth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth

<hi>If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
drinke.</hi> You see, that onely the thirstie soules
are invited to <hi>Christ:</hi> a man without this

likely to make a right use of it, such onely
will take paines to procure, and be at great

would bargaine with <hi>Christ</hi> for true saving

                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Direction</hi> Diligence in frequenting the place of sale.</note> Diligence and constancie in
frequenting the place of sale; this also must
needs follow upon the three former dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
For, he that is, first, sensible of the
want of grace; secondly, knoweth the right
worth of grace; thirdly, and hungreth and
thirsteth after it, cannot but in the fourth
place, with all possible diligence, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse,
frequent the place of sale.</p>
                  <p>Buying, presupposeth going to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.
He that would have true saving grace,
must diligently, and constantly frequent
Gods house, and Ordinances. He is worthy
to goe without his commoditie, that will
not frequent the place of sale. A wise man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4060:68"/>
will watch for an opportunitie to procure
that commoditie, that will serve his turne;
he will come one market day after another,
untill he be furnished: and he is a blessed
man that doth thus, and that in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and opinion of wisedome her selfe:
observe it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Blessed is the man that
heareth me, watching daily at my gates, and
giving attendance at the postes of my doores.</hi>
Happie is that man that daily frequents
Wisedomes markets, and diligently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in Gods house and Ordinances. Thus
was <hi>Paul's</hi> direction to the Elders of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi>
he sendeth them still to the market,
<hi>Acts</hi> 20. 32. <hi>And now, Brethren, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
you to God, and to the Word of his grace,
which is able to build you up farther,</hi> &amp;c.
Here is the meanes both to get, and increase
grace. This made Gods Saints love Gods
house and Ordinances so exceeding dearely.
Let me instance in <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Davids</hi> love to Gods house and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> in stead of all the
rest: oh his admirable love to Gods house
and Ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ances! <hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 8. <hi>Lord, I have
loved the habitation of thine house, and the
place where thine honour dwelleth:</hi> he was a
constant frequenter of this spirituall mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket:
yea, see how he manifested his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
affection that way, he was even sicke
when he was kept from the market. Give
me leave to informe you of one singular pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of his, to this purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>One
thing have I desired of the Lord, and that I will
require, and seeke after,</hi> (but one thing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid?</hi>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:4060:69"/>
surely then, that is a matter of some
speciall importance. It may be another king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
or such another crown, as that which
was taken from the King of <hi>Rabbah?</hi> No
surely, it was no such matter; but onely
this, <hi>sc.</hi> libertie to enjoy the benefit of Gods
house, and Ordinances, he desired onely to
keepe the market) <hi>sc. That I may dwell in
the house of the Lord, all the dayes of my life,
and enquire in his Temple.</hi> As if he had sayd,
Lord, what a doe is here in the world with
many, one would be rich, and another
would be honourable, this man is for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and that for profit: well, let them take
all, so that I may enjoy the libertie of Gods
house and Ordinances, the meanes of grace,
the pledges of Gods favour; let me have
but this one thing alone, and let them take
all the rest. This is <hi>Davids</hi> one thing. And
no marvell, if he was thus earnest in this
case; for <hi>Davids</hi> one thing, is the <hi>one thing
needfull,</hi> and that in the judgement and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 42.
<hi>One Thing is needfull, Mary hath chosen the
good part, which shall not be taken from her.</hi>
And surely there is good reason for this;
here is the place of Gods speciall presence,
this is (as it were) the shop of <hi>Christ,</hi> here
he walketh, and talketh with his customers,
and here he selleth his precious commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
<hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 1. we there finde him <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the middest of the golden Candlestickes;</hi>
still present in the Church assemblies; yea,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:4060:69"/>
there he hath promised to be present, in a
most speciall manner, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
two or three are gathered together in my
Name, there am I,</hi> even in the middest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them: there he standeth looking
for customers, and calling in such as are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to passe his shop, and never so much as
once thinking to cheapen his commoditie,
untill they heare him cry, What doe yee
lacke, O yee poore soules? Why will yee
not come unto me, that yee might have
grace here, and glorie hereafter? See how
he proclaimeth open market, and describeth
his commodities, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Hoe, every one
that thirsts, come yee to the waters, buy wine,
and milke without money:</hi> I will sell the best
ware, very cheape; yea, if thou be a poore
needie soule, and hast no money, I will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
trust thee, and take thy word, or give
it freely without price: yea, see how he
chideth them, for not frequenting his shop,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 40. <hi>But yee will not come unto me, that
yee might have life. Why doe you lay out your
money, for that which is not bread, and spend
your labour, for that which satisfieth not? Isa.</hi>
55. 2. Why doe yee goe where you are
cheated, and cozened, with drosse, in stead
of gold; and will not come at me, where
you shall be faithfully, and kindly dealt
withall? And therefore againe he inviteth
them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Encline your eare, and come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me; heare, and your soule shall live.</hi> They
that neglect the market, are likely to starve,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:4060:70"/>
and perish for want of grace, and glorie:
<hi>Salvation is farre from the wicked, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
not thy Statutes,</hi> sayth <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119.
155. He that despiseth Gods Ordinances,
is farre from salvation. This is the fourth
thing requisite for the making of this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with <hi>Christ, sc.</hi> Diligence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie
in frequenting the house of sale.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Direction</hi> Pay the full price.</note> He that would bargaine with
<hi>Christ,</hi> must pay the price of it, to the worth
of the commoditie, though it cost him all
that he hath. Now we come to the very
price of the Iewell. A naturall man will
thinke it too much, but the truth is, it is an
excellent peni-worth; for he must part with
nothing, but what he hath of his owne, and
what he may well spare; <hi>He goeth, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all that he hath, and buyeth that field,</hi> sayth
our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 44. Let no man thinke
it deare, because he must sell all that he hath,
before he can buy it of <hi>Christ;</hi> for, alas!
what doth our Saviour meane by, <hi>All that he
hath?</hi> but that which he hath of his owne;
not his wealth, nor his wit, nor his life,
(save onely in some cases,) but all that he
hath, that is, all his sinnes, all his lusts, all
his earthly members, his corrupt and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
affections, his actuall transgressions:
these he must needs sell, these he may well
spare, nay, these will be his utter ruine, if he
sell them not. See how the Lord expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it himselfe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 31. <hi>Cast away
from you all your transgressions, and make you
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:4060:70"/>
a new heart, and a new soule. Why will ye die,
O house of Israell?</hi> We must not stand dodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Christ,</hi> but part with our sinnes
freely, and we shall have a most blessed, and
happie exchange.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6 <hi>Direction</hi> Prepare a fit vessell to put it in.</note> To the making of this bargaine,
there is another thing necessary, and that is,
That wee must prepare a vessell to put it in.
When a man hath bought his commoditie,
and payed the price of it, then he looketh
for his wallet, or basket, or something to
carie it home in: so that all that come to
this spirituall market, to bargaine with
<hi>Christ,</hi> for this jewell of true saving grace,
they must bring hearts emptie, and ready to
receive it. <hi>Open thy mouth wide, and I will
fill it,</hi> sayth the Text, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 10. Come
hither, sayth God, let me see thy heart, open
the mouth of thy heart, that it may be fit to
receive, and cary away this precious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.
See the practise of Gods people
for this, this was <hi>David's</hi> practise, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
11. <hi>I have hid thy Word in my heart, that I
might not sinne against thee.</hi> So the <hi>Baereans,
They received the Word with all readinesse of
minde, Acts</hi> 17. 11. This was <hi>Lydia's</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
<hi>God opened the heart of Lydia, that shee
attended to those things that were spoken by
Paul, Acts</hi> 16. 14. This was a piece of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes</hi>
good housewifery, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 51. <hi>Shee
kept these sayings, and pondered them in her
heart.</hi> When we come to Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
we must have a speciall care to prepare
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:4060:71"/>
our hearts to that purpose, that we may be
able to say with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 108. 1. <hi>O God
my heart is prepared,</hi> or, <hi>my heart is readie.
My sonne, give me thine heart,</hi> sayth <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
Pro.</hi> 23. 26. Yea, see how expresly the
Lord required it of old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 46. <hi>Set
your hearts unto all the words that I command
you this day, (i. e.)</hi> here is saving grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to thee in this Ordinance, let me see
thine heart, what hast thou else to put it in?
trust not thy memory alone with it, but
hide it, with <hi>David,</hi> in the middest of thy
heart.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7. <hi>Direction</hi> A care to keepe it from loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> There must be a speciall care,
to keepe it from loosing, when we have it.
If a man goe to market, on purpose to buy
some precious jewell, which costeth him
all that he hath, he is undone if he loose it
by the way; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. Take heed of loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the grace of God, let it not run out,
as the word importeth; <hi>Proove all things,
and keepe that which is good,</hi> sayth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Blessed are they that heare
the Word of God, and keepe it.</hi> It is not the
hearing of Gods Word, but the keeping of
it, that is the way to true happinesse. If a
man buy never so good a peny-worth, if he
loose it by the way, it will never enrich
him. Therefore after we have bought the
commoditie, there must be a care to keepe
it; let us knit up the mouth of our vessell,
by prayer, and meditation, that wee loose
not our treasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:4060:71"/>
Eighthly and lastly,<note place="margin">8. Direction</note> A care to make a
right use of it, both in regard of our selves,
and others. This last direction,<note place="margin">2. Branches.</note> divideth
it selfe into two branches.</p>
                  <p>First, He that hath bought true saving <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
grace,<note place="margin">Make use of it for our selves, &amp;</note> must labour to make use of it for his
owne particular. Commodities are bought
to be used; cloathes to be worne; meate to
be eaten, &amp;c. so when we goe to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
of Gods Ordinances, to get grace, we
must have a care to practise what we know,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22. <hi>Be yee doers of the Word, and not
hearers onely, deceiving your selves.</hi> He that
contenteth himselfe with bare hearing, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his markets undone, or, at least hath
lost his commoditie. <hi>If yee know these things,
happie are yee if ye doe them,</hi> sayth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. 17. See the use that <hi>David</hi>
would make of this precious commoditie,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 11. <hi>I have hid thy Word in mine
heart, that I might not sinne against thee.</hi> To
make grace an Antidote or preservative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne, is the right use of it indeed.
<hi>Labour not for the meat that perisheth, but for
the meat that endureth,</hi> sayth our Saviour,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. What should we doe with meat
but eate it? The best meate in the world,
will never nourish, unlesse it be eaten: and
therefore sayth the Prophet, <hi>Come, buy and
eate, and let your soule delight it selfe in fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
Eating, and digesting, is the end of
buying food; and practise, the end of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.
The want of this, was the fault of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel's</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:4060:72"/>
hearers: they came to the market,
and seemed to buy good provision; but they
wanted good stomackes to digest it; <hi>They
heare thy words, but they will not doe them;</hi>
their stomackes were cloyed before, they
had gotten a surfet of covetousnesse, <hi>Ezech.</hi>
33. 31.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Branch</hi> 2. Dispose of it for the good of others.</note> A care to make a right use of
it, in regard of others. Men do not buy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
for their owne use onely, but also
for their families, and neighbours: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a familie, buyeth provision not onely
for himselfe, but for his wife, and children,
and servants; yea, if he be a kinde man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede,
he will invite his neighbours, and
make them partakers of his good provision.
<hi>Vnto him that hath</hi> (this care to employ it)
<hi>shall be given, and he shall have abundance,
Mat.</hi> 25. 29. But he that layeth it up in a
napkin, and maketh no use of it, neither for
himselfe, nor the good of others, shall have
it taken from him at last; and himselfe be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
for want of making a right use of it,
<hi>ver.</hi> 30. But every good man is of a quite
contrary disposition: observe it in, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.
30, 31. <hi>The mouth of the righteous speaketh
wisdome, and his tongue will be talking of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
Whence cometh this? The Law of
God is in his <hi>heart, and none of his steps slide.</hi>
He that hath the law of grace setled in his
owne heart, will not onely take heed to his
owne wayes, but will labour also, to be an
instrument of benefit, and good to others.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4060:72"/>
See an experiment of this, in two famous
examples for this purpose. 1. That of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psal.</hi> 51. 13. <hi>Then shall I teach thy wayes
to the wicked, and sinners shall be converted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee.</hi> So see what the Lord sayth of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Gen.</hi> 18. 19. <hi>I know Abraham, that he
will command his children, and servants, to
keepe the way of the Lord.</hi> He will not onely
walke holily before God himselfe, but also
will doe his best endeavour, to reforme his
familie, and put away iniquitie from his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles.
See the practise of this, in that
<hi>Samaritan</hi> Convert, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 20. when our
Saviour had dealt effectually with her; see
what a care she had to impart this precious
commoditie, for the use and benefit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
she ranne into the Citie, and sayd to
the men of that place, <hi>Come, see a Man, that
hath told me all that ever I did: Is not he the
Christ?</hi> She useth the best, and the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
argument that shee could possibly
thinke of, to bring them to <hi>Christ.</hi> She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
him to be a Man that could tell won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
that she might perswade them to come
unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and be wrought upon, as well
as her selfe. Here is the right use of grace
received, to employ it, not onely for our
owne use, but also for the benefit, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and comfort of others.</p>

amongst us,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sort.</hi> Such as doe despite the place of sale, or come not to the market.</note> that utterly reject Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and despise, and contemne the Word
faithfully preached, &amp;c. these are such as
come not to the market, they frequent not
the place of sale, but eyther totally, or for
the most part, absent themselves: <hi>Yee will
not come unto me, that yee might have life:</hi>
You might have grace, and spirituall life for
your soules, if you would but come, and
fetch it, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 40. But your destruction
is upon your selves, your blood will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at your owne hands, you have even
pined and starved your soules, by your grosse
neglect of the market, where you might
have had provision, and food for your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
soules; which are now, like to perish
for want of food, <hi>Hoe, every one that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth,
come yee to the waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4060:73"/>
This is an evident signe, that they neither
know the worth of grace, nor find the want
of grace in themselves, but like the Church
here, thinke they are rich, and filled with
goods, and stand in need of nothing, and
know not, that they are wretched, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,
and poore, and blinde, and naked:
woe be to these rich, and full soules, for they
are like to be sent empty away, if they doe
come; and sure to perish for ever, if they
doe not come. Oh that all such would lay
to heart those terrifying Texts of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 47. <hi>He that is of God, heareth
Gods Word: yee therefore heare them not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
yee are not of God.</hi> It is a fearefull signe
of reprobation, obstinately to refuse the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of Gods Word faithfully preached.
Oh that all popish, and prophane persons
would consider this: it is a fearefull signe
they are none of Gods. The other heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaking
place to this purpose, is that of our
Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 26. <hi>My sheepe heare my

life.</hi> This is the very eare-marke of
a sheepe of <hi>Christ,</hi> that he heareth Gods
Word, and <hi>Christs</hi> voyce. It must needes
therefore be the Character of a Goate, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,
and reject it: there is no <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
sheepe, and goates, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31.

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sort.</hi> Such as mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend their ime there.</note> Some come indeede to the

spend their time, in walking here, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementing
there, and never once cheapen
the commoditie, that is there to be sold:
these are negligent, and carelesse hearers.
I have observed how strangely men spend
their time in the Church assemblies; some
walking, and whispering; some jeering,
and laughing; some sleeping; some reading
upon a booke, while the Minister is eyther
praying, or preaching: doe such men spend
their time well at market? for shame sleepe
not at market: surely you may come to have
your purse picked,<note place="margin">Sleeping at market, dangerous.</note> while you are asleepe:
certainly, the devill doth even watch for
such an opportunitie; while you sleepe, the

tares in stead of the pure graine of true
grace, which you might have had sowen in
your hearts, if you had watchfully and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

                  <p>Thirdly, Some come, and seeme to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Sort.</hi> Some aske the price onely, but b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but receive nothing, all runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides:
these cheapen the commoditie, but
bid nothing: these are never likely to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with <hi>Christ;</hi> they onely would know
the price of grace, and what it would cost
to become religious; but they meane not
to practise any thing. These were <hi>Ezechiel's</hi>
Chapmen, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31. They came, and
heard; they came to the market, and they
asked the price, for they seemed to be very
serious in hearing; but they would bid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
they would heare all, but doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but do rather reject a good bargaine,
when it is offered, and thrust it from them.
Oh the wofull estate of these persons, that
doe cast the Commandements of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
their backes, and come with a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
onely to heare and know, but doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
<hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
onely, deceiving your owne selves, Jam.</hi> 1.
22. He doth utterly deceive himselfe, that
thinketh bare hearing will serve the turne,
to bring him to heaven: it is not cheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but buying, and paying downe, that
procureth this commoditie. See the wofull
estate of all such, set out in that Text of the
Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>It was necessary that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:4060:75"/>
the Word of God, should be first preached unto
you; but seeing that yee thrust it from you, and
judge your selves unworthy of everlasting life;
behold, we turne to the Gentiles:</hi> they judge
themselves unworthy of such a precious
jewell, that carelesly thrust it from them,
and bid nothing for it. Here is the third
sort.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Sort.</hi> Some bid fairely, but not the full price.</note> Some goe a little, and not
onely cheapen the commoditie, but also bid
fairely for it, but will not come to the price;
they would have it under the worth, or not
at all. These are such as are content to part
with some sinnes, and doe many things,
but will not be universall in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Now you know the price is, <hi>All that
we have, Mat.</hi> 13. 44. He that will not
part with every lust, and readily abandon
every base corruption, is not fit to be a
Chapman for <hi>Christ;</hi> he is but an Higler,
or a dodging companion, that will have a
thing quite under the worth, and at his
owne rate, or else he will none of it; he
cannot abide, to fell all that he hath. Such
an one was <hi>Herod, Mark.</hi> 6. 20. He reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced
his person, and ministery, and heard
him gladly, and did many things, but would
not forgoe his incest. Such was <hi>Iehu,</hi> zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in many things, but would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
his Idolatry; he was loth to come off
with the whole price. See how the Spirit
of God reports it, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10. 31. <hi>But Iehu
tooke no heede to walke in the Law of the Lord,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:4060:75"/>
with all his heart; for he departed not from the
sinnes of Ieroboam:</hi> This he kept as a sweete
morsell in his mouth, and would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
it. But a good Chapman is readie to
give the whole price, will sell all that he
hath, that he may buy that field. This was
the Apostles practise, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 16. <hi>Herein
doe I exercise my selfe, to have alwayes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
voyde of offence, towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
men.</hi> So, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 18. <hi>Pray for us,
for we trust we have a good conscience, desiring
in all things to live honestly.</hi> Such a Chapman
was holy <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. 6. <hi>Then shall I
not be confounded, when I have respect unto all
thy Commandements:</hi> here is the full price.
But when a man is content to part with
some sinnes, but not with other; seemeth to
make conscience of some duties, but is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
carelesse in regard of others; he doth
but scotch with God, he is but a dodging
companion, he is not a fit Chapman for
<hi>Christ,</hi> unlesse he will sell all that he hath,
and buy that field. Here is the fourth sort of
bad Chapmen. They bid faire, but when
they come to stake downe, they will have
something abated of the full price, or else
no bargaine: and so these goe away emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Some bid faire,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Sort.</hi> Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise the full price, but doe after revoke it.</note> and are readie
to promise the full price, but when they
come to pay, they revoke the bargaine, and
goe backe with their word, and will not
stand to their promise: these are Apostata's,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:4060:76"/>
that doe seeme to be wrought upon, but fall
off againe at last, and renounce the bargaine:
so these Chapmen fall off, for want of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
these, notwithstanding all their
vowes, and promises, returne, <hi>like the dog to
his vomit, and the sow,</hi> that was washed, <hi>to
her wallowing in the mire,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. So
these <hi>returne to folly, Psal.</hi> 85. 9. Oh the
wofull estate of these persons, unlesse they
repent, and <hi>doe their first workes,</hi> they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
likely to bargaine with <hi>Christ,</hi> but fall
off from God, by inconstancie, and fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and so, <hi>The later end of these men, was
worse then the beginning: And they had better
never to have knowne the way of righteousnes,</hi>
then thus shamefully to <hi>depart from the holy
Commandement:</hi> they were better never to
have bidden one peny, then promise the
whole price, but immediately revoke it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Sort.</hi> Some want hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</note> Some want an heart to receive

home, or filled with other trash, that there
is no roome to receive grace: these leave
their commoditie at market, for want of a
vessell to put it in: their hearts are gone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their covetousnesse, or rent in pieces
with the thoughts, and cares of this life,
and so they goe home againe, utterly unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
of this precious commoditie; eyther
for want of a vessell, or at least, roome to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it, forgetting <hi>David's</hi> practise, <hi>I have
hid thy Word in my heart;</hi> or the Lords owne
admonition, <hi>Set your hearts to all these words<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Deut.</hi> 32. 46. These are another sort of bad
Chapmen, that leave their commodities at
market for want of cariage; contrary to the
Lords expresse command, to this purpose,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>These words which I command thee,
shall be in thy heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7. <hi>Sort.</hi> Loose their commoditie.</note> Some are forgetfull, and lose
hearers, that seeme to bid faire, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the commoditie, but loose all, before
they get home. These loose all their labour,
as well as the rest. These forget to tie up the
mouth of their hearts, by some holy prayer
to God; and so loose by the way, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> contrarie to that advise of the
holy Ghost, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Let us feare, least at any
time, a promise being made unto us, of entring
into rest, any of you should seeme to come short,</hi>
or suffer it to runne out, as the word signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth.
A commoditie is bought to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if there be not a care to preserve, and
keepe it from loosing, when wee have it.
1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Prove all things, and keepe that
which is good;</hi> 1. keep it in memorie, labour,
not to forget it: 2. Keepe it in affection,
love, and embrace it. 3. Keepe it in practise,
with all speed, and diligence set about the
performance of it. But contrarie hereunto
is the practise of many, who seeme to heare
with some good affection, for the present,
but immediately their hearts are coole, and
they are straight of another temper, and the
complaint of these men is onely of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie,
they have the worst memories that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:4060:77"/>
ever had any, but when the matter commeth
to be throughly sifted, the fault is in their
affections, and not in their memorie; like
a man that having lost his markets by the
way, or left them behinde him, complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
of his wallet, or basket, that had an
hole in it: whereas the truth is, it was his
carelesnesse, and not his forgetfulnesse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
when the wallet commeth to be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and made use of for other things, it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
well enough: so mens memories retaine
other vanities strongly enough, onely they
forget that which should doe them good in
regard of their soules: these unjustly lay
the blame upon their memories, whereas
the fault indeede is in their hearts, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
Here is another sort of bad Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
such as loose their commodities.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8. <hi>Sort.</hi> Some are robbed of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, as they returne home.</note> There is yet another sort, that
are justly to be reproved, though they seeme
not to be in so great fault, as the former;
and they are such as are robbed of their
commodities, as they returne home. These
are such as seeme very honest hearers, and
doe many things, yea, seeme to take much
delight in approaching to God; but in time
of temptation, they fall away, they are quite
dryed up, with the scorching heate of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;
they are set upon by the way, and
the devill taketh away that seede of grace,
that was sowne in their hearts, and so at
last, they returne home, not onely emptie of
grace, but wounded with sinne. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:4060:77"/>
seemeth to set out such market-folke,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 32. <hi>When tribulation or persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ariseth, because of the Word,</hi> then <hi>by and
by, they are offended,</hi> and so come home
wounded with Sathans assaults. Me think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
such as are driven off by the heate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution,
are just like unto such Chapmen,
as goe to the market on foote, in a hote sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
day, and put their markets in their
bosomes, but being set upon by the heate of
the Sunne, they unbutton their doublets to
get ayre, and so loose their commodities;
so many set upon good duties, in their owne
strength, and so at last are driven off from
the service of <hi>Christ,</hi> by the heate of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.
Here is the eighth sort.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">9. <hi>Sort.</hi> Some are quarrelling Chapmen, that fall out with the partie that felleth it.</note> Another sort are quarrelling
Chapmen, that will have the commoditie
at their owne price, or else they will fall
out with the party that selleth it, and setteth
the price too deare (as they thinke:) These
are such hearers, as cannot abide to part
with their sinnes, and yet hope to goe to
heaven, as soone as the best: they make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
they can serve God, and sinne too;
God, and <hi>Mammon</hi> too; God, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
too; God, and their bellies too; and
therefore when a Minister telleth such cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
persons, they must sell all that they
have, they are readie to fall out, and fight
with him; <hi>They blesse themselves in their
owne hearts, and say; I shall have peace, though
I walke after the stubbornnesse of mine owne
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4060:78"/>
heart;</hi> I hope to goe to heaven without
halfe this adoe: these are quarrelling Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Such an one was <hi>Herod,</hi> he putteth <hi>Iohn</hi>
in prison, because <hi>Iohn</hi> would not bate him
an ace, not a peny in the matter of <hi>Herodias,
Mark.</hi> 6. <hi>It is not lawfull for thee to have her,</hi>
sayth <hi>Iohn.</hi> No, sayth <hi>Herod:</hi> If I may not
have my brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, thou shalt not
have thy libertie: here was a quarrelling
Auditor. There are too many such as these
in the world, at this present. If a Man of
God, be faithfull to <hi>Christ,</hi> and tell them,
they must part with their lusts, or else have
no part in <hi>Christ,</hi> nor interest in heaven,
though he proove it never so substantially,
yet they will hate him, and spite him for
this, because he setteth too high a rate upon
this precious commoditie of true saving
grace. Iust such a Chapman was <hi>Ahab,</hi> see
how he quarrelleth with <hi>Elijah,</hi> and with
<hi>Michajah:</hi> observe it, how he greets that
faithfull Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 20. <hi>Hast
thou found Me, O mine enemie!</hi> Why? what
was the matter? he knew, he was readie to
chide him for taking away <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
he ever looked when he should heare
him say, <hi>Thou hast sold thy selfe to worke evill
in the sight of the Lord,</hi> and hast shed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood of honest <hi>Naboth.</hi> So what
was his quarrell to <hi>Michajah?</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 8.
<hi>There is one Prophet more, but I hate him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he never prophesieth good of me, but evill:</hi>
He selleth his Sermons too deare, I cannot
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4060:78"/>
abide him, if he doe not comply with the
rest, send him to prison, and feed him with
the bread of affliction, untill <hi>Ahab</hi> returne.
Here is unjust dealing, when men will have
a commoditie at their owne rates, or else
quarrell with him that selleth it.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly and lastly,<note place="margin">10. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

                     </note> There is another sort,
that doe utterly cry downe the market.
What need so much Preaching, and such
running after Sermons? there was never
good world, since so much preaching came
up, &amp;c. These doe even cry downe the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and will neither goe to Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
themselves, nor suffer others to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
them. These are absolutely the worst
of all that I have yet mentioned. They are
enemies to Gods people, <hi>because they follow
the thing that is good:</hi> Oh that such would
consider the folly, and absurditie of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and practise, and withall, the great
danger that they are in, while they so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
Let them seriously consider of these
two places of Scripture; the one is, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.
28. <hi>And in nothing be terrified by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
which is to them, a token of perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to you of salvation, and that of God.</hi>
All that oppose Gods people, for frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Gods Ordinances, and the spirituall
market of <hi>Christ,</hi> are sonnes of perdition,
(like the great Antichrist their Father) and
the very tokens of perdition, are even stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
upon them. The other place, for this
purpose, is that of the Apostle, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 10.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:4060:79"/>
See what <hi>Paul</hi> that Man of God sayth there
to that limme of Sathan, <hi>Elymas</hi> the sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
that sought to turne away the Deputie
from the faith, and endeavoured, eyther to

that felleth it.<note place="margin">It is Christ that felleth it, who is so rare a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man as you have heard.</note> What greater comfort
then this, to know that true grace, is at the
dispose of thy Saviour? Indeede, if thou
didst stand in neede of a thing, which was
wholly at Sathans dispose, thy case was ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible;
but now for thy comfort, consider,
that as thou canst not be saved without
grace, so this true saving grace is at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who is the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Chapman that ever was knowne, or
heard of. Consider the reasons of the poynt:
He is a Chapman of a most sweet dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
He is very well stored, with all kinde
of precious, and heavenly treasures; and
He is no respecter of persons; He thinketh
never a whit the worse of thee, for thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie;
nay, He esteemeth so much better of
thee, because thou art sensible of thy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
penurie; and then, how freely doth
He part with his commodities? How
cheape doth he sell, to such as are truely
humbled? He requireth nothing of thee,
but what thou mayest well spare; He will
give thee beautie, for ashes; robes, for
rags; onely sell all thy sinnes, and part with
thy lusts, (that otherwise would keepe thee
out of heaven) and assure thy selfe then, He
will never breake with thee for price,
though thou hast neither money, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-worth,
yet he will bestow this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
commoditie upon thee, and desireth
onely to finde thee emptie, and hungry:
doe but hunger and thirst after it, and it is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4060:80"/>
thine owne. And therefore all you that
feele any want of true saving grace, goe to
<hi>Christ</hi> for it; and assure your selves, you
cannot be so readie to desire it, as he is to
bestow it; nor so forward to aske, as he
is to give, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Aske, and yee shall
have; seeke, and you shall finde; knocke, and
it shall be opened.</hi> Nay, farther, he is so
readie to heare thee, that he will prevent
thy request, and petitions. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 24.
<hi>It shall come to passe, that when they call, I
will answere; and while they are yet speaking, I
will heare.</hi> Doest thou see (<hi>Luk.</hi> 15.) how
readie the old man was to cloath the tatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Prodigall? God is so readie to helpe his
children: <hi>Christ</hi> is so readie to cloath and
refresh his poore members. Yea, for thy
farther comfort, consider the fidelitie of this
Chapman; assure thy selfe, he will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thee, he cannot deny himselfe; thou
mayest safely repose thy confidence in him,
for matter, and measure, and time; assure

let him buy it of <hi>Christ;</hi> goe to <hi>Christ</hi> for
grace at the first, yea, and goe to <hi>Christ</hi> for
a farther increase of true grace; see thy
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:4060:80"/>
want of grace, labour to know the worth
of grace, hunger and thirst after it, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the Ordinances, &amp;c. and assure thy
selfe, the God of all grace shall be with
thee. But of this in the first use. But that
which I especially desire to presse at this
present, is to exhort, and direct, such as
desire grace, not onely for themselves, but
also even for others; godly neighbours,
that would have others religious, as well as
themselves; godly masters, and parents,
that would put away iniquitie from their
tabernacles; and desire to have saving grace
wrought in the hearts of their children, and
servants. This was godly <hi>Iosuah's</hi> care, and
pious resolution, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24. 15. <hi>I, and my
house, will serve the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for Direction to such as are thus
graciously affected, and lovingly disposed
towards others, in generall, I say. Let
such consider, that they must buy it of
<hi>Christ,</hi> for themselves, and their families.
What they should doe for themselves, I
have alreadie shewed: and what they
should doe for their families,<note place="margin">And for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> I will now
endeavour to manifest. Thus then,</p>
                  <p>First, In the generall, you must have a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
care to bring them to the market.<note place="margin">1 Direction generall. Bring them to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</note> When
some of your familie want new things, you
usually take them to the market, that they
may be fitted for the purpose. This is the
generall Direction, bring them to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
see that thy children, and servants doe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:4060:81"/>
constantly frequent the Church assemblies;
<hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 1. <hi>Hoe, every one that thirsteth, come
yee to the waters.</hi> Doest thou thirst after the
salvation of thy wife, or children, or ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?
O then bring them to the waters,
pray earnestly to God for them, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
bring them to the publike Ordinance.
It is the safest buying things, (eyther for
our selves, or our families) in the publike
Market place. Bring thy children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to Gods house, and Ordinances. It
is not enough, to be constantly there our
selves, unlesse we bring our children, and
servants with us. See upon what proofe I
speake it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 11, 12. <hi>When all Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
shall come to appeare before the Lord thy
God, in the place which he shall choose; Thou
shalt reade this Law before all Israel. Gather
the people together, men, women, and children,
and the stranger that is within thy gates, that
they may heare, and learne to feare the Lord
thy God,</hi> &amp;c. So then this is the first thing
in the generall; doe not content thy selfe
to come alone to Gods Ordinances, but also
bring thy children, and servants with thee:
for God will not say unto thee, in that case,
as he did to <hi>Adam, Where art thou?</hi> but as
unto <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Where is thy Brother?</hi>
So, where is thy wife? and where are thy
children, and servants? What make they
abroad about foolish vanities, when they
should be present here in the Church assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies?
When they should be making mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:4060:81"/>
for their soules? Command them to
keepe the way of the Lord, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. When thou commest out of
thine owne house, with a purpose to goe to
Gods house, say unto thy familie, as, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.
3. <hi>Come, let us goe up to the house of the Lord,
and he will teach us of his wayes, and we will
walke in his pathes.</hi> This is sweet musicke in
the eares of God Almightie, when we thus
stirre up one another to love, and unto good
workes. Thus in the generall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Direction</hi> In speciall, prepare them before hand.</note> Doe thy best endeavour, to
fit, and prepare them before they come to
Gods publike Ordinances; labour to <hi>plow
up the fallow ground of their hearts, Jer.</hi> 4. 3.
When you have a purpose to take your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
abroad to market, you cause them to
make preparation, and to put on faire
cloathes, and not to come abroad in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie,
or filthie apparell. Doe so in this case,
helpe them to put on the wedding garment
of due preparation; have a care to pray
with them, and for them. Thus <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi>
10. 1. <hi>My hearts desire, and prayer to God
for Israel is, that they might be saved.</hi> Doe
thy best, to prepare, and fit them: for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of our preparation,
will be (for the most part) our profit. Oh
therefore take paines with them in private,
by godly advise, and counsell, catechise,
and instruct them, teach them before they
come to the market, how to lay out their
money; especially, forget not to pray with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:4060:82"/>
them, and for them, that they may speed
well, and prosper in making holy markets
for their soules.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Direction</hi> Bring them with thee, left they tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away their t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

and neither send them before, nor let them
stay behind thee: For, alas! children, and
youth, being sent to the market alone, will
play by the way, and trifle away their time,
untill the market be done. And therefore
saith <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 42. 4. <hi>When I went with
the multitude, I led them to the House of
God.</hi> Not as the practise of some is, that
say, well, I will goe to Church, wife,
make haste, and come away; she stayeth
a great while, before she be ready, and the
children and servants as long after her, that
the market is almost done, ere the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily

say, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>Come, let us goe up to the house
of the Lord,</hi> and labour to see, that thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

thy selfe; that they may say unto thee; as
some did to <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Come,</hi> Sirs, <hi>let us goe

<hi>I was glad when they said unto mee, let us

and ply their markets, when they are
come: let them not stand, and looke about
them, or laugh, or talke, as too many doe;
sleepe, as some doe: have an eye to your

that are in the speciall presence of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
You know children are apt to
trifle away their time, let slip the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of making their markets: Besides,
they may soone come to have their purses
picked, or be cousened, and cheated of their
mony: there is that old Serpent, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
that watcheth his opportunity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
them, and doe them a mischiefe,
therefore I say, as, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 18. <hi>Take heed

                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Direction</hi> Examine them when they come home, what markets they have made.</note> To make them the more carefull,
and warie, you must constantly examine
them, (when they come home,) what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
they have made, and how they have
hid out their money: this after reckoning,
will make them diligent, and heedfull. So
when they come from the Church, the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket

encouraging them, if they doe well,
and shew care, and diligence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,

of all honest lawfull endeavours, and then
prayer unto God for his blessing upon their
journey; the old man had more confidence
in his prayers, then his presents. So when
we have given our children, and servants
the best direction that wee are able, let us
ever conclude all with prayer to God for
his blessing, for <hi>He is that Father of lights,
from whom commeth every good, and perfect

him, and from him, are all things, to him bee
honour, and glory, now, and for ever:</hi> it is
the conclusion of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 36.
Thus through the good hand of God upon
me, I have finished this point, wherein I
have shewed; That all that would have
true saving grace, must buy it of <hi>Christ.</hi>
In handling of which point, I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
Why wee must doe it, and how wee
must doe it, and also how much they are

wee may, not onely make this golden pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase

our selves, but also direct, and assist
such as are committed unto our charge.</p>
                  <p>Now my humble and heartie request is,
to the God of all grace, for his blessing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these unworthy labours; And that as
the paines, through Gods assistance, have
beene mine: so the profit, and comfort

                     </gap> are a portion, doth containe two
speciall arguments, whereby <hi>David</hi> enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
his earnest desire, to enjoy the liberty of
Gods Courts, and Tabernacles.</p>
                  <p>1. Is drawne from the worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
of the time so spent, in the words of
our Text.</p>
                  <q>For a day in thy Courts, is better than a
thousand.</q>
                  <p>2. From the dignity of the persons, that
so spend their time. The meanest office
there, is better than the highest employment
other where: even the place of a <hi>doore
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:4060:86"/>
keeper</hi> there, <hi>is better than to dwell in the
Tents of wickednesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the words which I have read,<note place="margin">The Cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> do
containe in them an argument or speciall
reason, why <hi>David</hi> longed so much after
the Courts of God.</p>
                  <p>And the argument is drawne <hi>a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis,</hi>
by comparing time spent in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
with time spent otherwise: there is a
broad difference, a thousand to one. So that
if you aske <hi>David,</hi> why his soule longed so
sore for Gods Courts? He answereth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
<hi>A day in Gods Courts is better than a
thousand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before we come to receive that instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the words affoard us, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
for mee to unfold the meaning of the
words. And herein there is no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
but only for me to shew you, what is
meant by the <hi>Courts of God</hi> in this place.
So then, by <hi>the Courts of God David</hi> doth
not meane the outward fabricke, or frame
of Gods Courts, but hee hath speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the duties of Gods worship and
service, and the exercises of religion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
there by Gods people. So that we
may conceive <hi>Davids</hi> meaning, as if hee
had spoken more largely thus; O Lord of
Hosts, I am now a banished man, debarred
of the liberty of thine House and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
I cannot joyne with thy people, in the
duties of thy publike worship, nor serve
thee in the <hi>beautie of holinesse.</hi> O Lord I
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:4060:87"/>
pray thee restore me againe, for so highly
doe I prize all things appertaining to thy
publike worship and service, that I thinke
them onely happy, that have free liberty to
frequent them; and therefore doe envie
the very Sparrowes, which have more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in this, then I have: and that so much
the rather, because I value that time, which
is spent in thy service, before all other time
a thousand fold. This is the sense. Let us
now consider of the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> This;
That time spent in Gods service,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Doctrine</hi> 1. That time spent in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is the best spent.</note> is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and incomparably the best spent time.
Even <hi>a day</hi> spent in the duties of Gods so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
worship and service, <hi>is better then a
thousand</hi> dayes spent otherwise.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon it is,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Proofe.</hi> By the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> that the Saints of God
have spent so much time in the duties of
Gods worship, and service, and exercises of
religion; as in holy meditations, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
praying, hearing, &amp;c. See it in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
Let us begin with <hi>David.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Davids piety.</note> Oh how
great a part did he spend in Gods service!
see, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>O how I love thy Law! it

And why all this, but only to teach us thus
much, that time spent in Gods service is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
the best spent time, this appeareth
(by his practise) to be his opinion. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon

in prayer, and thanksgiving; and that not

knew that the writing was signed, he went into
his house, &amp;c. and kneeled upon his knees,

before his God, as he did afore time.</hi>

that he did so still, as openly, and as so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
and as frequently, as he did before,
notwithstanding the danger of the Kings
Decree. And Thirdly, that he knew that
the writing was signed, and sealed to this

see your good workes;</hi> (spend much time in
Gods service, and become patternes for
others) why so? <hi>And glorifie your Father
which is in heaven; (i. e.)</hi> this doth much
glorifie your heavenly Father. So, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.
11. The Apostle prayeth, that <hi>they might
bee filled with the fruits of righteousnesse;</hi>
and marke the reason, <hi>which are by Iesus
Christ, to the glory and praise of God;</hi> so that
time spent in Gods service, is spent for his
glory. Now lay all these three together, and
they will make a strong twine to confirme
this truth, like <hi>Solomons</hi> threefold cord,

which is spent with <hi>God,</hi> or in his presence:

and the Disciples were gone to the
City to buy meate; in the meane time,
commeth a woman to draw water, and
our Saviour tooke that opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct

and was so serious in it, and so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with it, that when the Disciples
come with meate, they say unto him, <hi>M.
eate, Ver.</hi> 33. See what he answereth, <hi>I have
meate to eate, which yee know not of,</hi> and then
explaineth the meaning, <hi>Verse</hi> 34. <hi>My
meate is to doe the will of Him that sent mee,

meate, it did him more good, Hee found

it before his meate and drinke, so that (if
our mouth be not out of taste) time spent

and therefore, in that regard, is the best
spent time.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Time spent in Gods service is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the most full of profit, every way,<note place="margin">Most profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> both for
body and soule, <hi>Godlinesse is profitable unto
all things,</hi> saith the Apostle, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.)

right way,</hi> as <hi>Samuel</hi> calleth it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
24. It is that <hi>one thing needfull,</hi> as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:4060:93"/>
himselfe calleth it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 42. This is
the only thing, the very boone that <hi>David</hi>
would begge at Gods hands, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 27. 4.
<hi>One thing have I desired of the Lord, that I
will seeke after.</hi> But one thing <hi>David?</hi> sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is some rare thing, some extraordinary
profitable matter. What is it? <hi>That I may
dwell in the house of the Lord, all the dayes of
my life, and behold the beautie of the Lord,
and to enquire in his Temple.</hi> This is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
one thing, <hi>sc.</hi> that hee might spend all
the greatest part of his life in Gods service;
he knew the benefit, and the profit of it.
He might well say then, as, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 23. 6.
<hi>Surely goodnesse and mercy shall follow me all
the dayes of my life.</hi> Time spent in Gods
service, is the only way to procure safety
and profit, both for body and soule, 1. There
is safety in this course, even when their see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to be most danger,<note place="margin">And safe for body.</note> 
                     <hi>Hee that looseth his
life for Christ's sake, shall be sure to finde it,
Mat.</hi> 16. Yea, see that excellent promise, <hi>v.</hi> 11.
of this Psalme; <hi>The Lord will give grace, and
glory, and no good thing will he withhold, from
them that walke uprightly.</hi> Let no man think
that Religion is the High-way to danger
and beggery; No, no, It is the only safe way,
and the most profitable. An excellent place
to this purpose, is, that we have, <hi>Exo.</hi> 34. 24.
Where the Lord enjoyneth that all the
Males should appeare before him thrise in
the yeare at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (as if all the Males in
<hi>England</hi> were to appeare thrise in the yeere
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:4060:93"/>
before God at <hi>London</hi>) Now whereas a man
would think that this was very dangerous,
in regard of invasion from their cruell
neighbours, that might take the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to set upon their borders, in the absence
of all the Males: Now mark what the <hi>Lord</hi>
promiseth in that case, <hi>No man shall desire
thy land:</hi> such an envious, covetous, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
thought, shall not once enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their heart, as to thinke, Now we have
a fit opportunity to invade <hi>Israel.</hi> So the
equity of this promise remaineth still: Time
sincerely spent in Gods service, bringeth
safety with it; or, if any danger, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
hurt come, in this case, God will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it for our good. Rather then <hi>Daniel</hi>
shall loose by his time spent in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">Safety in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of it.</note>
the Lord will keepe him in safety in
the Lions denne, and send his Angels to
shut the Lions mouthes, that they may not
hurt him, as wee see, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. Marke that
speech of the King to him, <hi>Verse</hi> 20. <hi>O
Daniel, servant of the living God, Is thy
God (whom thou servest continually) able to
deliver thee from the Lions?</hi> Is there safety
in the service of thy God? See how <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
answereth, according to the event of
it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. <hi>My God hath sent his Angell,
and shut the Lions mouthes, that they have not
hurt me.</hi> Lo, what impregnable safety in
Gods service. So <hi>Daniel</hi> 3. What danger
were the three noble <hi>Iewes</hi> in? But see how
God made good that promise, (<hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 2.)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:4060:94"/>
                     <hi>When thou passest through the waters, I will be
with thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>when thou walkest through the
fire, thou shalt not be burnt, neither shall the
flame kindle upon thee. Our God whom we
serve is able to deliver us,</hi> say they, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17.
and the event shewed as much. <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. saith
the King, <hi>I see foure men walking in the
midst, and they have no hurt, and the forme
of the fourth, is like the Sonne of God,</hi> God
is able to keepe the fire from hurting (if he
please) even those that walke in the midst
of it. And mark what is said of these men,
<hi>Verse</hi> 27. <hi>That they were such, upon whose
bodies the fire had no power, nor was an haire
of their head singed, neither were their coates
changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on
them,</hi> Oh admirable fruit of faith! Oh
strange effects of piety! who would not
confes, that time spent in <hi>Gods</hi> service, is the
best spent time, when he seeth and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
that there is such admirable profit and
safety in it? Nay, he that doth consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
spend time in Gods service, may be sure
he <hi>shall want nothing that is good, Psal</hi> 34. 10.
So that such a man may boldly say with
<hi>David, Psalm.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>The Lord is my Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
I shall not want.</hi> The greatest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
under heaven (without piety) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
say so much; yea, <hi>Blessed is the man
that feareth the Lord;</hi> (and spendeth much
time in his service) <hi>for riches and plentious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
shall be in his house,</hi> if God see it to be
good for him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 112. 1, 2. Thus for the
body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:4060:94"/>
Then for the soule. Hee that spendeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
time in Gods service,<note place="margin">And Soule.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall never perish, but
have everlasting life, Ioh.</hi> 3. 16. Yea, hee that
spendeth time in Gods service, doth follow
the advise of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 27. sc. <hi>To
labour for that meate that perisheth not, but
endureth unto everlasting life;</hi> and with
<hi>Mary, chooseth the better part, which shall
never be taken from him, Luk.</hi> 10. 42. Yea,
this is chiefely, and especially beneficiall for
the soule. See an excellent promise to this
purpose, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>Encline your eare, and
come unto me, heare, and your soule shall live.</hi>
And, <hi>I will make an everlasting covenant with
you, even the sure mercies of David, Ver.</hi> 4.
This is the maine thing to be regarded, in
point of profit. For, <hi>What is a man profited,
if he shall gaine the whole world, and loose his
owne soule?</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.
26. See an experiment of this, in that rich
man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 19, 20. that had goods laid
up for many yeares, but could not secure
his soule, no, not for a night, but God said
unto him, <hi>thou foole, this night shall they fetch
away thy soule, and then whose shall these goods
bee, which thou hast provided?</hi> And this is
the case of every man, that spendeth his
time to get riches, instead of Gods service,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 21. <hi>So is every one that gathereth riches
for himselfe, and is not rich towards God;</hi> For,
<hi>What hope hath the Hypocrite, though hee hath
gained, when God shall fetch away his soule?
Iob</hi> 27. 8. When such are ready to <hi>call to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:4060:95"/>
the mountaines to fall upon them, and the hills
to cover them, from the presence of the Lambe,
Revel.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Then shall the godly lift up their
heads with joy, because their redemption draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
nigh.</hi> So that by this it appeareth
evidently, that time spent in Gods service
hath the most profit in it every way, both
for body, and soule. Oh the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
time spent in Gods service, and in
the neglect of it! Give mee leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
this branch of the Reason, with that
excellent place, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 13, 14. <hi>Thus
saith the Lord, Behold! my servant shall
eate, and yee shall bee hungry; behold! my
servant shall drinke, but yee shall be thirsty;</hi>
behold! my servant shall rejoyce, <hi>but yee
shall bee ashamed; Verse foureteene behold!
my servant shall sing for joy of heart,
and yee shall cry for sorrow of heart, and
shall howle for vexation of spirit, &amp;c.</hi> A
sweete cordiall for GODS servants; but
terrible to the wicked, that neglect his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, and lastly, I told you, that
time spent in Gods service,<note place="margin">Most full of comfort in life and death, &amp;c.</note> hath the most
comfort in it; the very time it selfe, so spent,
is full of comfort, the very joy and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of a mans heart. But especially this
will afford us comfort at our death, and at
the day of judgment. 1. For our death bed
nothing will afford us so much comfort
then, as this, if a man can say with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4060:95"/>
Testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity,
and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisedome,
but by the grace of God we have had our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
in the world;</hi> Time sincerely spent
in Gods service, wil assure a man, that when
he dyeth, he shall goe to heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.
<hi>Wee know that if this earthly house of this ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
shall be dissolved, we have a building
of God, not made with hands, eternall in the
heavens.</hi> Three singular examples I will
give you for this. 1. That of <hi>Hezekiah,
Isa.</hi> 38. 3. When the Prophet greeteth him
with that heavie tydings, saying, <hi>put thy
house in order, for thou shalt dye, and not live.</hi>
What was it that did afford him comfort,
in that case? That you shall see, was the
consideration of his well spent time. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
Lord, I beseech thee, how I have wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
before thee in truth, and with a perfect
heart, and have done that which is good in thy
sight.</hi> Lo, the chiefe ground of comfort in
death, is the conscience of a well led life.
So that of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>For
I am now ready to be offered, and the time of
my departure is at hand,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>v.</hi> 6.
Now see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what it was that did afford him
comfort in that case. Surely, considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the right and religious spending of
his time. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have
finished my course, I have kept the faith; hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
there is laid up for me a crowne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</hi>
Hee that would have the like
comfort in his death, must have a care to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4060:96"/>
spend much time in Gods service in his life
time. Oh, <hi>let me dye the death of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi>
saith wicked <hi>Baalam, and let my last end
be like his;</hi> he meaneth in regard of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and comfort, <hi>Num.</hi> 23. 10. This is the
desire of many. Now the way to obtaine
this, is to live the life of the Righteous.
This appeareth lastly, by the example of our
blessed Saviour, when hee had finished his
course, how sweetely doth hee conclude?
<hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 4, 5. <hi>I have glorified thee on the
earth, I have finished the worke which thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
me to doe; (i. e.)</hi> I have spent my whole
life in thy service, it hath beene my <hi>meate
to doe the will of thee my heavenly Father:</hi>
Yea, see the sweet fruit of this: <hi>And now,
ô Father, glorifie thou me with thine own selfe,
with the glory which I had with thee before the
world was.</hi> See here the way to have hope,
and comfort in death. Hee that would
have glory with God in heaven; must glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
God here on earth. Hee that would
be assured, that he shall spend his time with
God in heaven, in eternall glory; must
first spend his time in Gods service here on
earth. Grace on earth, is the way to glory
in heaven. And thus you see also, that time
spent in Gods service, is the best, not onely
in regard of God, but also in respect of our
selves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,<note place="margin">In regard of others, hereby wee may doe good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> and lastly, I told you, that time
spent in Gods service, is best spent, in regard
of others: it redoundeth not only to Gods
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:4060:96"/>
glory, and our owne good, but it also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
to the good of others, especially,
those that are in any kind of distresse. Time
spent in Gods service, is the best way, both
to prevent danger, and to remove it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the danger and misery of GODS
Church, both at home and abroad: dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of famine, danger of sword, danger of
pestilence: Now what better remedy to
prevent these dangers, then time spent in
Gods service, in prayer, and fasting, &amp;c?

yeeres in the service of sinne and Sathan,
before hee begin to serve God at all, or so
much as once thinke of the maine end for
which hee was made, and sent into this

from any desire to doe God service, that, on
the contrary, we hate him, and oppose, and
set our selves against him, and in effect doe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:4060:101"/>
nothing dayly, but even fight against God:
for indeed, there is a direct and an expresse
enmitie betweene God and us, by nature;
as appeareth by that speech of the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>For if, when wee were enemies,
we were reconciled to God, by the death of his

rebellion against the Lord; yea, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the vow and covenant, that wee
have made in our Baptisme, <hi>sc.</hi> that wee
would continue <hi>Christ's</hi> faithfull servants,
and souldiers, unto our lives end; yet
alas! notwithstanding we daily dishonour
God by our vicious lives, and live in the
apparent breach of his blessed and holy
Commandements.<note place="margin">Not onely before our conversion.</note> In our naturall estate
wee doe not so much as once perceive the
<hi>things of the Spirit of God,</hi> for they are <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnes</hi>
unto us, neither can we know them,
because <hi>they are spiritually discerned,</hi> as the
Apostle sheweth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. No, no,
alas! wee are so farre from spending time
in Gods service, that we spend it in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the will of the flesh, and in heathenish
lusts. This the Apostle intimateth, 1 <hi>Peter</hi>
4. 3. <hi>For the time past of our lives may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
us, to have wrought the will of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
when wee walked in lasciviousnesse,
lusts, excesse of Wine, revellings, banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and abominable Idolatries;</hi> Loe! here
the Apostle sheweth, how wee spend our
time usually before our conversion, not in
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:4060:102"/>
working the will of God, but the will of
the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> not in the service of God, but
in the service of the flesh, and of the devill;
for drunkennesse, and idolatry are such.
Thus vainely and foolishly doe we spend
our time by nature, yea, this is not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of some few odde ones, that are of an
extraordinary evill nature; but it is the
condition of all, even of the best. The holy
Apostle confesseth thus much of himselfe,
and of all true beleevers (before their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version)
<hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3. <hi>For we our selves were
sometimes foolish, disobedient, serving diverse
lusts, and pleasures, living in malice, hatefull,
and hating one another,</hi> sayth the Apostle.
So that if we seriously consider this, we have
reason every one, to cry out of himselfe, in
this respect, as the Psalmist did in another
case; <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 22. <hi>So foolish am I, O Lord,</hi>

that time spent in Gods service, is the best
spent time: men can finde many dayes to
spend for themselues, none for God. Thus
the ambitious spend time to get honour,
the malicious for revenge, the covetous to
get wealth; in the meane time, no time can
be spared, to be spent to get grace. Oh the
folly of men, to begin at the wrong end:
<hi>First seeke the kingdome of God,</hi> sayth our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. Now that is put off to
the last place (at least) if it be not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

fooles, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 19, 20. There was a man
spent all his time to get wealth, but could
finde no time to serve God, and to get
grace; and therefore he hath no time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
his wealth; but in the very night that
he beganne to take possession, and enjoy the
benefit of all his paines, God greeteth him
with this heavie message; <hi>Thou foole, this
night shall they fetch away thy soule, and then
whose shall those goods be, which thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided?
So is every one</hi> (sayth our Saviour)
<hi>that getteth riches for himselfe, and is not rich
towards God.</hi> What greater folly, then to
be all for the present, nothing for the future?
All for the Summer, nothing for the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?

And yet alas! there are thousands that are

                  <p>Now for the meanes to prevent,<note place="margin">Remedies against this.</note> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this grosse abuse, in thus mis-spending
of our time; Let us consider these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
                  <p>First, That time spent in Gods service,<note place="margin">1. Remedie.</note>
is absolutely the most full of pleasure; yea,
there is no true solid pleasure in the world
without it; it is to a spirituall man, <hi>the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
joy and rejoycing of his heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Remedie.</note> The more pleasure we have in
any thing, in the neglect of Gods worship
and service, the more torment and sorrow
will follow afterward: The better the wine
is, the sharper and more sowre will it be,
when it is turned to vinegar. It is most true
of all such delights, which <hi>Abner</hi> sayd to
<hi>Joab, They will be bitternesse in the later end.</hi>
See the fruit of the rich mans carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 25. In that speech of Father
<hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich man in hell; <hi>Sonne,
remember that thou in thy life time receivedst
thy good things,</hi> or thy pleasures, <hi>and likewise
Lazarus evill things: but now he is comforted,
and thou art tormented.</hi> O the everlasting
bitter panges of hell, which follow the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of sinne for a season! Who would dote
upon such sweet meat, that is attended with
such bitter and sowre sauce? So, mark what
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:4060:105"/>
is sayd of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that had glutted her selfe
with pleasures, and made her selfe <hi>Drunke
with the bloud of the Saints, Revel.</hi> 18. 7.
<hi>How much she hath glorified her selfe, and lived
deliciously; so much torment and sorrow give
her.</hi> The more pleasures of sinne here on
earth, the more torment in hell. If our
carnal mirth-mungers would consider this,
it would be a meanes to perswade them to
spend more time in Gods service, and lesse in
the pleasures of sinne, which are but for a
season.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Sort.</hi> Are such as stay long, before they beginne to spend any time at all that way.</note> This serveth to reprove all such,
as stay long before they spend any time at
all in Gods service. How ordinary a thing
is it for men to mispend their best strength,
and flower of their youth, and reserve the
decrepit old age for God? Tell many of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
of Gods service, of the power of
godlinesse; oh, say they, it is too soone, I am
too young; hereafter is better, when I am
old. This is the usuall practise of the world.
If time spent in Gods service be the best
spent; woe be to those, that stay long before
they begin to serve God at all.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Like a man
that goeth to <hi>London,</hi> about some businesse of
great importance, and when he commeth
there, spendeth all his time in saluting here,
and complementing there, and seeing this
and that rare sight; and then hath all his

                     </gap> to dispatch, when he should goe
home. Here is the very case of many, that
come into the Citie of this world: they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:4060:105"/>
spend the greatest part of their time in other
things; and never so much as dreame or
thinke of Religion, which is the maine end,
for which they were sent into the world.
What a woefull account will these make,

                     </note>
let us consider these foure particulars.</p>
                  <p>First, The expresse command of God:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
To <hi>Remember our Creator in the dayes of our

                     <note place="margin">Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>before those dayes come, wherein wee
shall say, I have no pleasure in them.</hi> A woe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
thing, for a man even then to bethinke
himselfe how to live, when he is readie to
die, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in
the dayes of thy youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider the time which we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
have here to spend on earth is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine;<note place="margin">Consider, that the time wee have to spend, is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.</note>
a man resolveth to serve God when
he is old; yea, but what if he dye in the
meane time, while he is young, and never
live untill he be olde? How many Lambe-skinnes
come to the Market, as well as the
skinnes of elder sheepe? How many dye
young, and drop away, even in the middest
(as they thought) of their best strength?
No man knoweth the day of his death; and
therefore <hi>Job</hi> (to make sure worke) would
beginne and prepare for it every day, <hi>Iob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>

<hi>They spend their dayes in wealth, and in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

they say unto God, depart from us, for we desire
not the knowledge of thy wayes,</hi> &amp;c. A woefull
estate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,<note place="margin">The longer we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties wee shall meete withall.</note> The longer it is before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to God, the more difficult we shall
finde it, to turne at last. <hi>Qui non est hodie,
cras minus aptus erit.</hi> Continuance in sinne,
breedeth custome in sinne; and how hard is
it for men to overcome evill customes?
<hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>Can the Aethiopian change his
skinne, or the Leopard his spots? then may yee
also doe good, that are accustomed to doe evill.</hi>
So that it is exceeding difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
The further a man goeth out of his
way, the longer journey he hath to goe at
his returne; and then it is possible for him
to stay too long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly,<note place="margin">Consider how just it is, for God to reject such as doe turne at last.</note> But admit, that at last he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
to returne to God, and spend time in
his service; Yet how just is it with God,
to reject him in that case? What a base
thing, for a man to spend all the best of his
time and strength in the service of sinne and
Sathan, and then to beginne to serve God,
when he is fit for nothing, but to feede
wormes? What would you thinke of that
servant, whom you should hyre to serve you
for a yeare; and yet he never would doe you
dayes worke, untill the last moneth, or
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:4060:106"/>
weeke, or houre, immediately before hee
should receive his wages? Or what would
you conceive of that Souldier, that should
spend all his youth and strength in the
warres against his King, and Soveraigne;
and then offereth his old age to his Prince,
when he is scarce able to cary his weapon.
Here is the very case of all those, that spend
all the best of their health and strength in
the service of sinne, and offer their poore,
despicable old age to God. What is this
but to offer the Lame, and Torne, and the
Sicke? <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. O how justly may God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
us in that case? Consider that fearefull
place, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 28, 29. <hi>Then shall they call,
but I will not answer: they shall seeke me early,
but shall not finde me, because they hated know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
&amp;c. They that despise Gods service in
their youth, may justly expect, that God
should despise them in their age.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Sort.</hi> Such as spend some time in Gods service, but not enough.</note> This serveth to reprove such,
as spend some time in Gods service, but not
enough: seeme to make conscience of some
duties, but not of others. If time spent in
Gods service be the best spent time, then
they are to blame, that deale niggardly with
God in this regard; that doe serve God by
the halves; with the lippes, but not with
the heart; have prayer in the morning, but
not in the evening; both these perhaps,
but no reading, nor godly conference, nor
catechising: some also come to Church
sometimes, once a moneth, or in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:4060:107"/>
but not in the evening. Well, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that time spent in Gods service is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
the best spent time. Therefore they
are too blame, that are sparing in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe.
God is abundant in goodnesse to us,
and therefore we should be abundant in
dutie to him; <hi>Alwayes abounding in the
worke of the Lord,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 58. Oh, for shame let us not be
niggardly with him, that is so bountifull
to us; <hi>He giveth to all men liberally,</hi> sayth the
Apostle, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 6. O let us be liberall in our
dutie to God, seeing no time is so well
spent, as that which is spent in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

it, that they doe even <hi>imagine mischiefe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their beds,</hi> that when the morning light
is, they may practise it, <hi>Mich.</hi> 2. 1. Yea,
some are so sharp set in this case, that it doth
even breake their sleepe; according to that
in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 4. 16. <hi>They sleepe not, except
they doe evill; and their sleepe departeth
from them, except they cause some to fall,</hi> Oh
how foolishly and desperately doe such
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:4060:108"/>
spend their time, even in cutting, and
wounding, and stabbing their soules, and
doe daily <hi>treasure up to themselves wrath,
against the day of wrath, and the revelation
of the righteous judgement of God, Rom.</hi> 2.
4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Now for the perfecting of this branch,
give me leave to shew you the remedies of
this dangerous mischiefe: and the helpes
which we must use to this purpose,<note place="margin">Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> are prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
these foure.</p>
                  <p>1. Consider,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Remedy.</hi> Whilest we live thus, we are chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath.</note> that all the while we spend
our time thus, wee are children of wrath,
and in the state of nature, as the Apostle
sheweth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. All the while wee
live thus, we can looke for nothing, but the
<hi>wrath of God,</hi> to come upon us, as it doth
upon the <hi>children of disobedience,</hi> as the
Apostle speakes, <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5. 6. <hi>The wrath
of God is even revealed from heaven against
such, Romans</hi> 1. 18. See a notable place for
this purpose, in <hi>Romans</hi> 2. 8, 9. <hi>But unto
them that are contentious, and doe not obey
the truth, but obey unrighteousnesse,</hi> (marke
the condition of all such) <hi>indignation, and
wrath, tribulation, and anguish, upon every
soule of man that doth evill, upon the Iew
first, &amp;c.</hi> See here the estate of such as
spend time in the devils service, instead of
Gods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Remedy.</hi> God wil not heare their prayers, that doe so.</note> Consider, that all such have
cause to feare, that God will deny to helpe
and succour them, when they stand in the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:4060:109"/>
most need of it, and seeke for it with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
earnestnesse. <hi>If I regard wickednesse in
my heart, God will not heare my prayer,</hi> saith
<hi>David, Psalme</hi> 66. 18. Yea, <hi>we know that
God heareth not sinners,</hi> saith the blind man,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 31. and therefore, if God doe not
heare wicked mens prayers in their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
but lets them perish in their sinnes;
it is not for want of power, or mercy in
God; but onely for want of piety, and
repentance in them, according to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
place which wee have to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 1, 2. <hi>Behold, the Lords hand
is not shortned, that he cannot save; neither
is his eare heavie, that he cannot heare,</hi> where
is the fault then? that you shall see in the
next verse, <hi>verse</hi> 2. <hi>But your iniquities
have separated betweene you and your God,
and your sinnes have hid his face from you,
that he cannot heare;</hi> Oh the wofull estate
of all such, as cry unto God in their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and are nothing at all regarded!
Yea, God hath told them already, that hee
will not heare them: observe it, <hi>Proverbs</hi>
1. 28, 29. <hi>Then shall they call, &amp;c.</hi> that is,
in their extremity, <hi>but I will not answer;
they shall seeke me early, but they shall not
finde mee; because they hated knowledge,
and did not choose the feare of the Lord.</hi>
Yea, the Lord hath sent them word before
hand, that he will not helpe them, <hi>Iob</hi> 8.
20. <hi>Behold, God will not cast away a perfect
man, neither will hee helpe the evill doers,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:4060:109"/>
saith the Text there. O the wofull estate of
all such, when sicknesse comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n, or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
come, or death; then they are glad to
cry out, Helpe Lord, or else I am damned
for ever: Not I, may the Lord say, I will
helpe no evill doers, such as you are, and
therefore thou art now like to perish, and
<hi>dye in thy sinnes, Iohn</hi> 8. 20. Yea, the
Lord is so farre from regarding the prayers
of such people, in such cases, that he rather
refuseth them; see upon what warrant I
speake it, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 15. 8. <hi>The sacrifice of
the wicked is an abomination unto the Lord.</hi>
The sacrifice, what is that? Surely his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
as appeareth by the Antithesis in that
place: for so it followeth, <hi>But the prayer
of the upright is his delight,</hi> God hateth and
abhorreth the prayers of all such as live in
their sinnes, and hate to be reformed: <hi>Hee
that turneh away his eare from hearing the
Law, even that mans prayer shall be an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi>
saith the Wiseman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9.
O wofull estate! If men had but eyes to
see it, and hearts to consider it aright: the
Lord takes no pleasure in the very best ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
which they can doe him.</p>
                  <p>And no marvell,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Remedy.</hi> All such are at utter enmity with God.</note> for in the third place;
So long as men live in their sinnes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
repentance, and spend time in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
service, instead of Gods, there is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and an expresse enmity betweene God
and them. <hi>If when we were enemies, we were
reconciled to God, by the death of his Sonne,</hi>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:4060:110"/>
saith the Apostle, <hi>Romans</hi> 5. 10. Yea, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
those that live and goe on in their
sinnes, have just cause to be assured of this,
and that they shall smart for it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
See a place or two to this purpose,
<hi>Psalme</hi> 37. 20. But the wicked shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
why so? surely, because they are Gods
enemies. <hi>And the enemies of the Lord shall
be as the fat of Lambes,</hi> (easily melted)
<hi>into smoke shall they consume away.</hi> Where
we see; first, that the wicked are Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
Secondly, that they shall consume
away like smoke, and the fat of Lambes.
So in that Psalme for the Sabbath, <hi>Psalme</hi>
92. 9. <hi>For lo thine enemies, O Lord, lo thine
enemies shall perish;</hi> and who are they?
that yee shall see in the same verse. <hi>All the
workers of iniquity shall bee scattered:</hi>
where we see both the description, and the
condition of wicked men. They are Gods
enemies, there is their description; dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
and perishing, there is their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But above all to this purpose is that
of <hi>Psalme</hi> 68. 21. <hi>God will surely wound
the head of his enemies, and the hairie scalpe
of such a one, as goeth on still in his trespas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
O consider this, ye that forget God,</hi> and
live in your sinnes, <hi>lest God teare you in
peeces, and there be none to deliver you, Psal.</hi>
50. 22. What estate can be more dangerous
then an estate of enmity against God? <hi>The
adversaries of the Lord shall bee broken in
peeces, out of heaven shall be thunder upon
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:4060:110"/>
them,</hi> saith <hi>Hannah Samuel's</hi> Mother,
1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 2. 10. Mee thinkes I have said
enough, if effectuall, to afright men out of
their service of sinne and Sathan, especially
if I shall adde but one thing more, which
shall be the fourth and the last remedy, that
I purpose to propound.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Remedy.</hi> Consider, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is the worst Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that we can serve.</note> Therefore consider, that the
devill is the worst master that any man can
serve, and giveth the most wofull and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed
wages. What baser Master then the
devill? that <hi>great red Dragon, Revelations</hi>
12. 12. That <hi>roaring Lion, that goeth about
continually seeking whom he may devoure,
A murtherer from the very beginning: Iohn</hi>
8. 44. and the most damnable liar, that ever
was, yea, the very <hi>father thereof;</hi> What
baser Master then the Devill? Yea, and see
what base wages he giveth, <hi>Romans</hi> 6. 23.
<hi>For the wages of sinne is death,</hi> spirituall,
temporall, and eternall, both the first, and
the second death. They that spend time in
the devils service, must goe to hell, with
the Devill for company, <hi>Psalme</hi> 9. 17.
<hi>The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all
that forget God.</hi> They are utterly deceived,
that thinke to live like devils upon earth,
and yet for all that, become glorious Saints
in heaven, when they dye: that thinke
they shall get into the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
without being New Creatures for
the present. No, no, God hath revealed
the contrary already, as is evident, <hi>Revel.</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:4060:111"/>
22. 14, 15. <hi>Blessed are they that doe his
Commandements</hi> (that spend time in Gods
service) <hi>for they shall enter in through the
gates, into the City of the new Ierusalem.
But without shall be dogges, and Inchanters,
and Whoremongers, and such as love, and
make lyes.</hi> These must stand without, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
goe to hell with the devill and his Angels,
according to the prediction of <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
in <hi>Matthew</hi> 25. 41. <hi>Goe ye cursed,
into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devill
and his Angels.</hi> Consider this, all you that
have spent more time in the devils service,
then in Gods; yea, all, or the greatest part
of thy life in the service of sinne and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than;
and little, or no time at all in the
service of God Almighty: you that could
finde in your hearts to say unto God, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from us, for wee desire no acquaintance
with thy wayes,</hi> He will pay you home one
day, in your owne coyne, (unlesse yee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent)
and send you packing to hell, with a,
<hi>depart from me, &amp;c. I know ye not, ye wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of iniquity, Matthew</hi> 7. 23. Yea,
when ye shall begin to claime acquaintance
with God, and cry, Lord, Lord, &amp;c. Even
then will Hee professe unto you, <hi>I never
knew you,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">6. <hi>Sort.</hi> Such as will neither spend Time in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor suffer others</note> 
                     <hi>Depart from me, ye that worke
iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The sixth, and the last sort, are those, that
will neither spend time in Gods service
themselves, nor suffer others; such as not
only mispend their owne time, but also hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:4060:111"/>
and discourage others from the well
spending of theirs; such as cry out, what
need so much preaching, such running after
Sermons, &amp;c. like waggish and unhappy
Schollers, that will neither apply their
bookes themselves, nor suffer their fellowes,
but hinder, and disturbe them by all meanes
possible. Here is just the Dogge in the
manger. These are Sathans Vicegerents,
even his Standard-bearers, and Captaines,
chiefe factors for Hell. These are they, that
<hi>will neither enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
themselves, nor suffer others,</hi> but shut
up the kingdome of God against them,<note place="margin">Luk. 11 52.</note>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 13.</p>
                  <p>Consider now; Is time spent in Gods
service absolutely the best spent time?<note place="margin">See the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full estate of all such.</note> How
grosly and grievously are they to blame,
that not only despise the duties of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
themselves, but also discourage others;
For the perfecting of this point, give mee
leave to shew you the wofull and fearefull
estate of all such.</p>
                  <p>1. They are guiltie of the bloud of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
soules that perish,<note place="margin">Guilty of the bloud of soules.</note> by this meanes. Now
what a wofull estate is this, that whereas a
man is not able to answer one of a thousand,
in respect of his owne sinnes, he should yet
bee chargeable with the sinnes of others?
when he shall heare those poore soules curse
him in hell, and say, O woe be to thee, for
thou art the cause of my damnation? I had
spent my time in Gods service, had it not
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:4060:112"/>
beene for thee? O how this will gall thee,
and torment thee at that day; such and
such might have gone to heaven, but for
thy discouragements:<note place="margin">Ezec. 33. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>He</hi> verily <hi>dyeth in
his iniquitie, but his bloud will the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
at thy hands,</hi> thou hast helped forward
a soule to death, and so art guilty of the
bloud of soules.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Consider, the extent of this grievous
sinne;<note place="margin">A sinne of a large extent reacheth up unto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</note> it reacheth up to the very heavens.
Every such person, doth even become a
fighter against God, and taketh the devils
part against <hi>Christ,</hi> this soule is mine,
saith the LORD, and I will save it;
nay, saith the Devill, this soule is mine, and
I will damne it. Thus they strive and
wrestle for the poore soule; <hi>Christ,</hi> by the
meanes of grace to save it, and Sathan by
his temptations to damne it: now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
person, hee taketh Satans part, and
helpeth him against <hi>Christ;</hi> and therefore
is a direct fighter against God. Excellent
to this purpose, is that speech of <hi>Gamaleel,
Acts</hi> 5. 39. when they were consulting
how to suppresse the Apostles preaching of
the Gospell, <hi>Abstaine from these men, and
let them alone; for if this counsell, or this
worke bee of men, it will come to nought;
but if it be of God, yee cannot overthrow it,
lest happily yee become even to fight against
God;</hi> He that fighteth against Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
doth even fight against God: yea, he
that doth but murmure against these things,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:4060:112"/>
his murmurings are against the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi>
16. 8. yea, and he that doth set himselfe to
persecute Gods people for this, doth even
persecute <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, as appeareth by
that speech of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> as he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Damascus,</hi> with a Commission to
persecute those Primitive Christians, <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> strikes him downe to the earth, and
salutes him in these termes, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 4.
<hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? I am
Iesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest.</hi>
Christ taketh that as done to him, which is
done to his members, in this case: yea, he
that doth but touch them (in any kinde, to
hurt them) toucheth the very Apple of
GODS eye. Oh that men would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
consider the extent of their sin, and
how farre their rebellions doe reach in this
case!</p>
                  <p>And therefore in the third place, it must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
needs follow,<note place="margin">The wrath of God is ready to fall on them to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most.</note> that the wrath of God is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to seaze upon them to the uttermost;
yea, the wrath of God already abideth on
them, although they perceive it not. See
a fearefull and terrible place of the Apostle,
to this purpose, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Ye have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
like things of your owne Country-men,
as they of the Iewes,</hi> Why? what had the
<hi>Iewes</hi> done? That the Apostle sheweth,
<hi>verse</hi> 15. <hi>Who both killed the Lord Iesus,
and their owne Prophets, and have persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us, and they please not God, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to all men, verse</hi> 16. <hi>forbidding us to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4060:113"/>
speake to the Gentiles, that they might be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi>
(there is the very case that we have in
hand) they doe hinder (as much as in them
lyeth) the salvation of others. Now what
is the fruit of all this? that yee shall see,
in the later end of that verse. To fill up
their sinnes alway, for <hi>the wrath of God
is come upon them to the uttermost;</hi> Oh the
wofull estate of such, the wrath of God is
ready to seize upon them to the uttermost.
This is enough even to shake the hearts of
all such, as are guilty in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Because this is a fearefull
signe of reprobation,<note place="margin">A fearefull signe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</note> it is the very brand
of a reprobate, and hee that goeth on in
this case, without repentance, hath great
cause to feare this of himselfe, That God
hath forsaken him, and given him up to
his owne hearts lusts, and into the hands of
Sathan. Two singular places of Scripture
I will give you for this, the one 2 <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
3. 8. <hi>As Iannes, and Iambres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoode
Moses; so doe these men resist
the truth,</hi> (they will neither embrace it
themselves, nor suffer others,) what is the
state of these men? (men of corrupt
mindes, reprobate concerning the faith.
The other place which I will commend
to your consideration in this case, is,
that of the Apostle, <hi>Philippians</hi> 1. 28.
<hi>And in nothing be terrifyed by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
which is to them a token of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but to you of salvation, and that of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:4060:113"/>
God.</hi> Where wee may plainely see, that
as it is a token of salvation, to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
for righteousnesse sake; so it is
a fearefull token of Reprobation, to bee a
persecuter in that case.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and lastly, It is a fearefull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
signe,<note place="margin">A signe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</note> that a man belongeth to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.
This is a speciall worke of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
to hate, and maligne, and persecute

resolve to goe on in this case, it is a

youth. How can you spend the flower of
your youth better, than in the service of
your Maker? Give me leave therefore, to
perswade and presse every one of you, in
the words of the wisest <hi>Salomon, Eccles.</hi>
12. 1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes
of thy youth, before the evill day come:</hi> It
is a young mans greatest honour to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
betimes. Oh what an honour to
young <hi>Salomon,</hi> to be vertuously instructed,
even from his child-hood, with, <hi>Know
thou the God of thy fathers,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9.
So an everlasting credit for young <hi>Samuel,</hi>
to be trained up in the duties of Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of a childe, <hi>Samuel ministred before
the Lord, being a child,</hi> saith the Text,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 18. And againe, <hi>The child Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
ministred unto the Lord before Ely</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. Yea, this was so famous and
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4060:115"/>
admirable a thing, that all <hi>Israel</hi> tooke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it; <hi>for they all knew that Samuel
was established to be a Prophet of the Lord,</hi>
saith the Text, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 3. 20. <hi>verse.</hi> This
set such a Crowne of glory upon his head,
that it is not forgotten to this day. Hee
that setteth himselfe to serve, and honour
God in his youth, shall have the honour
and credit of it for ever. So for <hi>Iosiah,</hi>
What glorious things are spoken of him to
this day, even in this respect? See how
the Spirit of God reporteth it, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi>
34. 3. <hi>In the eight yeare of his reigne, while
he was yet young, he began to seeke after the
God of David his father;</hi> young indeed,
for he was but eight yeares old, when he
began to reigne, <hi>verse</hi> 1. So that he could
bee but sixteene yeares of age, at the most,
when this was reported of him. O what
an excellent patterne is here for young
men: let them all learne of this young
Saint, to bestow the flower of their youth
upon God; it will set an everlasting crowne
of glory upon their head. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is that of famous <hi>Timothy,</hi> of whom
it is said, <hi>That he knew the Scriptures of a
child, which was able to make him wise unto
salvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Wherewithall
shall a young man cleanse his way,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
religious? Surely by imitating and
following the example of such rare young
men, as these are.</p>
                  <p>Now the better to stirre up young men
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:4060:115"/>
hereunto, I have two generall Motives to
propound unto them (besides the honour of
it) <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Vtilitie.<note place="margin">Motives 2.</note>

                     <item>2. The Necessity.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>1. The Vtility. Hearken to this,<note place="margin">1. The uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in sundry bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, which flow from hence.</note> O yee
young men, for it is for your profit; heare
it, and doe it for your good. Behold! here
I will shew you the good and right way,
<hi>sc.</hi> feare the Lord, and serve him in your
youth, <hi>First seeke Gods kingdome, and the
righteousnesse of it,</hi> as our blessed Saviour
himselfe adviseth, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6. 33. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your selves with God, even in your
youth, and serve him, for hereby good shall
come unto you, as one of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
excellently, <hi>Iob</hi> 22. 21.</p>
                  <p>1. For. 1. The Lord will take it excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
kindly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Benefit.</hi> The Lord taketh it exceeding kindly, if we set our selves to serve him in our youth.</note> we shall please him exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
yea, the Lord will be so much affected
with it, that he will never forget it. To
sacrifice our youth unto Gods service, is (as
it were) to sacrifice our <hi>Isaac</hi> to him: now
see how kindly the Lord tooke <hi>Abraham's</hi>
purpose in that case, <hi>Genesis</hi> 22. 12. <hi>By my
selfe have I sworne, because thou hast done
this thing, that in blessing, I will blesse thee.</hi>
He that dedicateth his youth unto Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
shall be remembred with a blessing in
his age. So when <hi>Israel</hi> was newly come
out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> no marvell if they were
much affected with his admirable mercies
towards them; they could not choose (for
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4060:116"/>
the present) but love him entirely, and even
set the dearest of their affections upon him.
Now see how kindly this was taken, and
remembred a long time after; (yea, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
their manifold infirmities,
their murmurings, their infidelity, &amp;c.)
yet see how lovingly the Lord maketh
mention of it, a long time after, <hi>Ieremy</hi>
2. 2. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, I remember thee,
the kindnesse of thy youth, the love of thine
espousals, when thou wentest after me in the
wildernesse, &amp;c.</hi> The kindnesse of their
youth, is kindly remembred, <hi>With such sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
the Lord is well pleased.</hi> This is the
first benefit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Benefit.</hi> It will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Lustes of youth, which will else lie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon us in our age.</note> If we set our selves to serve
God in our youth; it will be an excellent
meanes, to prevent the lustes of youth;
which if they be not prevented, will be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and terrible in the time of age. <hi>Fly the
lustes of youth,</hi> sayth the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.
22. There are certaine lustes, which men
are most subject unto in time of youth: yea,
these lustes, are noysome and dangerous,
and fight directly against the soule; <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from fleshly lusts, which fight against the
soule,</hi> sayth another Apostle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 11.
These (many times) lye heavie upon the
conscience (of the best,) in time of age.
Hearken how holy <hi>David</hi> cryeth out, <hi>Psal.</hi>
25. 7. <hi>Remember not the sinnes of my youth,</hi>
sayth that good man: He knew what a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
case he should be in, if God should call
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:4060:116"/>
him to account, for the sinnes of his youth:
and yet doubtlesse, he was a godly man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from his youth: see what he sayth of
himselfe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 71. 5. <hi>Thou art my hope, O
Lord God, thou art my trust, even from my
youth:</hi> yea, he was taught of God from his
youth, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. Yea, marke what the Lord
himselfe sayth of him, even in his youth,
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>The Lord hath sought him a
man after his owne heart.</hi> He was a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gods owne heart, yet cryeth out of the
sinnes of his youth. So consider <hi>Iob,</hi> by the
Lords owne testimony, an incomparable
man; <hi>A man that feared God, and eschewed
evill:</hi> yet see how he cryeth out of the sinnes
of his youth, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 26. <hi>Thou writest bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
things against me, and makest me to possesse
the sinnes of my youth:</hi> and yet he was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and mercifull, even in his youth:
see what he could speake of himselfe; <hi>Iob</hi> 31.
18. (where speaking of the widow and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse;)
<hi>For from my youth, he</hi> (that is
the fatherlesse) <hi>was brought up with me, as
with a Father; and I have guided her</hi> (that is
the widow) <hi>from my mothers wombe.</hi> Now
marke it, I pray you, are the sinnes of youth
thus bitter, to such as <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> such
godly persons? What will they then be,
to them that <hi>draw iniquitie with cords of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie;
and sinne as it were with a cart-rope?</hi>
They must needs feele and finde (one day)
that it is an evill thing, and bitter, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Lord, and that his feare is not in
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4060:117"/>
them (in their youth) as the Lord himselfe
speaketh, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 19. They that have taken
great paines, and toyled, and moyled in
their youth, are apt to cry out of Stitches
and Aches in their age: this is the very case
of such as take great paines in the service of
sinne, and Sathan, in their youth; they will
cry out of the bitternes of it in their age:
As <hi>Abner</hi> sayd to <hi>Ioab,</hi> they will finde it
<hi>bitternesse in the later end.</hi> Thus wise <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
disswadeth the yong man from whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<hi>Pro.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Come not nigh the doore of
her house;</hi> Why so? 1. <hi>Lest thou give thine
honour to others, and thy yeares to the cruell;</hi>
thy credits gone, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. yea, and thy profit
too, <hi>Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth,
and thy labours be in the house of strangers;</hi>
it will emptie thy house of wealth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all.<note place="margin">Service of sinne, bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse in the end.</note> 
                     <hi>It will be bitternes in the
end,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>Lest thou mourne at last, and say,
How have I hated instruction,</hi> &amp;c (<hi>i.e.</hi>) How
have I mis-spent my precious time, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
the service of God, in my youth?
Now the way and chiefe meanes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this, is to set our selves to serve God,
even in our youth; for this will bring
sweetnesse and comfort in time of age. Oh
what an happinesse, when a man can say
with <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 23. 1. <hi>I have lived in all
good conscience unto this day.</hi> Or with the
young man, <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 20. <hi>All this have I
kept from my youth.</hi> See the respect that our
Saviour had to him for this; <hi>Then Iesus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4060:117"/>
him, loved him:</hi> He even loved him,
in some sort, for his externall obedience:
how much more will he love them, that
truely, and sincerely love and serve him?
<hi>Ich.</hi> 14. 21. 23. <hi>He that hath my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and keepeth them, is he that loveth me;
and he that loveth me, shall be beloved of my
Father, and I will manifest my selfe to him;
yea, my Father will love him, and wee will
come and make our abode with him.</hi> O happie
Companie! what greater comfort? It is
heaven upon earth: in stead of the bitter
sinnes of youth, <hi>we shall have fellowship with
the Father, and with his Sonne Iesus Christ,</hi>
sayth the Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Benefit. Quo semel est imbuta, &amp;c.</note> Time spent sincerely in Gods
service in our youth, will make us constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
religious in our age. I know indeed,
that some that have seemed Saints in youth,<note place="margin">It will make us constant in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in our age.</note>
have proved devils in their age: As <hi>Ioash,</hi>
&amp;c. but they did but seeme so, they had <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a forme of godlinesse, but denyed the power of
it,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. But such as are truely and
sincerely religious in youth, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in age; that is the right propertie of
a tree of Righteousnesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92. (that
Psalme for the Sabbath day) <hi>vers.</hi> 13. 14.
<hi>They that be</hi> (truely) <hi>planted in the house of
the Lord, shall flourish in the Courts of the
house of our God. They shall still bring forth
fruit in their old age, they shall be fat and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing.</hi>
To the same purpose is that speech
of <hi>Salomon, Pro.</hi> 22. 6. <hi>Traine up a childe,</hi>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:4060:118"/>
(or Catechise) <hi>in the way he should goe, and
when he is old, he will not depart from it.</hi> Loe,
the benefit of a religious education in
youth. He that spendeth time in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in his youth, will hardly neglect it in
his age. He that is a <hi>Tymothy,</hi> in his youth,
for the most part, proveth a <hi>Mnaason,</hi>
an old Disciple in his age, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 26. An
heart seasoned with the true feare of God in
a mans youth, will make him, that he shall
not depart from God when he is old. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
indeed fell foulely, and dangerously in
his age, but returned to God by repentance
at last, as is evident by his booke of <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes;</hi>
yea, see what warrant we have to
thinke thus; <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>And I will put
my feare in their hearts, that they shall never
depart from me.</hi> He that once truely feareth
God, departeth not from him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Benefit.</hi> The more comfort for the present, &amp; the more glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</note> The more time we spend, and
the more paines we take in Gods service in
our youth, the more comfort shall we have
for the present, and the more glorie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
this addeth still more weight, and
massinesse to our crowne of glory in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
The small paines that we take in Gods
service, (though in comparison they be
but as for a moment) yet <hi>worke unto us, an
eternall and exceeding weight of glory,</hi> as the
Apostle speakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. O how this
should perswade us to beginne betimes!
The sooner wee beginne to spend time in
Gods service, the more time shall we spend
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:4060:118"/>
in it, and reape the more glory hereafter.
This is evident by that Parable of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.
The more Talents we have, and the
better we employ them, the more glorie in
heaven. See what is sayd to him that had
five Talents, well improved, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 17.
<hi>Well done, thou good and faithfull servant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
thou hast beene faithfull in a few things,
have thou authoritie over ten Cities.</hi> Yea, who
must have the odde Talent, but he that had
ten before? <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. <hi>And he sayd unto them
that stood by, Take the Talent from him, and
give it to him that hath ten Talents. They said
unto him,</hi> (v. 25.) <hi>Lord, he hath ten Talents,
(i.e.</hi>) he hath enough alreadie; now observe
the answer, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>For unto every one that
hath, shall be given,</hi> &amp;c. He that hath most
grace to spend most time in Gods service on
earth, shall have the greatest reward, and
the most glorie in heaven. Oh therefore
beginne betime to get grace, that thou
mayest have the more glorie in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Benefit.</hi> Hereby wee shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and requite their love.</note> The sooner we beginne to spend
time in Gods service, the sooner shall we
beginne to requite our Parents love, and
to affoord them comfort. The childes well-doing,
is the Parents comfort. Yea, many
Parents, that are not so religious them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
rejoyce yet to see their children zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and forward that way. <hi>A wise Sonne
maketh a glad Father,</hi> sayth <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi>
10. 1. A wise Sonne, that is, a religious
childe, one that setteth himselfe to serve
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4060:119"/>
God in his youth, he rejoyceth the heart of
his Father: <hi>But a foolish Sonne</hi> (that is, an
ungodly Impe) <hi>is the griefe of his Mother.</hi>
Vngodly children, like a viperous brood,
do eate out the very hearts of their parents,
and doe stab their hearts with sorrow, and
heavinesse. It is a strange speech of <hi>Salomon,</hi>
17. 21. <hi>He that begetteth a foole</hi> (that is, an
ungracious child, for that is <hi>Salomons</hi> foole)
<hi>doth it to his sorrow; and the Father of a foole
hath no joy.</hi> I marvaile not more, that old
<hi>Ely</hi> brake his necke with his fall at last, then
that his sonnes had not broken his heart
long before, with their vicious courses.
Oh let us therefore serve God in our youth,
that it may be a comfort to our Parents in
their age. Here is the fifth Benefit.</p>
                  <p>But besides the Vtilitie,<note place="margin">2. Motive. 2 Necessity. Eccles. 12. 1.</note> let us (in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place) consider the Necessitie. For
besides the expresse charge that wee have
from God to this purpose, see the dangerous
consequences, and inconveniences that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
upon the neglect of it.<note place="margin">Sundry mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs which flow from the neglect of it.</note> So that wee
must needs doe it, or we must doe worse.
Now the mischiefes that doe especially flow
from the neglect of Gods service in our
youth, are principally five.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Mischiefe</hi> Wee shall serve worse Masters,</note> If we doe not serve God in our
youth, we shall serve worse Masters, <hi>sc.</hi> the
Devill, the world, and the flesh. He that
serveth not God, must serve the Devill; it
is unavoydable; observe it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2.
<hi>Wherein, in times past ye walked, according to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4060:119"/>
the course of this world, according to the Prince
of the power of the ayre, the Spirit that now
worketh in the children of disobedience.</hi> But
how came this to passe? See, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. <hi>At
that time yee were without Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in the world:</hi> He that is without
<hi>Christ,</hi> and without God, will not, nor
cannot be without his lustes. Vntill we
become the servants of God, we are all the
vassals of Sathan, and slaves to our own fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
lustes. <hi>Titus</hi> 3. 3. <hi>For wee our selves
were sometimes foolish, serving diverse lustes,
and pleasures,</hi> &amp;c. Loe, our woefull Masters,
untill we set our selves to serve God; <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in malice, hatefull, and hating one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
sayth the Apostle there: <hi>Yee cannot
serve God and Mammon,</hi> sayth our blessed
Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24. As if he had sayd,
Yee cannot but serve one of them; <hi>He that
committeth sinne, is the servant of sinne;</hi> a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Master. See what lamentable wages
such Masters usually give their servants in
the end; <hi>The wages of sinne is death,</hi> sayth
the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. See then how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is to serve God, and that speedily;
for till then, we must of necessitie serve wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Masters, for wofull wages. But O the
happinesse of such as spend time in Gods
service; <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. <hi>But now being made free
from sinne, and become the servants of God,
yee have your fruit unto holinesse, and the
end everlasting life.</hi> There is excellent
wages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:4060:120"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Mischiefe</hi> The more difficult.</note> The longer we stay, before
we set our selves to serve God, the more
difficult and hard we shall finde it, if we
doe returne to God at last. He that posteth
the contrary way,<note place="margin">Qui non est hodie, cras minus aptus erit.</note> is still the farther from
his journeys end, and will have the lesse
minde to returne. Continuance in evill,
breedeth a custome in sinne, which is not
left, without great difficultie; <hi>Ier.</hi> 13. 23.
<hi>Can the Aethiopian change his skinne, or the
Leopard his spots? then may yee also doe good,
that are accustomed to doe evill.</hi> It is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
difficult. When a man hath gotten
a custome of swearing, or drinking, or
gameing, how hard is it for such to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed?
A twig is easily dealt with, which
is immoveable, if it grow till it become a
tree. How tractable was <hi>Joash</hi> in his youth?
but in his age intolerable. He that was gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by <hi>Jehojada</hi> in his youth, killed his
sonne <hi>Zachariah</hi> afterward. Much more, he
that is bad in his youth, may be worse in
his age.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> God hath just cause, to reject such in their age.</note> How just is it with God to
reject them in their age, which have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
his service in their youth. Men thinke
any thing is good enough for God, the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
old age, the blinde, and the lame, and
the sicke; but how much they are deceived,
the Prophet sheweth, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. <hi>Offer it now
to thy Prince, or thy Governour,</hi> (sayth the
Lord) <hi>would he accept it at thy hands?</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that a Souldier should spend all his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:4060:120"/>
youth, in service against his Soveraigne,
and then in his old age should offer his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to his Prince: How justly might such
a base offer be rejected? Why should we
spend the flower of our youth in vanitie,
and yet thinke that God should accept of us
in our age? He that runneth from God, the
greatest part of his life, God may hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
from him at his death:<note place="margin">See their Histories.</note> witnesse <hi>Spira,</hi>
and the <hi>Kentish</hi> Apothecarie; how wofully
did God hide himselfe from them in death,
that had neglected his service in their life?
When the Father seeth the childe readie to
play with every toy, or feather, and not to
minde his way, he steppeth behinde a bush,
and hideth himselfe a good while before the
childe can finde him: so dealeth God with
his children; <hi>Verely, thou art a God that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thy selfe, O God of Israel the Saviour,
Isa.</hi> 45. 15.</p>
                  <p>If Gods children will walke so neare hell
mouth, the greatest part of their life,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Harris</hi> Abs. Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</note> no
marvell if at the time of death, the Lord
take them by the heeles, and make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
he will throw them in. So I conceive
the Lord dealt with <hi>Spira,</hi> and the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie.
<hi>I love them that love me,</hi> sayth Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

they hated knowledge, and did not choose

off the service of God to the last. Let <hi>Esau</hi>
admonish every one of us, to beware of
comming too late; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 16, 17. <hi>Lest
there be any fornicator, or prophane person, as
Esau, who for one morsell of meate, sold his
birth-right:</hi> Why so? <hi>For yee know, how that
afterward (when he would have inherited the
blessing) he was rejected; for he found no place
of repentance, though he sought it carefully
with teares.</hi> He that (prophanely) prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
a messe of pottage, before a birth-right,
is justly rejected, when he would inherit
the blessing. He that hateth to be reformed
in his youth, is very likely to be rejected in
his age: <hi>Because I called, and yee refused,</hi>
sayth Wisedome, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>I will therefore
laugh at your destruction, and mocke when your
feare commeth, ver.</hi> 26. He that laugheth
Wisedome to scorne, when she reproveth,
is justly derided of Wisedome, in his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

yet a man is not sure that he shall, or
can repent: Repentance is the gift of God,
as well as remission of sinnes: so that, as
none can be pardoned, unlesse he repent;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4060:121"/>
so none can repent, but those to whom it is
given: <hi>If God peradventure will give them
repentance, to the acknowledging of the truth,</hi>
sayth the Apostle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25. He that is
so often called to repentance in his youth,
and neglecteth it, God may justly deny to
give him repentance in his age, <hi>Except yee

<hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 5. and except God give it, you
cannot repent. Oh therefore, whilest God
calleth to repentance, and offereth the

afterward.</p>

1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. Bruitish in life, and bruitish in
death; after God smote him, <hi>his heart dyed
within him, and he was even like a stone:</hi> he
had a long time to repent in, but he wanted
an heart, his heart was dead within him,
and he was like a stone. If a man were sure
to repent at last, and that his repentance
should surely be accepted, he might the farre
more safely deferre and put off his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,

what they say, or doe: O yes (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
it is very materiall: he that sinneth
in his youth, unlesse he repent, is like to
smart in his age. It doth not extenuate our
sinnes, but aggravate them (rather) that
they are the sinnes of our youth. See how
ironically the Wise-man speaketh to the rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
young man, in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Rejoyce,
O young man, in thy youth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that (for these things) God will bring

aggravated the sinne of <hi>Sodome,</hi> that young

beastly and filthy, both young and old,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 4. Did at any whit excuse, or exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate
the sinne of <hi>Eli's</hi> sonnes, that they
were young men? No; it did aggravate it
rather, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 17. <hi>Wherefore the sinne of
the young men, was very great before the Lord,</hi>
sayth the Text. An odious thing for a young
man to be old in wickednesse; for a young
man to be an old drunkard, or an old adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
&amp;c. (that is, a man of a long standing
in viciousnesse,) doth aggravate the sinne
very much. Yea, God cannot endure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse,
no, not in children: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let no man say, it is no matter for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
how prophane they be, or how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious,
no matter if they be mockers, and

God of such pure eyes, that he hateth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse,

even in children. See an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment

the old Prophet <hi>Elisha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 23,
24. <hi>As he was going up by the way to Bethel,</hi>
sayth the Text, <hi>there came forth little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
out of the Citie, and mocked him, saying,
Goe up, thou bald-head, Goe up, thou bald-head:</hi>
now see the event of this; The old <hi>Prophet
turned backe, and looked on them, and cursed
them in the Name of the Lord, and there came
forth two shee Beares out of the wood, and tare
fortie and two children of them.</hi> God will not
suffer the prophanenesse of children to goe
unpunished. O how much better had it
beene for these children, that they had been
employed in the worship and service of
God, that the Prophet might have blessed
them in the Name of the Lord! Now the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of all that neglect the worship and
service of God, is a most cursed estate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be young, or old, <hi>For cursed are
all they that erre from Gods Commandements,</hi>
as <hi>David</hi> speakes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 21. whether they
be young, or olde. Not onely the curse of
the Prophet, but the curse of the great God,
is readie to seize upon them. O then let us
set our selves to serve God in our youth,
and we may have the blessing of God upon
us, both in our youth and age. Thus you see

that we would be esteemed to be Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
hence we come to Church, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon his Ordinances, yea, no doubt,
but if we should be questioned, the most
of us would be ready to say to God, as the

Looke even out the best, and meetest of your

saying, Here Lord, wee offer unto thee our

Another Motive, to be constant.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We are the Lords bought ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

and should pay the summe, and set him at

assure a man, that when he dyeth, he shall

thing it is, that a man should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to say with the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Wee
know, that when the earthly house of our taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
shall be dissolved, we have a building of
God, an house, not made with hands, eternall in
the heavens.</hi> But how came the Apostle by
this assurance? Vpon what ground did he
thus confidently assure himselfe? That we
shall see, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9. Wherefore <hi>we labour, that
whether present, or absent, we may be accepted
of him.</hi> This was the ground of his rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
<hi>The testimonie of our conscience, that in

simplicitie, and godly sinceritie; not with flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wisedome, but by the grace of God, we have
had our conversation in the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12.
Vpon this ground he expecteth a crowne

required, and expressed in the Lords graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<hi>In due time wee shall reape, if wee faint not,</hi>
sayth the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 9. Yea, this dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and constancie in Gods service, is
that which will give a man abundant assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of entrance into the Kingdome of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus

Oh what a precious thing is this!</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Benefit.</hi> This will be our crowne of glorie in our age.</note> This will be a crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to us, in our old age; <hi>sc.</hi> if we be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.
See the testimony of <hi>Salomon</hi> for this,

also the Lord will set a crowne of glorie
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4060:128"/>
upon the hoarie head, that is found in the
way of Righteousnesse, and is constant in
Gods service. Here was <hi>Pauls</hi> crowne of

he was once truely converted, and was
entred into Gods service, see how constant
he was in it, even untill old age: yea, death
it selfe: as appeareth by his owne speech
to <hi>Philemon, Ver.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Though I might be
much bold in Christ, to enjoyne thee that which

This was <hi>Mnaasons</hi> crowne of glory, that
he was justly called an old Disciple; <hi>They
brought us to the house of one Mnaason, an old
Disciple, with whom we should lodge,</hi> sayth the

                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:4060:129"/>
Oh what an admirable thing is this! Who
would not but labour to be assured that he
is of the number of <hi>Christs</hi> true Disciples,
and no hypocrite? Why now, constancie
in Gods service will assure a man of this.
See an excellent place for this purpose, <hi>Joh.</hi>
8. 31, 32. <hi>If ye continue in my Word</hi> (in
yeelding of constant obedience unto my

yee shall know the truth, and the truth shall
make yee free,</hi> sayth our Saviour. But on the
other side, he that wavereth, and is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
hath great cause to suspect himselfe,
to be no better then an hypocrite. See an
excellent place for this purpose, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 3.
<hi>Blessed are they that doe judgement, and he that
doth righteousnesse at all times:</hi> they are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
happie, that are constant in Religion:
but the hypocrite is fickle and inconstant;
<hi>Job</hi> 27. 8. <hi>What is the hope of the hypocrite,
though he hath gained, when God taketh away
his soule?</hi> He is in a woefull estate at that
time. Why so? And who are these, that have
cause to suspect themselves to be but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites?
That yee shall see, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. <hi>Will he
delight himselfe in the Almightie? Will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
call upon God?</hi> Will he be constant
in Gods service? No sure; in time of
temptation they fall away, and so discover
their unsoundnesse and hypocrisie; for so
argueth the holy Apostle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>They
went out from us, but they were not of us; for
if they had beene of us, they would no doubt
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4060:129"/>
have continued with us; but they went out,
that they might be made manifest that they
were not all of us. Will yee also goe away?</hi>
sayth our Saviour to his Disciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.
67. He that is a true Disciple of <hi>Christ,</hi> will
be constant in his service, and never depart
from him: yea, he will be readie to say,
with <hi>Peter,</hi> (though without boasting of
his owne strength) <hi>Though all men should
forsake thee, will I never forsake thee: yea,
though I should dye with thee, yet will I not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thee, Mat.</hi> 26. 35. No question <hi>Peter</hi>
spake as he thought, when he said so, though
his owne strength failed him, when it came
to the poynt. But he that resolveth the like,
in the strength of the Lord, and out of the
sight and sense of his owne weaknesse, (if he
should be left to himselfe) that man may
comfortably assure himselfe, that he is a true
Disciple of <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>

which is constant in doing him service;
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>This is the confidence that wee
have in him, that if we aske any thing, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his will, he heareth us.</hi> Oh what an

soule, that his prayers are heard, and finde
acceptance with the Lord? Now if a man
be constant in Gods service, he may be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

seeke, and yee shall finde; knocke, and it shall be
opened unto you.</hi> Or that in <hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 24. <hi>It
shall come to passe, that when they call, I will
answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will
heare.</hi> Now nothing will more certainly
assure us of this, then constancie in Gods
service. See that excellent speech of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 15. 7. <hi>If yee abide in me, and my
Word abide in you; yee shall aske what yee will,
and it shall be done unto you.</hi> Constancie in
Gods service, assureth us, that God heareth
our prayers, and will grant our requests, so
farre as shall be expedient. Hereupon is that
admirable speech of the blind man, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 31.
<hi>We know that God heareth not sinners; but if
any man be a worshipper of God, and a doer of
his will, him he heareth.</hi> Loe another speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

in some sort to distinguish it from false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and opinions, that are in the world;
<hi>My sheepe heare my voyce, and follow me,</hi> sayth
our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27. Yea, they know
his voyce, and are able to distinguish it
from the voyce of strangers, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>The
Sheepe follow him,</hi> (that is, the good Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard)
<hi>for they know his voyce, and a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
will they not follow, but flee from him, for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4060:130"/>
they know not the voyce of strangers,</hi> sayth the

So, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 12. 14. <hi>What man is he
that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the
way that he shall choose.</hi> Yea, <hi>the secret of the
Lord is with them that feare him, and he will
shew them his Covenant:</hi> They that feare and
serve God constantly, shall be acquainted
with the secrets of Religion. O what an
happinesse is it for a man to be assured in his
soule, that he is of the true Religion, among
all the religions that are in the world.
Hence is that speech of our Saviour, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.
16, 17. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but his that
sent mee:</hi> yea, but how should a man know
that? that our Saviour sheweth, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17.
<hi>If any man will doe his will, he shall know of the
Doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I
speake of my selfe:</hi> A most sweet and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
benefit: a constant and conscionable
care to yeeld obedience to what we know,
is the best meanes to perfect, and increase
our knowledge. This made <hi>David</hi> wiser
then his enemies; yea, then the Ancient;
yea, then his teachers; because he was a

<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 98, 99. &amp;c. He that would be
assured of the truth of his Religion, let him
be constant in the duties of Gods worship

that affoorded <hi>Iob</hi> such comfort, in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities,
but his sinceritie, and constancie?
Two excellent places we have for this; the
one, in <hi>Job</hi> 27. 5. <hi>God forbid, that I should
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4060:131"/>
justifie you,</hi> sayth he to his friends. Why
not? Were they not honest and religious
men? Yes surely, they were gracious men,
and full of wisedome; but yet <hi>Iob</hi> would
not justifie them in that particular, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they condemned him for an hypocrite:
they charged him with inconstancie, and
hypocrisie, and that he would never yeeld
unto, <hi>Till I dye, I will not remove my inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
from me; my righteousnesse I hold fast,
and will not let it goe, my heart shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
me, so long as I live.</hi> This was the
onely thing, that did affoord him comfort,
in his great extremities, and calamities, and
unjust censures of his friends; he knew,
that he had beene sincere, and constant in
Gods service. The other place for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
is, <hi>Iob</hi> 23. when God hid himselfe from
him, that he could not see him, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8, 9.
whether he went forward, or backward,
on the right hand, or on the left, yet he
could not finde God; What was his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?
<hi>Yet when he hath tryed me, I shall come
out like gold;</hi> I shall be the better for all this
at last, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. Well, how came he to be
assured of this? That yee shall see, <hi>Ver.</hi> 11,
12. <hi>My foote hath held his steps, his way have
I kept, and not declined; neither have I gone
backe from the Commandement of his lippes;
I have esteemed the words of his lippes, more
then my necessary food:</hi> Here was his comfort,
that he had beene constant in Gods service;
it was grounded upon the consideration of
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4060:132"/>
his perseverance. The second particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
is that of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 18. when he
was in many waters, readie to be drowned,
environed with strong enemies, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16, 17.
Now what was his comfort in these cases?
That yee shall see, <hi>Ver.</hi> 21. <hi>For I have kept the
wayes of the Lord, and have not wickedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from my God.</hi> Loe here, what will
affoord us comfort in our greatest miseries,
and extremities, <hi>sc.</hi> Constancie in cleaving
to God; and a vigilant watchfull care, not
to depart from him: <hi>All his judgements were
before me, and I did not put away his Statutes
from me, Ver.</hi> 22. I have beene constant in
his service. So, that of <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. see what
dangerous straites that good man was in;
<hi>Ver.</hi> 107. <hi>I am afflicted very much:</hi> How
much <hi>David? My soule is continually in my
hand;</hi> I doe even daily cary my life in my
hand; there is but even a step, betweene me
and death: Well, how came that to passe?
<hi>The wicked have layd a snare for me,</hi> sayth he,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 110. Well, what was his comfort in
all this, his Staffe to uphold him in all these
dangers? Surely his constancie in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
<hi>I have sworne, and will performe it, that
I will keepe thy righteous judgements, V.</hi> 106.
and <hi>Ver.</hi> 111, 112. <hi>Thy Testimonies have I
claimed as my heritage for ever; for they are
the rejoycing of my heart; and I have inclined
my heart to performe thy Statutes alwayes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto the end.</hi> Loe, this will affoord us
comfort in the greatest troubles that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:4060:132"/>
us. Yea, this will affoord comfort, and
confidence, even in death; <hi>Though he kill
me, yet will I trust in him,</hi> sayth <hi>Iob,</hi> upon
this ground, <hi>Iob</hi> 13. 15. See an example of
this in that good King <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> What
was his comfort when the Prophet brought
him the message of death, from the Lord,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 3? Surely, his constancie, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
in the duties of Gods worship and
service; <hi>Remember now, O Lord, I beseech
thee, how I have walked before thee, in truth,
and with a perfect heart, and have done that
which hath beene good in thy sight, (i.e.</hi>) here
is my chiefe comfort in this case. So, this
made <hi>Paul</hi> thinke on death with comfort,
and rejoycing; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. So, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.
7, 8. <hi>The time of my departure is at hand, and
I am now readie to be offered, sc.</hi> in sacrifice to
God by death. Now see the grounds of the
Apostles comfort and confidence in that
case; <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
my course, I have kept the faith,</hi> (I have
spent time in Gods service constantly,)
<hi>henceforth there is layd up for me a crowne of
Righteousnesse.</hi> And thus you see at large
the Vtilitie of the dutie, which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

of the expresse command of God, to

condition required on our part, as ever we
expect the reward promised, (as wee have

All our righteousnesse shall not so much as

a whit the better for it, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 24.
<hi>The soule of the Lord shall have no pleasure in
him: Heb.</hi> 10. 38. See an experiment of this,
in two famous examples to this purpose, <hi>sc.
Demas</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> See what a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
the Apostle had of this <hi>Demas,</hi> he
remembreth his love to the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losse,
Col.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Demas-greeteth you:</hi> yea,
he was one of <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow labourers, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon,

cryeth out of him afterward, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10.
<hi>Demas hath forsaken us, having loved this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
world: Demas</hi> hath lost all his labour,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:4060:133"/>
and the credit of all his former proceedings.
So for <hi>Alexander;</hi> see how zealous, and
forward he seemed to be, in <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 33.
he was very like to have suffered Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and yet see how the Apostle disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth

2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Alexander the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-smith

it is compared to the vomit of a Dogge,

2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. Yea, if any man draw backe,

lost in their owne sense, and feeling, which
is even a little hell upon earth; as appeareth
by the example of <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> and <hi>William
Rogers</hi> of <hi>Cranebrooke</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the Stories of

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:4060:134"/>
the woefull estate of <hi>Lot's</hi> wife; Let the

was turned into a pillar of salt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 46.
Whosoever doe thus, unlesse they repent

to doe us mischiefe, we had need continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to stand upon our guard, and ply our
worke; for if we give over, we immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
become a prey to his malicious cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Whilst the little bird is in action, and
flying from bush to bush, and from place to
place, she is in no danger of being shot to
death; but when she sitteth still, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
a prey to the cruell fowler, it is
the Holy Ghosts owne similitude, <hi>Prov.</hi>
26. 2. <hi>As the bird by wandring, and the

shall not come.</hi> When did <hi>David</hi> become a
prey to the Devill and lust, but when he
lay idely at home, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 11. upon his
bed. The Devill seeketh continually to doe
us hurt, and by doing nothing, we learne to
doe evill. Therefore this is the Apostles
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:4060:134"/>
argument, to perswade to constancy and
vigilancy, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5. 8. <hi>For your adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Devill, as a roring Lion, goeth about,
seeking continually whom he may devoure.</hi>
And thus yee see also the necessitie of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
and perseverance in the duties of
Gods worship, and service. It is equall,
profitable, and necessary.</p>
                  <p>Now for the Meanes that wee must use,<note place="margin">Meanes.</note>
that we may be constant, I will give you
only one generall, which will divide it

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. In generall,<note place="margin">

heart to this purpose, without this it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any to be constant in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
therefore saith <hi>David, Psalme</hi> 119.
112. <hi>I have inclined my heart, to performe
thy Statutes alwayes.</hi> It is only a good,
and an honest heart, that is able to make a
man hold out in Gods wayes, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
sheweth, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15. This made <hi>Iehu</hi>
fall away at last, notwithstanding all the
faire shewes he made of zeale for God, and
his truth, <hi>But Iehu tooke no heede, to walke
in the Law of the Lord God of Israel, with
all his heart,</hi> saith the Text, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 31.
This made him cleave to <hi>Ieroboam's</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
Idolatry. So this made <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
fall off, notwithstanding all his fine
shewes of Religion, his keeping company
with the Apostles, his being baptized, &amp;c.
he shewed plainly what he was at last: And
how came that? <hi>I perceive that thy heart is
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4060:135"/>
not right, in the sight of God,</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 21. If we would perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in Gods service, we must labour to
have our hearts set in a right frame.</p>
                  <p>Now (more particularly) if ye aske me,<note place="margin">In sundry specialties.</note>
what disposition or frame of heart is it, that
we must labour for,<note place="margin">2. Speciall.</note> if we would bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in Gods service?</p>
                  <p>1. I answer,<note place="margin">1 It must bee a faithfull or belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heart.</note> that if we would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in Gods service, we must labour for a
beleeving heart, an heart fraught with the
precious grace of true saving faith. This is
that, which will make a man constant and
victorious over all impediments, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5,
4, 5. <hi>For whosoever beleeveth and is borne
of God, overcommeth the world: and this
is the victory that overcommeth the world,
even your faith.</hi> True saving faith is of a
lasting nature; he that hath it, <hi>can never
perish, but have everlasting life, Iohn</hi> 3. 16.
Yea, this doth alwayes end in salvation,
1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 9. <hi>Receiving the end of your
faith, even the salvation of your soules,</hi>
saith the Apostle, if any man draw backe,
and fall off from Gods service, it is either
for want of faith, or at least for want of a
true saving faith. When the Apostle had
shewed the danger of backsliding; see the
remedy which the Apostle prescribeth, or
intimateth (at least) in that case, <hi>If any man
draw backe, my soule shall have no pleasure
in him. We are not of them that draw back<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4060:135"/>
of them that beleeve,</hi> or follow faith <hi>to the
saving of the soule,</hi> there is the remedy,
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> 10. 38, 39. If any thing make us
hold out against Sathan, in that dangerous
conflict, it must be the <hi>shield of faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may quench all the fiery darts of the
wicked, Ephesians</hi> 6. 16. <hi>Above all, take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you the shield of faith:</hi> if any thing at
all can doe you good, this is it.</p>
                  <p>2. It must be such a <hi>faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A loving heart.</note> as <hi>worketh by</hi>

                     <hi>love, Galath.</hi> 5. 6. And therefore in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place, we must labour for a loving
heart, if we would be constant: Let us
serve God for love, and that will make us
persevere in it. Men will bee constant in
the workes they love, the <hi>Epicure</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
in pleasures, and recreations; the
covetous, in toyleing for the world; the
Student is constant at his booke; And why
so? Because they love these things. Charity
will make a man hold out, <hi>it hopeth all
things, and endureth all things,</hi> saith the
Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. It never faileth, <hi>ver.</hi> 8.
They that serve God for love, resemble the
Sunne, that shineth more and more, till the
perfect day, or like Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
fast for ever, and cannot be removed,
Psalm.</hi> 125. 1. See how constant is <hi>Iacob</hi> in
serving for <hi>Rachel, Genesis</hi> 29. 20. <hi>He ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
seven yeares for her, and they seemed
but a few dayes, in regard of the love that
he had to her,</hi> saith the Text; Love set him
a worke, and that made him constant in it.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:4060:136"/>
Now what a shame for us, if <hi>Iacob</hi> should
love <hi>Rachel,</hi> better than we love God, <hi>If
ye love me, keepe my Commandements,</hi> saith
our Saviour, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 14. As if hee had
said, If yee love me, ye will doe it. Labour
of love, will be constant. He whose boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and charity is grounded upon true love
to God, will be constant in it. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
place to this purpose, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. 10.
<hi>God is not unrighteous, to forget your worke,

Surely by the constancy of it, <hi>In

Gods service, we must labour to have our
hearts fraught with the true feare of God.
This is one of the gifts of God, that are
without repentance, <hi>Romans 11. 29. The
feare of the Lord is cleane, and endureth for
ever, Psalme 19. 8. Blessed is the man that
feareth alwayes, Proverbs</hi> 28. 14. Hee that
truly feareth God, will feare him alwayes,
this will make him constant in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40. <hi>I will put my feare in their
hearts, that they shall never depart from me,</hi>
saith the Lord. The true feare of God will
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:4060:136"/>
make us constant, and therefore it is a chiefe
point of wisdome, to serve God with feare,
as is intimated, in <hi>Psalme</hi> 2. 10, 11. Be
<hi>wise now therefore, O ye Kings, be instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ye Iudges of the earth;</hi> Well, wherein
should they chiefely shew their wisdome?
<hi>Verse</hi> 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with feare, and
rejoyce with trembling;</hi> Why so? Surely,
because then they would bee constant, and
keepe in the right way, or else they would
soone perish from it, as is intimated in the
next <hi>verse</hi> 12. <hi>Kisse the Sonne, lest be
be angry, and yee perish from the right
way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">A sound and upright, or a good and an honest heart.</note> If we would bee constant in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
Gods service, we must labour for a sound,

15. <hi>Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward

                  <p>The Motives that may perswade us,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> to
spend as much time as we can possibly, in
the duties of GODS publike Ordinances,
they are principally these foure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Because the time present,<note place="margin">Time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, is the only time for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</note> I meane, the
time of this present life, is the onely time,
that we have to this purpose, either now,
or never, must we serve God in these duties
and Ordinances: as for Purgatory, it is but
a popish dreame, a very fancy: the time of
this life is the onely time for this purpose.
Hereupon is that speech of our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 9. 4. <hi>I must worke the workes of God,
while it is day, the night commeth, when no
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:4060:139"/>
man can work:</hi> by night, he meaneth death,
and the grave; there is no worke to bee
done then; this appeareth by the next
verse, that this is our Saviours meaning,
<hi>(i. e.) While I live I must finish the worke
that I have in hand,</hi> death commeth, when
no man can worke: no, then <hi>we rest from
our labours, Revel.</hi> 14. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>whilest we have
time, let us doe good,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi>
6. 10. There is a set time, appointed for
well doing, which is the time of this life,
which is by no meanes to bee let slip, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted?
if death once come, it presently
putteth an end to our labour: when night
commeth, men shut up shop. Excellent
therefore to this purpose, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 10.
<hi>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to doe, doe it
with thy might.</hi> Ply thy worke hard. Now
marke the reason, which he giveth to this
purpose; <hi>For there is no worke, nor devise,
nor knowledge, nor wisedome in the grave
whither thou goest;</hi> there is no opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
for doing any worke there, no, that is
the evening, a time of reckoning, but not of
working; that is a time of receiving wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
not of labour. What saith the Lord of
the Vineyard, when the evening was come?
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>Call the labourers, and give
them their hire:</hi> not set them a worke, but
pay them their wages. If therefore wee
looke for any wages at evening, let us ply
our worke in the day time. This is the first
Motive.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="264" facs="tcp:4060:140"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Motive.</hi> This time is short.</note> As the time of this life, is the
onely time for this purpose; so it is very
short, and very uncertaine; the time of
him that liveth longest here, is but short,
<hi>Iob</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Man that is borne of a woman,
hath but a short time, and is full of misery.
Remember, Lord, how short my time is:</hi> Our
worke is great,<note place="margin">Ars longa, vitabrevis</note> and our time short, and
therefore wee had need to be diligent: our
journey is long, and our time short, and
therefore we had need to runne speedily, as
well as constantly. Time passeth away with
a swift foote, <hi>My dayes passe away as the
most swift Ships,</hi> saith <hi>Iob</hi> 9. 26. <hi>Man is
like to vanity, his dayes are as a shadow, that
passeth away, Psalme</hi> 144. 4. Yea, <hi>we bring
our yeares to an end, as a tale that is tould,
Psalm.</hi> 90. 9. <hi>And our life is very like unto a
vapour, Iames</hi> 4. 14. Seeing then our time
is so short and withall so uncertaine; wee
had need to runne with speed (as well as
patience) the race that is set before us. If
the time were short, yet if it were certaine,
there were lesse danger in slacknesse: but it
is not more short, then uncertaine; like the
thiefe, that commeth in the night, or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
returne home, who hath set no time,
but commandeth his servants to watch,
<hi>Watch ye therefore, for yee know neither the
day, nor the houre,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi>
25. 13. <hi>But blessed is that servant, whom
his Lord, when he commeth shall finde so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>
watching, and working with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 43.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:4060:140"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Motive.</hi> Wee stay long before we begin.</note> After wee once begin to serve
God, we had need to use all diligence, and
spend as much time as wee can that way;
because wee are long before wee spend any
time at all to this purpose. Some stay twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
thirtie, fortie, fiftie yeares, before they
doe God any service at all, to any purpose;
all such had need to worke hard, when
they have once begun. Yea, and such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
betime, they stay long, before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
our child-hood, and youth are a great
part spent, before we enter into Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 1. There were some
that began early in the morning, but it was
the third houre, our nine of the clocke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any more came, <hi>verse</hi> 3. and some stayd
untill the eleventh houre, five a clocke at
night, an houre before Sun set; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
such had need to worke hard. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
we spend time, for our selves, for the
world, for Sathan, before we spend any time
for God; for ye are all the <hi>children of wrath
by nature, Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>serving diverse lusts
and pleasures, Tit.</hi> 2. 3. So that, for the
most part, it is long before we serve God.
Marke that speech of the Apostle, to this
purpose, <hi>Romans</hi> 13. 11. <hi>And that knowing
the time, that it is high time to awake out of
sleepe,</hi> It is high time to serve God, for the
night is farre spent, that is, the time of this
life is farre spent; it is high time to fall
to worke. Now lay these together, the
time of this life is the only time that wee
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:4060:141"/>
have to serve God, it is very short, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
at best, and withall it is very farre
spent before we begin, therefore wee had
need to ply our worke with all diligence.
This is the Apostles chiefe Argument to
perswade us to spend much time in Gods
service, or according to his will, 2 <hi>Peter</hi>
4. 2. <hi>That he no longer should live the rest of
his time in the flesh, to the lusts of men, but
to the will of God:</hi> Why so? see <hi>verse</hi> 3.
<hi>For the time past of our life may suffice us, to
have wrought the will of the Gentiles, (i. e.)</hi>
it is enough, and too much, alas, that wee
have mispent so much of our precious time
already; it is now high time to redeeme
time to spend in Gods service. Hee that
hath but a small stocke in all, and mispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
some part of that too, had need to bee
sparing and frugall with that which is left:
here is our very case, our time that we have
to spend in Gods service, the whole time of
our life, is but short, wee have mispent
much already, wee had need to spend
all the rest (if it were possible) wholly in
Gods service.</p>
                  <p>Fourth Motive,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Motive.</hi> The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our Master.</note> to perswade us to spend
much time in Gods service, is drawne from
the consideration of the excellency of that
Master whom wee serve, <hi>Behold, Lord, how
that I am thy servant,</hi> saith <hi>David, Psalme</hi>
116. 16. <hi>Ye call me Lord, and Master</hi> (saith
our Saviour) <hi>and yee say well, for so I am,
Iohn</hi> 13. 23. Yea, Lord, so thou art, abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:4060:141"/>
the best and most incomparable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
in heaven and earth. This I will strive
and endeavour to manifest, in sundry parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;
which will be so many severall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
to perswade us to spend as much time
in his service as we can possibly.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Almightie Master; able to defend his servants, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them.</note> Our heavenly Master is a most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
or Almightie Master, able to defend
us from dangers, able to provide for us;
he is God Almightie; as we professe in the
first Article of our Creede: So, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. last.
Thus God himselfe encourageth <hi>Abraham</hi>

Almightie,</hi> or the Strong God, <hi>walke before
me, and be upright. He is able to bring to passe
what he pleaseth, in heaven or earth, Psal.</hi> 115.
3. <hi>Is any thing too hard for the Lord?</hi> sayth
God himselfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14. He is able to
defend us from all dangers that may befall
us, and to supply us with all necessaries;
so that we neede feare nothing, if we be
carefull to serve God: <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>Feare not
Abraham, I am thy Shield,</hi> (therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can hurt thee) <hi>and I am thy exceeding
great reward,</hi> (therefore make no question
of thy wages) let no man thinke, or say,
<hi>it is in vaine to serve God;</hi> for we serve such
a Master, as is both able to defend us, and
pay us our wages to the full, that we neede
never repent our worke: <hi>For he is able to
doe for us exceeding abundantly, above all that
we can aske, or thinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> sayth the Apostle, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi>
3. 20. there is his power. This made
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:4060:142"/>
the three noble <hi>Iewes</hi> sticke to Gods service,
they would by no meanes change their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
because they knew his power, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,
both to defend, and reward them,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Our God, whom we serve, is able
to deliver us, and he will deliver us out of thine

be not afraid,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the Lord thy God is with
thee whithersoever thou goest.</hi> Now if God
be with us, we need not feare who are, or
can be against us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 31. Especially,
we never set our selves to serve God in the
duties of his publike worship and service,
but he is present with us, in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Loe, I am
with you alwayes, unto the end of the world:</hi>
This is an excellent argument, to perswade
us to spend much time in Gods service,
how difficult, or dangerous soever it may
seeme to be; because wee may be sure of
Gods presence with us; <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 10. <hi>Feare
not, I am with thee; be not afraid, I am thy
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:4060:142"/>
God, I will helpe thee,</hi> &amp;c. What if we passe
through the fire, or water afflictions, yet
we need feare nothing, so long as wee are
sure the Lord is with us. Now see what a
promise wee have for this; <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 1, 2.
<hi>Feare not,</hi> sayth the Lord, <hi>I have redeemed
thee, thou art mine, (i. e.)</hi> thou art my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
by purchase, or redemption. What
then? <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>When thou passest through the
waters, I will be with thee; and through the
rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou
walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burnt,
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fire, nor water can hurt us, if God be
with us. This made <hi>Ioseph</hi> prosper so excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
in all his dangers; He was first cast
into a pit, then sold into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> then cast
into prison, put in the Stockes, the <hi>iron en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
even into his soule,</hi> but in all these extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
the Lord was with him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 21.
Yea, and at last, made him Ruler of all <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
This made <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prosper so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly
in all his enterprises: see how the
Text reporteth it, in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 5. <hi>He tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
in the Lord God of Israel, and clave unto
him, and served him, ver.</hi> 6. Then see the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
<hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>And the Lord was with him, and
prospered him whithersoever he went:</hi> and
therefore see how he could encourage his
Souldiers against the invasion of the King
of <hi>Assyria,</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 7. <hi>Be not afraid
of the King of Assyria, be strong and couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
for</hi> (notwithstanding all his multitude)
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4060:143"/>
                     <hi>there is more with us, then with him.</hi> Now see
how he proveth it, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. both by way of
confession, and by direct affirmation; <hi>With
him</hi> (indeede) <hi>is an arme of flesh;</hi> but <hi>with
us is the Lord our God to helpe us, and to fight
our battells.</hi> Yea, thus the Lord encouraged
<hi>Paul,</hi> to an unwearied painfulnes in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Gospel, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 9, 10. <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
but speake, and hold not thy peace; for I
am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to
hurt thee.</hi> This will make a man couragious,
even in the strongest dangers, in the very
jawes of death, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 4. <hi>Though I walke
through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will feare no evill,</hi> sayth holy <hi>David; for thou
art with me; thy rod and thy staffe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
me.</hi> Let us therefore be couragious,
and abundant in the duties of Gods service,
for the Lord is ever present with us, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
us, and to provide for us. This is <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi>
reason, in the verse immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the words of this Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. of this
Psalme; <hi>For the Lord is a Sunne, and a Shield,
he will give grace and glorie, and no good thing
will he withhold from them that walke upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
in his service. So, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. 19.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:4060:143"/>
that the Lord is very pitifull, and of tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi>
As if he had sayd, yee may clearely see
in Gods dealings with <hi>Iob,</hi> that in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he approved himselfe to be very piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and of tender mercie. A strange place
to this purpose is that we have, <hi>Judges</hi> 10.
Though he seemeth to reject them, and hold
them at staves end for a time, yet upon their
repentance, see how sweetly he approveth
and manifesteth his compassion towards
them, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>They put away their strange
gods, and served the Lord, and his soule was
grieved for the miseries of Israel:</hi> though he
may shut up his bowells for a time, yet at
last his compassions will finde a vent, his
very soule is grieved for our miseries: So,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 18, 19, 20. Consider the estate of
repenting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> the Lord seemeth angry
with him, and speaketh against him, yea,
and it may be smiteth him too: but no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
doth <hi>Ephraim</hi> truely repent, and smite
upon his thigh, and fall out with his sinnes,
but then, see how God is affected with him:
when he thinketh worst of himselfe, then
God thinketh the best of him: see <hi>ver.</hi> 20.
<hi>Is Ephraim my deare childe?</hi> It may be <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
thought himselfe scarce worthy the

calleth him his childe, yea, his deare childe.
Well, how shall this appeare? Surely by
the Lords gracious pity and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him: now he is sorry for his sinnes,
God is sorry that he did so much as speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:4060:144"/>
him; <hi>For since I spake against him, I

this tender mercie, and this gracious
disposition of his, in pardoning the wants
and weaknesses of his servants, in subduing
their corruptions, and in keeping covenant
with them. I must lap up many things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
because I have not time to expresse
them severally. First, He is sinne-pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Master: yea, he alone can doe it, no
man hath power on earth to forgive sinnes,
but God alone; <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. <hi>Blesse the Lord, O
my soule, forget not all his benefits, who forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
thine iniquities, and healeth thy diseases,</hi>
sayth <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 103. 2, 3. Here is a sin-pardoning
Master: yea, he taketh no notice
many times of our infirmities, but gracious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
passeth by the weaknesses of his servants.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>He hath not beheld iniquitie
in Iacob; he hath not seene perversenesse in Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi>
or, if he doe see, he freely forgiveth it,
and spareth his servants, as a man spareth
his own sonne that serveth him, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:4060:144"/>
And then he is a Covenant-keeping Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
<hi>All his promises are yea and Amen,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. <hi>Daniel</hi> giveth him this title,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>O God the great, and terrible, that
keepest Covenant with them that love thee:</hi>
he is alwayes as good as his word, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 24. namely to his service: he
will keepe Covenant with you. Nay, see
a place that hath all these together in it,
<hi>Mich.</hi> 7. 18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto
thee?</hi> The Lord is a most incomparable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
there is none like him in all the world.
Why so? Surely for those three things,
whereof I have now spoken: first, He is a
sinne-pardoning, secondly, a corruption-killing,
thirdly, a Covenant-keeping Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
See all these in this Text, <hi>That pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
iniquitie, and passeth by transgression,</hi> &amp;c.
there is a sinne-pardoning Master: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>He will subdue our iniquities, (and heale
our back-slidings,</hi> as <hi>Hosea</hi> 14 4.) there is
a corruption-killing Master: <hi>Thou wilt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
thy truth to Iacob, and mercie to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and therefore he is a Covenant-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Master. If this be rightly considered,
this will make us spend much time in Gods
service.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Lord is a soule-saving Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
yea, he alone is able to doe this,<note place="margin">A soule-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Master.</note> no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Master under heaven is able to doe this. An
earthly Master may be kinde to his servants,
and give them many good things; but he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:4060:145"/>
cannot save, or redeeme their soules, he
must let that alone for ever. Even they that
trust in their wealth, and boast themselves
in the multitude of their riches, these seeme
to be very powerfull Masters, yet marke
what the holy Ghost sayth of such, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.
6, 7, 8. <hi>None of them can by any meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
his brother, nor give to God a ransome
for him;</hi> for the Redemption of the soule is
precious, and ceaseth for ever. All the men
in the world, with all the wealth in the
world, are not able to save one soule: <hi>And
what is a man profited, if he could winne the
whole world, if he loose his soule?</hi> sayth our
Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. But now this our
heavenly Master is able to save a soule from
death, and cover a multitude of sinnes:
<hi>Thou hast delivered my soule from death,</hi> sayth
<hi>David, Psal.</hi> 116. 8. Yea, he is the author
of eternall salvation to them that doe obey
him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 9. Here is a Master worth ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
that is able to save the soules of his
servants with an everlasting salvation.
<hi>Psal.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Salvation belongeth unto the Lord,
(i. e.)</hi> it is his peculiar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly,<note place="margin">Accepteth the will for the deed.</note> He is readie to accept, and take
in good part, the poore endeavours of his
servants; yea, their desires (if sincere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
fervent) doe finde acceptance with him.
God doth indeed set his servants hard taskes
many times, such as they are never able to
performe of themselves: He commandeth
us to love him with all our hearts, and keep
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:4060:145"/>
all his Commandements; but his meaning
is (according to the mitigation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell)
onely that we should earnestly desire,
and doe our best endeavour to doe so, and
then it is sufficient in Gods account. A lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Father, that would try the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his childe, biddeth him, goe sirrah,
runne, and fetch me such a great piece of
wood (which, it may be, is as much as five
or six men could carry) but if he finde him
willing, and readie to doe his best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
it contenteth the Father: so dealeth
God with his servants; <hi>He spareth them, as
a man spareth his owne sonne that serveth him,
Mal.</hi> 3. 17. Yea, if there be but first of all a
willing minde, it is accepted, according to
that we have, and not according to that we
have not, sayth the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12.
Yea, sincere desires are graciously accepted.
See how <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> propoundeth his case,
<hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 11. <hi>O Lord, I beseech thee, let thine
eares be attentive to the prayer of thy servant,
and to the prayers of thy servants, that desire to
feare thy Name:</hi> especially, if these be secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and accompanied with earnest and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
endeavours. Thus <hi>Abrahams</hi> resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to offer his Sonne, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12.) was
accepted, as if he had actually done it: and
therefore <hi>by faith Abraham when he was try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
offered up Isaac,</hi> sayth the Holy Ghost,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. and yet we see in the Storie,
that actually, and really he did it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no,
the Lord himselfe withheld him, by a voyce
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:4060:146"/>
from heaven; and yet in this place yee see
it is said, that he did offer <hi>Isaac,</hi> when he
was tryed, that is, he was readie to have
done it, it was his purpose, if God himselfe
had not granted him a dispensation; and
therefore in Gods account it was done:
Yea, sayth the Lord himselfe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 13.
<hi>Because thou hast done this,</hi> though indeede
he did it not, yet because he was willing to
have done it, it was done in Gods account,
and in his gracious acceptance. Oh who
would not be constant and abundant in the
service of such a Master?</p>

all things that he commandeth, so as he is

but also he is exceeding bountifull and libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
See one expression of his bounty in this,
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 84. 11. <hi>He will give grace and glory,
and no good thing will he withhold from them
that walke uprightly.</hi> As he himselfe loveth

<hi>Blessed be God, even the God of our salvation,

pleasure in the prosperitie of his servants,

earthly Masters are changeable, and fickle,
and doe often envie the prosperitie of their

prosperitie of his seruants, and his love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

For the first, observe it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35. 27. <hi>Let

Isa.</hi> 65. 14. And withall, he is constant in
his love towards them: if he be angry, it is
but for a moment, but his love and mercie

having loved his owne which were in the
world, <hi>he loved them unto the end,</hi> sayth our

thee; therefore with loving kindnesse have

time in Gods service, we must
labour to have our hearts right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

many a foole to get wisdome, but he wanteth

17. 16. How many blessed opportunities
have we, of spending time in Gods service,
which are let slip, because wee want hearts
rightly prepared for that purpose? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
it is, that in the first place, God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
our hearts, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 23. 26. <hi>My son,
give me thy heart,</hi> and <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>O Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
wash thy heart from wickednesse,</hi> A
prophane heart can never endure to spend
much time in God service, but straight
cryeth out, <hi>behold, what a wearinesse is it,
Mal.</hi> 1. 13. Hence it is, that the Lord cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
out most of all for want of a right and
fit disposition of heart in the duties of his
service, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 29. 13. <hi>This people draweth
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:4060:149"/>
nigh unto me with their mouthes, and honour
me with their lips, but their hearts are farre
from me.</hi> Here was the defects of <hi>Ezechiels</hi>
hearers, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 31. <hi>ver. They come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee as my people commeth, and they also sit

words, but they will not doe them,</hi> where was
the chiefe fault? Surely in the heart, for
with their mouthes they shew much love,
but their heart goeth after their covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
A covetous and a vicious heart will
soone make a man weary of time spent in
Gods service: and therefore when any man
setteth himselfe to doe God any service, the
Lord looketh directly with what heart he
doth it. It is an excellent speech of God to
<hi>Samuel,</hi> (when hee was to choose <hi>Israel</hi> a
King) 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 7. the Lord said to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
Looke not on his countenance, nor on the
height of his stature,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For the Lord seeth
not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on
the heart:</hi> For the Lord knoweth full well
that if the heart be not right set for God,
he will never walke uprightly before God,
how great a semblance or shew of piet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a man may make, therefore God in his
wisedome looketh on the heart, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.
46. <hi>Set your hearts unto all these words,</hi>
saith <hi>Moses.</hi> It is not setting of the eare
to heare only, or the mouth to speake, no,
nor the hands to worke, nor feete to walke,
that will serve the turne, unlesse the heart,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:4060:150"/>
in the meane time be right set for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
therefore saith <hi>David, Psalme</hi> 119.
11. <hi>I have hid thy Word in my heart, that
I might not sinne against thee.</hi> Lo, the
chiefe antidote against sinne is to hide,
and ponder the Word of God within our
hearts.</p>
                  <p>An excellent direction, to this purpose,
is that of the Apostle Saint <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 8.
<hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to
you</hi> (if wee desire that God should draw
nigh to us in mercy, we must strive, to draw
nigh to him in service, and obedience.) But
what is required, that wee may bee fit to
draw nigh to God? <hi>Wash your hands, or
cleanse your hands, yee sinners, and purifie
your hearts, ye double minded.</hi> It is only
a cleane and a true heart, that will make a
man fit to draw nigh to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.
<hi>Let us draw nigh to God, with a true heart,
&amp;c.</hi> Hereupon <hi>David</hi> prayeth so earnestly
for such an heart, <hi>Psalme</hi> 119. 80. <hi>O let
my heart be upright in thy Statutes, that I
be not ashamed.</hi> For indeed, God loveth
truth of heart, or truth in the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
above all other things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
this is the maine thing that he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;
<hi>Psalme</hi> 51. 6. He that ever meaneth
to be religious indeed, must of necessity
begin with the heart, that is the chiefe great
wheele of the clocke that moveth all the
rest, <hi>Psalme</hi> 37. 30, 31. <hi>The mouth of the
righteous will speake wisedome, his tongue
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:4060:150"/>
will be talking of judgement.</hi> How com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
this to passe? that yee shall see in the
words following, <hi>The Law of God is in his
heart, and none of his steps shall slide.</hi> It is
the heart that setteth both the tongue, and
hands a worke: for <hi>out of the abundance
of the heart, the mouth speaketh,</hi> saith our
blessed Saviour, in <hi>Matthew</hi> 12. 34. Oh
therefore all that would spend much time in
Gods service (which, as we have heard, is
absolutely, and incomparably the best spent
time) labour to have your hearts rightly fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and prepared for that purpose, even
such an heart as I have formerly described
unto you, namely, a beleeving heart, a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
heart, a sincere and an upright heart,
full of truth and sincerity, and an heart al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
fraught with the true feare of God: hee
that hath such an heart, is right set for Gods
service. It is just such an heart as God would
have us to have, <hi>sc.</hi> an heart fraught and
furnished with the true feare of GOD,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 5. 29. <hi>They have well said, all that
they have spoken,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 28.
<hi>Oh that there were such an heart in them.</hi>
Good words, without a good heart, are lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
worth. Well, what kinde of heart
would God have them to have? That yee
shall see in the words following, <hi>O that
there were such an heart in them, that they
would feare me, and keepe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
alwayes, that it might be well with
them.</hi> An heart fraught with the true feare of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:4060:151"/>
God, is that which GOD especially de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth
should be in his children, and which
he doth exceedingly delight in, when hee
findeth in it them.</p>
                  <p>2. We must be constant and conscionable<note place="margin">2. <hi>Direction</hi> Sc. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in the private duties and exercises of Religion.</note>
in the private exercises of Religion: this
is the way to bring the heart to a right
frame for the publike Ordinances? this is
like the tuneing of the instrument: so that
he that careth not for spending any time at
all in private duties, careth not how little
time he spendeth that way, in publike. Oh
that wee would lay this to heart, and bee
carefull to spend time in private prayer,
and reading, and holy meditations. Even
Princes are not exempted in this case: See
that Direction, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 18, 19. See
the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Israels</hi> duty, when he sitteth
on the Throne of his kingdome, <hi>Hee shall
write him a Copie of Gods Law in a booke,
out of that which is before the Priests and
Levites, and it shall be with him, and hee
shall reade therein, all the dayes of his life,
that he may learne to feare the Lord his God,
&amp;c.</hi> where we see,</p>
                  <p>1. That it is the duty, even of Kings
themselves, to feare GOD, as well as
others.</p>
                  <p>2. That to the end he may feare God,
hee must be acquainted with Gods Word;
for the feare of God must be learned out of
the booke of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Hee was to get him a copie of Gods
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:4060:151"/>
Booke, that which wee now call a Bible;
Kings must get them Bibles, as well as
Priests and Levites;</p>
                  <p>4. Hee must reade in it all the dayes of
his life; and if Kings, then much more all
subjects, and private persons, must spend
some part of every day in the duties of
Gods service in private. Who need thinke
himselfe too good for private duties, when
Kings themselves are not exempted? Yea,
it is the duty of all Gods people to search
the Scriptures, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Search the
Scriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have
eternall life, and they are they that testifie of
me,</hi> saith our Saviour, Yea, wee should all
study to be well acquainted with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
by private reading, that we may be
the more delighted with the publike heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>Colossians</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Let the Word of</hi>
CHRIST <hi>dwell in you richly in all
wisedome, teaching, and admonishing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
in Psalmes, and Hymnes, and spiritiuall
songs, &amp;c.</hi> Lo, how Gods people should
spend their time in private. O how this
would fit us for exercises of Religion in
publike! What made those Noble <hi>Boere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Acts</hi> 17. 11. willing to spend so
much time in hearing <hi>Paul</hi> preach in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like?
Surely this was one cause (amongst
the rest) <hi>sc.</hi> the care which they had to
spend their time well, even in private;
<hi>They searched the Scriptures daily whether
those things were so,</hi> and so finding how
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:4060:152"/>
sweetely <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine accorded with
that which they found written in Gods

this is the way to shut out the three capitall

dispose us to evill, so soone as we awake in

wretched company all the day, isto let

by holy meditations. See an experiment of
this in <hi>David.</hi> What made him to make
so great account of Gods publike Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
Surely, his care to begin the day well,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:4060:152"/>
was a very great helpe unto him. Even
hee that saith in our Text, <hi>A day in thy
Courts, is better than a thousand:</hi> could
say other where, <hi>Early in the morning will I
direct my prayers unto thee, and will looke
up, Psalme</hi> 5. 3. Hee was an excellent
husband in a morning. And therefore, as the
drunkard riseth early to follow strong
drinke, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5. So Gods people must rise
early in the morning, to doe God service:
yea, this was an ordinary thing with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psalme</hi> 119. 147. <hi>I prevented the
dawneing of the morning, and cryed:</hi> hee
was at his holy exercises before the dawne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<hi>My soule waiteth for the Lord, more than
they that watch for the morning; I say,
more than they that watch for the morning.</hi>
He was like a man full of paine, that could
not rest, nor sleepe all the night, but watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the morning light; or a man, that
hath some speciall businesse to doe, that
breaketh his sleepe, with the thoughts of
it, and lyeth, and watcheth for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that he may speedily start up and set
about it: so a gracious heart, doth even
consecrate his first awakings unto God;
and lyeth and watcheth for an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to doe God service. Oh that we would
hearken to this direction, <hi>sc.</hi> to begin the
day well, even with holy meditations. Oh
what a shame is it, that we should not bee
as diligent to save our soules, as the wicked
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:4060:153"/>
are to loose theirs; and bee at least as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous

made himselfe the fitter for the discharge

upon the discharge of his Propheticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and to this end (by his Spirit) stirreth
up an earnest desire in the peoples hearts to
heare him; and therefore saith the Text,
<hi>Simon, and they that were were with him,
said unto him, All men seeke for thee, verse</hi>
36. 37. and then see his resolution to that
purpose, <hi>verse</hi> 38. 39. <hi>Let us goe into the

in their Synagogues throughout all Galilee.</hi>
But what meanes did he use, to fit himselfe
for this purpose: that yee may see, <hi>ver.</hi> 35.
<hi>And in the morning rising up a great while
before day, he went out, and departed into a
solitary place, and there prayed:</hi> wherein
he is an excellent patterne for our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and by his blessed example doth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
teach us, that for a man to arise early in

Hereupon it is also, that He giveth
direction for private prayer, even prayer in
the Closet, as well as publike, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6.
<hi>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy
Closet, and shut the doore, and pray unto
thy Father in secret; and thy Father, that
seeth in secret, will reward thee openly,</hi> Which
he doth (not only because such prayers, for
the most part are done in sincerity, but also)
because he well knew, that the more men

care for spending much time, in things
which they love not, they are soone weary

other side, men care not how much time
they spend, in those things which they
love, and wherein they delight. Some

deale of time did <hi>Iacob</hi> spend in <hi>Laban's</hi>
service, for the love of <hi>Rachel?</hi> twise se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
yeares he served him, night and day
with all his power, and <hi>they seemed but a
few dayes, in regard of the love, which hee
had to her,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>Genesis</hi> 29. 20.
Twise seven yeares, seeme but a few dayes,
if they be considered and looked upon with
the eyes of love. Now is it not a great
shame for us that are Christians, if it
shall appeare, that a man shall love a faire
Virgin, better than we love God? Now if
we loved Gods Ordinances as wee should,
all the time that wee spend in his service,
would seeme but a few dayes, even nothing
in comparison, if we could once come to
serve God, out of love to himselfe and his
Ordinances. Now surely, this must needs
follow upon the three former directions:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:4060:155"/>
for, if we, 1, get an heart right set for <hi>God</hi>
and bee constant in the private duties of
religion, and especially, be carefull to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
our hearts with religious cogitations
early each morning, then we cannot choose,
but love the duties of Gods publike wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and service: and where this true love
to Gods Ordinances is, there will be a care
to spend much time in Gods worship and
service, both publike and private. See the
description of <hi>David's</hi> blessed man, <hi>Psalm.</hi>
1. 1, 2. where he is described, first, Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,
by what he doth not; and secondly,
Affirmatively, by that which he doth, <hi>v.</hi> 2.
<hi>But his delight is in the Law of the Lord,
and in that Law doth hee meditate day and
right.</hi> See the connection of these two:
If ye aske, Why he spendeth so much time
in Gods service, even day and night? It is
answered, because his delight is in the Law
of the Lord, <hi>ergo,</hi> he spendeth much time in
it. Yea, see this in <hi>David</hi> himselfe. Why did
he spend so much time in the duties of Gods
worship and service; but in regard of his
singular love and affection towards them?
as that one speech of his doth plainly and
fully intimate, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>Oh how I love
thy Law, it is my meditation continually.</hi> A
man will never continually thinke and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on that which he loveth not. <hi>David</hi>
could never have sayd truely out of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<hi>A day in thy Courts, is better then
a thousand,</hi> if he could not have truely sayd
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:4060:155"/>
first, <hi>My soule longeth, yea, even fainteth for
the Courts of the Lord, Psal.</hi> 84. 2. No, it
was his extraordinarie love to Gods house
and Ordinances, that made him value time
spent there, at so high a rate. The Booke of
<hi>Psalmes</hi> giveth plentifull and abundant te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
to this purpose; <hi>Lord, I have loved
the habitation of thy house, the place where
thine honour dwelleth, Psal.</hi> 26. 8. And againe
often in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>Oh how I love thy Law!</hi>
How much, <hi>David?</hi> Surely, <hi>more then thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of gold and silver: Ver.</hi> 72. Yea, <hi>more
then great spoyles, ver.</hi> 102. yea, <hi>it was swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then honey, and the honey-combe, Psal.</hi> 119.
103. No marvell if such a man as he spent
much time in the duties of Gods service,
that loved Gods house and Ordinances so
exceedingly. Yea, such was his love to the
duties of Religion, that by his good will,
he would spend all his dayes in that holy
imployment: yea, and he maketh it his
grand request, the very onely Boone, that
he would beg at Gods hands, that he might
doe so. An excellent place to this purpose,
is that which wee have, <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4. <hi>One
thing have I desired of the Lord, that I will
seeke after.</hi> But one thing <hi>David?</hi> Surely,
that is some great matter indeed: it may be
some great Kingdome, bigger then that of
<hi>Ierusalem:</hi> No; <hi>Davids</hi> ayme was at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde of matter: see how he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it, <hi>That I may dwell in the house of the
Lord, all the dayes of my life.</hi> This is <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <pb n="296" facs="tcp:4060:156"/>
one thing, that he would beg at Gods hand;
yea, the meanest office, or imployment in
Gods house, would give him more content,
then the highest place in the tents of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly,
as is sweetly expressed in this very
Verse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 10. in the words immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
following the words of our Text; <hi>I
had rather be a doore-keeper in the house of God,
then to dwell in the Tents of wickednesse.</hi> Yea,
this is not <hi>Davids</hi> case onely, but all that
are regenerate indeed, and truely godly and
religious, they are all of the same minde, as
well as <hi>David.</hi> The little childe loveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so well as the mothers brest, that is
the onely still-babe, that giveth content for
the most part, when all other devices faile,
if this doe not quiet the childe, scarce any
thing will doe it: so it is with all the new
borne babes of <hi>Christ;</hi> if they once be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
and borne againe; they love nothing
so well, as to sucke the milke of Religion,
out of the breasts of Gods Ordinances. It
is the comparison that the holy Ghost him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
useth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As new borne Babes,
desire the sincere milke of the Word, that ye may
grow thereby.</hi> See the affection of Gods Saints
this way, <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi> and
<hi>Paul.</hi> First, for <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Chap. 15. 16.
<hi>Thy Words were found, and I did eate them.</hi>
And how did they taste, <hi>Ieremiah? Thy Word
was unto me the joy and rejoycing of my heart.</hi>
Loe what sweetnesse the Babes of <hi>Christ</hi>
finde in Gods Ordinances. The like wee
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:4060:156"/>
finde of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Sonne of man, cause thy
belly to eate, and fill thy bowells with this rowle.</hi>
Here was Gods charge to the Prophet:
now see what sweetnesse he found in it,
<hi>Then did I eate the rowle, and it was in my
mouth as honey for sweetnesse.</hi> Then for holy
<hi>Job,</hi> the sweetnesse that he found in Gods
Ordinances, was that which affoorded him
a great deale of comfort in his greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
<hi>Job</hi> 23. 12. <hi>His way,</hi> that is, the
Lords way, <hi>have I kept, and not declined, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have I gone back from the Commandement
of his lippes; I have esteemed the words of his
lippes, more then my necessarie food:</hi> that made
him so religious, and spend so much time in
Gods service, because he was so farre in love
with Gods Ordinances. Then consider the
example of <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. 22. What made
him spend so much time in Gods service, in
prayer, and preaching to all the world, but
because he loved the Word exceedingly?
<hi>I delight in the Law of God, according to the
inner man:</hi> so farre as he was regenerate, he
tooke great delight in Gods Ordinances.
But above all, consider the example of our
blessed Saviour; none comparable to him,
for his unwearied painfulnesse in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
<hi>He went about, doing good continually,
Act.</hi> 10. 38. Yea, observe it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 35.
<hi>Iesus went about all the Cities, and Villages,
teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching
the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing every
sicknesse, and every disease amongst the people.</hi>
                     <pb n="298" facs="tcp:4060:157"/>
And why so? Surely, because his love to
Gods Ordinances, and his Fathers will,
was extraordinarie. This is the reason, that
he himselfe giveth in this very case. It is an
excellent Storie that we finde, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and substance whereof is this; That our
Saviour comming to <hi>Sychar,</hi> to <hi>Iacobs</hi> Well,
and being hungry and thirstie, <hi>He sendeth
his Disciples into the Citie to buy meate,</hi> sayth
the Text, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. In the meane time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
a woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to draw water,
and our Saviour taketh that opportunitie,
in their absence, to convert the heart of this
poore <hi>Samaritan,</hi> wherein the Disciples
finde him so busie at their returne, that he
had forgotten both his hunger and thirst,
in so much, that they were enforced to urge
him, saying, <hi>Master, eate, ver.</hi> 31. Now
marke the sweet answer of our blessed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;
<hi>I have meate to eate, that yee know not
of, ver.</hi> 32. And see how he doth farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
his full meaning, <hi>Ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Iesus sayd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, my meate is to doe the will of him that
sent me, and to finish his worke.</hi> Oh admirable
patterne! Oh heavenly example! such
was his delight in doing Gods will, that
hee preferreth it before his meate and
drinke, in the time of his greatest hunger
and thirst.</p>
                  <p>Now for the perfecting of this point, to
quicken our affections, and to set the better
edge upon our appetites, let us consider
these three particulars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:4060:157"/>
First,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> That we may love Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the better,<note place="margin">To perswade us to the love of Gods house and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</note> and delight to spend more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
time in the exercises of Religion, let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
whose Ordinances they are; They are
the Lords Ordinances, of divine authoritie;
they come from above; they are tokens of
love sent from our heavenly Father; the
Word preached, is Gods Word; the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are his broad Seales of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
and prayer is a dutie expresly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God himselfe: and therefore they are
worthy of all due regard and esteeme, for
his sake that hath sent them. Now a token
sent from a deare friend, O how welcome!
a Letter, a Booke, a Ring, &amp;c. these finde
speciall regard with us: And shall the
Lords Word, that gracious Epistle, sent
from the King of heaven to us, shall that be
accounted as a strange thing? God forbid.
Oh let us love the Word faithfully preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
because it is the Lords Word: It is the
Gospel of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> This is the Apostles
Argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>I am not ashamed of
the Gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God
unto salvation.</hi> Yea, it is the very Word of
Gods grace, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. <hi>And now, brethren,
I commend you to God, and to the Word of his
grace, which is able to build you up farther,
and to give you an inheritance amongst them
that are sanctified.</hi> Yea, the Word preached,
is a speciall fruit of his favour, peculiar to
those that are Gods people: so that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he sendeth it, he hath a purpose to
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:4060:158"/>
save some there. See how this is mentioned,
as a speciall priviledge to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> which
were then the onely people of God under
heaven, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. <hi>He sheweth his
Word unto Iacob, his Statutes and Ordinances
unto Israel: He hath not dealt so with any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Oh how we should value the Lords
goodnesse herein to us, if this were rightly
and throughly considered? This was the
<hi>Iewes</hi> chiefe priviledge, that they had the
Lords Word in speciall for their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
when all Nations besides were left in
darknesse, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>For what Nation is
there so great, that hath Statutes and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
so righteous, as all this Law which I
have set before you this day?</hi> So marke how
the Apostle setteth out the <hi>Iewes</hi> priviledge,
above all other Nations, which (he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth)
consisted in this, that they had the
Lords lively Oracles for their Direction;
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>What advantage then hath the
Jew, and what profit is there of Circumcision?
Much every way; chiefely, because unto them
were committed the Oracles of God:</hi> They
were the Lords Oracles, and therefore the
more to be esteemed; and their priviledge
was so much the greater, that did enjoy
them. So againe, setting out the <hi>Iewish</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,
see how the Apostle reports the
matter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. <hi>To whom pertaineth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,
and the glory, and the Covenants, and
the giving of the Law, and the service of God,
and the promises?</hi> The Lords Covenants,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:4060:158"/>
the Lords Law, the service of God, and his
promises; this should make us esteeme them.
Yea, it is the Lord that sendeth Prophets,
and Apostles, and Pastors to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
his people in this Word that he hath
given us; <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>I will give you Pastors,
according to mine owne heart, that shall feede
you with knowledge and understanding.</hi> It was
the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> himselfe, that sent the
Apostles to preach the Gospel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20.
<hi>Goe, and teach all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>teaching them
to observe all things that I command you; and
loe, I am with you alwayes, unto the end of the
world.</hi> Yea, and this sending of Ministers to
preach the Word unto us, is a fruit of Gods
singular love towards us, it argueth the
Lords fatherly pitie and compassion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us; according to that we reade in
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15. <hi>And the Lord God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
sent unto them by his Messengers, rising
early, and sending, because he had compassion on
his people, and on his dwelling place.</hi> Now lay
up all these together. If the Word preached
be an Ordinance of Gods appointing; if he
send the Ministers to preach it; if their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
to doe this, be a fruit of his love, yea,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> compassion towards us; then surely,
if this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> rightly considered, wee cannot

                     </gap>ut love it; <hi>it is the Lords doings,
and therefore it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>
The like may be said of prayer, and the
Sacraments, they are also of Gods ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:4060:159"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Motive.</hi> The worth and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</note> Consider the worth &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of these Ordinances in themselves. The
Word of God faithfully preached, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Ordinance of God, and so is prayer,
and so are the Sacraments, matters of speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and exceeding worth: now yee know,
men love and delight in things that are
most excellent. This is one reason that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
giveth, why he delights in the societie
of Gods Saints, <hi>sc.</hi> because they were excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
persons, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>My goodnesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth
not unto thee,</hi> (sayth he to God) <hi>v.</hi> 3.
<hi>but to the Saints that are in the earth, and to
the excellent, in whom is all my delight.</hi> Doest
thou delight in those things that are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent?
O then delight thy selfe in Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
which are most excellent. The
Word of God faithfully preached is a most
sweet and excellent Ordinance of GOD.
See how highly <hi>David,</hi> that man of GOD,
commends and extolleth it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The
Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soule;
the Testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise
the simple;</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>More to be desired are
they then gold, yea, then much fine gold, swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
also then honey and the honey-combe.</hi> Oh the
transcendent excellency of the Word of
God faithfully preached! Had I the tongue
of men and Angells, I could not expresse it
to the full. Take notice of a Testimony or
two to this purpose, in the new Testament,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. <hi>For the weapons of our warfare
are not carnall, but mightie, through God, to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:4060:159"/>
the pulling downe of strong holds:</hi> yea, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make Sathan fall downe from heaven
like lightening. This is the Lords great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
to batter the strong holds of sinne
and Sathan; they are excellent things, for
the demolition of Sathans Ammunition:
this casteth out the strong man armed, and
taketh away his armour, wherein he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted;
here is the excellency of the Word
preached. So observe another testimony to
this purpose, which sheweth the excellency
of this Ordinance; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>For the Word
of God is quicke, and powerfull, and sharper then
any two edged sword, piercing, even to the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
asunder of the soule and spirit.</hi> This sword
of the Spirit is a most excellent Ordinance
of God, it is a speciall Shield, to defend us
against the fury of all our spirituall enemies.
See the Apostles testimony for this, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6.
16. <hi>Take the Helmet of Salvation, and the
Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.</hi>
See how our blessed Saviour (with this)
put Sathan to flight, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>Scriptum est;</hi>
this was his weapon: and see the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>Then the Devill left him.</hi> This
sword will pierce the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ead of that
great <hi>Leviathan.</hi> Oh how we should love
it, if this was rightly considered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and lastly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Motive.</hi> The singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar use and benefit of them.</note> Consider the singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
use and benefit of Gods Ordinances, in
regard of us. Give me leave to instance in
one of Gods Ordinances, <hi>sc.</hi> the Word
preached. Certainly, the utilitie of it is
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:4060:160"/>
extraordinarie, if it be well considered: ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it, I beseech you, and see in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Benefit.</hi> Of the Word preached, it is the Word of God.</note> The Word preached, is the Word
of life, the meanes to quicken a dead soule;
It is the meanes both to beget, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
spirituall life in the soule of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 50. <hi>This is my comfort in mine
affliction, for thy Word hath quickened me.</hi> We
are by nature all <hi>dead in trespasses and sinnes,
Eph.</hi> 2. 1. Now the Word faithfully preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is the meanes to revive and raise us up
unto newnesse of life, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Verely, I
say unto you,</hi> sayth our Saviour, <hi>the houre is
comming, and now is, when the dead shall heare
the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that
heare it, shall live.</hi> See here the meanes to
revive and quicken our dead soules. Oh
therefore let us love the Word, even as we
love our life; <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 35. <hi>He that findeth
me, findeth life, and shall obtaine favour of the
Lord:</hi> Oh the worth of life! Life is sweet,
especially spirituall; yea, naturall life is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deare unto us; <hi>Skinne for skinne, and all
that a man hath, will he give for his life,</hi> sayth
the Text, <hi>Job</hi> 2. 4. Now the Word of God
faithfully preached, is our very life, <hi>Pro.</hi> 4.
13. <hi>Take fast hold of Instruction, let her not
goe, keepe her, for shee is thy life,</hi> sayth the
Wise-man. How can we choose but love
the Word, if we consider this?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Benefit.</hi> The Word of Health.</note> Because life it selfe, without
health, is but a burthen, rather then any
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:4060:160"/>
benefit. A sicke man is even weary of his
life: so was <hi>Iob</hi> in his extremitie; <hi>My soule
is weary of my life, Iob</hi> 10. 1. <hi>sc.</hi> for want of
health. Therefore in the second place, the
Word of God is health, as well as life, to
them that truely embrace it. <hi>My Sonne,
attend to my words,</hi> sayth <hi>Salomon, Pro.</hi> 4. 20.
Why so? See the worth of them, <hi>sc. Ver.</hi> 22.
<hi>For they are life unto those that finde them, and
health unto all their flesh.</hi> Life is a sweet
thing, if it be accompanied with health:
so, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>It shall be health to thy navell,
and marrow to thy bones.</hi> Health is a most
precious Iewell, and therefore the Word,
which is the meanes to beget and preserve
it, must needs be precious.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Benefit.</hi> The Word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</note> But what is life and health
without comfort? And therefore in the
third place, the Word preached is the chiefe
meanes of comfort that we doe enjoy. This
is our chiefe support and consolation, next
under God himselfe; <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 92. <hi>Vnlesse
thy Law had beene my delight, I should have
perished in my affliction.</hi> The Word preached
is the Word of comfort, proceeding from
the God of all comfort (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3.) <hi>which
is able to comfort us in all our tribulations, that
we may be able to comfort others with the same
comfort, wherewith we our selves are comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of God.</hi> Yea, the holy Word of God is
both written and preached to this end and
purpose. 1. It is written to this end, <hi>Rom.</hi>
15. 4. <hi>Whatsoever is written aforetime is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:4060:161"/>
for our learning, that we through patience
and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope.</hi>
Yea, secondly, This is one end of preaching,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 1. <hi>Comfort ye, comfort yee my people,
sayth your God: speake comfortably to Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
Hence also is that of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 3. when shewing the excellency of
preaching; he giveth this for one of the
chiefe reasons of his <hi>Encomium; But he that

and exhortation, and comfort.</hi> He that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
aright, preacheth to the comfort of Gods
people. Indeed, as for the wicked of the
world, here is no comfort for them, they
must goe to the world for comfort, for the
Word hath none for them; it is the terror
of the Lord, to <hi>torment them before the time;</hi>
but to the godly, and such as are religious,
it is to them a Word of strong consolation,
yea, <hi>the very joy, and rejoycing of their heart,</hi>
sayth <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 16. This was <hi>Davids</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 50. <hi>This is my comfort in my
affliction, for thy Word hath quickened mee.</hi>
And indeed, what greater comfort, then
for a condemned man to heare of a pardon?
Men in a desperate condition to heare of a
Saviour? <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures,
for they are they that testifie of me,</hi> sayth our
Saviour himselfe. What greater comfort?
The Scriptures tell us of the gracious readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God to be reconciled to poore sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. <hi>We are Embassadors for
Christ, as though God did beseech you by us,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:4060:161"/>
and we pray you, in Christs stead, to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to God.</hi> The Word assureth us, that upon
our repentance, our sinnes are forgiven us,
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 21. which is one of the chiefe
grounds of comfort that can be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Thus <hi>Christ</hi> comforted the poore Palsie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. <hi>Sonne, be of good cheare, thy
sinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> Men may seeme, but
can never be truely chearfull in the want of
this favour. Thus also would our Saviour
comfort the poore weeping penitent, <hi>Luk.</hi>
7. 48. <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> He knew
she could receive no better ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
So when God would have his people
comforted, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 1. see what direction he
giveth to that purpose; <hi>Comfort ye my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
Comfort ye Jerusalem;</hi> How? <hi>Tell her;
that her iniquities are pardoned,</hi> &amp;c. As if he
had said, If any thing will affoord her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
that will doe it. <hi>Blessed is the man
whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sinnes
are covered, Psal.</hi> 32. 1, 2. He that is assured
of happinesse, may well be comforted. Yea,
the Word preached, is the <hi>glad tydings of
Salvation;</hi> it doth assure us of our interest
in <hi>Christ,</hi> and that <hi>He is made of God unto us,
Wisedome, and Righteousnesse, Sanctification,
and Redemption,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. As also that
<hi>Christ,</hi> with all his merits, doe properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23. <hi>All is
yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>all
is yours, and ye are Christs, and Christ is Gods.</hi>
Now what greater comfort? So that ye see,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:4060:162"/>
that the Word faithfully preached, is the
Word of comfort; and therefore wee have
reason to love it in that regard.</p>

Yea, as God himselfe, is the God
of all grace; so is his Word, the Word of all
grace: for what grace of the Spirit is it,
that is not usually begotten in us by the
Word, whether knowledge, or faith, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:4060:162"/>
or the feare of God? &amp;c. 1. Out
of question, it is the chiefe meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and wisedome, and understanding in
the things of God. See it in <hi>Davids</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 98. <hi>Thou, through thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
hast made me wiser then mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
for they are ever with me. Ver.</hi> 99. <hi>I have
more understanding then all my teachers; for
thy Testimonies are my meditation. Ver.</hi> 100.
<hi>I understand more then the Ancient, because I
keepe thy precepts.</hi> Then for faith, the Word
is the meanes to beget and preserve that;
for it is the Word of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8. And
the Apostles conclusion is, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. So <hi>Then
faith commeth by hearing, and hearing of the
Word of God.</hi> And then for the feare of God,
another excellent grace of the Spirit, the
Word of God is the chiefe meanes to beget
that; <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 19. Where it is said of the
King, that he shall write him a copie of the
booke of the Law, and reade in it all the
dayes of his life; Why so? <hi>That he may learne
to feare the Lord his God, and to keepe all the
words of this Law:</hi> Yea, this is the end of
our publike meeting to heare the Word
faithfully preached, all both old and young
must come to heare it. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 12. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the people together, men, and women, and
children, and the stranger that is within thy
gates:</hi> All sorts must constantly frequent
the Church assemblies, and depend upon the
ministery of the Word: Why so? <hi>That they
may heare, and that they may learne, and feare
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:4060:163"/>
the Lord your God, and observe to doe all the
words of this Law.</hi> The true feare of GOD
must be learned out of the Booke of GOD;
and hearing the Word preached, is the
means to attaine thereunto. The like might
easily be shewed of sundry other graces.
But this is not all: the Word preached, is
not onely the meanes to beget the graces of
Gods Spirit in us, but to encrease them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Observe it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>As new borne

that yee may grow thereby,</hi> sayth the Apostle.
So that the ministery of the Word, is not
onely the seede of our new birth, but also
the chiefe means of our encrease and growth
in Grace: yea, it will still build us up far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
untill we come to perfection, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.
32. <hi>And now, brethren, I commend you to God,
and to the Word of his grace, which is able to

among all them that are sanctified.</hi> Oh
precious Word, and well worthy of all
high esteeme, that is able to build us up in
grace, farther and farther, untill wee come
to perfection! How can we choose but love
the Word exceedingly, and delight to spend
much time in it, if we seriously consider how
usefull it is unto us also in this respect.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Benefit.</hi> The word of eternall life and salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and lastly, The Word preached,
is not onely the chiefe meanes of spirituall
life, and comfort, but of our eternall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
and salvation. It is not onely the
Word of grace, but of glory too, and of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:4060:163"/>
salvation, <hi>Romans</hi> 1. 16. <hi>I am not ashamed
of the Gospell of Christ,</hi> saith the Apostle,
Why so? Because (how simple, or despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
so ever it may seeme in it selfe, yet) <hi>it
is the power of God, through faith, unto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
a foolish thing indeed it is, in the
eye of flesh and bloud, and of carnall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but yet it pleaseth God, <hi>even by the
foolishnesse of preaching to save them which
doe believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. Yea, it is the
Word of salvation, so that he is farre from
salvation, that rejects it, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 119. 155.
Yea, it is the Word of eternall life, and
therefore he that thrusteth it from him, doth
judge himselfe unworthy of eternall life.
See two direct Testimonies for this: the
one is the speech of <hi>Peter</hi> to our Saviour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 68. <hi>Will ye also goe away,</hi> saith our
Saviour to his Disciples? The Apostle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
maketh answer, <hi>Whither should we goe?</hi>
(where shall wee thinke to mend our
selves?) <hi>thou hast the words of eternall life,</hi>
And therefore, he that rejecteth it, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
not to spend time in the hearing, and
reading, and serious perusall of it, doth even
judge himselfe unworthy of everlasting
life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46. saith the Apostle, addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his speech to the <hi>Iewes, It was necessary
that the Word of God should be first preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto you,</hi> (the preaching of Gods Word
is of necessary use in the Church of God)
<hi>but since that ye thrust it from you, and
judge your selves unworthy of everlasting

life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>behold wee turne to the Gentiles.</hi>
Oh how readily, and with what great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
would we receive the Word, if this
was rightly considered.</p>

time in Gods service, must follow
that golden rule of the Apostle, <hi>sc.</hi>

Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 16. Which rule he repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
againe to the <hi>Colossians, Colos.</hi> 4. 5.
Now if you aske me, From what wee must
redeeme the time? I answer, from all such
lets and impediments that will hinder this
way. There are diverse great consumers of
precious time, from which he must careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
redeeme it, that would spend much time
in Gods service. I shall need to say the lesse
in this case, in regard of that which I have
already said, as also in respect of a Treatise
written to this purpose,<note place="margin">Whately. Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Time.</note> called <hi>The Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:4060:164"/>
1. Therefore all men,<note place="margin">All mispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of time must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</note> must very careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and watchfully subdue and suppresse all
those great mispenders of time, which like
so many gracelesse spend-thrifts, doe wast
and consume many precious houres, and
much golden time, that was farre better
spent in Gods worship and service: which
are especially sixe.</p>
                  <p>1. Sinning.</p>
                  <p>2. Sleeping.</p>
                  <p>3. Carking and caring.</p>
                  <p>4. Sporting, or recreations, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
feasting.</p>
                  <p>5. Foolish thinking.</p>
                  <p>6. And lastly, idle speaking, which is
usually a fruit of the former, because, <hi>Out of
the abundance of the heart, the mouth speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi>
whereof some of these must bee mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
and put to death, and others againe
restrained and regulated, or bound, as it
were, to the good behaviour.</p>
                  <p>1. The first,<note place="margin">Let. 1. 1. <hi>Sinnc.</hi>
                     </note> and the worst, and chiefe
mispender of precious time, is Sinning;
when we spend time in doing that which is
directly naught, as lying, swearing, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
wantonnesse, and such like works
of the flesh, and of the Devill: this is the
worst spent time of all, as being directly
contrary to that which is spent in Gods
service; as I have already shewed in the
first use of the point.</p>
                  <p>Now this thiefe is utterly to be mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and put to death; imprisoning, or bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:4060:165"/>
to the good behaviour, will not serve
the turne; for indeed this is a desperate
ruffian, or swaggerer, that is not capable of
any good behaviour, and therefore must
needs be put to death, and wholly suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
We must endeavour, as much as in us
lyeth, that wee spend no time in sinning,
but carefully mortifie the deeds of the body
by the Spirit; this is the Apostles rule,
<hi>Colossians</hi> 3. 1, 2, 5. <hi>If ye then be risen with
Christ, seeke those things which are above,</hi>
be heavenly minded, <hi>set your affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

                     </gap>. 30. But what course must
wee take to this end? That the Apostle
sheweth, <hi>verse</hi> 5. <hi>Mortifie therefore your
members, which are upon the earth.</hi> Where
wee see this truth most clearely manifested,
that all that would spend much time in
Gods service, and holy performances, must
carefully mortifie their members here on
earth, and put sinfull lusts to death: For
this horrible thiefe, and great mispender
of precious time, is like some mischievous
person, or desperate ruffian, that flyeth in
a mans face, and will either kill, or bee
killed; and therefore must needs be killed,
that hee doth not kill us, for <hi>the wages of
sinne is death, Romans</hi> 6. 23. So that wee
must either kill our corruptions, or they
will bring our sonles to death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13.
<hi>For if yee live after the flesh, ye shall dye:
but if ye through the Spirit doe mortifie the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:4060:165"/>
deeds of the body, ye shall live.</hi> Where you
see, that our precious soules cannot live;
but by the death of our corruptions: the
life of the one, is the death of the other:
as <hi>Ahab</hi> lost his owne life, for preserving
<hi>Benhadads, Thy life shall goe for the life of
him,</hi> in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 42.) so our soules must
eternally perish, if we suffer our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to survive.</p>
                  <p>But how should we so mortifie our lusts,<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
that we may spend little or no time time in
vicious courses, and so consequently more
time in Gods service?</p>

is the issue. So againe, when the same holy
Apostle was cumbred, and pestered with the
pricke in the flesh, the messenger of Sathan,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. see what course he took: here
was his refuge, even the bosome of the Lord
was his only shelter and defence, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>For
this I besought the Lord thrise, that it might
depart from me.</hi> Now see the issue; What a
gracious answer? <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>And he said unto me,
my grace is sufficient for thee, &amp;c.</hi> Hearty
confessions, and strong petitions and cryes
to God, are very availeable in this case; the
prayer of the righteous is very effectuall in
such a condition, if it be fervent, <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.
16. as the Apostle there speaketh in another
case. When a man is in that case, and in so
great a strait, that he knoweth not what to
doe, it is his best course in that case to looke
up to God, by earnest, and fervent prayer,
according to the practise of that gracious
King <hi>Iehosophat,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 12. <hi>Wilt
thou not judge them? Oh Lord? Wilt
thou not judge them? for wee have no might
against this great multitude, neither know
we what to doe, but our eyes are upon thee.</hi>
Hee looked at God in this case with many
eyes; with an eye of faith and confidence,
with an eye of patient expectation, with
an eye of diligent observation, and with
an eye of prayer; according to that of
<hi>David, Psalme</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Early in the morning,
will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:4060:168"/>
looke up:</hi> where the former words are a
direct explication of the later, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) I
will looke up unto thee, ô Lord, with an
eye of prayer. If a man can even fall out
with himselfe, and loath himselfe in his
owne sight for his iniquities, and for his
abominations, as the Prophet speakes,
<hi>Ezech.</hi> 36. 31. and earnestly, and unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly
complaine to God against his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
certainely, in Gods good time hee
shall be able to prevaile against his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
for God is not only a sinne-pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but also a corruption-killing God,
one that will subdue our iniquities, <hi>Micah</hi>
7. 18. See what a promise we have for this,
<hi>Romans</hi> 6. 14. <hi>Sinne shall not have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
over you; for ye are not under the Law,
but under Grace,</hi> saith the Apostle. And
<hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 22. with <hi>Hosea</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Returne, ye
back-sliding children, and I will heale your
back-slidings,</hi> saith the Lord there, so that
here is great hopes (if we take this course)
that we shall prevaile against our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Doest thou thinke that thou art uncapable

This is a meere fallacy. Doe not cast away

It is some goodnes in thee to be bad enough

base enough, bad enough, and then thou
art good enough to partake of grace:
thine emptinesse will make some way to

must of necessitie be mortified, and put to
death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Let.</hi> Excessive sleeping, or sluggishnes.</note> Another great let or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that must be removed; another great
waster of time, that must be speedily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
is immoderate, or excessive sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and sluggishnesse, This also is a most
dangerous mispender of precious time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not so bad as the former. Thus the
Prophet <hi>Ionah</hi> mispent his time, as he was
in a Ship sayling to <hi>Tarshish,</hi> when hee
should have gone to <hi>Ninev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h;</hi> He was fast
asleepe in a very dangerous storme, when
he stood in more need to have been wrestle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God by humble, earnest, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
prayer, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 6. See how pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Heathen Mariners awake him, and
rouse him up, <hi>The Ship-master came to him,</hi>
saith the Text; <hi>and said unto him, What
meanest thou, ô sleeper? Arise, and call
upon thy God, if so bee that God will thinke
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:4060:171"/>
upon us, that we perish not, (i.e.)</hi> Is this a
fit time to sleepe, when we are all ready to
perish, and be ready even every moment
to bee swallowed up of the waves? Oh
therefore arise, and bestirre thy selfe, and
call upon thy God, and for shame learne to
spend the time better then in sleeping, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
in such, and so great and apparent
danger, their being (as it were) but even
a step betweene us and death. Thus <hi>Salomon</hi>
awaketh his fluggard, <hi>Proverbs,</hi> 6. 9, 10.
<hi>How long wilt thou sleepe, ô sluggard? When
wilt thou arise out of thy sleepe?</hi> Marke now
the sluggards drousie, slumbring, senselesse
answer, <hi>Yet a little sleepe, a little slumber, a
little folding of the hands to sleepe;</hi> Thus
still he keepeth his bed, and there he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth
to spend his time, and there the
Wiseman letteth him alone, and bestoweth
no more paines to call him up, but even
passeth sentence upon, as he lyeth in his
bed, <hi>So thy poverty commeth as an armed
man.</hi> This will bring both temporall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
and spirituall misery upon a man;
such a man shall surely come to poverty,
<hi>Proverbs</hi> 20. 13. for this stealeth away
not only much time, that was better spent
in Gods service; but it robbeth us of two
speciall seasons, and opportunities of doing
GOD service, and getting good to our
soules, <hi>sc.</hi> the morning season, and the
Sermon time, or the time for the exercises
of religion, which is the very harvest of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:4060:172"/>
our soules, Is not he likely to bee a poore
man, that will keepe his bed in harvest
time, and like to reape shame and penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
<hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 5. Well, What shall wee
doe with this unruly person? Put him to
death? O no, What? Not sleepe at all?
Rather binde him to the good behaviour,
send him to the house of correction: for
sleepe, in it selfe, is a refreshing mercy of
God, which he conferreth upon those whom
he loveth, <hi>Psalme</hi> 127. 4. <hi>For so he giveth
his beloved sleepe.</hi> What then? Deale thus
with this companion; cut shorter this
prodigall; allow him lesse liberty. Hee
that mispendeth his meanes, it is pity but
he should want; let some of his meanes be
taken from him, he doth but wast and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
it. And therefore the best way is to
observe these two rules, which I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
on purpose (in this case) for our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                  <p>1. Let us habituate,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Rule or Remedie.</hi> To habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate or accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome our selves to timely ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</note> or accustome our
selves to early or timely rising. Let us
even forcably breake off our sleepe, for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and godly meditations; and that
which at first will seeme even impossible,
will by a little use and custome prove, not
only be possible, but also most facile &amp; easie,
even as the Cocke clappeth his wings early
in the morning, thereby to shake off drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
and to stirre up himselfe to crow:
so let us shake off our sluggish humour by
degrees, and even stirre up our selves to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:4060:172"/>
holy duties in the morning. Thus <hi>David</hi>
stirreth himselfe, and endeavoureth to shake
off his drousie temper, <hi>Psalme</hi> 103. 1, 2.
<hi>Blesse the Lord, ô my soule, and all that is
within me blesse his holy Name. Blesse the
Lord, ô my soule, forget not all his benefits.</hi>
Yea, this he would doe early, or betimes
in the morning, <hi>Psalme</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Early in the
morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and
will looke up.</hi> Yea, this was not all, but
sometimes he would breake his sleepe, even
at midnight, to doe God service, <hi>Psalme</hi>
119. 62. <hi>At midnight will I arise to give
thankes unto thee, because of thy righteous
judgements;</hi> Thus by degrees in time we
should prevaile exceedingly against that
sluggish humour, that will else keepe us from
embracing many blessed opportunities of
doing God service.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Rule or Remedy.</hi> Take heede of immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate use of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Wee must beware of excessive
eating and drinking. The immoderate use
of the good creatures of God, doth very
much dispose to sleepe, but indispose us to
any holy and religious imployment. When
the belly is full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saith the homely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe,
a man, in that case, is fitter to serve
the Devill in sinning, or the flesh by sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
then God in any religious duty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.
<hi>Put a knife to thy threat, if thou be
a man given to appetite.</hi> Wisely doe thou
refraine from the immoderate use of that,
which will altogether indispose thee to
Gods service, and make thee a very prey
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:4060:173"/>
to lust, and unto the Devill. Hee that in
this case maketh his belly his god, is then
ready for sleepe almost at any time, but will
scarce bee fit to serve GOD at any time.
Consider the place of the Apostle, <hi>Romans</hi>
13. 13. <hi>Not in ryotting, or gluttony, and
drunkennesse,</hi> and what followeth? <hi>Nor in
chambering and wantonnesse:</hi> where we see,
that ryot and excesse in the use of Gods
good creatures, disposeth strongly to lust
and filthinesse. <hi>When I fed them to the full,
then they committed adultery against me, and
assembled themselves by troopes in the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
houses,</hi> saith God, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 5. 7. It was
<hi>Sodoms</hi> fulnesse, that made them so filthy.
But of this hereafter, when I come to
speake of feasting, and recreations, which is
another great mispender of precious time,
and a great impediment to keepe us from
spending time in Gods service. And so
much therefore as touching this second
great mispender of precious time, and that
is, excessive sleeping.</p>

nor many times, there is no time for

world kept men from the great Supper,
whereof our Saviour speaketh in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell;
<hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 16. <hi>A certaine man made a
great Supper, and bad many, and sent his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
at Supper time, to say to them that were
bidden, come, for all things are now readie.</hi>
How could they finde in their hearts to
slight or reject such a loving invitation?
See then what followeth, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>And they

to distract us in them: so that if we doe set
our selves to serve God, yet we cannot doe
it with all the heart, as we should. This co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
carking will steale away the heart,
that we cannot so seriously hearken to the
Word preached, we cannot set our hearts
to all the good Word of God, as we ought
to doe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 46. <hi>These words that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

<hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 6. This cannot be, in this case; for
covetous carking will keepe out the Word,
and distract us in hearing of it. See an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
of this in <hi>Ezechiels</hi> hearers, <hi>Ezec.</hi>
33. 31. By their outward garbe and fashion
they seemed to be very religious, they were
constant hearers, <hi>They come unto thee as the

not doe them, for with their mouth they shew

much love; but their heart goeth after their
covetousnesse.</hi> It was but an heartlesse piece
of service that they performed to God, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,
even in the very instant of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
had stollen away their hearts. They
were just like unto a Chapman,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> that while

beating it to a price, a nimble subtle cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purse,

for his commoditie, his money is gone.
Let us beware and take heed of this subtle
jugler, that will eyther keepe us from, or
distract us in the duties of Gods worship
and service.</p>

profiting by, or practising of that which
we seeme to heare with great attention: so
that we shall become but hearers onely, but
not doers of the Word; and so build the

seede among the thornes, is he that heareth
the Word, and the care of this world, and the
deceitfulnesse of riches, choke the Word, and he
becometh unfruitfull.</hi> Thus yee see the great
hurt we receive by this unjust usurper of
our precious time, which prevaileth so
much the more, because he seemeth to be the

where this prevaileth, there the one

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:4060:176"/>
where to get meate and drinke, nor how to

                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> Depriveth us of Gods love to us.</note> The too-much bent of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to outward things, doth utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
us of Gods love to us. As the love of
the Father is not in him; so the love of the
Father is not towards him, in that case. But
on the contrary, the Lord even hateth and
abhorreth him; which is a most wofull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
and condition: <hi>Psal.</hi> 10. 3. <hi>Speaking

Where we see evidently, that every cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
person is hated and abhorred of GOD.
And no marvell, for it is no lesse then Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
in Gods account, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5. Yea, and there
is a very direct and expresse enmitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

<hi>Know ye not, that the amitie of the world, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie

Gods enemies; <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 21. <hi>God will surely

                        </gap> Religion</note> This inordinate thought-tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for outward things, doth often keepe
many from entering upon the profession of
Religion, and embracing of Christianitie.
Many could be content to embrace <hi>Christ,</hi> if
it were not for the world. This hindereth
many from becomming the Disciples of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:4060:178"/>
                     <hi>Christ,</hi> because they cannot finde in their
hearts to forsake all for his sake. See an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
of this in that young man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 16. He had a moneths minde
to become one of our Saviours Disciples:
see how sweetly and lovingly he speaketh
to our Saviour, <hi>Good Master, what good thing
shall I doe, that I may have eternall life? If
thou wilt enter into life, keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
as if he had sayd, come on thy wayes,
I will set thee a taske: but when he had told
him the upshot of all, <hi>Ver.</hi> 22. <hi>If thou wilt be
perfect, Goe, and sell all that thou hast, and give
to the poore, and thou shalt have treasure in
heaven, and come follow me: Ver.</hi> 22. <hi>When he
heard this saying, he went away sorrowfull, for
he was endued with great possessions.</hi> Yea, and
(it seemeth) he did not so much possesse, as
he was possessed of them: he loved the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of the earth too well, to forsake them
for the treasures of heaven. Now mark what
our Saviour inferreth hereupon to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
<hi>Ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Verely, I say unto you, that a
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdome
of God.</hi> Inordinate love of riches doth keepe
men from the profession, much more from
the practise of Religion. This is another
mischiefe.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> Maketh men fickle, and inconstant in Religion.</note> Wee would never spend time
in inordinate thought-taking how to get
wealth, if we did consider another speciall
inconvenience that ever commeth with it,
and that is, that it maketh men fickle and
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:4060:178"/>
inconstant in their Religion. This will
make a man plainly disert, and utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<hi>Christ,</hi> and his cause, and leave him in
the open fields. A covetous person will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stand to his colours: our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
foretelleth, that some should forsake
him, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 32. <hi>Behold, the houre commeth,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>when yee shall be scattered every man to
his owne, and shall leave me alone: and yet I
am not alone; for the Father is with me.</hi> Yea,
this you shall finde most certaine, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will make a man sooner doe this, then
the inordinate love of this present world.
This made <hi>Demas</hi> forsake his colours, and
turne Apostata. The Apostle once kindely
salutes the Church in his Name; but after
cryeth out against him for Apostacie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
4. 10. <hi>Demas also hath forsaken us, having lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
this present world.</hi> So that if we would
be constant in the service of <hi>Christ,</hi> we must
take heede of the world.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and lastly,<note place="margin">6. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> Bringeth the wrath of God upon a mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie.</note> This will bring the
wrath of God upon a mans posteritie. Many
a man goeth to the devill himselfe, to make
his sonne a rich man; and yet in spite of
his heart, God maketh him a beggar, <hi>He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getteth
a sonne, and there is nothing in his hand,
Eccles.</hi> 5. 14. So that he <hi>coveteth an evill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse

thinketh his children shall fare better, and

and <hi>Ahab;</hi> whose covetous ill gotten
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:4060:179"/>
wealth was the ruine of them, and of their
posteritie, <hi>Josu.</hi> 7. 24. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29. This
will helpe us against this sinne, if this be
rightly considered.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Let. sc.</hi> Carnall fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting.</note> Another great Let or impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in this case, is excessive feasting, or
belly-cheare. True it is, that we are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the liberall, and comfortable use of Gods
creatures, not onely for necessitie, but for
delight; but yet we must even in this case
beware of excesse. The Prophet cryeth out
against unreasonable, and unseasonable feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mungers,
<hi>Amos</hi> 6. 4. <hi>That they stretched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon their couches, &amp; did eat the Lambs

11. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Woe to them that rise up early to
follow strong drinke,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And the Tabret and
the Pipe are in their feasts; but they regard not
the worke of the Lord, nor the operation of his
hands.</hi> Where we see, that time spent in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
and excessive feasting, and time
spent in Gods service, cannot well stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
it is a great Let and impediment in
this case. This was one thing that made the
rich man, that he could finde no time for
Gods service, nor for the good of his soule,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 19. Because, as he was <hi>cloathed
with purple and fine linnen,</hi> so he <hi>fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
every day,</hi> sayth the Text. Every day
was a day of feasting, and therefore there
was no time left for the exercises of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:4060:179"/>
they feede the bodie, but starve and pine
the soule. Therefore we must have a care to
spend lesse time in feasting,<note place="margin">Remedies. To consider the great hurt that commeth by it.</note> that we may
spend more in the duties of Gods worship
and service. And to this end let us consider
these five Remedies.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> Abuse of Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> Immoderate feasting, is seldome, or
never without the abuse of Gods good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and so we fight against God, and strike
him with those blessings, which he hath
graciously given us for our delight: yea,
hereby we commit Idolatrie, in making our
<hi>belly our God, Phil.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> A breeder of quarrells and unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse.</note> Seldome without brabbles and
quarrells, many times betweene persons of
neare relation one to another. See the fruit
of that great feast made by <hi>Ahashuerus,</hi> that
lasted so long; What was the event of it,
but a woefull breach betweene him and his
wife? <hi>Hest.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> A man in that case is most apt
to deny God. This made <hi>Agur</hi> pray against
wealth and riches; <hi>Give me not povertie, nor
riches,</hi> sayth the Text, <hi>Pro.</hi> 30. 8. And the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
see the reason that he giveth for it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9.
<hi>Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is
the Lord?</hi> Thus full-fed <hi>Pharoah</hi> cryed out,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Who is the Lord, that I should obey
his voyce, to let Israel goe? I know not the Lord,
neither will I let Israel goe.</hi> Excessive fulnes
will make a man even to kick against God;
<hi>Jesurun is waxed fat, and kicked,</hi> sayth the
Text, <hi>Deut</hi> 32. 15. <hi>Thou are covered with
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:4060:180"/>
fatnesse; Then he forsooke God that made him,
and lightly esteemed the rocke of his Salvation.</hi>
Loe, the fruit of excessive fulnesse. Yea,
this was one of the sinnes of <hi>Sodome,</hi> Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and fulnesse of bread made them so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerably
filthy, that they fell to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanenesse
which was unnaturall, as the
Prophet sheweth, <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 16. 49.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> And also to forget God.</note> This excessive use, or rather
abuse of Gods creatures, are great meanes
to make us forget God. True it is, that even
then we have most cause to remember him
with all love and thankfulnesse: but such is
the corruption of our nature, that even then
above all other times, wee are most apt to
forget him; according to the admonition
of the Lord himselfe by <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 8. 11,
12. <hi>When thou hast eaten and art full, then
thou shalt blesse the Lord thy God, for the good
Land that he hath given thee.</hi> There is the
right use of fulnesse and plentie. But what
followeth? <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Beware, that thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
not the Lord thy God:</hi> and <hi>Ver.</hi> 13, 14.
<hi>Lest when thou hast eaten and art full,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then
they heart be lifted up, and thou forget the Lord
thy God,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a dangerous mischiefe
indeed: <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>The wicked shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into hell, and all that forget God. O consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this yee that forget God,</hi> and feast your
selves without feare, <hi>least he teare you in piec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and there be none to deliver you. When I
fed them to the full, they then committed adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie
against me; and assembled themselves by
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:4060:180"/>
troopes in the harlots houses, Iere.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Mischiefe</hi> Increase our torments in hell, if we repent not.</note> The more that wee have mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spent
our time in feasting and carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
the more torment we are like to have
hereafter. All such immoderate carnall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
end in torments, without repentance.
What became of him that was cloathed in
purple and fine Linnen, and fared delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
every day? <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 19. What is the
next newes we heare of this Belly-god; this
mirth-munger? <hi>The rich man dyed, and was
buried; and in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in

there, what <hi>Abraham</hi> especially objecteth
against him, <hi>Ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Sonne, Remember that
thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>therefore he is comforted, and thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</hi>
See a direct testimony, concerning
the woefull estate of such, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19.
<hi>For many walke, of whom I told you often, and
now tell you even weeping, that they are the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Crosse of Christ; whose end is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:</hi>
Well, What are their courses?
<hi>Whose God is their belly, whose glorie is their
shame, who minde earthly things.</hi> See here the
end of excessive feasting. And thus you see
the fourth Impediment, and the Remedies
against it.</p>
                  <p>Fift let or impediment,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Let. sc.</hi> Carnall pleasures, how hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous.</note> that keepeth men
from spending time in Gods service, is the
inordinate pursuite, and excessive use of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
pleasures and delights, vaine mirth and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:4060:181"/>
merriment. This doth follow to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
after the former, as being, for the most
part, an inseparable companion of it;
<hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 6. <hi>The people sate downe to eat,
and to drinke, and they rose up to play.</hi> So in
<hi>Isaiahs</hi> time, this was an adjunct of their
feasting, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 5. 12. <hi>The Harpe, and the
Violl, the Tabret, and Pipe are in their feasts,</hi>
(therefore they had no time to serve God)
therefore it followeth, <hi>But they regard not
the worke of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> certainely these
vaine pleasures, if eagerly followed, will
doe us a great deale of hurt, in usurping a
great part of precious time, which was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
spent in Gods service. Recreations, if
moderately used, are very usefull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing,
but if inordinate, they spoyle all.
As it is fitly said of fire and water, that they
are very good servants, but evill Masters:
fire on the hearth is usefull; but in the
thatch of the house fatall and dangerous: so
pleasures and recreations are very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
if used moderately, but very hurtfull,
if they be abused by excesse. Yea, even the
most innocent and harmelesse pleasures that
can be, are very hurtfull, if followed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately;
as the best wine maketh the
sharpest and the quickest Vinegar, <hi>To bee
lovers of pleasures, more then of God,</hi>
2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 4. or to spend that time in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
which we should spend in <hi>Gods</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
will poyson the most innocent and
harmelesse pleasures in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="347" facs="tcp:4060:181"/>
Now the Remedies that we must use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst<note place="margin">Remedies.</note>
this great usurper of precious time,
are principally these.</p>
                  <p>1. Let us be sure that the matters of our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
pleasures and delights,<note place="margin">See that the matter of our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures bee lawfull.</note> be just and lawfull.
To take pleasure in sinning against God, <hi>It
is a sport for a foole to doe wickedly,</hi> saith
<hi>Salomon Prov.</hi> 10. 23. To take pleasure in
swearing, in excessive drinking, or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others drunke, or pernicious and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
jestings, this mirth is wholly earthly,
sensuall, and devilish; this is like him, of
whom <hi>Salomon</hi> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 19, 20. <hi>that
casteth firebrands, arrowes, and death,</hi> and
saith, <hi>Am I not in sport?</hi> Here is wofull
sport. Bee sure thy delights be lawfull and
honest.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Remedy.</note> Seasonable. If never so law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
yet if they be followed unseasonably,<note place="margin">Seasonable.</note>
they are deadly and dangerous. Bowle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
shooting, leaping, these are lawfull in
themselves; but these may be made unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
if used unseasonably, that is, in time of
divine Service, or Sermon on the Lords
day; Here is Wine turned into Vinegar:
or in time of any publike calamity, when
Gods Church is in misery. This was their
fault in <hi>Amos</hi> his dayes, <hi>They dranke wine
in bowles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but did not regard the affliction
of Ioseph, Amos</hi> 6. 6. So <hi>Isaiah</hi> 22. 12.
<hi>In that day did the Lord God of Hosts call
to weeping and mourning,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and behold,
joy, and gladnesse, slaying Oxen, and killing
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:4060:182"/>
Sheepe, eating flesh, and drinking wine.</hi> These
were things lawfull in themselves, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
now, because at this time God
called for the contrary. This is the second
rule or Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Remedie.</hi> 3. Moderate, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive.</note> Moderate and sober, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive,
when wee are even too much bent
upon pleasures, and set our hearts upon
them continually. Here was the Rich mans
fault, that hee <hi>fared deliciously every day,
Luke</hi> 16. 19. when we love pleasures more
than God; when wee spend more time in
carnall delights, then in the duties of Gods
service; nay, can finde no time to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Some spend day by day in pleasures,
like their resolution, in <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 12. <hi>Come
ye</hi> (say they) <hi>I will fetch wine, and we will
fill our selves with strong drinke, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
shall be as this day, and much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
This was excessive.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Rule or Remedy. Meditat.</note> And therefore the fourth and
last Remedy consisteth in holy meditation,
concerning the vanity, and danger of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
delights, if followed immoderately.
To withdraw our affections from them,
consider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The vanity,<note place="margin">To consider the vanity of carnall pleasures.</note> and vacuity of these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
and pleasures; especially, if wee
seeme to place our happinesse, and felicity,
in the enjoyment of them; they cannot
satisfie the minde of man, but the more he
doteth upon them, the lesse hee findeth in
them. See what <hi>Salomon</hi> pronounceth of
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:4060:182"/>
them all, when he had sifted them to the
bottome, <hi>All is vanity, and vexation of
spirit.</hi> That which he saith of silver, is as
true of pleasures, He that loveth them (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
too well) shal not be satisfied with
them <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 10. See what the Holy
Ghost pronounceth of all worldly things,
and consequently of carnall and worldly
pleasures, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. <hi>Wherefore doe ye spend
your money, for that which is not bread, and
your labour for that which satisfieth not?</hi>
These cannot satisfie, nor bring any true
content with them. But as in case of a
burning fever, the poore thirsty creature,
cryeth out for a cup of cold water, but the
cup is scarce gone from his mouth, when
he cryeth out for more, as being more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed,
and farre more thirstie then before:
so it is with these carnall pleasures, they doe
bewitch us so, that the more wee enjoy
them, the more we dote upon them, Let
us stay and moderate our selves this way,
with this consideration, He that thinketh
to satisfie himselfe with carnall delights,
may as well take in hand to fill a sive with
water, which would bee an endlesse la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Medit.</hi> 2. Fickle and uncertaine.</note> If they could satisfie, (which
they cannot doe) yet dote not upon them,
because they are so fickle, uncertaine, and
momentany. Alas! they are but for a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they <hi>betake them to their wings</hi> (like
riches) <hi>and flye away as an Eagle towards
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:4060:183"/>
Heaven:</hi> they are of a fading nature,
and a perishing condition: they endure
but for a season; That made wise <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
care little for them, and so lightly to
esteeme them, preferring the afflictions of
Gods people before them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 25.
<hi>Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the
people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of
sinne for a season.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Meditat.</hi> 3. Hurtfull &amp; dangerous.</note> Consider how hurtefull, and
dangerous. Carnall mirth doth ever end in
heavinesse, and bitternesse. <hi>Woe unto you
that laugh now,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>for yee
shall wayle and weepe, Luke</hi> 6. 25. (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
Hearken to this yee merry blades, that
spend all your dayes in mirth, and jollity,
you will have one day the heaviest hearts of
any people under heaven; in the meane
time it stealeth away the heart. Like as
continuall whetting spendeth time, and
spoyleth the sithe: so excessive sporting
spoyleth the minde, indisposeth to good,
and maketh a man even a prey to his lusts
and to Sathan; yea, and we may assure our
selves, that it will be bitternesse in the later
end, for it is sure to end in heavinesse, either
of godly sorrow, (if we doe repent) or of
desperate griese and sorrow in hell, <hi>lest thou
mourne at last,</hi> saith <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 5. 11.
<hi>when thy flesh and body are consumed, &amp;c.</hi>

not only idle, but tatlers also, and busie bodies;</hi>
which is the babling out of vaine, and

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is to make conscience of our thoughts,<note place="margin">Consisting in meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. God searcheth the heart, &amp; seeth our thoughts.</note>
and examine them dayly, and that upon a

                  <p>1. Because God is a searcher, and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

spent in GODS service is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and incomporably the
best spent time, This serveth to
exhort us, not only to preach, but also to
doe our best to perswade, and prevaile with
others, and to presse them earnestly to spend
much time in Gods service. It is the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a religious heart, that such an one
is not content to serve God himselfe, but
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:4060:185"/>
earnestly desireth, and carefully endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
to draw others thereunto. This hath
ever beene the disposition and the practise of
Gods people, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 122. 1. <hi>I was glad,
when they said unto mee, let us goe to the
house of the Lord.</hi> Where we see, that in
those dayes, such as were truely religious,
were not content to serve God themselves,
but were ready to exhort and perswade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
thereunto. 2. That <hi>David</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous
glad, and very ready to accept of
the motion. This was foretold to bee the
disposition of godly persons under the time
of the Gospell, <hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 2, 3. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 1, 2.
<hi>It shall come to passe in the last dayes, that
the mountaine of the Lord shall be establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
in the top of the mountaines,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
all Nations shall flow unto it.</hi> Well, What
is, or shall be, the disposition of godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in those times? <hi>And many people shall
goe up, and say, come ye, let us goe up to the
mountaine of the Lord, to the house of the
God of Iacob; and he will teach us of his
wayes, and wee will walke in his paths, &amp;c.</hi>
The like was foretold, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. 21. <hi>The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of one Citie, shall goe to another,
saying, let us goe speedily to pray before the
Lord, and to seeke the Lord of Hosts; I will
goe also.</hi> Where we see,</p>
                  <p>1. That godly people are not content to<note place="margin">It hath bin the practise of Gods people to doe so.</note>
serve God themselves, but are carefull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
and perswade others thereunto.</p>
                  <p>2. That they were ready to doe this spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="355" facs="tcp:4060:185"/>
3. That he that made the motion, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
ready to goe before them, by his own
good example, <hi>I will goe also:</hi> an excellent
patterne for our imitation; that we should
exhort others to make all possible speed to
serve God. And 2. That such as make such
religious motions, must be fearefull to goe
before them, by their owne good examples.
Now as it was foretold that it should be so
in the later dayes; so give me leave to shew
by examples, that it was so. Now for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
I might produce many, I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but only in two: one man, and one
woman: that I may perswade both men
and women, to imitate and follow such
rare, and holy examples. Holy <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
see what the Spirit of God saith of him:
<hi>Acts</hi> 11. 23, 24. (when he came to <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och</hi>)
sc. <hi>That when he had seene the grace of
God among them, he was glad, and exhorted
them all, that with purpose of heart they
would cleave unto the Lord: for hee was a
good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi>
Wherein we may see; 1. That he that is
truly religious, is not content to serve God
himselfe, but rejoyceth greatly in the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
forwardnesse of others, and is
ready to exhort, and encourage others to
constancy, and perseverance therein. 2. That
hee is a good man, and full of the Holy
Ghost that is of that holy disposition.</p>
                  <p>2. The other example is that of the
Woman of <hi>Samaria, Iohn</hi> 4. 28. who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:4060:186"/>
met with our blessed Saviour, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by him effectually wrought upon, and
truly converted unto God, she runneth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the City to tell her neighbours, saying,
<hi>Come, see a Man that hath told me all that
ever I did; Is not he the Christ?</hi> where we
see, that she was not content to enjoy this
speciall favour her selfe, but she earnestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth,
and carefully endeavoureth to be an
instrument and meanes to prevaile with
others, and to bring them to God. Let no
man say, What need I trouble my selfe with
others? Is it not enough for me to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
and serve God daily, and truly my
selfe, unlesse I be forward to exhorte others?
For he that hath true grace, cannot but bee
ready to doe all good offices to hasten, and
to helpe forward the salvation of others.
Goodnesse is even a spreader of it selfe.
True grace maketh a man to resolve, like
those Lepers, whereof we reade 2 <hi>Kings</hi>
7. 9, 10. When they had filled, and satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

is much honoured, and his Name is highly

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ove unto his Majesty. Gods glory in all
things should be respected in the first place;
<hi>Whether ye eate, or drinke, or whatsoever ye
doe, doe all to the glory of God,</hi> saith the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:4060:187"/>
Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31. Now surely the
more people, and the greater the company
is, that joyne together in the duties of
Gods service, the more glory must needs
hereby redound to God: for the enlarging
of <hi>Christs</hi> kingdome, is a chiefe meanes of
advancing Gods glory. This our Saviour
teacheth, in the very mould, and course of
the Lords Prayer: it appeareth in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
order of the petitions. 1. <hi>Hallowed be
thy Name:</hi> to shew, that in all things, in
the first place, Gods glory must be respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
2. <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> there is the
chiefe meanes, to shew that the comming
of Gods kingdome is one chiefe meanes
for the hallowing of his Name; and the
enlarging of <hi>Christ's</hi> kingdome is a chiefe
meanes for the advancing of Gods glory,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 10, 11. certainely much glory
must needs hereby redound to God, when
we are not content only to serve God our
selves, but also exhort, and excite, and stirre
up others hereunto.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Motive</hi> In regard of our selves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause. 1. This is a good Testimony that we our selves are religious.</note> There is another Motive to
perswade us, which is drawne from our
selves: Hereby we shall manifest the work
of grace wrought in our own hearts. This
is a good testimony that we are truely reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
indeed, when wee are not content
to serve God our selves, but are ready to
provoke, and stirre up others hereunto: for
goodnesse is a spreader of it selfe, it is ready
to disperse and communicate it selfe for the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:4060:187"/>
good of others. Yee heard what the Holy
Ghost said of <hi>Barnabas, Acts,</hi> 11. 23. <hi>That
he exhorted them all, that with purpose of
heart they would cleave to the Lord, ver.</hi> 24.
<hi>for he was a good man, and full of the Holy
Ghost.</hi> A good man, and one that is full of
the Holy Ghost, is, and will be ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite,
and stirre up others unto that which is
good: <hi>When thou art converted, strengthen
thy brethren,</hi> said our Saviour, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 32.
He that is truly converted himselfe, will be
ready to be a meanes to convert, and turne
others to God. See it in <hi>David, Psalme</hi>
51. 13. <hi>Then shall I teach thy wayes to the
wicked, and sinners shall be converted unto
thee.</hi> Where there is abundance of grace in
the heart, it will manifest it selfe in our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
speeches, and holy communication,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 30, 31. <hi>The mouth of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
speaketh wisedome, his tongue will bee
talking of judgement, the Law of his God is
in his heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for out of the abundance of
the heart, the mouth speaketh,</hi> saith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 34. <hi>I have hid thy Word

to others; yea, we doe not know, how

for by this, we may come to <hi>save a soule from
death, and cover a multitude of sinnes, Iam.</hi> 5.
20. Hereby we may come to be acquainted
with the wayes of God,<note place="margin">This hath beene the practise of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> our selves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom we perswade, may be hereby
converted to walke in his pathes; for <hi>Psal.</hi>
19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the soule,</hi> &amp;c. See how confidently <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
assureth himselfe of the conversion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
upon his best endeavour to teach them
Gods wayes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 13. <hi>Then shall I teach
thy wayes to the wicked, and sinners shall be
converted unto thee.</hi> How much more, if we
come to the house and Ordinances of God,
and bring others with us? This argument
Gods people have used, to perswade others
to goe with them to Gods house. <hi>Come, let
us goe up to the mountaine of the Lord, for he
will teach us of his wayes, and we will walke in
his pathes, Isa.</hi> 2. 2, 3. This is the way to
bring others to the true feare of GOD, as
well as our selves, if we can perswade them
to accompany us, in the constant and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
use of Gods Ordinances. Observe an
excellent place to this purpose, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.
11, 12. <hi>When all Israel is come to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, in the place that he shall choose,
thou shalt reade this Law before all Israel in
their hearing. Gather the people together, men,
women, and children, and the stranger that is
within thy gates.</hi> Why so? What good will
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:4060:188"/>
they get this? <hi>That they may heare, and that
they may learne, and feare the Lord your God,
to doe all the words of this Law.</hi> Where we
see, that the house, or place of Gods worship
and service must be constantly frequented;
and that it is not enough for us to come
thither our selves, but we must also bring
our whole families, men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
yea, the very stranger that doth but
occasionally come unto us; we must bring
all to Gods Ordinances. And lastly, that
hereby we are likely to be instruments of
working the feare of God in the hearts of
those whom we bring; and so to bring them
to obedience. Let no man say, What neede
we trouble our selves with others? Is it not
enough, for every man to looke to himselfe,
and to have a care that he spend time him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in Gods service, though he doe not
meddle with others? For though Christian
charitie begin at home, yet it doth not end
there; but he that is truely carefull to serve
God himselfe, will be readie to exhort and
admonish others, especially those of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie,
and such as are committed to his
charge. And if any thinke much at this, yet
let him know that it is no more then his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>But exhort one another day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
while it is called to day.</hi> Nay, no man can
have any good assurance, that he draweth
nigh to God with a true heart himselfe, if
he doe not doe his best endeavour, to excite
and stirre up others to doe so too. See an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:4060:189"/>
passage to this purpose, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22.

in full assurance of faith, having our hearts
sprinkled from an evill conscience, and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
washed with cleane water,</hi> &amp;c. But how
shall we come to be assured that we doe so?
That you shall see, <hi>Ver.</hi> 24. <hi>Let us consider
one another, to provoke unto love, and unto good
workes,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, but what good worke are
we principally to bring others unto? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to frequent the Church assemblies, <hi>v.</hi> 25.
<hi>Not forsaking the assembling of our selves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as the manner of some is,</hi> So that you
see, we have great warrant for this. Yea, we
must needs doe it, necessitie is layd upon us,
and woe be unto us if we doe it not. It is
the voyce of a <hi>Cain, Am I my Brothers keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
Gen.</hi> 4. Art thou not bound to <hi>love thy
neighbour as thy selfe?</hi> But I will tell thee,
that thou doest not love, but hate him in
thy heart, if thou suffer him to goe on in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sinfull way, and doe not doe thy best en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to convert him. See an evident
place for this purpose, in <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Thou
shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart.</hi> Yea, it
is the second maine dutie of the Law, <hi>Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe?</hi> But it
may be thou art readie to say,<note place="margin">Else we hate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not hate him, but wish him well, and love
him as my selfe; I doe not trouble him, nor
make nor meddle with him, &amp;c. Nay, but
this is not enough, thou mayest hate him
in thy heart, notwithstanding all this, if
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:4060:189"/>
thou goe no farther, and therefore see what
followeth; <hi>Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy
neighbour, and not suffer sinne upon him; else
thou doest but hate him in thy heart.</hi> So that if
we see our brother neglect the Church as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles,
or heare him sweare, and blaspheme
the Name of God, or live in any other sinne,
and doe not plainely rebuke him, thou doest
not love thy brother, but hate him in thy
heart, and art a murtherer in Gods account.
Hereby we testifie the truth of our love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them; especially, thy familie, and
those that are committed to thy charge;
thou doest not love them truely, but hate
them in thy heart, if thou neglect the good
of their soules. See the concurrent practise
of such as have beene once truely converted
themselves, that their families have beene
soone wrought on, even immediately after.
<hi>Act.</hi> 16. 34. It is sayd of the converted Iay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,<note place="margin">The Iayler. Acts 16.</note>

this would quicken our desire and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to reforme our familie; if this was
layd to heart, and rightly considered; this
would make a man resolve with <hi>David,</hi>

O therefore let us have a care, not onely to
serve God our selves, but let us doe our best
to perswade others; especially, let us have
a care to reforme our families, and put away
iniquitie from our Tabernacle;<note place="margin">This is the way to bring Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</note> this is the
way to bring the blessing of God both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves, and upon our families. The
power of Religion, where it once cometh,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:4060:190"/>
doth ever leave a blessing behinde it. As the
Arke of God brought a blessing with it to
the house of <hi>O bed Edom,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 11. Yea,
if there be but one person in a familie that
truely feareth God, the whole familie and
houshold shall fare the better for their
sakes. Thus God blessed <hi>Labans</hi> house for
<hi>Jacobs</hi> sake, as <hi>Laban</hi> himselfe confessed,
and therefore was lothe to part with him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 27. <hi>I pray thee tarry,</hi> sayth he, <hi>for
I have learned by experience, that the Lord
hath blessed me for thy sake.</hi> And so the Lord
blessed <hi>Putiphar's</hi> house for <hi>Ioseph's</hi> sake:
that idolatrous family sped a great deale the
better for such a servant; <hi>The Lord blessed the
Aegyptians house for Ioseph's sake,</hi> sayth the
Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 5. But how much more,
would it be a speciall meanes to bring Gods
blessing upon our houses, and families, if all
the whole familie would delight to spend

perswade us, not onely to serve
GOD our selves, but also to
perswade others thereunto, is
drawn from the consideration of the worth
and excellency of the exercises of Religion;
especially, the duties of his publike and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
worship. How can any of us spend
our time better, then in such holy and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
performances? It is even a little hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon earth to be so employed; there
have we the Word faithfully read &amp; preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both the Old and New Testament; yea,
there we have the Ordinance of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
wherein we have milke for babes, as

of our Church, wherin all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
joyne together, as one man, in that so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne

of the Booke of prayers, appointed

Divine sayth thus, concerning the sayd
Booke of prayers, That they are as ample,
holy, effectuall, and fit for the present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as ever were in any Lyturgie that he

in the first place, give me leave to shew you
the worth and excellency of publike prayers
in the Congregation, in some respect above
any prayers that are made in secret in our
Closets, or in private amongst our people in
our families. See it in foure particulars.</p>

yea, and cary his whole hous-hold (a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude)
with him to the House of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

This made him so glad when he was exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

that should perswade us, not onely duely to
frequent the house of God our selves, but to
exhort and stirre up others to joyne with us
therein, <hi>sc.</hi> because of the people of GOD,
that are there present in a speciall manner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The Angels are present there.</note> Not onely Gods people are there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
present, but also the holy Angells of God are
present in our Church assemblies. As <hi>they

that shall be heires of Salvation, Heb.</hi> 1. 14.
so especially then, when we are the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously

their tents about us, to defend us, Psal.</hi> 34. 7.
<hi>and keepe us in all our wayes;</hi> much more
when we walke in the wayes of God, they

<hi>because of the Angells, (i.e.)</hi> The Angells
are in a most speciall manner present in our

Yea, this was also figured to Gods

that the walls of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple were full
of <hi>Cherubims</hi> round about, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 29.
to intimate unto Gods people, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Angells of God were in a speciall manner
present in the Church assemblies. This
should perswade us to make great account
of the publike prayers in the Congregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,<note place="margin">Not onely the Saints and Angels, but also the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is there present.</note> Not onely the Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells,
but also the Lord himselfe is in a most

in the Congregation: <hi>Loe, I am with you

<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. Especially, at publike
prayers; for of such kinde of assemblies our
blessed Saviour speaketh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>Where
two or three are gathered together in my name,
there am I in the middest of them.</hi> Oh how
this should perswade us, not onely to spend

others to doe so too, in regard of the
excellent company that we are there sure
to meete withall, the holy Saints, and the
Angels of God; yea, and the Lord himselfe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Illustrat.</hi> Such pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally most powerfull and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> Because publike prayers, that
are presented to God in the Congregation,
are usually most prevalent, and powerfull,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:4060:193"/>
and likely to prevaile with God, eyther for
the obtaining of some speciall blessing that
we want, or preventing, or removing some
heavie judgement, eyther felt, or feared;
for <hi>the Lord loveth the gates of Zion, more
then all the dwellings of Iacob, Psal.</hi> 87. 2.
Such prayers do usually finde speciall accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with him. See what a promise our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
hath made to such prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
19. <hi>Againe, I say unto you, if two of you</hi> (much
more, if two hundred) <hi>shall agree on earth,
as touching any thing that they shall aske, it
shall be done for them, of my Father which is in
heaven. For there the Lord commandeth his
blessing, and life for evermore,</hi> sayth the Text,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 133. 3. Yea, the Lord himselfe directeth
to these publike and solemne prayers, as
those that of all others are the most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to prevaile with God; as appeareth in
<hi>Joell</hi> 2. when he foretelleth a judgement fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
see what the Lord prescribeth, as the
meanes to prevent it, <hi>V.</hi> 15. <hi>Blow the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
in Zion, sanctifie a Fast, call a solemne as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly;
V.</hi> 16. <hi>Gather the people, sanctifie the
Congregation, assemble the Elders, yea, gather
the children, yea, the bride and bridegroome,
the Priests and Ministers of the Lord,</hi> all must
bestirre themselves, with fasting, and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and praying; and then see the event pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
<hi>V.</hi> 18. <hi>Then will the Lord be jealous for
his Land, and pitie his people, Ver.</hi> 19. The like
promise we have, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7. 13, 14. <hi>If the
people that are called by my Name, shall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:4060:194"/>
themselves, and pray, and seeke my face,</hi> &amp;c.
So that in the opinion of God himselfe, such
prayers are excellent, because most effectuall
and prevalent with God in time of danger.
Yea, this was the opinion of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and therefore it was that he frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Jewish</hi> Synagogues, the places ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted
for publike prayer, though he was
the most excellently furnished with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of prayer, of any that ever were; yea,
and those Synagogues had great corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in them: which sheweth how highly
he esteemed of publike prayers, which were
solemnely made to God in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This also appeareth by experience. See
what wonderfull successe the <hi>Ninivites</hi> had,
in proclaiming publike fasting and prayer;
<hi>Ionah</hi> 8. 10. <hi>When God saw their workes</hi> (how
publikely &amp; solemnly they went to worke)
<hi>he repented of the evill that he intended to doe
unto them, and he did it not.</hi> So see the successe
that <hi>Iohosophat</hi> had by this meanes, even at
a dead lift, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 3. 13. Concerning
which the Storie setteth out three things in
that case, as the most remarkable. 1. The
danger they were in, their enemies being
many in number, were readie even suddenly
to set upon them, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. 2. The course
that they tooke, to prevent the danger, <hi>v.</hi> 3.
<hi>He proclaimed a fast, and set himselfe to seeke
the Lord:</hi> yea, see how solemnly they went
to worke; <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Judah gathered themselves
together to aske helpe of the Lord, even out of
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:4060:194"/>
all the Cities of Iudah they came to seeke the
Lord:</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>And all Iudah stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, with their little ones, their wives,
and their children, there was none left out.</hi> Then
thirdly, See the strange and admirable suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
that followed hereupon, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23,
24. &amp;c. They had the victorie, without so
much as striking of a stroke, the enemies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
one another, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to doe, but onely to divide the spoyle,
and returne due prayse and thankesgiving
to God, for so miraculous a deliverance. See
here the power of joynt prayers, like a great
flood, they beate downe all before them.
And indeede, in all reason the prayers that
are made by the publike vote of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
must needs be the most effectuall; for if
<hi>the effectuall fervent prayer of one righteous
man availe much, Iam.</hi> 5. 17. much more of
many: <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7. <hi>Aske, and you shall have;
seeke, and yee shall finde; and knocke, and it shall
be opened.</hi> If a whole Towne or Parish doe
all joyne together, to aske a boone at some
great mans hand, they are most likely to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile,
rather then one man alone. 2. If many
eyes do joyne in seeking a thing that is lost,
there is the more probabilitie to finde it;
and if many joyne together, with joynt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to knocke at heaven gates; are they not
the more likely to beate them open? O then
the blockish folly of such as regard not these
publike prayers, that are made to God in the
Church assemblies, but doe often absent
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:4060:195"/>
themselves, upon every light and triviall
occasion! Yea, and see the folly of those that
preferre their owne private prayers, before
the publike prayers of the whole Church of
God in the Congregation: but above all, the
folly of those is most palpable, that doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
that time in private reading upon a
booke, which they should imploy in joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Gods people in publike and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
prayers: if this be not to offer unto
God the sacrifice of fooles, I must needs
confesse, I doe not know what is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Illustrat.</hi> Such pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers redound most to Gods glorie.</note> The third thing wherein the
worth of such kinde of prayers appeareth,
is in regard of the glory that hereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth
to God. I know the Lord recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
glory by the performance of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in secret, and in our families, as well as
in the Congregation: but as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>There
are degrees of glory, there is one glory of the Sun
another of the Moone, &amp; another of the starres:</hi>
so in this case; 1. Secret duties in our Closets,
that may be compared to the glory of the
Starres. 2. Private duties in our families,
that may be compared to the Moone-light.
3. Publike duties in the Congregation, that
may be compared to the glorious light of
the Sunne: So that the most glory doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
redound to God. Hence it is, that <hi>David</hi>
had such a speciall respect to the duties of
Gods publike worship and service; as <hi>Psal.</hi>
111. 1. <hi>I will praise thee, O Lord, with my whole
heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:4060:195"/>
Congregation.</hi> So, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 18. <hi>I will pay my
vowes now in the presence of all his people.</hi> Why
so? Surely, because he knew that much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
did hereby redound to God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 29. 1, 2.
<hi>Give unto the Lord glory and strength; give
unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name:</hi>
But how? It followeth; <hi>Worship the Lord in
the beautie of Holines.</hi> By this meanes we
give unto God the glory due unto his name.
Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. <hi>Illustrat.</hi> Most sweet and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable.</note> In regard of the sweetnes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

of this Sacrament in it selfe, &amp; the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

It was the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> himselfe that institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

or scornfully turne their backs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, when it is administred in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
(as many doe, who eyther depart

                  <p>Secondly, There is none of us but may
receive much good by this Sacrament of

if the fault be not in our selves;<note place="margin">1. Benefit.</note> for hereby
we shall not onely testifie our due respect to
Gods Ordinance, and consequently to his
owne Majestie:<note place="margin">1. Hereby we are put in minde of our owne Baptisme, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits which we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</note> but besides, hereby we shall
be put in minde of our owne Baptisme, and
our participation in this blessed Sacrament,
and of those admirable benefits, which we
then received, as, <hi>sc.</hi> the remission of our
sins, our spirituall new-birth and regnera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:4060:196"/>
being borne of water and of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 5. Yea, hereby we become
the members of Christ, the children of <hi>God,</hi>
and inheritours of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as we have it in our Catechisme. And
how can we be put in minde of these bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
without being in some measure stirred
up unto praise and thankfulnes for the same,
when we have such a lively commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our being ingrafted into the body of
<hi>Christ,</hi> and of our originall sins being wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away in the bloud of <hi>Christ?</hi> Now if
any wonder, or thinke it strange, how any
such benefits should hereby be conveyed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us; let him consider, that Gods ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of any thing, doth make it effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to the end for which it is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
although in it selfe it seeme never
so improbable, or wholly impossible:
See 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Prophet to be cured of his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie,
he sendeth him to wash seven times
in <hi>Iordan,</hi> and he should be cleansed, this
seemed a very incredible thing in the eyes
of this great man, <hi>goe wash in Iordan;</hi> here
a likely course to cure a man of his leprosie:
if washing in a river would have served
the turne, I need never to have come hither,
for, saith he, <hi>Are no Abanah, and Pharpar,
rivers of Damascus better then all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Israel?</hi> &amp;c. and so he began to goe
his way in a rage, saith the Text, <hi>verse</hi> 12.
yea, and if some of his servants had not
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:4060:197"/>
better considered of the matter, hee had
gone backe againe as uncleane as he came;
for, say they, <hi>My father, if the Prophet had
bidden thee doe some great matter, wouldest
thou not have done it? How much more,
when he saith unto thee: Wash, and be cleane?</hi>
What hurt can it doe thee, if thou wash in
<hi>Iordan?</hi> Besides, it may happily prevaile
beyond all expectation. And see the sequell,
<hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>He went downe, and dipped him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
seven times in Iordan, according to the
saying of the Man of God, and his flesh
came againe, like unto the flesh of a little
childe, and hee was cleane.</hi> So let no man
say, What likely-hood, or probability is
there, that the washing or besprinkling the
face of an Infant with baptisme, should bee
the instrument of regeneration? Or that a
bit of bread, and a small sup of wine, should
be of such admirable efficacy, as to make us
partakers of <hi>Christ,</hi> with all his merits?
For certainely, the Ordinances of GOD
make a thing admirably effectuall, above
and beyond all imagination. What an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
passage to this purpose is that
which we have, <hi>Numbers</hi> 21. 9. Where
being stung with fiery Serpents in the
Wildernesse, God commandeth them, as a
remedy, that they should make a Serpent of
brasse, and set it upon a Pole. Now in the
eye of carnall reason, this was an unlikely
thing to doe any good at all; and yet the
Text sheweth how admirably effectuall it
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:4060:197"/>
was; so that he that could looke towards
the brasen Serpent, was healed immediatly:
and so whosoever can look at <hi>Christ,</hi> with
an eye of faith in his Ordinances, shal surely
be healed. So that here is the first benefit
that we may receive, and the ground of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Benefit.</hi> This may put us in mind of the vow wee made then to God.</note> So often as we see this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Baptisme administred, so often we
may be put in minde of our duty, and the
solemne vow and promise that we made
to God in that Sacrament, <hi>sc.</hi> that wee
would forsake the Devill, and all his works,
&amp;c. and that we would believe in God, and
keepe his Commandements, and so approve
our selves to be <hi>Christs</hi> faithful servants and
Souldiers unto our lives end. And is it not
of singular use, to bee put in minde of our
duty? And how can we choose but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
it, when we see and heare the like, nay
the same vow and promise made to God, in
the behalfe of another? This is another
speciall benefit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Benefit.</hi> Hereby wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in Baptisme may bee put in minde, of that which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke in the behalfe of others.</note> Hereby we may be put in mind
of that which we undertake, as solemne
Witnesses in the behalfe of our God-chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
or our children in <hi>God;</hi> that so we may
put them in minde of what we promised
for them, and see that they be vertuously
brought up, and to this end call upon them
to heare Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which, all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
but few performe. This will minde
us of this duty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Benefit.</note> and lastly, Hereby we have a
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:4060:198"/>
fit opportunity of performing a good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<note place="margin">An oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of performing a good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, in the behalfe of the Infant baptized.</note>
in respect of the present infant bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
<hi>sc.</hi> to pray unto God for it, that it may
be made a lively member of <hi>Christ,</hi> a true
child of God, and hereafter an inheritour of
the kingdome of heaven. In which respect,
it would be a good point of wisedome in
Parents, if they would provide (as much as
may be) that their children may be baptized
on the Sunday, or holy day, for solemne as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of Gods people; that by this meanes
their children may have the benefit of the
joynt prayers of the whole Congregation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly,<note place="margin">Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of it.</note> The excellency of the other
Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
which we receive thereby, is another
strong motive to perswade us, not only to
delight in the exercises of Gods publike
worship and service our selves, but also to
exhort and stirre up others hereunto. For
this blessed Sacrament doth fitly succeed and
follow after the former: for first we live,
and then we are nourished. So that as the
Sacrament of Baptisme, is a Sacrament of
initation, or implantation into <hi>Christ:</hi> So
the other, is a Sacrament of our continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
and growth in <hi>Christ.</hi> By the first, the
life of grace is begun; and by the second,
continued, or preserved in us. This also is
an Ordinance of <hi>Christ's</hi> owne instituting:
for the Apostle telleth us expresly,<note place="margin">An Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Christ.</note> that he
<hi>received it of the Lord Iesus, who, the same
night that he was betrayed tooke bread,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="813" facs="tcp:4060:198"/>
So that this blessed Sacrament is no lesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
then the former,<note place="margin">Beneficall to us.</note> let us (as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer)
consider what benefits wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
so often as this Sacrament is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among us, and received of us.</p>
                  <p>1. Hereby the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Benefits.</note> with all
his precious and soule-saving merits,<note place="margin">Hereby we doe receive Christ, with his merits.</note> are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
graciously offered unto all, and bestowed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
upon the soules of all worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers:
a matter that is fitter to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and faithfully believed, then curiously
disputed: for the manner of it, this is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
for our satisfaction, to believe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the doctrine of our Church) that
by the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, is
meant the very Body and Bloud of <hi>Christ,</hi>
which are verily and indeed taken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the faithfull in the Lords Supper.
And for the proofe of this, we have the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
words of our Saviour, <hi>Take, eate,
this is my Body.</hi> So that herein <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi>
with all the merits of his Body and Bloud
are offered unto us, and bestowed really
and effectually on all worthy receivers.</p>
                  <p>2. By receiving of this Sacrament, we
joyntly professe our common interest in
<hi>Christ,</hi> and our communion with him, and
one with another: and hereupon this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
is fitly called the communion,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 16.</p>
                  <p>3. Hereby the promises of God, and the
merits of <hi>Christ</hi> are sealed up unto us: So
that hereby we come to have both Gods
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:4060:199"/>
Hand Seale, to assure us of the pardon of
our sins, and of eternall happinesse: in
which respect the Sacraments are called the
Seales of righteousnesse, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Hereby our corruptions are
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> mortified,<note place="margin">Our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are mortified, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Gods spirit increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</note> and the graces of Gods Spirit
greately augmented and confirmed in us.
These Ordinances, through the speciall
blessing of God, doe nourish and feede our
soules unto life eternall. So that most true
we shall finde that speech of our Saviour,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 55. <hi>For my Flesh is meate indeed, and
my Bloud is drinke indeed.</hi> Yea, <hi>ver.</hi> 51. <hi>I
am the living Bread which came downe from
heaven; if any man eat of this bread, hee
shall live for ever, and the bread which I
will give, is my Flesh, which I will give for
the life of the world.</hi> Only remember, that
all this must bee understood of spirituall
eating, as our Saviour Himselfe, in the same
place, giveth us expresly to understand: for
when his grosse hearers made that carnall
question, saying, <hi>How can this Man give
us his flesh to eate? verse</hi> 52. Our Saviour
doth earnestly confirme it still, <hi>ver.</hi> 53. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye eate the Flesh of the Sonne of Man,
and drinke his Bloud, you have no life in you,
&amp;c.</hi> Yea, when many of the Disciples were
offended, and murmured at it, see how he
giveth them satisfaction, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. <hi>It is the
Spirit that quickneth, the flesh profiteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
the words which I speake unto you,
they are Spirit, and they are life;</hi> to shew,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:4060:199"/>
that all this must be spiritually understood;
for the foode is spirituall, and so of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
the eating and drinking must needs be.
So that this is enough to perswade us to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and highly to esteeme this Ordinance,
because therein <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> is verily, and
indeed taken and received, to the eternall
benefit and comfort of all worthy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
an argument sufficient, not only to
perswade us to take all opportunities of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this Sacrament our selves, but also
to perswade others hereunto, in regard of
the great benefits that are here offered and
exhibited, to the soules of all worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. <hi>Benefit.</hi> The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratton of the death of Christ, most lively represented unto us.</note> Hereby we have the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of <hi>Christs</hi> death most lively and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
represented unto us. So that we
may in this case use the benefit of our eyes,
to see the Bread broken, and the Wine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out, to signifie the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> and
the shedding of his Bloud; so that our
hands do as it were <hi>handle the Word of life,
Christ,</hi> as 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. The Word foundeth
in our eare; but in the Sacrament, the same
is most lively represented unto our eyes, <hi>sc.</hi>
the death of <hi>Christ: So that as often as wee
eate that bread, and drinke that cup, we shew
the Lords death, till he come,</hi> faith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. Yea, and this is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
end, for which this Sacrament was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
at the first, <hi>Doe this, in remembrance
of me,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. Yea,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:4060:200"/>
the Sacraments are most lively representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the sufferings of <hi>Christ,</hi> as if therein
<hi>Christ</hi> was really againe crucified before
our eyes, according to that speech of the
Apostle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> chap. 3. 1. <hi>O
foolish Galatians, Who hath bewitched you,
that you should not obey the truth, before
whose eyes Iesus Christ was evidently set
forth, even crucified amongst you!</hi> How
was he crucified among them, but only in
the Word and Sacraments? So that where
the Word is faithfully preached, and the
Sacraments duly celebrated, there is <hi>Iesus
Christ</hi> so evidently set forth, as if he was
even crucified among that people. Oh how
this also should perswade us, not only to
serve God our selves, but also to doe our
best, to perswade others to spend time in
Gods service; especially, if we remember
the Doctrine, which is the ground of this
whole discourse, namely this, that time spent
in the duties of Gods service, is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and incomparably the best spent time:
then certainely we would easily be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
not only to spend much time in Gods
service our selves, but also earnestly to doe
our best endeavour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to cause others to doe
the like, especially <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
