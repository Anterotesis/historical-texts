            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

(which we hear are coming forth) they

and seasonableness of the subject, we
cannot imagine but that they will be much
valued when they come abroad; seeing they
are not only his last words, but in that they
present to all men such a pattern of peace, as

               <hi>the God of peace,</hi> and the necessity of <hi>fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

God. We need not mention the vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt hearing and reading, or the

neither how neatly they might have
been cloathed if sent abroad by the <hi>Author;</hi>
all that we shall say, is, thou hast them in such

               <bibl>Heb. 13. 20, 21.</bibl>
               <q>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep,
through the bloud of the everlasting Covenant, make
you perfect in every good work to do his will, working
in you that which is wel-pleasing in his sight, through
Jesus Christ: To whom be glory for ever and ever.
Amen.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T would give light to these words, if
you consider the scope and design of
the Apostle in this Epistle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi>
the sum of which is, He writes
to them, that he might animate their
spirits against <hi>Apostacy from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel;</hi> they were liable to this upon a
double account: (1) Partly in respect of those <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions</hi>
to which they were exposed; for the <hi>Jews</hi>
were filled with a bruitish zeal for the Ceremonies of
the Levitical Law, and exprest the greatest rancour
against those, who left <hi>Moses</hi> to follow <hi>Christ.</hi> This
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103269:4"/>
is the Reason why the Apostle lays down so many
preservatives against their revolting from Religion;
and he spends one part of this Epistle in a most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
exhortation to perseverance, and doth in the
tenth Chapter insinuate himself into them; You
have already tasted the first-fruits of affliction, <hi>vers.</hi>
34. <hi>You took joyfully the spoyling of your goods, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in your selves, that you have in Heaven a better,
and an enduring substance.</hi> This is that temper that
Martyrs have exprest, who have not only parted
with their <hi>goods,</hi> but with their <hi>lives</hi> for the Gospel:
When they came to the Stake, they would not so
much as shed a tear to quench those flames, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they should ascend to God as in a fiery Chariot,
<hi>You took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing
in your selves, that you have a better and an endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
substance.</hi> Thus he insinuates himself, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
what they had done, to encourage
them to perseverance; and partly he fortifies them
against <hi>Back-sliding,</hi> by those terrible judgments
which he threatned against <hi>Revolters,</hi> as you may
read, <hi>chap.</hi> 6, <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. (2) As they were liable to this
Apostacy upon the account of <hi>Persecution,</hi> so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the account of the unsettledness and instability
of their own spirits. There were several of those
who had given up their names to Christ, who did
compare the Ceremonies of the Law with the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Gospel: Now the Apostle, to secure them
from this mixture, his great design is to represent
the vanity and infectiveness of all the Ceremonial
Law, and to express and prove the vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of the Lord Jesus his death, which was the
substance of all the shadows. And this takes up one
great part of his discourse with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103269:4"/>
Now in these two verses he sums up, by way of
Recapitulation, all that which he had discoursed
of at large; and in them you may observe these two
things:
<list>
                  <item>(1) A Description of God, to whom he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
this prayer.</item>
                  <item>(2) The Substance of the prayer it self.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Description</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that he amplifies by
these two things: (1) From the Attributes and
Qualities of God, (if I may so express it) <hi>Now</hi> (saith
he) <hi>the God of peace.</hi> (2) From the effects of his
power and love, <hi>That brought again from the dead
our Lord Jesus, that great Shepheard of the Sheep.</hi>
And these Titles, they are not here set down to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
his discourse, meerly as an ornament, but
they have all a peculiar efficacy, as to the obtaining
of the request which here he makes for them.</p>
            <p>I shall begin with the first, the <hi>Description of
God,</hi> from that Attribute. <hi>(Now the God of peace)</hi>
The Title that is used in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is this, <hi>[The Lord of Hosts]</hi> but in the <hi>New</hi>
he is called, <hi>The God of peace.</hi> There were darker
representations of the mercy and love of God then,
the more ful discoveries of his grace were reserved
til the coming of Christ: Their discoveries under
the Old Testament were but as the <hi>Day-star,</hi> which
usher'd in the <hi>Sun of Righteousness.</hi> Now this Title
of the <hi>God of peace</hi> imparts two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1) That he is the <hi>Author of peace,</hi> and
works it.</item>
               <item>(2) That he <hi>loves</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> in peace.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, That he is the Author of it: And if you
consider <hi>Peace</hi> in all its notions and kinds, it is a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103269:5"/>
fruit of God, and that which descends from him.
(1) <hi>Peace in Nature</hi> is the harmony that is between
all the parts of the world, the union that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the dis-agreeing Elements, this is from God;
for without him, the whole Creation would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
disband, and return to its first Chaos of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.
(2) <hi>Civil Peace,</hi> which is among the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties
of men; that which is so amiable and lovely,
and which needs no other foil to commend it, and
set off its lustre, than the miseries of War; this Peace
comes from God also: When there is a subjection
to just Laws, this is from God. Every rash hand is
able to make a wound, or cast a fire-brand; but it
is only the <hi>God of Peace</hi> that is able to heal breaches,
to allay those storms that are in a Nation. You
know, those showers which render the earth fruitful,
descend from Heaven, from God; so all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of peace descend from above: The fiery exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
ascend from the earth, counsels of war and
disturbance proceed from the devilish hearts
of men. Or (3) If you consider that <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Peace,</hi> which is in the spirits of men, <hi>i. e.</hi> when
the understanding exercises a coercion and restraint
over our licentious appetites, when all our inferior
Faculties are under the Empire and conduct of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
this proceeds also from God: For, since the fall,
there is a great deal of tumult, many riots and
disorders in the soul of a man. <hi>Reason</hi> hates a bad
<hi>Guide;</hi> and our <hi>Appetites,</hi> those are <hi>evil instruments,</hi>
and do many times hurry Reason from its regular
actings. But (4) much more, if you consider <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
peace,</hi> that peace doth not only import an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a man within himself, but the agreement of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103269:5"/>
the Soul with God. This is the fruit of the Spirit;
and it is onely God that is able to convey this peace
to us. And upon a particular account this Title is
given to him, by way of eminency and propriety;
as,</p>
            <p>(1) He is alone able to allow and dispence this
peace to us; for, all our sins are injuries committed
against him, against his Crown and Dignity; all the
Arrests of Conscience are made in the name of God,
and therefore it is only he that can speak peace. As
in the <hi>Civil State,</hi> it is an Act of Supremacy to give
a pardon; only he that can condemn is able to speak
a pardon, so, it is that God that is our Judge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
and incensed by us, he that hath a judicial
power to cast body and soul into hell-fire, is alone
able to speak peace, and pass a Pardon for us in the
Court of Heaven: and this is experienced by a
wounded spirit; it is just with such a person as it is
with a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> who stands condemned at the
Bar, he cannot receive encouragement from any of
his Spectators, til the <hi>Judge</hi> speak peace to him:
So, if an Angel from heaven should come and speak
to a wounded Spirit, it were impossible, unless God
did order, command, and dispence it, that the spirit
should receive any peace, because our sins are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
committed against him.</p>
            <p>(2) He is alone able to reveal and discover it.
There is nothing harder in the world, than to calm
and quiet a disturbed conscience, it must be the same
power that makes light to spring out of darkness, that
must cause a cheerful serenity in a dark and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate
soul. I know there is nothing more easie than
that <hi>false peace</hi> which is so universal in the world;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103269:6"/>
for the most amongst us cheat themselves with <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,</hi>
instead of <hi>peace with God,</hi> and <hi>security</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of <hi>peace with conscience:</hi> but that peace which
is solid and true can only be revealed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
We have an instance of this in <hi>David, (Psal.</hi>
51) although <hi>Nathan</hi> had told him from God, <hi>Thy
sin is pardoned;</hi> yet notwithstanding he saith, <hi>Make
thou me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which
thou hast broken may rejoyce.</hi> He stil addresses him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to God, that he would cause him to hear the
voice of pardon and reconciliation, for his soul could
not be quiet by the voice of the Prophet. There
is so much infidelity in the soul of a man, that
when he comes to take a view of his sins in all their
bloudy aggravations, only the Spirit of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
is able to allay the terrors of the conscience:
And this he doth by an overpowering light, when
he doth in an imperative and commanding manner
silence all the doubts of the soul, and establish it
in peace with God. Certainly he that shall but
consider the terrors, the faintings, the paleness of
a wounded conscience, when you shall see a person
dis-relish all the things of the world upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<hi>Fearing lest God is his enemy;</hi> when all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
that are addressed to him are ineffectual,
and but like warm cloath to a dead carcase, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
inspire any heat into him. Oh! this shews, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God is able to reveal peace. So <hi>Job, If he hide
his face, who is able to be at peace?</hi> There needs no
other fury to complete the misery of a man, than
his own accusing conscienee, Conscience is a verier
<hi>devil</hi> than the devil himself, and able more to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and lash the creature. Therefore, if that be
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103269:6"/>
once awakened, 'tis only God, to whose tribunal
conscience is liable, which is able to speak peace
to the soul. Now you see in what respect this Title,
<hi>[The God of peace]</hi> is attributed to him, as he is the
<hi>Author</hi> and worker of it.</p>
            <p>2. As he loves and delights in peace. This is that
which is so pleasing to him, that he adopts those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the line of Heaven who are <hi>Peace-makers, for
they shall be called the Children of God, Mat.</hi> 5. 6.
This characterizes persons to be his children, to be
ally'd to him. God, he only delights in the reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>his own Image;</hi> for those things that we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in the world, and delight in, do not affect his
heart: <hi>He delights not in the strength of the horse; he
taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man. The Lord
taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
hope in his mercy.</hi> Nothing attracts his eye and
heart, but his own <hi>similitude</hi> and <hi>resemblance;</hi> and
therefore, where he sees <hi>peaceable dispositions,</hi> this
is that which indears the soul to him, and makes it
amiable in his eyes. You may judge of his <hi>delight</hi>
in peace by this, it is that grace which in an especial
manner prepares us for communion with him; for,
we can never really honour nor enjoy him, unless
we bring to him those dispositions, which (if I may
so speak) are in himself. And therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that those have little <hi>peace of conscience,</hi> who
make so little <hi>conscience of peace.</hi> You know, when
God appeared to <hi>Eliah,</hi> he did not appear in the
<hi>Storm,</hi> nor in the <hi>Fire,</hi> but in the <hi>small still voice,</hi>
and when <hi>Elisha</hi> was transported with <hi>anger,</hi> he
was fain to allay that passion by Musick, that so he
might be prepared for the holy motions of the Spirit;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103269:7"/>
he call'd for an Instrument, and then the Spirit
moved in him. I bring it for this end, to shew, how
God <hi>delights in peace,</hi> and he will only maintain
communion with those that are of calm and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
spirits. So much way as we give to rash anger,
so much proportionably do we let in the Devil,
and cast out the <hi>God of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, the reason why this Title is given to God
is upon a double account, partly with respect to
the <hi>Blood of the everlasting Covenant,</hi> which made
peace between God and us; partly with respect
to the <hi>Covenant it self,</hi> which is founded in that
Blood.</p>
            <p>(1) In respect of the <hi>Blood of the Everlasting
Covenant.</hi> For, it was the blood of Christ that hath
sprinkled Gods Throne, and made peace in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
You shall read therefore, when Christ came
into the world, 'tis said <hi>(Luke 2. 14.)</hi> that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Host appeared and sang, <hi>Glory to God in the
highest, on earth peace, &amp;c.</hi> Since the <hi>Fall,</hi> God and
man are <hi>enemies,</hi> there is a reciprocal enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and Man, God hates the Creature as
it is unholy, and man hates God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as he is just, the
avenger of sin, the Author of the Law: Now, <hi>Christ</hi>
was the <hi>Umpire</hi> that composed this difference, he
was <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in one person, and so being ally'd
to <hi>both,</hi> he was a fit person to reconcile both. He
was (as <hi>Job</hi> speaks) a <hi>Days-man</hi> between us. He
hath paid every farthing that was due: for he did
not compound with God, but paid the utmost that
was due to him. He it is that hath reconciled us to
God by the power of his Spirit, in changing and
renewing our natures and creating in us those dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103269:7"/>
which are like to God; so that his Bloud
is the foundation of this peace. And now, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to us, not as a consuming fire, but as a refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
light, full of calmness, serenety and peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us. Christ he brought more honour to God
by his obedience, than we brought dishonour by
our transgression; and therefore without any injury
to God, he might be at peace with us. You know,
all our sins were but the acts of <hi>finite creatures,</hi> and
only <hi>infinite</hi> in regard of the <hi>object</hi> against whom
they were committed. But the Bloud of Christ was of
<hi>infinite value</hi> in regard of the <hi>Subject;</hi> for, he was
God, and the inriching union of the Deity conveyed
such value and worth to his Bloud, that he was able
to appease God, and not only to free us from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
but to make us the favourites of God.
We are not only pardoned, but preferr'd upon the
account of his Bloud.</p>
            <p>(2) He is the <hi>God of peace,</hi> as with respect to
the Bloud of Christ, which is the purchase of peace;
so with respect to the <hi>Covenant</hi> which is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and us <hi>(through the bloud of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Covenant)</hi> There are three sorts of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
amongst men, some are Covenants of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>
and <hi>Amity,</hi> some are Covenants of <hi>Trade</hi> and
<hi>Commerce,</hi> and some are Covenants of <hi>Assistance</hi>
and <hi>Help.</hi> Mow all these qualifications meet in this
Covenant, which is made between God and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
It is a Covenant of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Friendship,</hi> for
now we stand upon tearms of amity with God,
<hi>Those who were strangers and enemies, are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled.</hi>
And there is between God and us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
peace, there is a League (as the Scripture
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103269:8"/>
speaks between God and the Creature. It is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of <hi>Trade,</hi> there is now a way opened to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
we may now ascend to God in duties of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and God descend to us by the excitations of
his grace, and influences of joy. And 'tis a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of <hi>assistance,</hi> for he promises not only to give
us the reward of the Covenant, but to secure unto
us the Condition; he promises to enable us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the conditions of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi>
Now upon this account, of that Covenant which
is founded in the blood of Christ, he is the <hi>God of
peace</hi> to his people.</p>
            <p>[1 <hi>Vse</hi>] Is by way of <hi>Conviction.</hi> This may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
to us how distant their temper is from God,
who are <hi>enemies to peace:</hi> We unman our selves,
we unchristian our selves, so far as we are opposite
to this blessed temper of peace. Certainly, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
water cannot make any reflection unto us
of that face that looks into it, so when our Spirits
are disturbed by animosities, exasperations heats
and divisions, 'tis impossible for us to see the Image
of God, as he is the God of peace. And certainly,
there is no more doleful consideration in the world
than this, That <hi>Man,</hi> whom God made a sociable
creature, who hath all the engagments and endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
laid upon him, which may cause him to live
in peace and gentleness towards those who are of
the same nature with him, yet that in fierceness
our heats should exceed those of the most salvage
creatures. Man comes into the world naked, and
altogether unarmed, as if he were designed for the
<hi>Picture of peace;</hi> but could you look into the
hearts of men, you would find there such tumults,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103269:8"/>
divisions, such seeds of enmity against their fellow-creatures,
that Tigres and Lions are calm and
peaceable in comparison of them. Now, how is
this distant from the temper of the <hi>God of peace?</hi>
'Tis very strange to consider, that when promises
are made to bury all differences, as rubbish under
the foundation, that nevertheless the great work
of many persons should be, only to revive those
former animosities, to make those exasperations
fresh and keen upon their own spirits: but is this
to imitate the <hi>God of Peace?</hi> These, to promote
divisions and disturbances amongst us, cloath their
enemies with the <hi>Livery</hi> of <hi>shame</hi> and <hi>reproach,</hi>
that so they may be baited by their fury; that
make it their design to represent that party, which
they think is dissonant from them, with the most
odious appearances, (you know this is the old Art)
and those <hi>showers of calumnies</hi> which are in the
world, they usually precede the <hi>storm of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
The devil was first a <hi>Liar,</hi> and then a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer;</hi>
and those who are of his seed, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his Art. In the primitive times, all the Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions
of the Heathens arose from the reproaches
of Christians; so it is now. It is an easie thing to
blast the name of those persons, who are design'd
for ruine. But if the contending Parties would
consider, (if I may call one Party <hi>contending</hi> which
is only liable to Penalties, and is resolved to bear
them patiently) how <hi>unlike</hi> this is to that <hi>God of
peace,</hi> me-thinks it should allay the rancour that
is in mens spirits, and make an attonement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
all the differences that is amongst them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103269:9"/>
(2) If only peace come from God, you may
from hence take a trial of that peace that is within
you, (for hitherto I have been only discoursing of
Civil peace) whether it be the effect of this <hi>God of
peace.</hi> I know nothing more common in the world
than <hi>presumption;</hi> there is a <hi>false peace,</hi> which doth
not arise from the <hi>knowledge of a mans happiness,</hi>
but from the <hi>ignorance of his misery:</hi> Peace, which
is only like a Torch to shine in the night, or like
<hi>Players,</hi> that glitter only by Torch-light; so is the
false peace men cherish in their bosom, meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account, because they do not bring their
souls to the light of the Word, they never had it
from this God of peace; because,</p>
            <p>(1) God never speaks peace to a soul, but in
the way of holiness and obedience: And therefore
you shall find 'tis the counsel of the Scripture, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
thy self with God, and be at peace.</hi> Our peace
is found in the way of duty: and there are none
who are more blessed with the peace of conscience,
than those who with the greatest fervour, frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and delight, maintain communion with God in
holy Duties: For, as friendship among men is che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished
and preserved by visits and conversations, so,
our peace with God is preserved by those visits we
make to Heaven in prayer.</p>
            <p>(2) That peace that comes from God, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
causes in us a war with sin; for God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with us in Offensive and Defensive, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is impossible any person should have true and
solid peace, that waking tranquility of soul,
which is the reward of holiness and obedience, that
entertains sin; for every sin thou dost wilfully
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103269:9"/>
commit, 'tis an act of hostility against God, 'tis that
which makes him thy enemy, and makes thee an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
to him. As <hi>Jehu</hi> said, <hi>What peace, so long as
the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts
are so many?</hi> So, what peace can there be,
so long as thou dost indulge thy self in sin, and
make it thy business to gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ifie thy outward senses,
though it be to the displeasure of God? 'Tis the
greatest mercy in the world to rob such persons
of their peace, and to discover to them their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
they are only capable of true peace, by the
knowledge of that which is false. Therefore bring
your selves to this trial, whether or no doth that
peace which now you please your selves in, cause
in you an eternal hatred of sin? doth it set you
at a distance from your most beloved lusts? Then
it is that peace that springs from God. The
greatest part of the world are in a state of <hi>war</hi>
with God, though they do not feel the effects of
that war. True indeed, God doth not always
draw the sword, either of Famine, Pestilence, or
War, against a Nation, and yet they may be act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a most hostile way against God: So for a
person, God may not blast thy estate, or send dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases
upon thy person, or raise a tumult in thy
conscience, and make a conspiracy of thy thoughts
and passions against thy peace: thou maist be quiet
within, and yet have war with God, because, as
in the world, there may be a <hi>Truce,</hi> when there
is no <hi>Peace,</hi> the War may still continue, though
there be a Truce between two Princes: or rather
there is not a Truce between God and the sinner,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103269:10"/>
but, as a Town that is besieged for many days, may
not feel the battery of their enemy, because he is
undermining them to blow them up at once; so
God doth not many times make his battery against
sinners, but he is undermining them, and the fall
at the last will be dreadful, if there be not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Vse</hi> 2.] By way of Exhortation; Let me press
you all to follow peace, it is a duty which the
Gospel enjoyns with the greatest vehemency, with
the greatest force of words and expressions. The
Apostle, when he is to seal up his affection to them,
he doth it with that prayer, (2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 16) <hi>Now the
God of peace himself give you peace always, by all
means:</hi> What strange expressions! First, he gives
you here the Title of <hi>the God of peace,</hi> and then
he saith, <hi>[Himself] The God of peace himself.</hi>
There's a great deal of force in that word; Peace is
so excellent a blessing, and there is such an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
in our corrupt nature to it, that it is only
the <hi>Lord himself</hi> that is able to effect it: As if the
Apostle had said, The Lord must bow the Heavens,
he must come down <hi>himself</hi> to create peace among
you; and to express the greater vehemency of his
desire, he saith, <hi>Give you peace always, by all means.</hi>
So another Scripture, pursue peace, <hi>Follow peace
with all men,</hi> a word that imports our <hi>pursuit</hi> after
it, though it <hi>run</hi> from us. This is the strain and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of the Gospel, and this becomes you as Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.
When Christ came to purchase our peace, he
came as a Lamb, an Innocent and meek creature,
<hi>Behold the Lamb</hi> of God. When the holy Spirit
descended to seal the priviledge of peace to us, he
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103269:10"/>
descended in the form of a Dove; a gaul-less crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in whom there is no rancor nor bitterness. What
a strong engagement should this be upon all of us,
to pursue and promote peace? And for your encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
consider,</p>
            <p>(1) That in the times of the Gospel all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
do as it were empty themselves into this blessing,
the blessing of peace. Thus <hi>Isa.</hi> 11. 6. you shall find
there a gracious promise, respecting the times of the
Gospel, <hi>The Wolf also shall dwell with the Lamb, and
the Leopard shall lie down with the Kid, and the Calf,
and the young Lion and the Fatling together, and a
little child shall lead them: and the Cow and the Bear
shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together,
and the Lion shall eat straw like the Oxe.</hi> That
which I observe from thence is this, that God here
promises to cause an universal peace and unity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Gospel, though it be as difficult as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the most disagreeing natures to a peaceable
cohabitation. For here the Scripture instances in
those Creatures, between which there is the most
natural, and therefore the most fierce animosities.
The Lord will reconcile men, though their differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
be never so great. What is too hard for the God
of peace to effect? Is not God of infinite power, of
infinite love? then it should quicken us to pursue
peace. (1) By prayer to him, because he is able to
effect it: certainly that God that was able to bring
Order into the World, when it was a meer lump and
mass of Confusion, is able to bring peace and to unite
our spirits. And it is observable, the greater our
differences and divisions are, the more will the power
of this God appear in reconciling them. 'Tis said in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103269:11"/>
the Psalms, that <hi>God's Throne is in darkness, i. e.</hi> His
ways of providence are very difficult for us to trace
and find out: and therefore when our Divisions are
at the highest, he is able by one word to allay the
storm. This should encourage us in prayer. This is
the course of God to glorifie himself, by putting a
stop to the greatest Troubles, when nearest to us, and
to work out one contrary by another. To give you
some Instances, that so we may encourage our Faith,
and quicken our Prayer to God for this blessing. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
how still God hath made <hi>difficulties the way for
enjoyment;</hi> for Instance, The promises that <hi>Sarah</hi>
should be the Mother of a Child; but he made way
for that by her dead womb: for all that numerous
Progeny, which like the Stars of the Sky descended
from her. That he first maimed <hi>Jacob,</hi> and then gave
him the blessing. He brought <hi>Joseph</hi> from the Prison
to a Princely Pallace. First <hi>David</hi> was harassed with
troubles, and then his head was deck'd with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Crown. So if you look into the Kingdom of
Christ, who would have thought that a few <hi>Fishermen</hi>
should have advanced the Empire of Christ in the
World; had you lived to have seen those despicable
beginnings, when a few unlearned men were the
Heraulds and Preachers of Christ, how would this
have caused you to fail and sink in your spirits?
and yet the Gospel hath been preached in all the
parts of the World, and that by a few <hi>Fishermen.</hi>
The Providences of God are like those plated Pictures
if you look one way upon them, there is the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of a Serpent; if you look on the other side,
there's the appearance of an Angel. So here, many
times God is pleased to suffer exasperations to go
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103269:11"/>
very high, that so his power may appear more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
in the composure of them. He it is that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
the faith of his people to draw water out of the
Rock, when the Fountain is dry: that makes meat
to come out of the Eater, (as in <hi>Sampson</hi>'s Riddle)
that is able to bring a peaceable harmony out of
devouring differences: and therefore it should quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our prayers to him.</p>
            <p>(2) To make us more serious in our endeavours
after peace. Consider, what a dishonour it is to the
Gospel; that those that profess themselves Sons of
the same God, Members of the same Christ, Temples
of the same Spirit; should be at deadly jars one with
another. It is strange &amp; unnatural that <hi>Lillies</hi> should
prove thorns to one another: that those who are
<hi>Saints in pretence,</hi> should be Devils in practice to one
another: that Gods Diamonds should cut one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
this is very strange, yet thus it is. But how espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
it is most sad, when <hi>Religion</hi> which should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain
and bridle our passions, is made fuel and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of them: How far distant is it from the counsel
af the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10. where he speaks concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their lesser differences, <hi>One values one day above
another, another esteems every day alike,</hi> what's his
counsel? he speaks as a person that was fill'd with
bowels and compassion: Oh, saith he, let not him
that doth not esteem the day judge him that doth;
<hi>For we shall all stand before the judgment-seat
of Christ,</hi> there we shall appear all upon a level,
stand upon equal ground, and receive our final
doom from him: This therefore should calm our
spirits. Why may there not be some differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>judgment,</hi> without division in <hi>affection;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:103269:12"/>
for it is as impossible that all judgments should be
of the same extent, as all our faces to be of the same
colour and figure. Therefore consider what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
it is to our profession, how doth it obscure the
the glory of God, and lustre of our Religion?</p>
            <p>(3) Doth not the <hi>publick enemy</hi> rejoyce over
us, I mean the <hi>Papists?</hi> do they not warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
at the sparks of our divisions: for you know
the old Maxim of <hi>Divide and Reign:</hi> Therefore it
should compose our spirits, and quicken us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
after union. <hi>Unmortifi'd lusts</hi> are thence,
whence all Wars and enmities springs in the world.
The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he would compose their
differences, he doth not lay down Rules to decide
their coutroversies, but corrects their secret passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
pride, self-seeking, revenge, &amp;c. this being
the seed of all disturbances in the Church: And
although these lusts may not be conspicuous and
visible to the eyes of men, yet they are certainly the
fuel of our distempers.</p>
            <p>The sum of all is this; Those that have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, they cannot but mourn and be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of these divisions. I know a great part among
us are unconcern'd: some rejoyce, those that are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buried in the affairs of the world and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
with much business, or those that are steeped
in the pleasures of sense, are altogether unaffected
with these things, and stand as <hi>Newters,</hi> dis-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding
all events: But the Saints of God cannot
but mourn over them, when our divisions hinder
the progress of the Gospel, and are serviceable to
nothing but to the Kingdom of darkness. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I beseech you, let what hath been spoken
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103269:12"/>
quicken you in your prayers to God, to <hi>pray for
the peace of Jerusalem,</hi> (that's the least effect of
our love and desires after peace) and by all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to labour to bring back peace to us, that we
may see that <hi>Prophesie</hi> fulfilled in our time, that
<hi>the Lord shall be one, and his Name one amongst us.</hi>

            <p>THe Apostle describes God by the <hi>effects of his
power and love, [That brought again from the
dead our Lord Jesus]</hi> The Resurrection of Christ
from the dead is one of the most transcendent testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of God's <hi>love</hi> and <hi>power</hi> towards us.</p>
            <p>(1) Of his Love; because as the <hi>Anger</hi> of God
was that which crucifi'd our Saviour, so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
it must be his <hi>Love</hi> that should raise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
him. Christ, when he died, he looked upon
God as an Enemy, as a Judge, and as those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
which we see conveyed to us are answerable
to the Medium through which we see them; as,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103269:13"/>
if we look through a coloured glass, we see the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of that colour: So the Lord Jesus, when he was
upon the Cross, looked upon God through the black
cloud of our sins, and through the red cloud of his
Father's wrath, and so died as a sacrifice to Divine
Justice. But when he was raised from the grave,
that was the testimony of God's love to him, and of
his love to us; for he died as our <hi>Surety,</hi> he was <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested</hi>
for our <hi>debt,</hi> he was cast into the <hi>Grave</hi> as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Prison:</hi> But by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> he was redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from Prison and Judgment. And therefore you
shall find, when Christ was risen, he salutes his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
with this, <hi>Peace be unto you, (Luk.</hi> 24. 31.)
There was the dawning of peace at the <hi>Incarnation</hi>
of Christ, for then the Angels sung, <hi>Peace upon earth;</hi>
but the compleat Sun-shine of peace was at his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi>
when he had made full and compleat sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to God's Justice; for this was a clearing of
him before all the world, when God rais'd him
from the grave. And in this respect it was very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
for the Apostle to say, <hi>The God of Peace,
that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2) It was the effect of <hi>Infinite Power.</hi> You know,
'tis naturally impossible for a dead body to quicken
it self, to revive; but for the Lord Jesus, who had
the load of the sins of all the Elect upon him, who
was, as it were, secured in the grave by God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Power, for him to rise again: This must be
an effect of <hi>Infinite Power</hi> in the great God. This
raising of Christ, sometimes 'tis attributed to the <hi>Son,</hi>
being <hi>God</hi> equal with the Father; but here 'tis attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to <hi>God:</hi> And therefore, when the Scripture
would speak with the greatest magnificence of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103269:13"/>
the <hi>Power of God,</hi> it expresses it thus, <hi>That Power
which raised Jesus Christ from the dead.</hi> When Christ
wrought deliverance for the lost world, (all those
who were committed to his charge) This could be
no less than the work of an Infinite Power. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this account also it is very proportionable to
the design of the Apostle; for that Prayer he makes
to God is for that, which only can be accomplished
by <hi>Infinite Love,</hi> and <hi>infinite Power, i. e.</hi> to make
the Christian <hi>Hebrews perfect in every good work to
do his will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come to a further description. <hi>He that brought
again from the dead [our Lord Jesus.]</hi> The Title of
the <hi>Lord Jesus</hi> was only given to our Saviour <hi>after</hi>
his Resurrection; he was called <hi>Lord</hi> before, and
<hi>Jesus</hi> before; but these two Titles were never uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
til after his resurrection; <hi>They came to see the
place where the body of the Lord Jesus lay;</hi> the reason
was this, Because the Resurrection of Christ was a
solemn Proclamation to the world, that <hi>Christ</hi> was
the <hi>Son of God;</hi> 'tis true, this Title was given him
immediately upon his Conception, but it was never
compleatly declared to the world, til after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection;
for before, Christ was a <hi>Prince in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise,</hi>
the beams of his <hi>Divinity</hi> was abated by the
vail of his <hi>Humanity;</hi> but then he was declared by
power to be the Son of God.</p>
            <p>It follows. <hi>[That great Shepheard of the Sheep.]</hi>
For the opening of this,
<list>
                  <item>(1) We will consider this Title of Christ.</item>
                  <item>(2) The person for whom this Title relates.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, This Title, <hi>[The great Shepheard]</hi> 'Tis a
wonderful condescention in Christ, that he will take
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103269:14"/>
upon him the Title of a <hi>Shepheard,</hi> that which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expresses <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> than <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion;</hi>
yet he is pleased to assume this Title to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
his affection to us. For the opening of it,
wherein he appears to be the <hi>great Shepheard,</hi> I shall
lay down these particulars.</p>
            <p>(1) He is <hi>great</hi> in the <hi>Dignity of his Person;</hi> for
he that is Lord of Angels, is become the <hi>Shepheard
of the sheep;</hi> and the <hi>humiliation of his Person</hi> in this
respect, is the <hi>exaltation of his Office:</hi> It is looked
upon in the world as a mean and low employment,
to have the care and inspection of a Flock; but now
herein appears the love of Christ, he was pleased
to become our <hi>Shepheard,</hi> that so he might secure
and bring us to the Fold of Heaven, and there make
us to feed upon those Pastures, and to drink of
those Rivers of pleasure which flow from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God.</p>
            <p>(2) In the <hi>derivation of his Authority;</hi> that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which is communicated to him, whereby
he is our Shepheard, and that is originally from
God himself; it is not by any mediate deputation,
but from God himself. He is our Shepheard, and
hath a Title to his Flock upon a double account:
(1) They are committed to him as his <hi>Charge</hi> and
custody, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) All the Elect of the
World were given by God the Father to Christ, not
by way of <hi>Alienation,</hi> but by way of <hi>Opigneration,</hi>
as so many pledges which he was to bring to grace
and glory; and this Charge he doth most fully
execute, for there is none missing of those commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him. (2) They are given to him by way
of <hi>Reward</hi> and Recompence, for all his Blood
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103269:14"/>
and Sufferings, <hi>(Isa.</hi> 53. 10.) The Lord Jesus put
such a value on souls, that he purchased an interest
in them by his own blood; and he thinks himself
exceedingly recompenced for all his Pains on the
Cross, Agonies in the Garden, Temptations in the
Wilderness, &amp;c. if souls will submit to his care.
And here observe the course of Heaven, God
would endear souls to Christ upon all reasons, by
vertue of his command, and that charge he gives to
them, and by vertue of his own purchase.</p>
            <p>(3) If you consider the <hi>extent</hi> of his <hi>care</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
for all the Saints of the world, those who
are dispersed in all places, in all Ages, they are all
his Flock; and therefore 'tis the Royalty of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration,
<hi>(Joh.</hi> 10, 16.) <hi>There shall be one Fold,
and one Shepheard.</hi> As Christ is the only <hi>Catholick
King,</hi> so he is the only <hi>Universal Bishop;</hi> for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shepheards have but particular portions of his
Flock committed to their charge; and they should
be such portions as they have <hi>regard to,</hi> and <hi>are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their inspection.</hi> And at the last day, all his
sheep shall congregate together, and stand at his
right hand. All the Saints of God that are now
scattered, as so many Stars in the Firmament, shall
be united in one Constellation, when they shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in glory before him.</p>
            <p>(4) In respect of his endowments and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
which fit him for the discharge of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And</p>
            <p>(1) Take notice of his affection and love to us,
and that is the wonder of heaven and earth, <hi>Christ
laid down his life for his sheep, (Joh</hi> 10. 11.) This
is strange, that Christ should be a <hi>sheep for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103269:15"/>
slaughter,</hi> that he might become our Shepheard; that
he should be a Sacrifice, before he could take this
office upon him: Other Sheep lay down their lives
for the Shepheard, but Christ laid down his life for
the Sheep. So great was his love, that it brought him
from Heaven to <hi>seek and find those that were lost;</hi> he
left a <hi>Palace</hi> to come to a <hi>Wilderness;</hi> a Throne of
Heaven, to come to a Fold here upon Earth. We
read of <hi>David,</hi> that he exchanged a <hi>Sheep-hook</hi> for a
<hi>Scepter;</hi> but Christ quite contrary, he chang'd a
<hi>Scepter</hi> for the <hi>Rod and Staff of a Shepheard.</hi> It was
said by one, There is nothing so conspicuous in Christ
as the <hi>prodigality of his love</hi> to us. Oh! do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<hi>how great love</hi> that was, that sbould make him
to die for us, that he might bring us home to his
Fold. We were all of us like <hi>erring Sheep,</hi> who had
straid from him, and fell to the <hi>Lord of the soil</hi> as
strange Cattel: we were gotten into the possession
of <hi>the god of this world;</hi> the Lord Christ would buy
us off from thence: though we forfeited our <hi>right in
him,</hi> yet he would not lose <hi>his right in us,</hi> but he
laid down his life that he might reduce us to his
Fold; that of <hi>Wolves</hi> he might make us <hi>Lambs,</hi> and
fit us for the comforts of his presence.</p>
            <p>(2) In respect of his <hi>exact diligence</hi> and <hi>inspection
over them:</hi> When but one sheep went astray from
his Fold, we read, he left the ninety and nine, and
went and sought for that <hi>One, Luk.</hi> 15. where we
have that Parable, to express the diligence and
watchfulness of Christ over his sheep. There is no
person, be he never so mean, never so obscure, though
lost in the number and account of the world, if he be
one of Christ's sheep, he is always under his inspection
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103269:15"/>
and watchfulness. We read of the <hi>High-Priest,</hi> that he
carried the names of the <hi>Tribes</hi> upon his <hi>Breast-plate,</hi>
the Lord Christ carries the names of all his sheep in his
<hi>Heart;</hi> therefore, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. speaking concerning the
Saints, all that dwel upon earth, <hi>whose names are writ
in the book of life.</hi> His diligence and care is so exact,
that he hath all their names writ in his Book: He that
tels the stars, counts their hairs, and alwaies exercises
the most watchfull providence over them for good.
You know sheep are either liable to <hi>rage,</hi> or <hi>erring</hi>
and <hi>wandring;</hi> Christ's diligence is such, that he
protects them from the rage of Satan, reduces them
from all their wandring, and brings them home to
himself.</p>
            <p>(3) <hi>In making proportionable all tbeir services and
sufferings to those degrees of strength which he gives to
them,</hi> Isa. 40. 11. <hi>He shall feed his flock like a shepherd,
he shall gather the lambs with his arms, and carry them
in his bosom, and shall gently lead those that are with
young.</hi> Christ alwaies makes a proportion between
the services, sufferings and strength he cals them to.
He it is that with that tenderness speaks to <hi>Peter, Peter
lovest thou me? feed my lambs.</hi> He hath provided for
them the most ample &amp; most satisfying nourishment,
the Ordinances of the Gospel, the Word, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
which are the Breasts of Consolation; these
are all provided by him for his People. And in this
respect he is the great Shepherd, for he doth not
onely allow them means, but blesses the means to
them: he is able to enlighten the dark mind, and he
can make pliable the stubborn will, and he can spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallize
drossie affections, which all other shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
in the world are not able to effect.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103269:16"/>
(4) He is the great Shepheard, if you consider his
<hi>power to preserve them from danger;</hi> not only those
dangers which respect Satan, (for that fell under his
care before) but those diseases to which they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
which threaten ruine: Other Shepheards pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
may cure diseases, but not defend them from
danger. Christ it is that <hi>gives eternal life to his sheep,</hi>
he begins the <hi>life of holiness,</hi> which though at present
is but as a spark in the Sea, yet he keeps it alive till
it shall break forth into a triumphant flame. That
<hi>life</hi> that is encompassed with so many enemies, and
liable to so many weaknesses, the Lord Jesus will
<hi>bring forth judgment to victory,</hi> and will make them
to be powerful over spiritual and eternal enemies.</p>
            <p>The sum is this: The Lord Christ is so perfect a
Shepheard, so complete, as to all the qualifications
of that office, that the Prophet <hi>David</hi> breaks forth
into exultation, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 23.) <hi>The Lord is my Shepheard,
&amp;c.</hi> and then afterwards expresses all those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
which are made for him by God as a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
<hi>He makes me to lie down in green Pastures, he
leadeth me beside the still waters.</hi> So that you see,
Christ, whether for diligence, love, tenderness, for
preserving us from danger, for securing us to life
eternal, he is only the <hi>great Shepheard;</hi> he is the God
of shepheards, as well as the God of sheep, and all
other shepheards are but inferior to him, and must
be accountable to him for the souls of his sheep, which
are more valuable than all the world.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>The great Shepheard [of the sheep.]</hi> I shall
not spend any time in making any resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the people of God and the sheep: only,</p>
            <p>(1) They are sheep in respect of their <hi>Innocency.</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103269:16"/>
You know, of all creatures the sheep are unarmed;
other creatures, either they are armed with strength,
or skin, or swiftness, to guard themselves, and offend
others; but the sheep hath neither the strength of the
<hi>Lion,</hi> the craft of the <hi>Fox,</hi> swiftness of the <hi>Deer,</hi> and
of all creatures is most weak, inoffensive, and most li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>) where speaking concerning the times

               </gap> saith, <hi>The Lamb shall lie down with the</hi>

               </gap>, where the <hi>Prophet</hi> expresses their <hi>safety,</hi>
there he expresses their <hi>innocency</hi> and <hi>meekness.</hi> This
is the reason why the <hi>Prophet</hi> saith, <hi>For thy sake we
are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep
for the slaughter:</hi> because of all creatures most liable
to injuries, that which doth least resent them: And,
where ever the grace of Christ comes, it sweetens the
most cruel nature, and polishes the most rough dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
&amp; makes them to be like <hi>Christ, meek &amp; lowly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. In regard of their <hi>profitableness;</hi> for of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they are most profitable, the food, as to their
flesh, the cloth, as to their fleece. And the people of
God, however they are exposed to the contempts and
injuries of the world, they are the most <hi>profitable,</hi> for,
were it not for them, the whole frame of Nature
would fall into pieces, the Stars would fall like leaves
in Autumn, and all the Elements would fall into
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103269:17"/>
confusion; we see it by one <hi>Lot,</hi> who kept showers
of fire &amp; brimstone from falling on <hi>Sodom</hi> til he was
got out of it. And it is the people of God, for whom
this frame of nature is continued, &amp; when they are
brought into the fold of Christ, the Justice of God
will have a solemn triumph over all the world.</p>
            <p>(4) As they are liable to <hi>wandring:</hi> Sheep are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
creatures, and when strayed, not able to reduce
themselves. And in this respect the people of God
are sheep, they have a thousand allurements to draw
them from the ways of God; and if God should not
guide them by his eye, 'tis impossible they should go
in the way that leads to heaven. Therefore <hi>David</hi>
saith, <hi>I have gone astray like a lost sheep, seek thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
Psal.</hi> 119. 176. This shall suffice to make the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
&amp; Resemblance of the people of God &amp; sheep.</p>
            <p>The second Argument is this, That he hath design'd
Christ to be the Shepheard of the Church, <hi>The great
Shepheard of the sheep;</hi> this is another Argument and
evidence that he is reconciled to us, &amp; that he is the
<hi>God of peace:</hi> For when God gave Christ to be our
Sacrifice, &amp; raised him up to be our Shepheard, these
are the most clear testimonies of his love: For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
Christ now sits in heaven, and <hi>all the Angels of
God worship him,</hi> yet he doth not disdain to exercise
the same care, and to express the same love to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that he did when he was upon earth. All the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Christ express Gods love to us, for he feeds us
as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> died for us as a <hi>Priest,</hi> governs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
us as he is <hi>King;</hi> and all these meet together
in this Title, feeding of us, dying for us, defending
of us; as he was <hi>God</hi> he loved us, as he was <hi>Man</hi>
he died for us. This doth express the effects of his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103269:17"/>
two Natures in this Title, and therefore an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evidence that God is at peace with us.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>[Through the bloud of the everlasting
Covenant.]</hi> The bloud of Christ is that which cements
God and us together: For you must remember, our
<hi>original peace</hi> with God was broken, that peace we
have with him now is called <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> it is as
a broken bone, which, well set, is stronger than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
because nature conveys most liberal supplies to
the weakest part: so now, being reconciled to God
through the bloud of his Son, we stand upon surer
terms with him than we did in Innocency: The <hi>blood
of Christ</hi> speaks better things for us, than all our <hi>sins</hi>
speak against us, it speaks peace to our souls, and
that in heaven purchased by his death. Christ died
as a <hi>Testator,</hi> and bequeathed to the Church a <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of peace;</hi> he lives as the <hi>Executor</hi> of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and now in heaven conveys to us that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of peace, which he bequeath'd in his death. And
as our peace was founded in his <hi>Blood,</hi> so it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
by his <hi>Intercession;</hi> he appears in the Court
of Heaven as our Embassador, to make up all those
differences which fall out between God and us:
for you know, Amity and Friendship is kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Foreign <hi>States,</hi> by their Residents and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
that are kept in their several Courts; so, we
have an <hi>Agent</hi> in the Court of Heaven, the Lord
Jesus Christ, that was raised from the dead: And,
as a Believer falls into sin, which is a breach of peace
between God and us, so that peace is made up
by the Exercise of Repentance on our part, and
by sprinkling of Christ's blood upon us on Gods
part. The renewed exercise of Repentance,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103269:18"/>
and application of Christ's blood, preserves that
peace that is between God and Believers. And (to
sum up the force of the Argument) when we had
fallen from God, and it did not consist with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of God to make peace with us without satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
then was he pleased to pay our Ransom out
of his own Treasury, and redeem us by the blood
of his Son, so that all his Attributes might shine
forth in their lustre, and glory in our Salvation, and
that upon sure terms we might be able to challenge
an interest in his favour and love.</p>
            <p>It follows, <hi>Through the blood of the [Everlasting
Covenant.]</hi> Its call'd an <hi>Everlasting Covenant</hi> in two
respects.</p>
            <p>(1) In opposition to the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> which
was made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency; but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which secures to us the reward of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> did not secure to us the Condition that was
<hi>perfect obedience:</hi> And in reference to this Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
sometimes the <hi>Gospel</hi> is called a <hi>New Covenant,</hi>
sometimes a <hi>Better Covenant,</hi> because it supplies all
weakness in the first Covenant; not as if the Law of
God was weak or faulty in respect of it self, for the
Law is <hi>holy, just and good,</hi> but weak in respect of us;
for it is impossible that <hi>that Covenant,</hi> by the breach
of which sin and death came into us, should reconcile
us to God, and appease his anger; and therefore God
contrived another Covenant for us, a Covenant in
the Gospel, that was made with us in <hi>Christ,</hi> and this
is called an <hi>Everlasting Covenant,</hi> because it remains
for ever, the tenor of it shall not be chang'd; for, the
first Covenant is only abrogated &amp; made null, while
frustrated as to the intent it was first given.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:103269:18"/>
(2) Its call'd an <hi>everlasting Covenant,</hi> as it brings to
those that are parties in it an everlasting glory: So
the Lord Jesus his blood is called an <hi>everlasting Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
for it ransoms the souls of men from that
<hi>eternal death</hi> to which they were liable, and gives
them a title to <hi>everlasting life;</hi> for this Covenant
which now God hath made with us, it not only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
the <hi>Reward,</hi> but the <hi>Conditions</hi> to which the
reward is made; for God saith, <hi>I will plant my fear
in your hearts, that you shall not depart from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now gone over the Title, and that in order
to the Prayer, which follows, <hi>[Make you perfect to do
his will, working in you that which is well pleasing in
his sight,]</hi> the general sum of it is this, That God of
peace, who is reconciled to us in his Son, as he is the
<hi>Father of mercies</hi> to us, so he is the <hi>fountain of holiness</hi>
to us; and in this respect we can only expect from
him the <hi>treasures of grace,</hi> as he is the <hi>God of peace,</hi>
for God, as he is our <hi>Judge,</hi> dispences to sinners no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but revenge; there is nothing to be expected
but the curse of his Law, the execution of that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death from him. For although the world
despise holiness as a base &amp; contemptible thing, they
had rather be <hi>ungracious</hi> than <hi>inglorious</hi> in the eys
of men, and upon this account they are affraid to be
<hi>holy,</hi> least they should be the publick scorn &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the place wherein they live: although ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
is of so low a price in the world, yet in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
next to God, Christ, and the Spirit, Holiness is
the most rich Jewel, <hi>That,</hi> God can bestow upon us,
and therefore we must first look upon him as the <hi>God
of peace,</hi> before we can beg any grace from him. And
this is the reason why the Apostle represents God
