         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
VINDICATION
OF
SEVERAL PERSONS
Committed Priſoners to the TOWER, GATE-HOUSE, and other Priſons of this Nation;
Publickly reproached, as Actors or Contrivers of ſome horrid Plot.</head>
            <head type="sub">Publiſhed by PETER GOODMAN, who continues a Viſitor of Priſoners, Encouraged by this following Warrant;
<q>
                  <bibl>Prov. 31. 8.</bibl>
                  <hi>Open thy Mouth for the Dumb in the Cauſe of all ſuch as are appointed to Deſtruction.</hi>

               <lb/>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Find that the Perſons Impriſoned, having in all faithfulneſs publickly manifeſted their Peaceable Demeanors,
were (ſome of them) formerly, notwithſtanding his Majeſties gracious Letter from <hi>Breda,</hi> and the Act for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity,</hi>
upon falſe Informations, without ſeeing Accuſer or Accuſation, impriſoned in the <hi>Tower</hi> and elſewhere,
their Houſes, as hoſtile Enemies, by Souldiers (without Warrants) ſearched and diſarmed; but after very long
and chargeable Reſtraints, were thereof diſcharged: And whenas they, according to Juſtice, might have expected
Satisfaction for the Loſs of Goods and wrongful Impriſonment, from thoſe who were the Authors and occaſion
thereof, the Parliament was pleaſed (in one Clauſe, inſerted in an Act, Intituled, <hi>An Act declaring the Sole
Right of the Militia to be in the King</hi>) to Indempnifie and ſave harmleſs all ſuch perſons, as having acted for
the Service of his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <label>II.</label>
               <lb/>That the aforeſaid Perſons, hoping for the future not to have heard of any more Names or Terms of Diſtinction,
but expecting Protection equal with others, did again apply themſelves to their ſeveral Callings and Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
for ſupport to them and their Families, believing their Concernments ſo wrapt up in the General Act of <hi>Indemnity,</hi> as not to be
Diſarmed, Reproached, or Impriſoned, upon any pretence, hwo ſpecious ſoever; which nevertheleſs is now their Portion, when thoſe of the
<hi>Popiſh Religion,</hi> who have neither the Law, as to wearing Arms, nor Publick Promiſes to lay claim to, yet both in their Perſons and Eſtates are
very much Indulged, whilſt others remain in loathſom Priſons; wherein alſo are many other Sufferers becauſe of Oaths, which in their original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
were to diſcover <hi>Papiſts</hi> from <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> but now, as to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are diſ-uſed, and are become a Snare to entrap all other Perſwaſions,
who in Doctrine and Diſcipline are moſt contrary to the <hi>Pope</hi> and his Adherents.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label>
               <lb/>That within the moneths of <hi>October</hi> and <hi>November</hi> laſt, many of thoſe Perſons were again taken from their ſeveral Habitations, by Purſevants
or Meſſengers, and carried to the <hi>Tower, Gatehouſe,</hi> &amp;c. (the Keepers refuſing to deliver Copies of the Cauſe of their Detainor) and not a
little wounded in their Reputations and Credits, being publickly aſperſed, as if they, amongſt others, were the Contrivers or Actors in ſome
horrid Plot, thereby rendring them and their Friends moſt odiouſly Infamous, both in City and Country; as if their Actions did occaſion the
loading the Nation with more Taxes, and continuing of Mercinary Souldiers; Whereas in truth their Demeanors have been very inoffenſive;
and for ought they, or any of their Relations yet know, they are not ſo much as accuſed of any Crime: and might they but be permitted to
ſpeak for themſelves, or to enjoy a Tryal according to the known juſt Laws of this Nation, doubt not but they would ſoon make known, and
vindicate their Innocency to all People, however at preſent by ſuch Aſperſions prejudiced againſt them in their ſuffering Conditions.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label>
               <lb/>
I alſo find, in theſe places, and in this manner, have many been continued about a quarter of a year; others, upon as ſlight pretences, have
remained above a whole year paſt: And albeit the utmoſt endeavours of their Relations have not been wanting, ſome for Ten, Eleven, and
more weeks paſt, by their humble Petitions to his Majeſty and Council, to procure their Liberties, who are not permitted Pen, Ink or Paper,
their Friends, Atturneys, Solicitors, and domeſtique Servants not ſuffered to come at them, to be directed in any manner of buſineſs: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
ſome of their Conditions, as to Maintenance, be extream ſad, who after the loſs of their Eſtates, have (many of them) by the proceedings
aforeſaid, been forced to expend within theſe Eighteen Months laſt paſt, upon Jaylors Fees, and Charges within, and to get out of Priſons,
much more Moneys, than is now left them to maintain themſelves, their Wives and Children: And further to aggravate their diſtreſſed Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
againſt the very Law of God, Nature and Nations, their Wives are denyed the ſociety of their Husbands; only ſome of them, after
chargeable Solicitations, are permitted to ſee them, which is but at certain ſeaſons, and for a ſhort time in the preſence of a Keeper; whoſe
Afflictions are rather increaſed than leſſened, to behold their Relations under ſuch cruel Reſtraints.</p>
            <p>
               <label>V.</label>
               <lb/>
This being the Truth of their ſad and diſtreſſed Caſes, I find them every way diſabled, by ſpeaking or writing, to ſpread their deplorable Caſes
before the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament, the wonted Refuge of all oppreſſed Commoners, Unleſs ſome grave Patriot, in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to his Country and Poſterity, meeting with this their <hi>Juſt Vindication,</hi> will vouchſafe, on the behalf of the Priſoners, to implore their
Relief, by ſetting them at Liberty, without paying Fees or Chamber-Rent, repairing them for Loſſes and Dammages ſuſtained, and make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
to prevent ſuch hard uſage and Arbitrary Proceedings for the future, That ſo Innocent People may not be thus hurried from Priſon to
Priſon, but may enjoy Protection to live peaceably in the Land of their Nativity: Or, if after this long Impriſonment, Accuſations ſhall be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
againſt all, or any of them, That then a ſpeedy Tryal may be ordered to be had, agreeable to the known juſt Laws of this Nation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
if any of them ſhall be found guilty of any Plot, Conſpiracy, or Oath of Secreſie, againſt his Majeſties Perſon or Government, (as lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in two learned Speeches) Then let never more Credit be given to the Viſitor of Priſoners, who aims at no other advantage but the Peace
and Welfare of theſe Nations.</p>
