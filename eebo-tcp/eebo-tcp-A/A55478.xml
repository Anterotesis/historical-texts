            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
TO THE
TORIES</head>
            <p>ACcording to a late pattern,
we have dedicated also our
Poem, not to our Friends, but
Enemies, and I think I have not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Portraiture I designed to
draw of the Tories admired Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If I have mist of some particular
Works, Spots or Moles, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I durst not draw her so far to
the life for fear of her Power and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation,
else some of her grand
<hi>Heroes,</hi> and such as you <hi>Tories</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65517:3"/>
and fall down before, had been
shewn in her face, as much to the
life, as the pretended <hi>VVhiggs</hi> Heroe
most daubingly was lately aimed at,
by the Author of the <hi>Medal.</hi> But
like some pictures, I have seen, which
at a distance shew you the Faces of
Men, if looked on thorow a perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
expose to your view very
perfectly twenty more Faces of their
Relations, with in their own: This
revers'd Medal look'd on thorow
the perspective of Judgment, will to
some clear Eyes shew certain Images
plain enough to be known to the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
themselves, as Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to <hi>Persecution.</hi> Tho I am not of
Opinion that the Author of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal,</hi>
and that of <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel</hi>
is one person, since the stile and
painting is far different, and their
<hi>Satyrs,</hi> are of a different hew, the one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65517:3"/>
being a much slovenlier Beast than
the other: yet since they desire to
be thought so, let the one bear the
Reproaches of the other. I cannot
tell what immodesty the <hi>VVhiggs</hi> can
be taxed with, for the desire of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
from a Friend, more than the <hi>Tories</hi>
have shown in flattering draughts of
impudent Traytors. Nor tax us I
beseeeh you for pretending only the
publick Good, and a Veneration for
the King; as yet. You have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
those pretentions (as true as
honest) of those you call <hi>VVhiggs</hi> to be
false; and certainly a Medal of the
<hi>Tories</hi> Persecution, can be no scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to the King, nor true picture of
sedition. As for Pretences, the
<hi>VVhiggs</hi> can see as well as others, and
can as easily detect them as you, to
be gross fallacies, and that 'tis most
necessary for men in your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65517:4"/>
to pretend both: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them you could not deceive the
King, nor draw after you many of
the over zealous people, who sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
you work above ground, when
all the while you are sapping and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining
the peace of the Nation.
It is your common practise to sland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or villifie others, your gross Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
swarm in the Streets, and fly in
the Face of Magistracy it self, at such
an impudent rate as is not to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd,
in the most licentious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths,
and yet you have a
Confidence to cry out of the <hi>Whiggs</hi>
for their Clubs, whilst your damme
Bullies hector and roar in every Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fey-house.
<hi>Tories</hi> you are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who villifie the Government,
and are indeed the Reproach of it
both at home and abroad, some of
you designedly, more of you igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65517:4"/>
and foolishly. Your charges
of the <hi>VVhiggs</hi> incensing the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
to assume <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power is
most false; and we justly return that
Charge on your selves, for you have
tryed all ways imaginable, to push
on the people to a Rebellion, that
you might have a pretence to cut
their Throats, and compass your
grand design; which lies hid under
all. And when you see your Arts
fail you, and that the Loyalty of the
People, &amp; love they bear to their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
(notwithstanding your false
charge) make them stedfast, and not
to be moved with your Libels, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts,
Charges, and Reproaches,
and that you are not able to stir them
up to Rebellion, you feign plots and
devises against them, that you might
by Law cut off their heads, hang, or
draw; and with Satyrs from the most
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65517:5"/>
witty of your hirelings, sow sedition
thorow out the Nation, abusing
not only a living part of the King,
but even the King himself. And
what means this new Persecution of
Dissentors, in the midst of peace and
quiet, but another irritation if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
to some insurrection? but
for ought I can see, the Loss of
Goods, Religion, and Life it self,
will not move those you call <hi>VVhiggs</hi>
to actual Rebellion against a Prince
they love: Blame them not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if sometimes their passions
make them speak, they are Men, not
Asses; are to be led by Laws, not
driven at will and pleasure. We do
not believe that the King intends to
make use of Arbitrary Government,
and we think well of some of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
but we also certainly know
there are others, who endeavour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65517:5"/>
all they can to make their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
by unjust ways, and for Ends,
that must tend to the Ruine of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If their designs were just and
honest, would they live in so much
fear of a Parliament, when so much
the desire of the whole Nation? you
<hi>Tories</hi> think you now have the better
end of the staff, you have the Law,
you have the great ones, you have
Power, on your side; &amp; therefore may
do what you will, and abuse whom
you please, the <hi>Whiggs</hi> must not open
their mouths, and let them speak ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so reverently of the King, all is
blasphemy and canting in your Ears.
You brag of your Poets and your Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and that all the witt lies on your
side; be it so, we will not strive with
you about it, vve pretend to honesty
and justice, that shall make amends
for our ill Language and Verses. But if
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65517:6"/>
as the Author of the <hi>Medal</hi> says, his
own verses vvere turn'd against him,
and as he vvas made to satyrize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
it shevvs there vvas some skill to
beat him with his own vveapon; &amp; it
shews success in the Camp, when the
Enemies Guns are taken and turn'd
against themselves. And truly here
vve have but turn'd the <hi>Medal,</hi> to
shevv you the Picture of your selves,
vvithout stealing, or making any use
of your Rhimes or Railings. If it does
not please you I am not at all solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
for I am also of the Humor of
your Poet, &amp; as careless as he, vvhat
any of the Factious party says of me
&amp; have (I think) more reason to trust
to the goodness of my Cause.</p>

               <l>Small force will serve upon the stronger side:</l>
               <l>Power serves for Law, the wrong too oft's made right;</l>

               <l>When the Tide turn'd, then strait about he veers,</l>
               <l>And far the stronger side he still appears.</l>
               <l>Then in Heroicks Courts the great, and high,</l>

               <l>What ere these Men pretend, the jugling feat</l>
