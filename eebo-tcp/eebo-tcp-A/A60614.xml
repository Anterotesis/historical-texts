            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>
               </hi> Would willingly meet so much Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Ingenuity from thee, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, while I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that I propound to my self these two Designs in Publishing these Papers: First, That (by
<pb facs="tcp:100252:3"/>
the former part of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) I might contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the restoring the lost Principles and Practices of <hi>Christian Righteousness</hi>; &amp; free the Notion of it from such Prejudices and Misprisions which some mens Doctrines, and manner of Preaching the Gospel, have brought upon it. And that the Scandalous Distinction (which the world have had too just a temptation to make, by the observation of some Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors Actions) between Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Civil Honesty, Piety, and Obedience, might for ever be removed and forgotten; and that all persons designing to be
<pb facs="tcp:100252:3"/>
Religious, and that do not fully understand their indispensable obligation to the performance of every part of that Justice in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Salvation, might be delivered from the Ignorance of so considerable a part of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and their Duty to God. For it is too notorious, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny earnest Pretenders to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (by being so especially and continually called upon by their Teachers, to be righteous by the Person, and not the Religion of Christ, by the effects of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and not as necessarily by obedience to his Precepts) even while they presumed to engross the Vulgars belief of being the
<pb facs="tcp:100252:4"/>
only men that are Godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, have in contradiction to the very design of <hi>Christianity,</hi> &amp; to the shame of it, been grosly Vnrighteous before God and man, by being so to their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors (both civil and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick) as to Distributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, nor so careful to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the imputation of being unjust in their dealings &amp; transactions, as to Commutative. And though I have cast my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Christian Justice</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mould of a Sermon, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally preach'd, to represent the Danger of Vnjust persons; yet if any man, being convinced of the necessity <hi>of doing Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb facs="tcp:100252:4"/>
that he may be Righteous,</hi> (1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 7.) shall resolve to engage himself in that excellent part of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God; I hope I have so carefully drawn the several Lines of <hi>Evangelical Justice,</hi> that he may be sufficiently instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in that part of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which may be accounted the Vniversal Religion of the World; that is, as extensive as Gods Love to Mankind or Christ's Death for it, and by which men of every Nation, even among them that are invincibly ign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> and so not criminally Vnbelievers, (if <hi>Charity</hi> may be allowed to
<pb facs="tcp:100252:5"/>
speak her Sense) may be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Christ's sake: that is, such as <hi>fear God, and do righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>) or Justice (for they are of the same signification) <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 35. according to the light God hath given them of their Obligation to it.</p>
            <p>The next Design (in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Part of my Discourse) is to represent the Danger and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Partial and Shuffling <hi>Conformity,</hi> and to measure the Dimensions of those many wrongs that have been done to the Church of <hi>England</hi> by it, in all her concerns: and that in order to the finding out the best Expedients, how to redress them
<pb facs="tcp:100252:5"/>
And this I have done without the least uncharitable reflection upon any Man or Parties of men, unless to reprove their miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, which do so neerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the very Design of <hi>Christianity</hi> and the <hi>Churches</hi> Peace, may be so interpreted. And I find upon the most serious examination of the Affairs of the <hi>Church</hi> since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the most unpassionate observation of things which have been seen done in our time (to which a great part of this present Age can give testimony) That Ministers <hi>Puritanizing</hi> in their <hi>Congregations</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with some <hi>Forreign
<pb facs="tcp:100252:6"/>
Churches</hi> of different Models, Perswasions and Practices a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all their Obligations to do the contrary, (with considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had to our many sins for which God hath laid those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Punishments upon us) to be the Original cause of the great Evils that befel the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the days of her Late calamity, of the many present Discomforts that are now upon it, and the threatning dangers that are before it. For these men so managed their business in their <hi>Churches,</hi> that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People (many of which had honest minds, and upright de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of being good) are insensibly
<pb facs="tcp:100252:6"/>
betrayed into such a dislike of the <hi>Government, Service,</hi> and <hi>universal Constitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that they were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the least check of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to require <hi>Conformity</hi> from them, to make it the <hi>Cause</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and an <hi>eminent Act of Zeal for him,</hi> to deny all Obedience to it, if not to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the universal overthrow of all its Peace and Order. So that I am not so uncharitable as to think, that all the People that were Enemies to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> hated it because it was good and innocent, but because (through these mens either design'd project of keeping
<pb facs="tcp:100252:7"/>
them in Ignorance; or through their own Inability to instruct them better) they understood it not; and being once prejudic'd with an ill Opinion, and presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not to be Masters of so much Reason as to be able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themselves from their Mistakes, and not likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain an instruction from them, whom they were taught to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and oppose, its no wonder if they became such zealous &amp; implacable Enemies to a Church of the most Catholick and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Constitution in the World. Now the grand Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which they put into the
<pb facs="tcp:100252:7"/>
Peoples Heads, to perpetuate their enmity against the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Constitution</hi> is a Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Popery, and that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of it is to be imputed thereunto, when themselves are only guilty of it: For though the Designs of the <hi>Factious</hi> &amp; the <hi>Romanists</hi> are as distant as the two Poles, yet in this they <hi>Centre,</hi> that they aid one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the boldness of their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and allow a plausible temptation to such (who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult nothing but the Interest of an unsecure and palliated Peace, or rather to prevent
<pb facs="tcp:100252:8"/>
some little trouble of preserving the <hi>Church</hi> in its Integrity) to endeavour an universal Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Perswasions, to the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished <hi>Churches</hi> infallible fall and ruine. But concerning this and all other wrongs done by them to the <hi>Church,</hi> the Reader is refer-red to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course it self.</p>
            <p>Now if by Gods blessing I may in any measure attain both my Designs; If by the first I may fully instruct Souls to live (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:100252:8"/>
cure of the Church of <hi>England's</hi> present Distempers, I shall not much consult what Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they shall have among such as are resolv'd enemies to both, and perhaps for that reason will be so to their Faithful Monitor,</p>

Now because that every one of these should do right in his place, a civil account (at best) can advance to no other obligation, but that it is fit and worthy to be done; (too weak an Argument, to resist a Temptation from Profit, or Passion, to do the contrary;) therefore they are to be religiously instructed, (which makes this present exercise reasonable above all Apologies and Answers for the practice of former times among us, when Divines sate upon the principal Seats of Justice) I say, men are to be further instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that to do Civil Right, is, now, of Divine Obligation, and a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary condition of every mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; under Encouragements of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rewards, which no man shall lose, that brings but (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100252:13"/>
For so saith Christ (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 39.) <hi>The second is like unto it</hi> (that is) equally, and as indispensably neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbor as thy self.</hi> Now for the Measures of that Love, and (the principal design and excrcise of it).

                     </expan> tribuere</hi> (the Definition of Justice) to give to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man his Right and Due. The Offenders then against this Rule of Justice, in this strict sense, are the guilty persons in my Text, as the words before it, (and the very oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of it) doth fully evince; where the Apostle chargeth them, (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) that (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>Ye do wrong and defraud.</hi> And thence infers, that such as do so, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, or unjust; and <hi>shall
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100252:13"/>
not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Christian Obligation of doing right to all, having an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon all the conversation we have with men, that is, almost all the actions of our Lives; It's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary (that we may throughly find out the guilty in my Text) to make a strict enquiry after this Christian Justice, as it is distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its several Objects, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and by the various kinds of Right, we owe one to another; the breach of every part of which, doth expose us, as to the guilt, so to the severe sentence of my Text.</p>
               <p>The first kind of Gospel-Justice, (as it respects differing Relations) is that which is call'd Distributive, that is, the reciprocal Dues and Rights which Christians must pay one to another, in matters of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority and Subjection to it; from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100252:14"/>
an Empire, to the little Dominion of a Family.</p>
               <p>The first of that kind, is, the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Duties of Princes and Subjects. As for the Duties which Princes owe to their Subjects, or rather to God for them; it is not our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to enquire after. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistles, when he carefully provided Rules for all distributive Justice, makes no mention of the duties of Princes; intimating, that they are accountable to none but God, whose (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) Ministers they are. We must not curse them (<hi>Eccl.</hi> 10. 20.) not slight them, so the Hebrew, (<hi>ne detrahat Regi</hi>) not disparage them, so the Vulgar Latin, in the most retired thoughts of our Bed-chamber, for their miscarriages; For which, (when at the greatest) we must pretend to no other remedy, but the Primitive Churches powerful
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100252:14"/>
Engines, Prayers and Tears. But then the Subjects are bound in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Justice, to pay their Prince Honour, Tribute, and Obedience. And those that fail in any part of these duties, that is, that shall whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Jealousies into the heads of the Multitude, to defraud them of their honour; or refuse, or decline their Tribute, the price of their own protection; or disobey their Laws, the Nerves of all Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and publick safety, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they have wronged their Princes, and are unrighteous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just persons, in the sence of my Text. But if their unrighteousness in these cases shall ferment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Designs, (let them pretend to as much Saintship as <hi>Corah,</hi> or common Justice as <hi>Absolom,</hi> or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation as both) they are not then only unjust to a Prince in his Personal Capacity, contrary to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100252:15"/>
Rule of doing to all men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though he be a Tyrant, act contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to an express Precept (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) not to <hi>resist evil,</hi> not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among private persons: But as he is a publick person, they are guilty of a National wrong; they wrest out of Gods hand the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2.) the only expedient of Mercy, by which the Rights of all men are preserved, and the world kept from Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and are therefore answerable for all the Blood, Ruine, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Consequences of a Civil War, that is of a Princes Military defence of himself, and faithful Subjects that adhere to him, in the day of Rebellion. So that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel is an unrighteous person, by a complication of guilt and an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of wrongs.</p>
               <p>But now permit not your thoughts, nor will I my Tongue,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100252:15"/>
to make application, by reflecting upon the unparallell'd Tragedy of Evils done and suffered, upon the breach of this Justice in our late Rebellion. If I have said so much, as may teach the Guilty Repentance, and others that were not engaged, their duty, it's enough; let us bury all the rest in Prayers and Charity.</p>
               <p>But further, if the Nation be Christian, there is another Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity invested in a Prince, over Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastick Persons, and Cases; for he is concerned as well in the (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,) the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as the Civil Concerns of his Subjects (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2.) And there is a Due of Obedience to be paid him in Christian Justice on that account also. This Power was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently conferred by God on the Kings of the Old Testament; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> had both the Trumpets; <hi>David</hi> ordered the Courses of the <hi>Levites,</hi>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:100252:16"/>
and the Solemnities of the Publick Service: <hi>Joash</hi> had the Testament given him in his hand, as well as the Crown on his Head, (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 11.) <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Josiah</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Church by their Royal Authority. And as Christ found it (there being no retrenchment of that power in the Gospel) so he left it, as his own general Laws ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed and interpreted by the Churches after-practice, can testifie above all exceptions. <hi>Ex quo</hi> (saith <hi>Socrates</hi>) <hi>Imperatores facti sunt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani, ab ipsis res Ecclesiae depende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi> After that the Emperors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Christian, the Churches Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs depended upon them. Thus was <hi>Constantine</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And <hi>Leo</hi> the Third could say <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. that is, they were mixt persons, they were concern'd in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Protection of the Church.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100252:16"/>
But of this Right, hath the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi> and Assemblies, defrauded their Princes; the one gets away half of their Crowns, the other of their Scepters; both rob them of their Authority, and of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects full Allegiance. And thus it is with us, while we have a Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion establisht by Law, by a power next to God (<hi>Solo Deo minorem,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) and by such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, as God and Man cannot be pretended to stand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Obedience. The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath a superior power ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by some, and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly by others, and both profess a Religion in Obedience to those Usurpations, and in opposition to their Lawful Soveraign's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Laws: So that the King is robb'd of his Subjects, they, of their Allegiance, and the Church torn in pieces by them both, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100252:17"/>
two Milstones (as the late Arch-B. in his Preface to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie) This wrong is done on either side, and for that reason they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unjust, unrighteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that do it. This as to the first part of Distributive Justice, in the Concerns of Princes and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>The next kind of Distributive Justice in the larger Circles of it, is, the reciprocal Dues and Rights, which the Governours of the Church, and their Charges, are in Christian Justice obliged to pay to one another. Without the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual performance of which a Body of men can be call'd no more a Church, than a Tumult can be call'd an Army, or an ungovern'd Rout, a City. Now as it is in Civils, though the King be (<hi>Supremus Judex</hi>) Chief Judge in the Law, yet he administers Ju-Justice
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100252:17"/>
by his commission'd Justicers to whom also an Obedience is due on that account: so in Ecclesiasticks, he exerciseth his supreme authority, for the care of the Church, by proper Officers (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) set apart for that design; whose Calling though it be governed and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Princes, is yet immediately from Heaven (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 4.) they are called of God to it. and (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28.) <hi>Whom the Holy Ghost hath made Bishops,</hi> or Overseers; and for that reason a right of Obedience is due unto them on that account also.</p>
               <p>First then, the Pastors of the Church are bound in Justice (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to <hi>feed the Church of God,</hi> by pastoral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Preaching, by Sacraments, and Offices of Discipline, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting Canons, for fit Circumstances,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100252:18"/>
                  <hi>that all things may be done</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 40.) <hi>decently, &amp; in order,</hi> or uniformity in the Church of God. If they fail of their duties, they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unrighteous, and must answer deeply for the wrong they have done to their Charges.</p>
               <p>On the other side, their people in Christian Justice owe them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Love, Honour, and (which for the Churches sake, is most espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially required) Obedience. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you,</hi> (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) And as S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> (the best Interpreter of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles meaning and practice) saith <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) It is necessary that nothing be done in the Church, but in obedience to the Governors of it. And this was the Sense and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Practice of the Church, it its primitive purity, and best Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. But if their Charges shall
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100252:18"/>
condemn their Callings, contemn their persons, separate from their Administrations, and refuse confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to their Rules of Order, in the service of God; they are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, unjust persons, they have defraud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Spiritual Rulers of their, due, and (by infallible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence) the Church of the very Essentials of its well-being, Peace, and Unity; the ends for which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Government was especially design'd: Of which Unity the Church being once deprived, in comes the Inundation of Atheism, Prophaness, Contempt of Gods Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Heresies and Factions; for all which those unjust persons must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, when they happen. And of all this, our own woful experience is too convincing an evidence. For as it is certain, that those miseries are now upon us, so it is as certain, they own their beginning to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100252:19"/>
breach of this Christian Justice, and commenced from the days the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinarians first withdrew their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from their lawful Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and taught the people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise, and quarrel with them about indifferent Rites. Which unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness afterward, fermenting, and gradually increasing, hath in the various agitations of several ages, brought upon the Church, and the Pastors thereof, all these Infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and wrongs they now unjustly suffer: Grown too great (without a gracious divine Deliverance) for hope of relief. The Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Common-wealth's case, <hi>quae nec ferre sua possit vitia, necre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>media,</hi> neither able to bear its mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages nor remedies. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the severe Character of my Text may be applied to no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons alive, unless it be in our Prayers, to beg forgiveness for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100252:19"/>
them, as they were instrumental to these heavy punishments, and for our selves, that (for our sins) have justly deserved them at the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Thus I have gone over the parts of Distributive Justice, which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are to act in the greater Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferences of Publick Relations; I now contract my Discourse to the lesser Circles of it, in Domestick Concerns: Which though they be less considerable, are not at all less necessary. Our salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon every part of that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as much as the other: Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to a Prince, or conformity to the Church, cannot make us just, if we do wrong at home to our Wives, Children or Servants. Now the Christian Justice of the Family-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, are the reciprocal Dues of Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Masters and Servants; <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

                  </gap>, unrighteous, unjust in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>Lastly, As to the third, of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Relations, Masters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: First, Masters owe their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100252:20"/>
Servants, in Christian Justice, civil regard, kind usage, and just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for their Labours: And they again, owe their Masters Honour, Obedience, and Faithfulness. But if the Masters shall use their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants like Brutes, nay like senseless Engines, like Bodies without Souls, (for so Slaves are call'd <gap reason="foreign">

Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loiners, and depart from their Faithfulness: these are wrongs done on either side, and are all unjust, unrighteous persons, on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: And (as it is of the other Relations) if they had nothing else

to answer for, had guilt enough, to be disinherited from the Kingdom of God. These are they, which depart from Christian Justice in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Relations.</p>
               <p>Having thus found out the <gap reason="foreign">

The second right we owe in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Justice, as to the temporal well-being of our Neighbour, is the preservation of his Estate and Fortune; which whosoever shall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate, upon any temptation, is one of the unrighteous persons in my Text. And we consider not this, as done by acts of horrid oppression only, when the Beams and Stones are disquieted with the cries of

Lastly, We owe in Christian Justice (as to our Neighbours temporal well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the right of preserving one anothers Health, Limbs, and Peace; therefore he that shall wrong him in the first, by ingaging him in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100252:23"/>
intemperate courses, or deprive him of the second, by any act of private hostility, as Duelling, or the like; or defraud him of the third, by uncivil usage, or vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Suits and Controversies; so far as in any of them, or in any other way, a man is disadvantaged in the comfort of his Life, or means of Livelihood, there is a wrong done, &amp; he that hath done it, is an unjust, an unrighteous person, and as such, stands upon the necessity of restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or in the danger of his exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from the blessed Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>Thus having gone over the Breaches that are made upon the several Branches, both of Distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive, and Commutative Justice; there remains two more to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered apart; because they have a mixture of both. Of the first of these I would give a <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

               <p>5. Gods certain vengeance upon that wrong, by the fatal fall both of the one, and of the other. I shall not controversially apply this evidence, but must (for shortness sake) leave it to your serious refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, for the ends I mentioned it. Now that portion which hath been set apart for God, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of 16000 Servants of his Worship among us, are either Lands, or Tithes. As for the wrongs done to the first, they are commonly acted (<hi>per Sorices Palatii,</hi> as Bish. <hi>Andrews</hi> calls them) by the unhappy men about the Courts of Princes; who as they thirst after them, so would not stick to suck the milk of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, drink the tears of Widows, as well as devour the Demeans of Gods Servants (because as defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

as either) as Sacrifices to their pride and luxury. But it is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Favourites of this Design, that the supreme Judicature may, (when they please) take them away: I answer, they may (<hi>impunè</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul; and their Authority ought not (must not) be resisted; but whether (<hi>justè</hi>) righteously, or whether every one that hath a vote in their alienation, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rob God and man, and may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear Gods vengeance for doing so, I leave it to the former Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to determine. As for the wrongs done to the Church in point of Tithes, (<hi>Decimam meam</hi> as St. <hi>Austin</hi> supposeth God to speak) there depraedations happen upon lower contrivements; as when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the powerful mans heavy hand first presseth out the Vintage for himself, and then leaves some few drops; enough rather to upbraid, <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

I intended should reflect upon the occasion of this Assembly, where the proper business is judicially to administer right to them, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwise obtain it. Let every one then, that hath to do this day with the tender Rights of men, (whether they be the Ministers of the Law, of every sort, Witnesses, or Juries) have a care what they do; their Souls are at stake, the Oath of God is upon them, the Curse of God over them, the Cries of the oppressed about them, the Evidence of my Text, and the Law of Christ against them; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any unjust Cause goes away triumphant, if any mans right be impeached, through any defect in the discharge of their trust, they are <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thus I have finished the whole Scheme of Christian Justice; to the universal performance of which, the Gospel doth so strictly oblige us. And now who would think it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that a Christian Nation, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed with so many advantages of Religion, should in contradiction to the clearest Evidence of Gods Will, so generally degenerate from the practice of it in every part; and that not among them only, that have thrown off all Concern for Religion (that were no wonder) but amidst the very Professors of it, even among them, that pretend to a greater Zeal than others, in appearance for it, I cannot but think, that there hath been some <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

By these and the like unhappy Modes of teaching the Gospel, men have been driven from their Reason, and Religion, and set their Consciences loose to all unrighteousness. And hence it is, that they are grown every where so cross and intracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Authority, Laws, and Order, and the State is full of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, the Church of Schismaticks, our Houses of undutiful Children, and untrusty Servants; and men are made universally false and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful one to another. But let them pretend what Religion they will, they shall not so escape; all unjust persons (such as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed) are upon the Rock, the severe Sentence of my Text; <hi>They shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi>

               <p>In which, are two things to be observed; I. The Nature of the Punishment; it is a disinherison. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>In the first, here's a case in Law, a Title supposed, and a Disinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son expressed: A Title, these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just persons had, and heirs at Law they were, (and so were all that are, or shall be deprived of that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Blessing) or they could in no sence be said to be disinherited: 'Tis true, that <hi>Adam</hi> once forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Estate, but it was purchased again, or redeemed, by Christ, not with Silver and Gold, but with the dear price of his precious blood, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18.) And that Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made as large, as the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> discourseth, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18.) So that the Reason why any man is now disinherited, must be upon another account; not because <hi>Adam</hi> sinned, or that the Covenant of Grace was renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with any number less than all men, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4.) or that Christ died for fewer than (<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The sum then is, That the unjust man, as such, in all the particular cases I have mentioned, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he failed in both the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Lastly, He lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his own Soul; that is, he brings himself into such a State, (that <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stat nunquam natum</hi>) <hi>it were better for him he had never been born, or that a Milstone were hanged about his neck, and were drowned</hi> in a Sea of Forgetfulness, and Annihilation. And all this he adventures that he may add one handful of Earth more to the Turf of his worldly possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; one grain more to his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated heap; one garnish more to the pride of his Life; from all
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100252:31"/>
which, and from whatsoever else he enjoys in this world, he shall possibly within a few Minutes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably within a few Moneths, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly within a few Years, be as much a stranger, as he that holds up the Train of the <hi>Persian</hi> Emperor, or the Infant that hangs upon his Mothers Breast. These are the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable measures of the unjust mans Doom and Punishment.</p>
               <p>But is he past the utmost Confines of Hope? Is his evil an irrepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loss, an irrecoverable danger? Certainly no: For though the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel have drawn up the Indictment against him, it is not yet come to Judgment: He is in a state of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nability, but not Damnation. Not so shipwrack'd, but that there is (<hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buta post Naufragium</hi>) one Raft left to land him safe, one remaining con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his recovery, and that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100252:31"/>
is, a timely Repentance; For (saith God) <hi>if the wicked man shall turn away from his unrighteousness</hi> (his Injustice) <hi>and do that which is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and right,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>if he shall restore the Pledge, and execute judgment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, he shall save his Soul alive,</hi> Ezek. 18. 27. When first by Repentance, must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood nothing less, than (what is necessary for all other sins) a real departure from all unrighteous Actions and engagements: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is called Repentance, and brings not this change (be it Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Contrition, or Confession) ought in no reason to be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sufficient for Evangelical Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. Much less will (<hi>Lachrymu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la &amp; Suspirium</hi>) a Tear and a Sigh at the last period of our Life (by such measures of Mercy as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us) expiate the guilt of the sin of Injustice, or any other
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100252:32"/>
sins, habitually and reigningly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, to that helpless hour. Therefore 2. Besides this Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which is common to all other sins. The unjust (which doth much heighten the sin of Injustice above all others) are obliged to restore the injured persons (to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most capacity) to that Right, of which they have deprived them. Otherwise all other Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, (even to the departure from any further Commission of the sin) will be accounted fair, but abortive Attempts. Now in the several cases of Injustice, where the Scene lies not for restitution, as in the cases of Rebellion, Schism, and the like, the unjust person must make satisfaction, and amends, by acknowledgments and recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and those to be (if possible) as publickly and earnestly done, as those wrongs had been before
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100252:32"/>
committed. For if those attempts of satisfaction be not made (if in his power) whatsoever other acts of Repentance he had performed, (let no man deceive himself, nor mock God) he hath yet no title to the Blessing of the penitent. But where the unjust man (in the cases of the breaches of Commutative Justice) hath defrauded any man by Oppression, Theft, or Subtilty, in any Employment, or Contract whatsoever, so that another is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by him, if that person should weep an Ocean of Tears for his sins, and pray till his knees became cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, like a Camels, for the pardon of it, if the unjust thing lies upon his hand, if there be not restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, to the injured person, (according to his power) or if he be dead, to his Heirs; or if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be found, to the Poor; (whose Right then it is, by an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheat
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100252:33"/>
to the Soveraign Lord, whose Exchequer they are) he cannot be numbred among the Penitents, he is still an unjust man, and shall not <hi>inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> It was upon <hi>Zacheus</hi> noble Restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that our Saviour pronounced, <hi>This day is Salvation come to thy House,</hi> (Luke 19. 19.) And, <hi>Si res aliena</hi> (saith St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Macedonius</hi>) <hi>cum reddi potest, non redditur, non agitur poenitentia, sed fingitur</hi>; If the unjust thing be not restored, the Repentance may be feigned, but is not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And now I beseech all those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons here this day before me, whose Consciences can inform them, that they are so unhappy as to be unjust in any of the measures I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, first, that they take no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at the Religion, that requires, nor at me that preach, so severe a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100252:33"/>
Method (as men may be apt to think) of their recovery; for they ought to consider, that it was their own wilful prevarications of the most reasonable Rules of Justice, and not the Religion, that made it necessary.</p>
               <p>And let me further assure them, that whosoever shall give his Soul leave (for his own salvation) to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the performance of this Duty of Restitution (how unkind or difficult soever it may appear at the first view) let him not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged (my Soul for his) he shall find such a sensible return of sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and satisfaction in the very Acts, and much more in the Issue of it, that he would not exchange his Comforts, or have neglected his Duty, for all the Pleasures and Enjoyments in the world. <hi>His Soul shall dwell at ease, and he shall lie down in peace; his bed shall be no
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100252:34"/>
more shorter, but that he shall stretch himself upon it, nor his Covering narrower, but that he shall wrap him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in it,</hi> (Isa. 28. 20.) that is, he shall have a quiet mind, while he lives; and when he comes to die, he shall not be tormented with the confluence of direful Furies about his Bed, nor behold dreadful As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects hanging about his Curtains, the usual Attendants of unjust men, living and dying.</p>
               <p>What if thy House shall stand one Story lower by removing the Chambers built by wrong, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 13.)? Or contract the compass of thy Land by hedging out <hi>Naboth's</hi> Vineyard? Or lay aside some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of a splendid Life? Nay: what if thou shouldst be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a retired condition, or the narrow circles of a low fortune, by restoring what is anothers right? the assurance of Gods Favour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100252:34"/>
thee, the enjoyment of a good Conscience within thee, the view of a glorious hope before thee; (in a word) a contented life, a peaceable death, and a blest eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, will be a redundant compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation for all thou shalt so nobly part with. Thus have I adventured a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in your opinion, by chusing these unwelcome (though very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary) Doctrines of universal Justice, and upon the breach of it, Satisfaction, and Restitution. My comfort is, if I have not pleased you, I have done you right, I have dealt justly with you. And I do not despair, but I have met here many persons of <hi>David's</hi> Choyce, and Ingenuity, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 141.) who would rather be smitten friendly, and reproved, than to hear the pleasing Balmes of unconcerning and indulgent Doctrine, to break their heads, destroy their souls.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100252:35"/>
With whom (I hope) these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may so far prevail, that it may be said of them, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of his penitent <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the Verse following my Text; <hi>Such were some of you, but ye are washed, ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have in this Sermon (as fully &amp; faithfully as I could) made an universal Survey of the several Branches of Christian Justice, and given notice, that the wilful Transgressors of any part of it, stand arraign'd and condemned for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100252:38"/>
persons, as to their guilt, and cannot (upon the Gospels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring universal Obedience in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and doing right to all men in particular, as the Conditions of Salvation by it) inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, as their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But amongst the great numbers of unjust men, I have (in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of my Discourse) sorted those persons, who deprive the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magistrate of his due, in that part of his Authority which concern Spirituals; and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of the Church of their right of Obedience from their Charges; by refusing to conform themselves to the Commands of both, so far as they are invested with a power from God, to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Laws and Canons, for the Peace, Order, and Unity of the Churches, under their Rule and Conduct.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:100252:38"/>
Now because not only the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general are concern'd in that part of Evangelical Righteousness; but the Ministers also of Parochial Congregations stand most especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliged to it, and because their offences against it, are of far more dangerous consequence, I have for their sakes, who are of the Clergy, made this enlargement in that particular Branch of it, as to them.</p>
               <p>And this I have done the rather, because (at this present time) this kind of Injustice is so spreadingly, and unconscionably committed and practiced; that (what with the miscarriage of some, who out of worldly prudence, of others, who out of weakness, of most, who out of wilfulness, neglect their due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the establish'd Laws) a great number of the Churches are made irregular and disordered in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100252:39"/>
the publick Administrations of Gods service: By which means the Laws are baffled and despised, the Government suspected and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Priesthood in general reproach'd as false and careless, and the whole profession of our esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht Religion, is made a scorn at present, and ready to be made a prey in future, to our enemies on every side.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, let us have a care therefore in time, we do not too much, and too long (for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Concerns of our present quiet or profit, or to conciliate vulgar Love or Fame) not only wickedly and unjustly, but weakly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently comply with the humors of any party whatsoever, in the neglects of our Duties, or partial performance of our Offices: For it is certain, that no man can do it, (upon what pious Motives soever
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100252:39"/>
he pretends to be induced to it, as favouring infirmities, or tender Consciences, and the like) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his real offence against the Laws of Christ strictly obliging Obedience to his Superiors just Commands, he doth thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and cherish a Faction in his own bosom; which being once warm'd into a sufficient strength, shall upon the next advantageous opportunity, not only destroy the Church in its Legal Constitution, but in the same pitch and posture of abasement, to which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descension was made.</p>
               <p>And of this, let our late expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience be an impartial Judge. For when some Bishops, and other emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent persons of the Church, who out of a pious tenderness to some mens dissatisfactions, and designing the upholding their own, and the Churches Respect &amp; Credit among
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100252:40"/>
them (for which they were distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from their Brethren by the name of <hi>Puritans</hi>) did either not urge, or not practise strict Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, found at length their own grand mistake in the frustration of all those ends which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to themselves, as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of their compliance: For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themselves, nor the Church for their sakes, found any mercy at all from them, in the days of their Power and Fury, when nothing less would satisfie them, than the confusion of both. Little did those Reverend Persons think, when they strain'd their Candor to that Party, beyond the bounds of their due O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Law, that such a pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shew of tender Piety, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences so demurely nice (that could not digest so much as a Ring on the Brides Finger, the Infants wearing the shadow of a Cross three
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100252:40"/>
minutes at its Baptism, upon its Forehead, or but the colour of the Priest's Vestment; for they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended then but such little offences) should cover such black Designs, of the most unwarrantable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices that ever were acted in the world.</p>
               <p>It behoveth us therefore to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, when we meet with Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-scruplings about such, or the like indifferent Rites and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances that there lodgeth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath an unsatisfiable dislike and dissatisfaction to the whole esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment; so that if our Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty should be tempted to debauch our Obedience, by a partial confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to indulge them in those lesser things, it were prudence to believe, that we should be so far from giving them full satisfaction, that it would but the more advance and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en an unruly appetite, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100252:41"/>
could determine, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of all. Of this their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable humour, our late experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence can convincingly inform us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when their first modest desires of a Moderated Episcopacy, ended in nothing less, than its extirpation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of regulating some offensive parts of the Liturgy, in its utter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition. And when (as among many of them) after the Cross, followed Baptism it self; after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Rails and Genuflexion, went away the Sacrament: And when they had been at first a little gratified with the taking away the Habits, they were never quiet, till they had renounced the very Order &amp; Calling of Priesthood it self. Such effects, and no better than these we must expect from the greatest condescention that can be made, to men of this temper and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

               <p>These are they, that set up Altar against Altar in the same Church that join the Liturgy and Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry together, at the same Assembly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100252:43"/>
but as much as possible to the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of the former, which they shuffle over with such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and undevout Mode of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery, and then manage their Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier Effusions in Prayer, and their Hints and Corollaries in Preaching, with such Zeal and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, as if they design'd to tell the People, that they never were in earnest till then, or that those Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Pulpit might be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to serve no better end, than to undermine the credit of what they had done (or undone) in the Desk.</p>

               <p>These mens Congregations are the Fountains, from whence the crooked Rivers, and Rivulets, the Mother and Daughters of Factions, have deriv'd their streams, to that swelling greatness, as they now run among us, and almost over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They were the <hi>Seraglio's,</hi> where the late Warriors against the King and the Church, were trained up and disciplin'd: And what the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries beyond Seas, are to the propagation of Popery, these are the same to the keeping up of all Factions among us.

And this will easily be believed, when it is consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the difference between some Ministers practices in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and those of unlawful Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings is so small, that oft-times the separation may be rather account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

a Change of Places, than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.</p>
               <p>But that these Clergy-men may be more regularly convinced of their sin and folly, and find Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both from Conscience and Prudence, to change their destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive practices of popular compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, into a Design of preserving the Church of <hi>England's</hi> general safety, by a faithful conformity to its Institutions; I shall here offer to their considerations, (besides those which I have already intimated in general) a particular Series of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, certainly consequent to their Disorders.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From these mens Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, and the teaching their People to adhere to them (where they are) it comes to pass that the Enemies of the Church, have contrived an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, by crying up the numbers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100252:45"/>
of Dissenters (which by their means are more numerous in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, than without) as great and formidable; to tempt, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Civil Power, from prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Church, under its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent danger and oppression. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, as I believe the allegation to be false (especially if a lesser number of men in power, and of learning, and honour, may be allowed to compensate a greater, of the mean and ignorant) so, if this one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient were tryed, that all Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy men might be compelled to serve God in publick, in one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form submission to Law, without any liberty to extravagate from that Rule; and so no more Beacons on fire in any neighbouring Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to alarm the Vulgar, to run up and down to gratifie their natural love of Opposition and Novelty;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100252:46"/>
and a diligent care taken that no Factions without the Church, might be headed by men of Orders, or Parts (though the common people were less prosecuted with afflictive penalties) I am perswaded in a few years, the numbers of Dissenters, would be so far from being formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, that they would not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable for any thing, but our pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Charity. And I have this ground to assure me of the possible successefulness of this Expedient, because it is certain, that where the strictest Conformity hath a long time been constantly used, there are fewest that do trouble themselves, or their Governors about the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of Relaxation from it; and that there are none that hate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity so much, as they who live in places where it is discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and neglected. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:100252:46"/>
by the disloyal and undutiful temper of those that dwell in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and greater Towns, where, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was no provision in Law for them, that would obey it; the people were resolved to bestow their Contributions on none, but such, by whom they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed and indulged in an assured opposition to the Church.</p>
               <p>To which one cause, most of our former and present miseries refer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> effects; as when from those places were elected Burgesses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same Principles, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate troubles above (whose heavy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>and, our late Gracious Princes of Happy Memory felt sufficiently, even to the loss of the life of one of the best Kings that ever was:) and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> when the People of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Villages flockt to their Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Lectures, and were there train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:100252:47"/>
up, in dislike and enmity to the establish'd Church, and prepared to contemn their own Shepherds at home; unless they became such as themselves, which very oft they did, when younger Divines (who for want of Parts or Government, had little encouragement to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the Universities) made it a piece of their Education, to go thither, to scribble Notes for their own Pulpits, and to learn the Tones, Gestures, and Phrases, which might give their own People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment at home.</p>
               <p>Whereas if our present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as it was the Design of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) had upon the Kings Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion found out a way, to have set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a competent legal maintenance, and men of the greatest Integrity and Learning (whose abilities are commonly either lodg'd up in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100252:47"/>
and Cathedrals, or obscur'd in little Villages) planted in those greater places; and where they are popularly elective, if they had been brought under the Patronage of the Crown (whose safety is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially concern'd in it) and a way found out, to embetter Trade, in the stead of Factious Lectures, there could not have been a Stone laid, which would have added more to the defence and security of the Church and Throne.</p>
               <p>But to recover my self from this Digression, I am confident that this Expedient that I have mentioned, (whatsoever is pretended to the contrary by them that have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to ruine us) will give far less trouble to the Civil Power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Church, than a Tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all Religions (by the making and maintaining so many Rules to
<pb facs="tcp:100252:48"/>
limit it, and so many Provisions to prevent the dangers that will ensue upon it, half of which cannot be be foreseen) will cost to destroy it: Besides the Dishonour of discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancing that Party, which are the only assured Friends to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Loyalty, all other Parties lying under a stain of being unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Crown; of confounding the most absolute platform of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christianity, which no other Perswasion makes any such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to; and in defending of which, we have so far prevail'd in all rational Debates, that our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies stand ashamed, and baffled on every side: Of making that Church which hath appear'd hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the honour of the whole Reformation, to become vile and contemptible in the eye of the world, by giving advantage for
<pb facs="tcp:100252:48"/>
the encouragement and immixture of as many false and ridiculous Professions at one time among us, as all the Ages of the Church ever knew in its successive Periods: Of contradicting the sense of both the Universities, and of the principal of the most Learned men of the Age, with a great Blow to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self: Of opening a door to the increase of Atheism and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneness, which if they have thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven so much under a looser hand of Discipline, what will they come to, when all the Bars of Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Government are thrown down? Lastly, (with many more evils which a better and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd skill might foresee) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the dishonour of treading up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bloud and Ashes, and of blemishing the Fame and Actions of our Late Gracious King and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
<pb facs="tcp:100252:49"/>
who died to prevent the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of those evils among us.</p>
               <p>The Sum is, It is no wonder, (while so many Churches continue in their Irregularities) why the Arms of the Civil Power are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and discouraged, when all their Endeavours for the establishing an universal uniformity by the method of dispersing unlawful Assemblies, may be too justly interpreted to be but an emptying the streams, while the Fountain is kept running; and cutting down the Branches, while the Root is left entire, to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a new progeny of the same kind and spirit. So that when some Civil Magistrates have had their aid required, for the redressing of Misdemeanors without the Church, it hath been reasonably answered, and objected by them, let the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches own work of Reformation
<pb facs="tcp:100252:49"/>
and Order be done at home, and we are ready to give our assistance to endeavour it abroad.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From these mens Disorders it comes to pass that it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Government and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of the Church is baffl'd and despis'd, and men are tempted to reproach them as ineffectual, and consequently useless; when it is considered, that besides the known Dissenters, who impudently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them without, the R. R. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops universal care of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (every Parish being their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Charge) is executed by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Curates, who are Traytors to them and their Authority within. Who contrary to their trust (given and taken with all possible Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reasonable Obligations) of keeping up the Reverence and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of their Persons, Calling,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100252:50"/>
and Discipline, by conducting Souls, in one legal uniform per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Offices, in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Obedience (which by Oath they stand oblig'd to) and Filial submission to them; they tempt and teach the people to decline all respect and obedience to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, by setting up a new mode of Worship, by the Rubrick and Canon of their own Fancies, and in opposition to their Orders and Injunctions.</p>
               <p>Thus in stead of those excellent enjoyned Prayers, and Regular Forms of Worship, which they either omit in whole or part, or render unacceptable by an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar usage, they substitute such an unsavory Offering of their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, oft-times so full of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Clamors and Gestures, and odd Familiarities, if not of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100252:50"/>
non-sense and blasphemies (against which evils, neither the Church, nor themselves, will be secured, while they are permitted to assume a liberty of uttering what they please, and of gaining a reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it, of praying by the Spirit) that the wiser sort of the Friends to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> are scandall'd and ashamed, and forsake the Publick Assemblies, whither by Law they are ingaged to go; and the ignorant and credulous Vulgar train'd up and disciplin'd, in the Love and Admiration of an irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Devotion, and in an irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leable disaffection to the rational setled Service of the Church, and an insuperable hatred to the Laws and Persons that oblige and require it.</p>
               <p>And then, as to the executing the Churches tender care of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100252:51"/>
Youth in form and manner, as they are ingaged by Law and Duty, they either wholly omit that sweet and charitable Office, and convert it at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, into a Discourse, that neither for matter or manner, doth suit with either their needs or capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or instead of conducting them in the knowledge of the duties of Christianity, by the Church-Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism (which doth so concernedly design it) they have presumptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly substituted a great company of other Forms, full of private Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and Heads of controverted Doctrines (as those of absolute E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, Justification by Faith alone, and the like) which have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon, if not a contradiction to, the very reason of Christian Obedience; and thence Parents and Tutors, and the Children them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100252:51"/>
are left to a strange uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, when (upon change of places) they are either committed to the conduct of men of other Fancies, or to those that follow the Churches Order in their Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Now what kind of Youth such irregular usage of Children is like to make, may be judged by them, which they trained up in their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Twenty years Liberty, to use their own Methods without controul.</p>
               <p>Then as to the improving the Churches care of instructing men by the Office of Preaching, in the Duties of Justice, and Mercy, Peace and Innocence, Subjection to Authority, and (which is the Sum of all) universal Obedience: the Peoples ears are accustomed to the noises of new invented Phrases, and impertinent Notions; with the Discourses of Gospel-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100252:52"/>
Christian Liberties, and controverted Opinions (such as of the Famous five Points, and their dependent Articles). And instead of Preaching upon the Renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sermon upon the Mount (in imitation of our Saviour's own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) and pressing the Rules of Life contained in it, the People hear the weight of their Salvation laid upon some occasional expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Epistles of the Apostles, (especially those to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians</hi>) or else they send them to <hi>Patmos,</hi> to busie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves about opening some of the Seals of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which kind of Preaching, the People (as their Practices do too pregnantly declare) are kept in Ignorance (some think, greater than in the darkest Age of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Superstition) of those
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100252:52"/>
Christian Duties, but especially of their necessary obligation, for the attaining Eternal Salvation: which doth evidently appear, when it is observed, that no sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Nation, are so defective in most of them, nor (as to the case in hand) so cross &amp; intractable to all Authorities, nor so apt (on all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) to rebellious designs against them (which if a strict observation were made what places did most es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially afford the greater numbers of them, that were lately ingaged against the King and the Church, would easily be proved) than those that have been under the conduct of such Ministries.</p>
               <p>Hence ingenuous persons may consider, what grand and confused difficulties (made so through these mens disorders) the Ecclesiastick Jurisdiction hath to deal with, to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100252:53"/>
preserve the Church in any degree from a present sinking, into a total ruine; and (as things stand) how impossible it is (were its power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted to the greatest perfection) to attain its end of universal Peace and Order.</p>
               <p>But if all Ministers of Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations were compelled to do their Duties exactly according to Law, and not one permitted to perform any thing in the publick Worship of God, by his own choice or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whereby one Church should be distinguish'd from another; and so none be presum'd to come to Church, nor meddle with any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices or Business about it, but such as come thither (there being no temptation from any thing else) in a willing submission to conformity, which ('tis supposed) none would do but such, as would also be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100252:53"/>
and civil to the Government of the Church: And that all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed Dissenters were look'd upon as excommunicate persons (all which are really so, either, by the Sentence of the Church, or by their own wilful Separation) and so no further to belong to the Churches Jurisdiction (while they resolve ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately to continue so) than an Heathen, or an Alien: And that then the secular power would look upon them as only their proper Province, to regulate them by such Laws as they are, or shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered withal, made on the most Charitative Design to restore them to the Church; its Discipline would do its own work with honour, and all that live under its excellent conduct, enjoy it with comfort and safety to their Souls.</p>
               <p>Whereas, while so many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100252:54"/>
remain in their irregular, and mixt conformities, and for that cause as dangerous enemies, as any the Church of <hi>England</hi> is oppressed with, continue a kind of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with it, in her publick places; no wonder, when such persons are either made Officers, or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dealt withal, by the Churches Jurisdiction, that they appear, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to affront it, or to render it as trifling and ridiculous as they can: and when the Secular Power by due execution of Laws, shall bring any man to some publick Churches, it's a question whether he be restored to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or only removed from a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Conventicle to a greater; and so the Law be made use of, rather to confirm the Dissenters in their opposition, than to restore them to the peace and order of the Church.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:100252:54"/>
3. By these mens humouring the poor people with their Directorian Conformity, it is, that the True Sons of the Church, who in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of their duty to God, shall entirely conform themselves to the Laws established, are made the scorn and hate of the people: who are taught to reproach them (for want of an accusation that hath truth or sense in it) by the names of Popish &amp; Superstitious: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as their own Teachers might with less Injustice, and upon a nearer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement than we have with either the Pope, or the Worship of Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (as I can shew them if they desire it) be called <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> did not a good Cause solemnly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor such Unchristian Defences, though a bad one (and it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing sign it is so) hath no other to protect it.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100252:55"/>

And then upon the temptation of those reproachful. Names that signifie and prove no determinate thing (had they said Conformity had been against any Law of Christ, and shewn us a Precept general, or particular to prove it so, they had done like men and Christians) the people think themselves acquitted towards God, if they persecute their conformable Pastors, with all imaginable acts of Cruelty, to make their lives bitter and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them: To which evils they add this also (with him in the Psalm, imagining God to be such an one as themselves) that if any sad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (in common contingencies) shall befall them, it shall be record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Prodigy from heaven to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue Gods disowning them And whatsoever Faults (be they true or false) their watchful eye of envy

Not considering that the Juggling of their own admir'd Guides with Christian Obedience in some things, and their gross Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience to Authority in others, (to the universal wrong both of their Civil and Ecclesiastick Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors) are sins so much more scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous against the Gospel, than any their Malice pretends to lay to the Conformists Charge (if the miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of some were allowed to be a just Accusation of all) as the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie of a Pharisee is worse than the open Offences of a Publican; and as a sin that passeth under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Godliness, is much more dangerous, than those sins, whose

shame is written on the Offenders Foreheads; and for which there is no approbation or allowance from those of their own perswasion, and (so oft as their Spiritual Governors can have it signified to them) for which, some have been obliged to submit to the Penances of publick Recantations; as hath been done in this particular Diocess.</p>

From the example of these mens Disorders it comes to pass, that the ignorant and easie Dissenters are encreased, confirmed, and hardned in their Separations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all possible recal; when they understand, that what they depart from in the whole, is but that which those men (who by mistake enough and by incompetent Judges are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the only Godly Ministers do in their Churches reject in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And when, as to that little they observe, the matter is so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that they may be believed to do it, but in their own defence unwillingly, and by constraint, and as resolved to continue the doing it no longer, than they can get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves set free from the burden of Authority.</p>
               <p>But this mischief ends not here &amp; that which makes it much worse
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100252:58"/>
is, that such persons, who are yet unconcern'd as to any Religion, and are tempted through Idleness, or Business, or some little Offence to the person of their Priests, to stay at home; do answer all inward Checks of Conscience, and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Perswasions against their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of serving God according to the order of the Church, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging to themselves, that they absent themselves from nothing but that, which those that are account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Godly, do make it their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to scorn, and forsake, and would fight to destroy; and those that use it, seem to be opprest by it, and seek to avoid it as much as they can.</p>
               <p>By which it comes to pass, that great numbers of Men (I dare not say how great I think them) and of Youth especially (O unhappy they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100252:59"/>
that gave the occasion!) by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued absence from the Blessings and Ordinances of the Church, and the means of Grace and Knowledge are grown Atheistical and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, Vile and Vitious, Bold and Hardened in their opposition to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>Hence it is (what with the one and the other) that some places look like (if they really be not) an universal defection from Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And some Priests who faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform their duty, could not without great shame and oppression of Spirit, be serving God in the Publick Place, with so few about them (perhaps two or three in some populous places) but that they comfort themselves, that their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Handful, compared with the Flocks that attend Faction, look so like the different Numbers in the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100252:59"/>
Narrow and Broad way, mention'd in the Gospel, and the unequal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the good and evil in the world; and by considering, that Multitudes (when Differences are upon the Stage) seldom (and that by accident) entertain the right side, but do usually suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be conducted by such Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors, who because they cannot satisfie their Pride and Ambition in being considerable in real worth and weight, will endeavour to make themselves so, in Throngs and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>

of pursuing the Churches safety against Popery, by that Method, which is the only probable means of delivering up the Church unto it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanists</hi> know, that they can never bring this Nation back to their Religion, but first the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht Church must be overthrown; and they know also (no other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger yet appearing) it must be done, by improving the Dissenters Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice, and the Peoples Folly, to confound the Peace and Order of it, by the ruine of Episcopacy and Liturgy: which that they may do with the greater Zeal, the Cheat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:100252:61"/>
setting up of both among us.</p>
               <p>Thus the best Prince, Prelate, and Statesman then in the world, lost their Lives, by being first ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Peoples hate, as design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring in Popery; when wise men knew, that there were not three persons under the Sun, whom the <hi>Romanists</hi> would rather have removed out of the way, as the grand hinderers of their Design. The people are taught not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Liturgy, because it is Popish; whereas the Papists hate it, because it is not so; and when some of them have been dispensed to hear our Sermons, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prohibited to hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Factions are at work to make the People ruine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy, as Popish; there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the <hi>Romanists</hi> desire to see
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100252:61"/>
rather, than it's confusion; as knowing that it was that Order of men, that did at first throw, and now keeps out their Usurpations. And it is known, that the strictest Adherers to the Pope, are but back-friends to the Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the Countries of their own perswasion; and that the Order of Jesuites was first rais'd up, and now continued in its greatness, on design, to retrench the power of Bishops, as an Order that can only endanger the Popes Usurpations, and yet themselves stand upon a firm bottom of primitive Catholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme.</p>
               <p>But fully to confute the Peoples grand Mistake, who have been so falsly and disingenuously tempted, and instructed, to suspect the strict Conformists, as inclinable to Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (the spiteful Artifice of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

And who hath main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the Disputes against them, but the strictest Adherers to it, and those generally of the Episcopal Order it self? And if this cannot sufficiently manifest the falseness of the Accusation, and how far the Faithful Sons of our Church are from being Favourers of Popery, what can be said or done more to convince them?</p>
               <p>Then let them consider on the other side, what kindness the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:100252:62"/>
have shewn to the Factious, (not that I think they love them more than us, or would not destroy them also, when they had done their work of confounding us) of which none can be ignorant, that will enquire after so many Stories that pregnantly prove it, and that are Printed, and not Confuted: Of which there is hardly any Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but can say something from the Circle of his own Observation. Let the world therefore judge, whether they that have so unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily prejudg'd the People with a suspition of us, have not given occasion to be accused as really guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The Sum is, So far as a partial Conformist, doth by his unworthy usage of his Offices, cherish in the People a dislike and disaffection, to the Service, Orders, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100252:63"/>
of the Church, whereby they are prepared to oppose them, (if not to destroy them) on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; so far he must be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be doing the Papists work, to be digging down the Wall, pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Hedge, which fence and secure the Church against them; and laying all open to give them opportunity to re-enter and possess the holy Vineyard of God amongst us. And I think of this they have been sufficiently forewarned, by the late Incomparable Prelate and Martyr, when in his dying Sermon, he foretold what a Harvest the Pope would make of our Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; though for his good will, and dying-tender care of the Church, the Head of a Faction, (who afterward lost his own) was so impudent, as in a Triumph, to dip his Handkerchief in his Blood,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100252:63"/>
in requital for his Kindness.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And Lastly, By these mens undutiful practices it comes to pass, that the Parochial Officers, who should inform Authority of the Miscarriages of Congregations, are for their sakes, tempted to break their solemn Oaths to God, given and taken, for the good end of the Churches Order and Unity, and of the purity of Life in the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, which are wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by it.</p>
               <p>Of which Oaths so broken, those Ministers cannot but be highly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as being in no capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them, and necessarily oblig'd to indulge them, in their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sin of Perjury: And all to save themselves from being justly questioned, for their own Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Disobedience.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100252:64"/>
And the event is, that most Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches will be (without all visible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy) kept unreformed from the grossest Abuses; and the Nation in general will be taught by such remarkable Presidents of Perjury, almost in every Neighbourhood, to contemn all other Obligations by the solemn Religion of an Oath; that the King can promise to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self little assurance of Fealty, from them that have sworn it; and no man secure of his Life or Fortune, when both are committed to the tryal of the Law, when only the tye of an Oath can assure any man to have right done him. And there are already Complaints made of gross Miscarriages, where Favour or Interest have tempted men to deal unfaithfully, and to betray the Truth, to the preservation of which, they stood engaged by oath.</p>

And if men still proceed to be so Atheistical, and hardy, as to make no Conscience of an Oath, and consequently not of the lesser tyes of Honour, and common Honesty; the whole world will in a short time be sensible, that we are a false, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, and perjurious People, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable to God and Man.</p>
