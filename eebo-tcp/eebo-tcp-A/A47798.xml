         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN
ANSWER
TO A
LETTER to a Dissenter, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AFter many a Thought upon a Late Paper, Entitled
<hi>[A Letter to a Dissenter, &amp;c.]</hi> I am come to This
Resolution within my self: First, That it both Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and Deserves a <hi>Thorough-Answer. 2ly.</hi> That
No man can so Properly Speak to't, as <hi>a True Son
of the Church of England;</hi> for I take it to be his Province, and
Duty, in so Peculiar a manner, that such a Person, if Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
Qualify'd for That Office, can hardly Expect his <hi>Mothers
Blessing,</hi> without saying somewhat upon This Subject, in her <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</hi>
By a <hi>Thorough-Answer,</hi> I mean, the Taking of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Paragraph</hi> by <hi>Paragraph,</hi> and speaking to the <hi>Whole,</hi> and to
Every <hi>Part</hi> of it, all under one. My Course, I know, lyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Two Rocks;</hi> where 'tis Odds, that a man either <hi>dashes Vpon</hi>
One of them, or is <hi>Crush'd</hi> to pieces <hi>Betwixt</hi> them. But He that
is in his Duty, is never out of his Way. So that being Fully Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
already in the <hi>Main,</hi> my Next Care must be, not to
Transgress in the <hi>Manner</hi> of my Proceeding: Wherein I Propose to
Deliver my Thoughts, Plainly, and without Disguise; And not
to Depart, in the Least Scruple, from the Rules of <hi>Charity, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
Truth,</hi> and <hi>Candor;</hi> Nor (so far as my Understanding
will serve me) from the <hi>Dignity</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of my <hi>Profession.</hi>
I will not go behind the Door neither, to Conceal my <hi>Name;</hi>
for I have liv'd <hi>Open</hi> and <hi>Barefac'd</hi> a Long Time, and, by the
Grace of God, I will not Dye in a <hi>Disguise.</hi> Briefly, I shall take
the Freedom to <hi>Speak</hi> what I <hi>Think,</hi> without either <hi>Vanity,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence;</hi>
and make as <hi>Modest</hi> an Use of a <hi>Common Liberty,</hi> (with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41026:3"/>
leave for the <hi>Comparison) as any Other of His Majesties Subjects
whatsoever.</hi> And when I shall have done with the <hi>Publique</hi> Part
of This Discourse, I shall bestow a Few Pages upon a <hi>Postscript</hi>
for my self.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Letter it self</hi> is Address'd to a <hi>Dissenter;</hi> and why may not
<hi>My Answer</hi> be Address'd to a <hi>Dissenter</hi> too? For there's a Parity
of <hi>Reason,</hi> Indifferently, in <hi>Both Cases,</hi> where the <hi>Two Parties</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
Concerned, are not <hi>Both of a Mind.</hi> Beside, that by
This Means, I have an <hi>Introduction,</hi> ready to my hand here over
and above: for the <hi>First Paragraph</hi> will serve the <hi>Answerers</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as well as it did the <hi>Authors;</hi> And since I cannot Greet him
in <hi>Better</hi> Words, I shall do it so far in his <hi>Own.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Since Addresses are in fashion,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> give me leave to make one to you.
This is neither the Effect of Fear, Interest, or Resentment; therefore
you may be sure it is sincere: and for that reason it may expect to be
kindly received. Whether it will have power enough to Convince, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
upon the Reasons, of which you are to judge; and upon your prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Mind, to be perswaded by Truth, whenever it appeareth to you.
It ought not to be the less welcom, for coming from a friendly hand, one
whose kindness to you is not lessened by difference of Opinion, and who
will not let his thoughts for the Publick be so tyed or confined to this or
that Sub-division of Protestants, as to stifle the Charity, which besides
all other Arguments, is at this time become necessary to preserve us.</p>
            <p>I Can with a very Good Conscience put my hand to This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face;<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
for I have really All Those Peaceable and Compassionate
Dispositions about me, at This Instant, that the very Author of
the Letter would be thought to have; so that we may proceed,
I think, without any more Ceremony.</p>
            <p>I am neither <hi>surprized</hi> nor <hi>provoked,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter.</note> to see that in the condition you
were put into by the <hi>Laws,</hi> and the ill circumstances you lay under, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>Exclusion</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> laid to your Charge, you were desirous
to make your selves less <hi>uneasie</hi> and obnoxious to <hi>Authority.</hi> Men who are
sore, run to the nearest Remedy with too much haste, to consider all the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41026:3"/>
consequences: Grains of allowance are to be given, where Nature giveth
such strong Influences. When to Men under Sufferings it offereth Ease,
the present Pain will hardly allow time to examine the <hi>Remedies;</hi> and
the strongest Reason can hardly gain a fair Audience from our Mind,
whilst so possessed, till the smart is a little allayed.</p>
            <p>THere's a Plain,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and a Short Proverb, that may serve for a
<hi>Paraphrase</hi> upon This Clause. <hi>[Out of the Frying-Pan into the
Fire.]</hi> The <hi>Dissenters,</hi> it seems, were <hi>Vneasie</hi> under the <hi>Penal
Laws; Vnsafe</hi> under Certain <hi>Criminal Imputations;</hi> And, in This
Distress, like Drowning Men, they laid hold of Any thing that
came next to Hand; Mistook their Way and their Measures, for
want of Time to <hi>Look before they Leapt.</hi> The Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fancies them in a Streight; And then to Deliver them from a
Calamity of his Own Creating, Charitably puts in, and Pities
them; Supposes some very Dangerous Miscarriage; Assigns the
Reason of it, and at the Same Time Furnishes the Excuse. The
<hi>Innuendo</hi> of the <hi>Whole</hi> is Briefly <hi>This,</hi> that <hi>Matters are in an Evil
State,</hi> and <hi>that the Severities of the Government have been the Cause
on't;</hi> which are Two Dangerous Points to be Injected into Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
heads at This Time of the day: But, This is only an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
Preparatory to make way for somewhat more Considerable
that is to follow. He speaks of the <hi>Dissenters</hi> running to the
<hi>Nearest Remedy;</hi> which, Under favour, is a Mistake, if he Means
the King's <hi>Declaration of Indulgence;</hi> for <hi>That Remedy</hi> came to
<hi>Them.</hi> And so in his Following <hi>Allegory.</hi> If it holds in <hi>State,</hi>
as it does in <hi>Physick,</hi> the <hi>Patient</hi> is not to <hi>Examine</hi> the <hi>Remedy,</hi>
but to <hi>Observe</hi> the <hi>Prescription.</hi> And now to the <hi>Next Paragraph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not know whether the Warmth that naturally belongeth to <hi>New
Friendships</hi> may not make it a Harder Task for me to perswade you.<note place="margin">Letter.</note> It
is like telling Lovers, in the Beginning of their Joys, that they will in a
Little Time have an End. Such an unwelcome Style doth not easily find
Credit: But I will suppose you are not so far gone in your <hi>New Passion,</hi>
but that you will Hear still; and therefore I am under the Less Discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement,
when I offer to your Consideration <hi>Two Things.</hi> The <hi>First</hi>
is, the Cause you have to <hi>suspect</hi> your <hi>New Friends.</hi> The <hi>Second,</hi>
the <hi>Duty</hi> incumbent upon you, in <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> not to
Hazard the <hi>Publick Safety,</hi> neither by Desire of <hi>Ease,</hi> nor of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:41026:4"/>
WE are here Past Insensibly,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and in the Course of Six Lines
from the Present Compliances of the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> Purely for the
Sake of <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> to <hi>the Warmth of a New Friendship,</hi> and of a
<hi>New Passion;</hi> which is such a kind of Leap, as if a <hi>Cripple,</hi> for being
delivered from the <hi>Lash,</hi> should fall in love with the <hi>Beadle.</hi> I must
needs take Notice now, in This Place, by Anticipation, of a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
in the Next Clause, where the Gentleman tells the <hi>Dissenters,</hi>
that <hi>[These New Friends did not make them their</hi> Choice <hi>but their</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge;]
Which Implies, that the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> have not half the
Kindness for the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> have for the <hi>Roman
Catholiques:</hi> For at the rate of <hi>[the Warmth of This New Friendship]</hi>
and This <hi>[New Passion,]</hi> the <hi>Dissenters</hi> must be understood to make
the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> rather their <hi>Choice,</hi> than their <hi>Refuge.</hi> So
that according to this Proportion of Reasoning, the <hi>Dissenters</hi>
must Relinquish, both their <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Inclination,</hi> or there's No
Good to be done upon them. But however, If they be not either
too <hi>Sturdy,</hi> or too <hi>Stately,</hi> to Hearken to <hi>Reason,</hi> Here are <hi>Two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals</hi>
laid before them: The <hi>One,</hi> of <hi>Caution,</hi> Founded upon
<hi>[the Cause they have to suspect their New Friends:]</hi> The <hi>Other,</hi> of
<hi>Duty,</hi> both in <hi>Christianity</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> not to Sacrifice the <hi>Publick
Peace,</hi> either to their <hi>Ease,</hi> or <hi>Revenge.</hi> Here is, in these Two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
not only Subject-Matter for the kindling of <hi>Jealousies,</hi> and
for the Irritating of <hi>Fears,</hi> and <hi>Apprehensions</hi> in the <hi>Consequences</hi> of
Things; But <hi>Misunderstandings Dictated,</hi> and <hi>Inculcated</hi> in <hi>Express
Terms,</hi> which cannot possibly fail of moving <hi>Vnquiet Thoughts,</hi> and
of Dissolving the Common Tyes of <hi>Faith, Friendship,</hi> and <hi>Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
by making <hi>Parties</hi> and <hi>Factions;</hi> and <hi>stirring Animosities</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Kings Good Subjects.</p>
            <p>To speak One Word now to the Duty of Consulting the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
Safety,</hi> the Question will be shortly this, Whether the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
end of <hi>Peace,</hi> with a Respect to <hi>Civil</hi> Matters, (for here's no
talk of <hi>Religion)</hi> be not more likely to be <hi>Compass'd</hi> and <hi>Preserv'd,</hi>
by <hi>Vniting</hi> His Majesties Liege People, than by <hi>Dividing</hi> them? It
is time now to go forward to the <hi>Animadversions,</hi> and <hi>Reasonings</hi>
that the Ingenious Author shall be pleased to Pass upon his <hi>Two
Last Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the First:<note place="margin">Letter.</note> Consider, that notwithstanding the <hi>Smooth Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
which is now put on to Engage you, These new Friends did not
make you their <hi>Choice,</hi> but their <hi>Refuge:</hi> They have ever made their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41026:4"/>
               <hi>First</hi> Courtships to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and when they were rejected
there, they made their Application to you in the <hi>Second</hi> Place. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of This might be given in All Times. I do not Repeat them,
because whatsoever is Vnnecessary, must be Tedious; the Truth of this
Assertion being so Plain, as not to admit a Dispute. You cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
reasonably Flatter your selves, that there is any <hi>Inclination</hi> to You.
They never pretended to Allow <hi>You</hi> any <hi>Quarter,</hi> but to Vsher in <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
for <hi>Themselves,</hi> under That <hi>Shelter.</hi> I refer you to Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi>
Letters, and the <hi>Journals</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> where you may be
Convinced, if you can be so Mistaken, as to Doubt. Nay, at this very
Hour, they can hardly forbear, in the height of their Courtship, to let
fall <hi>Hard Words</hi> of you. So little is Nature to be restrained: It will
start out some times, disdaining to submit to the Vsurpation of <hi>Art</hi> and
<hi>Interest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are left mightily in the Dark here,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> how to understand his
<hi>[Smooth Language]</hi> and his <hi>[New Friends;] Where</hi> we are to
<hi>Look</hi> for the <hi>One,</hi> and <hi>How</hi> we are to <hi>Distinguish</hi> the <hi>Other.</hi> If his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be, that the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> are making Fair Weather with
the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and withal, that the <hi>Dissenters</hi> are to Blame to
Close with them, he should do well to have a Care of his <hi>Characters;</hi>
for a Man can very hardly Reflect a <hi>Scandal</hi> upon the <hi>Whole Party,</hi>
without wounding their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Master.</hi> I would fain know, if the
<hi>King Himself</hi> does not fall within the Compass of One of Those <hi>New
Friends;</hi> or rather how it is possible it should be <hi>Otherwise,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Particular Saving</hi> and <hi>Exception</hi> out of That Number. He
speaks of Those <hi>New Friends</hi> that have ever made their <hi>First</hi>
Courtships to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I would he had but told us
<hi>Where, When,</hi> and <hi>How;</hi> Or what Commission they had for the
making of These Overtures from <hi>One Community</hi> to <hi>Another:</hi> But
whether they <hi>Did,</hi> or whether they did <hi>Not,</hi> comes all to a Case,
tho for the sake of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> I must needs say that <hi>[EVER]</hi>
goes a little too far: For in That Great Revolution of the Long
Rebellion, the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Joyned in a
Common Act of <hi>Prudence, Interest,</hi> and <hi>Conscience,</hi> to Meet them
Half Way: Or if there were any <hi>Priority</hi> of Respect in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it was on the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Side. I speak of the <hi>Old
Rebellion,</hi> when the Members of Both Churches fell by the Sides
One of Another in the Common Defence of their <hi>Prince,</hi> and
their <hi>Country;</hi> their <hi>Honour</hi> and their <hi>Allegeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:41026:5"/>
But when the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> were rejected there, they made
their Application to the <hi>Dissenters</hi> in the <hi>Second</hi> Place, he says;
and made them not their <hi>Choice,</hi> but their <hi>Refuge,</hi> without any
Inclination for them at all. Well! And whether the <hi>Church of
England-Men</hi> Reject the <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> or the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
Reject the <hi>Church of England-Men,</hi> 'tis Just <hi>as Broad as it is
Long;</hi> for Whethersoever of the <hi>Two</hi> stands in need of a <hi>Third
Interest;</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> of the <hi>Perswasion,</hi> but the <hi>Strength</hi>
of the <hi>Allye</hi> that He considers: And what matters it for an <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of <hi>Kindness,</hi> where <hi>Necessity</hi> Creates an <hi>Inclination</hi> that does
the Office of an Inclination by <hi>Nature?</hi> What's more Ordinary,
than for Two Mortal Enemies to Joyn in a Common Defence,
for the Mutual Preservation One of Another? And I never met
with any Man yet since I was born, that made it a <hi>Casuistical Moot-Point,</hi>
Whether a Man might Lawfully submit, to have his <hi>Life,
Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> Preserved by a Man of <hi>Another Opinion.</hi> This
Gentleman tells the <hi>Dissenters</hi> that the <hi>Papists</hi> have No Kindness for
them, and that they are not their <hi>Choice,</hi> but their <hi>Refuge.</hi> Now
if This be <hi>Our Author's Own Case,</hi> (as by the Ayre of his Paper
it appears to be) the Argument that he has Advanc'd against the
<hi>New Friends,</hi> as he Calls them, holds Every Jot as good against
Himself: And the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> with whom he has to do, have All-out
as good Reason to Suspect the <hi>One,</hi> as the <hi>Other.</hi> He is pleased
to Appeal to <hi>Coleman</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> and the <hi>Parliament Journals,</hi> though
the <hi>One</hi> makes not at all for him, and the <hi>Other</hi> seems in some
Respects to be Point-Blank Against him. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Business was
a <hi>Common Liberty,</hi> without Meditating any Act of <hi>Violence</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</hi>
And then if the <hi>Journals</hi> be set One against Another, and
a Design of <hi>Vniting Protestants</hi> in a General License, opposed to
the <hi>Vniting</hi> of <hi>Protestants,</hi> in a strict Conformity to the <hi>Rubriek</hi>
and <hi>Canons,</hi> they will do the Cause that This Gentleman has a-foot,
at least as much Hurt as Good. What signifies the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that <hi>[the</hi> Papists <hi>can hardly forbear in the height of their
Courtships to let fall Hard Words of the</hi> Dissenters,] If this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
even in the Height of his Courtship, finds himself apt to
Speak, or to Think <hi>Hardly</hi> of them too? He says Extremely
Well at last, in Contemplation of the Difficulty of Restraining
<hi>Nature,</hi> [She <hi>Disdains</hi> (he says) to submit to the <hi>Vsurpation</hi> of
<hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Interest.]</hi> This he <hi>Says,</hi> and This he <hi>Proves,</hi> in the same
<hi>Breath,</hi> and <hi>Paper;</hi> for in despight of All the <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of
This Discourse, his <hi>Inclination</hi> shews it self, and his <hi>Nature</hi> breaks
through the Disguise.</p>

This Allyance between <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter.</note> is bringing together
the Two most contrary things that are in the World. The Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> doth not only <hi>dislike</hi> the allowing <hi>Liberty,</hi> but by its <hi>Principles</hi>
it <hi>cannot</hi> do it. Wine is not more expresly forbidden to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
than giving <hi>Hereticks, Liberty,</hi> is to <hi>Papists:</hi> They are no more able
to make good their Vows to you, than Men Married before, and their
Wife alive, can confirm their Contract with another. The Continuance
of their Kindness would be a Habit of Sin, of which they are to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and their Absolution is to be had upon no other Terms, than their
Promise to destroy you. You are therefore to be <hi>Hugged</hi> now, only that
you may be the better <hi>Squeezed</hi> at another time. There must be something
Extraordinary, when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> setteth up <hi>Bills,</hi> and offereth
<hi>Plaisters,</hi> for <hi>Tender Consciences:</hi> By all that hath hitherto appeared,
her Skill in Chirurgery lyeth chiefly in a Quick Hand, to cut off Limbs;
but she is the worst at Healing, of any that ever pretended to it.</p>
            <p>HEre's a Splendid,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> and a Fallacious Amusement, in the First Line;
and it is Plausibly enough Pursued too; but Inevitably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with the Fate of All Things that are <hi>Built</hi> upon a <hi>False Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.
Supposing [LIBERTY,]</hi> and <hi>[INFALLIBILITY,]</hi> as the Matter
is here set forth, and Assum'd, to be the Present Point before us, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Question of <hi>Competition,</hi> or <hi>Consistence.</hi> Upon this <hi>Supposal,</hi> I
say, All the Following Cost, and Figure, for the Dazling of
<hi>Weak Eyes,</hi> and the Transporting of <hi>Impotent Affections,</hi> is very
well Bestowed upon it: But if <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> shall fall
out in This Case, to be <hi>Nothing a-kin;</hi> The <hi>One,</hi> to be a <hi>Civil</hi>
Point; The <hi>Other,</hi> a <hi>Religious;</hi> And the <hi>One,</hi> in short, to Differ
as much from the <hi>Other,</hi> as <hi>Doctrine</hi> does from <hi>Practice,</hi> or the
<hi>Exercise</hi> of a <hi>Secular Power,</hi> from a <hi>Theological Perswasion;</hi> Why
then This <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility, Truly Vnderstood,</hi> and <hi>Rightly
Distinguished,</hi> may very well stand together, and the Holding of
the <hi>One Opinion,</hi> does not at all Clash with Permitting the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise</hi>
of the <hi>Other.</hi> This Specious Sparkling Way of Reasoning
will have little more in't at last, than what we see Every Day in
the Skill and Address of <hi>Bird-catching,</hi> where <hi>the Twinkling of the
Glass brings the Lark Dancing down into the Net.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man that would put his Thoughts, and his Wits upon the
Stretch, might Enlarge till <hi>Doomsday,</hi> upon the Text of <hi>LIBERTY</hi>
and <hi>INFALLIBILITY.</hi> But I am for speaking <hi>Plain, Home,</hi> and in <hi>Few
Words,</hi>
to the Stress of the Subject in hand, rather than squand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41026:6"/>
away more Time and Paper than needs, in Talking it out
at <hi>Length.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman-Catholique-INFALLIBILITY,</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY</hi>
are the Two Hinges of the Controversie here in Debate. Put them
<hi>On, Right,</hi> and the <hi>Door Opens,</hi> or <hi>Shuts,</hi> with All the Ease in the World;
But if This Gentleman will needs set them on <hi>a-Cross,</hi> and then
<hi>Exclayme</hi> against them as <hi>[the most Contrary Things in the World]</hi>
when it is the Fault of the <hi>Workman,</hi> not of the <hi>Hinges,</hi> that the
<hi>One</hi> Hinders the <hi>Other,</hi> from doing its <hi>Proper Office.</hi> What help
for't! This is an Error in the <hi>Speculation</hi> of the Thing, that we
see Dayly <hi>Disprov'd,</hi> and <hi>Contradicted,</hi> in <hi>Fact;</hi> And it must be a
very <hi>Gross Partiality,</hi> that shall take upon it self to support <hi>Fancy</hi>
against <hi>Experiment.</hi> Now if the <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> here <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
Intended,</hi> and <hi>Designed,</hi> be quite Another Thing than the
<hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Infallibility</hi> that lies Naturally within the Compass of
<hi>This Question,</hi> all the <hi>Flowers</hi> that are here Employed for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending,</hi>
and the <hi>Garnishing</hi> of <hi>This Topique,</hi> how Artificially soever,
must not be Allowed to come up yet to the Least Colour of a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>
or an <hi>Argument,</hi> for any thing that hitherto appears.</p>
            <p>The First Query toward the Discussing of This Question, will,
in One Word, be <hi>This.</hi> What does This Gentleman mean by
<hi>[LIBERTY?]</hi> Why does he not give some <hi>Standard</hi> of it? Is it a
<hi>Determinate,</hi> or an <hi>Vnlimited Liberty?</hi> Why is it not <hi>Ascertain'd,</hi> that
a Body may see <hi>Thorough</hi> it? For how shall any Man take upon
him to make a <hi>Reasonable Discourse,</hi> upon an <hi>Vnknown Meaning?</hi> If
he Means <hi>Liberty of CONSCIENCE,</hi> with a Respect to the Present
Circumstances of the <hi>Dissenters;</hi> His Majesties Gracious Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>April</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> Last Past, will most Explicity Adjust <hi>That</hi>
Point, in These Following Words:</p>
            <p>We have thought fit, by Vertue of our <hi>ROYAL PREROGATIVE,</hi>
to Issue forth This our Declaration of <hi>Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that it is a <hi>Liberty,</hi> Granted by <hi>Vertue,</hi> and in the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>His
Majesties ROYAL RREROGATIVE:</hi> A <hi>Civil Liberty</hi> to Meet for a
<hi>Religious Worship;</hi> Or in the <hi>Words</hi> of the <hi>Declaration</hi> it self, For <hi>[the
Free Exercise of their Religion.]</hi> The Plain <hi>English</hi> of the Case is This;
The <hi>Dissenters</hi> find themselves <hi>Aggriev'd</hi> for want of <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science:</hi>
And why? But because they cannot <hi>Meet</hi> to <hi>Worship</hi> God
in their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> as they say, they reckon themselves <hi>Bound</hi> to do.
This <hi>Restraint</hi> makes them <hi>Vneasie;</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> lies <hi>Heavy</hi> upon
them; and they have no Means of Relief but by the <hi>Kings Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending</hi>
the <hi>Execution</hi> of the Penalties in That Case Provided, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41026:6"/>
Exerting His <hi>Sovereign Authority</hi> in Their <hi>Favour.</hi> Now Every
Body knows it for a <hi>Principle</hi> that is Rooted in the very <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of <hi>Government</hi> it self, That <hi>All Publique Assemblies;</hi> That is
to say, the <hi>Indicting,</hi> the <hi>Inhibiting,</hi> the <hi>Adjourning, Proroguing, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing,</hi>
or <hi>Dissolving</hi> of them, are <hi>Entirely,</hi> and <hi>Incommunicably,</hi>
at the <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> of the <hi>Supreme Magistrate.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi>
in the Right of This <hi>Power, Allows</hi> his People to <hi>Meet,</hi> to the End
that they may <hi>Worship.</hi> The <hi>Dispensation</hi> respects the <hi>Freedom</hi> of
<hi>Assembling,</hi> not the <hi>Articles</hi> of every Particular Congregation's
<hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Creed.</hi> His Majesty Grants <hi>so much,</hi> as by His <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
he <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>not One Jot more;</hi> for <hi>All Humane Acts whatsoever,</hi>
are, to All Purposes <hi>Void,</hi> when they come to break in once upon
the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Nature:</hi> So that here's neither <hi>Ground,
Place,</hi> nor <hi>Pretence,</hi> for an <hi>Immoral,</hi> or an <hi>Vnrighteous Liberty:</hi> And
if the Gentleman, in <hi>This Paragraph,</hi> speaks of a <hi>Boundles,</hi> and of an
<hi>Indefinite Licence,</hi> it neither <hi>IS,</hi> neither <hi>CAN</hi> it be, neither can it be
<hi>SVPPOSED</hi> to be, the <hi>Case</hi> that is here in <hi>Agitation.</hi> It Involves
a <hi>Nullity,</hi> to <hi>Imagine</hi> it so; and it Imports a <hi>Tacit Censure of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
even so much as to <hi>Insinuate</hi> that it was ever <hi>Intended</hi> so: For
<hi>No power upon Earth Can either Discharge, or so much as Suspend, the
Over-ruling Dictates, and Sentences, of Equity, and of Right Reason</hi>
Now 'tis no Wonder, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will never Endure a
<hi>Liberty</hi> of This <hi>Latitude;</hi> for neither will any <hi>Christian Church</hi> that
ever was upon the Face of the Earth, Endure it; for it would be
All one with the Over-ruling both of <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Gospel;</hi> and the
Destroying of <hi>Religion it self,</hi> as well as <hi>Christianity</hi> at a <hi>Blow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if a <hi>Liberty,</hi> in <hi>This Extent</hi> cannot so much as be <hi>Imagin'd,</hi>
without a most <hi>Vncharitable,</hi> and a <hi>Dangerous Scandal;</hi> it must, in
<hi>Common Honesty,</hi> be taken for <hi>Granted,</hi> that the <hi>Author</hi> of This
Letter speaks only of a <hi>Liberty,</hi> within a <hi>Reasonable,</hi> and a <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Compass:</hi> So that to <hi>Acquit</hi> him of the <hi>Calumny,</hi> I find my self
Obliged to <hi>Mind</hi> him of a <hi>Seeming Contradiction.</hi> There is a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi>
that is <hi>Evil in it self,</hi> with a Respect to the Matter that it is
Conversant about: And there is a <hi>Liberty,</hi> that is <hi>Evil,</hi> because it is
<hi>Prohibited.</hi> The <hi>Former</hi> is <hi>Indispensable;</hi> and All the Powers under
the Sun can never make it <hi>Warrantable.</hi> The <hi>Latter</hi> was left <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
till <hi>Authority Restrained</hi> it; and the <hi>same Authority</hi> may
set it at <hi>Liberty Again.</hi> So that the <hi>Liberty</hi> here spoken of, is an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
Liberty;</hi> That is to say, a <hi>Liberty</hi> totally Depending upon
the <hi>Political Judgment</hi> of the <hi>Sovereign Magistrate;</hi> Whether to
<hi>Grant</hi> it or <hi>Not;</hi> How <hi>Far;</hi> In What <hi>Cases;</hi> To what <hi>Parties;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:41026:7"/>
Under What <hi>Limitations</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Conditions:</hi> But whether <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable,</hi>
or <hi>Not Allowable; Protestants,</hi> it seems, may set up their
Rest upon't, that <hi>Hereticks</hi> are to expect <hi>No Quarter; No Liberty,</hi>
from <hi>Papists:</hi> Nay our Author is of Opinion, that they esteem
Themselves under a most <hi>Conscientious Obligation</hi> to <hi>Destroy Vs.</hi> The
Late Havock that has been made among the <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi>
Concludes Nothing against the Judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
concerning the Liberties and Privileges that they Enjoyed there
in <hi>Former Times.</hi> To say nothing of the <hi>Freedom</hi> they are Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
in <hi>Divers Other Places,</hi> where they live <hi>Intermixt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There will be No Great Difficulty, I hope, to bring the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Yield, that the <hi>Fact</hi> is clearly <hi>Against</hi> him; but if upon the
<hi>Penning,</hi> and the <hi>Couching</hi> of This Clause, he had not so Totally
Indulg'd his <hi>Inclination,</hi> as not to Look Forward into the <hi>Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
of his <hi>Discourse:</hi> If, I say, he had not so eagerly <hi>Press'd</hi> and
<hi>Pursued</hi> the Point he had in his <hi>Eye,</hi> without Considering <hi>Whither
he was a-going,</hi> or the <hi>Precipices</hi> that he had before him, he might
have seen more Hazards than One, that were likely to Ensue upon
his taking of <hi>This Biass.</hi> And God Grant, that the Author of This
Paper, may not be found to have been One of the Number that
has formerly fall'n upon <hi>Mee,</hi> without <hi>Mercy,</hi> for a <hi>Doctrine, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously</hi>
laid to <hi>My Charge,</hi> and which he himself does Manifestly
Enforce, and <hi>Suggest,</hi> in this very <hi>Paragraph.</hi> It made a Heavy
Noise for One While, since the Coming of His Sacred Majesty to
the Crown, that I should hold forth in an <hi>Observator,</hi> That <hi>[All
Subjects were Bound to be of their Princes Religion]</hi> which I never
<hi>Wrote, Said,</hi> or <hi>Thought,</hi> since I was Born: But I <hi>have</hi> been, and
am <hi>still,</hi> and I doubt not but that I shall <hi>ever</hi> be, fully Perswaded,
that the <hi>Conscience</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> is the <hi>same</hi> upon <hi>All Subjects,</hi> let the
<hi>Religion</hi> of their <hi>Lawful Sovereign</hi> be what it will: And I say further,
that there is a <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Allegeance,</hi> as well as of <hi>Faith.</hi> But to
what I was about to say.</p>
            <p>Here is a Point Agitated betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> with an Eye to the <hi>Liberty</hi> that the <hi>Latter,</hi> at This
Time <hi>pretend</hi> to, and <hi>Enjoy.</hi> Now <hi>This Liberty</hi> is an Act of <hi>State;</hi>
And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> can have Nothing to do with it, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than by the <hi>Influence,</hi> which our Author possibly Supposes
they may have upon His Majesty: So that there can be <hi>No Vnfair
Dealing</hi> in the Matter; but in such a Manner, that, some way or
other, Our Master must be made a <hi>Party</hi> to't. The <hi>Dissenters</hi> have
a <hi>Common Right</hi> to the <hi>Equity</hi> of His Majesties Gracious Promises,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41026:7"/>
and <hi>Assurances,</hi> Exhibited in the Aforesaid <hi>Declaration:</hi> So that
they are <hi>All</hi> as safe, as the Word of a King in a <hi>Royal Act of Grace,
Sign'd, Seal'd,</hi> and <hi>Deliver'd</hi> in the Presence of <hi>God, Angels,</hi> and
<hi>Men,</hi> can Make'em. If This be the very State of the Bus'ness, how
<hi>Vain,</hi> how <hi>Vngrateful,</hi> and how <hi>Vnprofitable,</hi> is it, for Any Subject
but to Grumble, as if he <hi>Doubted</hi> the <hi>Performance!</hi> Nay, and how
<hi>Foolish,</hi> Over and Above; for <hi>One Medling Protestant,</hi> to <hi>Provoke</hi>
the <hi>Ruine,</hi> and the <hi>Inconvenience</hi> of <hi>All the Rest!</hi> I will hope af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
All, that a Good Part of This Matter dropt from the <hi>Author</hi>
in his <hi>Sleep:</hi> For if That which he Delivers in This Place, for
the <hi>Conscientious Doctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he, in <hi>Truth,</hi>
so as he <hi>Affirms</hi> it to be, the <hi>Inference</hi> Undenyable that Results from
it, is This; That <hi>His Majesty thinks himself Bound in Conscience, to
Destroy All Religions but his Own;</hi> Which would be certainly One
of the most <hi>Pernicious Impressions,</hi> if it should once take Root a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Common People,</hi> that was ever thrown into the <hi>Mouths</hi> of
the <hi>Multitude;</hi> and the most <hi>Destructive</hi> of All <hi>Communities.</hi> But
we have (God be praised for it) for our <hi>Infallible Security,</hi> not
only the Solemnity of <hi>Assurances,</hi> and <hi>Declarations,</hi> but the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable
<hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Great,</hi> a <hi>Just,</hi> and a <hi>Wise Prince,</hi> whose
<hi>Internal Honour, Generosity,</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> are <hi>Ten Thousand Guards

Above, to Watch over, both <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There lay a Great Stress upon This Section; and I had rather be
<hi>Tedious,</hi> than speak to't by <hi>Halves.</hi> As for <hi>Hugging</hi> and <hi>Squeezing,</hi> 'tis
no more than a Common Trick of <hi>Policy,</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> A Man helps
his <hi>Friend</hi> up the <hi>Ladder;</hi> And has his <hi>Teeth</hi> Dash'd out for his Pains.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[There must be something Extraordinary</hi> (he says) <hi>when the Church
of</hi> Rome <hi>setteth up Bills, and offereth Plaisters for Tender Consciences.]</hi>
And truly I am content to Agree with the <hi>Metaphorical Author,</hi>
that there <hi>Is</hi> something in't, that is <hi>very Extraordinary;</hi> And I'le
speak Freely to't, when I come to't: But a Word by the Way;
If this Gentleman be a True Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as
by the Ayre and Humour of his Discourse he would appear to be)
there is something <hi>Extraordinary</hi> in the <hi>Church-of-England-Man's-Case,</hi>
as well as in the <hi>Papists;</hi> And it is No Ordinary Thing for
<hi>Him,</hi> to be <hi>Billing</hi> of it Neither: Beside that it is not <hi>Fair,</hi> for
<hi>One</hi> Man to find Fault with what <hi>Another</hi> does, and yet do the
<hi>Same Thing</hi> Himself. As to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Skill,</hi> or <hi>No
Skill,</hi> either in <hi>Cutting</hi> or in <hi>Healing,</hi> I can say little more, than that

some of <hi>Our Good People</hi> have shewed themselves <hi>Master-Operators,</hi>
within the <hi>Memory of Man,</hi> in the very way of <hi>Amputation</hi> too;
whereever they learnt the <hi>Trade:</hi> though the <hi>PRETENDED
Murder</hi> of a <hi>IVSTICE,</hi> by the <hi>Papists,</hi> has put the <hi>ACTVAL
Murder</hi> of a <hi>PRINCE,</hi> quite out of Countenance. What shall
I do now? for This Chapter hangs yet upon my Fingers; and I
cannot get off, without another Touch upon the Subject of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
By which <hi>LIBERTY,</hi> I <hi>mean TOLERATION.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No man perhaps, has Spoil'd more Paper upon This Argument,
than my self; No man has been more for the Upholding of the
<hi>Rubrick,</hi> and <hi>Canons;</hi> No man more for the keeping of People up
to the <hi>Stated Articles,</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of our <hi>Communion;</hi> And I am
the same Man in my Principles at This Day, that ever I was;
Though upon a Change of Circumstances, I have likewise Vary'd
my Judgment, with a respect to <hi>Hic, &amp; Nunc,</hi> as to That Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
For I take it to be Mightily <hi>Another Case,</hi> under a Prince
of the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> from what it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Prince of the <hi>English</hi> Communion. My <hi>Religion</hi> is in every
Point the <hi>Same;</hi> But That which <hi>Was</hi> the <hi>Interest</hi> of That <hi>Religion,</hi>
in <hi>Former</hi> Times, is in some Innocent Respects, no <hi>Longer</hi> so.
The <hi>Strictness,</hi> and <hi>Rigour,</hi> that was <hi>Laudable,</hi> and <hi>Meritorious,</hi>
in the <hi>One</hi> Case, would be <hi>Vnmannerly,</hi> and <hi>Provoking,</hi> in the <hi>Other.</hi>
If I had had my Option, upon the late Mighty Change, the
<hi>Church-of-England-Men,</hi> as an <hi>Acknowledgment,</hi> as a <hi>Respect,</hi> and
for Twenty Reasons Beside, should have Presented His Majesty
with All Honourable Assurances of <hi>Freedom</hi> for his <hi>Own People,</hi>
even without so much as <hi>Capitulating</hi> for <hi>Themselves.</hi> First, as an
Act of <hi>Necessary Prudence;</hi> For <hi>Authority</hi> had the Better End of the
Staff; And there was Nothing to be <hi>Gotten,</hi> by Contesting and
Strugling; but much to be <hi>Lost</hi> by't. <hi>2ly.</hi> As a Testimonial of
<hi>Reverence,</hi> and of <hi>Thankfulness;</hi> for it would have been no more
than what was Due, from a <hi>Subject</hi> to a <hi>Prince,</hi> upon the Matter of
<hi>Deference,</hi> and <hi>Resignation.</hi> There would have been No Point of
<hi>Religion</hi> Yielded; Not the Least Scruple of any Nicety of <hi>Conscience</hi>
Departed from; but it would have made the King, and the
King's Friends of the same Communion, <hi>Easie,</hi> and <hi>Happy.</hi> It
would also have been a Retribution of Gratitude; and a Verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Kings Opinion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by their
Practice. The Words ought, not only to be Recorded in the
Journals, both of the Parliament, and of the Council; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in the Hearts of all his Majesties Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:41026:8"/>
I know the Principles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are for <hi>Monarchy;</hi>
and the <hi>Members</hi> of it have shewed themselves <hi>Good,</hi> and <hi>Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;</hi>
Therefore I shall always take Care to Defend and Support it.</p>
            <p>These were his Present Majesties Words at his First Sitting in
the Privy Council, after the Death of the Late Blessed King: And
These Words are to be made Good, in <hi>Honour, Duty,</hi> and <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment,</hi>
without <hi>Deliberating,</hi> or <hi>Starting,</hi> by <hi>Every Man that
Professes himself a Member of That Church. 3ly</hi> We could not
better have Consulted our own <hi>Peace, Freedom,</hi> and <hi>Security;</hi> for
it is the Natural <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of the Thing, to <hi>Allow,</hi> as
we would be <hi>Allowed;</hi> and not to Do Any thing to <hi>Others,</hi> that
we should be Unwilling to see Turn'd upon <hi>our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is likewise a Fourth Reason, over and above All Those
before mentioned, to Oblige us as <hi>Christians,</hi> and as men of <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Common Justice.</hi> It is now a Long Time
since, that we have found the <hi>Pretended Popish Conspiracy</hi> to be an
<hi>Imposture,</hi> and a <hi>Subornation;</hi> And I would put it to the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
of Every man, that has either by the <hi>Press,</hi> the <hi>Barr,</hi> the
<hi>Pulpit,</hi> (or I could go Higher if I pleased) Contributed to the
<hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Villany,</hi> Whether he be not <hi>Bound</hi> to make his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi>
and his <hi>Retractation,</hi> as <hi>Publique,</hi> as ever his <hi>Seduction</hi>
was? If he has Caused Many People to <hi>Believe</hi> a <hi>Lye;</hi> a <hi>Sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Lye;</hi> a <hi>Lye</hi> that has drawn <hi>Innocent Bloud</hi> after it; He is
<hi>No True Church-of-England-Man,</hi> if he does not <hi>Openly Confess</hi> it;
<hi>Declare</hi> it; and make All the <hi>Publique Satisfaction</hi> for it that the
Matter will bear; If he does not Endeavour the Setting of as
many People <hi>Right</hi> again, as his <hi>Example, Authority</hi> and <hi>Doctrine</hi>
had led out of the Way; He's No <hi>True Penitent;</hi> No <hi>Right Honest
Man;</hi> and I might add to't, that he's no <hi>True-Christian;</hi> An <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite</hi>
of <hi>Bloud</hi> is the <hi>Worst</hi> of <hi>Hypocrites;</hi> and the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it
Sticks to his <hi>Conscience,</hi> as well as the <hi>Gore</hi> of it to his <hi>Chops,</hi>
'till he has <hi>Wash'd his Mouth.</hi> And it is not enough neither, where
Men have been Falsly Sworn out of their <hi>Lives,</hi> for the <hi>Believers</hi>
of those Perjuries, and Consequently the <hi>Promoters</hi> of the <hi>Credit</hi>
of them; and Consequently yet once again, the <hi>Accessoryes</hi> (with

they <hi>Were,</hi> to the <hi>False Witnesses.)</hi> It is not enough, I say,
for a Man under These Circumstances, Barely to Clap his Hand
upon his Breast, and say <hi>The Lord Forgive me; for I have Innocent
Bloud to Answer for.</hi> No, not if he should make <hi>Proclamation</hi> of

by <hi>Future Kindnesses,</hi> and <hi>Respects:</hi> As who should say,
<hi>[Gentlemen, we have been Impos'd upon by Perjur'd Villains, to the
Loss of many of your Lives and Liberties, and the Ruine of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,

Vs'd ye like Traytors; For the Love of God let us Live hereafter,
like Loyal Subjects, Friends and Christians.]</hi> In a Word, After

<hi>be very Wary,</hi> how They Hazzard the Following of it with <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the same kind. Prepossessions</hi> and <hi>Jealousies</hi> can never War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
us in the Violation of <hi>Christian Charity:</hi> And so at the Long
Last, I'le go a Step Further now.</p>
            <p>To come so quick from another extream,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> is such an unnatural motion,
that you ought to be upon your Guard; the other day you were <hi>Sons of
Belial,</hi> Now, you are <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> This is a violent change,
and it will be fit for you to pause upon it, before you believe it: If your
features are not altered, neither is their opinion of you, whatever may
be pretended. Do you believe less than you did, that there is <hi>Idolatry</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> sure you do not. See then, how they treat
both in Words and Writing, those who entertain that Opinion. Conclude
from hence, how inconsistent their favour is with this single Article,
except they give you a Dispensation for this too, and by a <hi>Non Obstante,</hi>
secure you that they will not think the worse of you, <hi>p.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>VVHere there is <hi>Reason</hi> for a <hi>Change</hi> for the <hi>Better;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> Where
there is Manifest <hi>Interest</hi> to <hi>Induce</hi> That Change; a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
that such a Change is <hi>Wrought;</hi> and a <hi>Charitable Place</hi> left
to hope the <hi>Best</hi> of things; Where's the <hi>Crime,</hi> or the <hi>Folly</hi> of
Inclining to the <hi>Belief</hi> of such a <hi>Conversion?</hi> If it be the <hi>Dissenters
Interest,</hi> 'tis a Great <hi>Weakness,</hi> in That Respect, not to <hi>come about.</hi>
If they <hi>Declare,</hi> and <hi>Promise</hi> more then they <hi>Intend</hi> to <hi>Perform,</hi> they
Cut their Own Throats, by Playing the <hi>Knaves,</hi> to their <hi>Ruine;</hi>
and by Acting against <hi>Common Honesty,</hi> as well as against <hi>Common
Sense.</hi> Their <hi>Interest</hi> it is, most Undenyably; for they get <hi>Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
Ease</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> by't. If the <hi>Papists</hi> think Better of the
<hi>Dissenters</hi> then they <hi>deserve,</hi> 'tis an Error on the <hi>Right Hand:</hi>
But the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> it seems, that but T'other day were <hi>Sons of
Belial,</hi> are now, all of a sudden, in the Opinion of the <hi>Papists,</hi>
become <hi>Angels of Light.</hi> And is it not just the very same Thing,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41026:9"/>
(at least if the Author of This Letter Judges Aright) from the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters</hi>
to the <hi>Papists,</hi> that it is from the <hi>Papists</hi> to the <hi>Dissenters?</hi> And
where's the Hurt on't, if they are <hi>Both Agreed</hi> to think Better One of
Another, then they were used to do? Or, according to our Author's
Opinion, then Effectually they have Cause to do? Well! But he gives
to Understand, that though the <hi>Papists</hi> have Changed their <hi>Style,</hi>
they have not yet Changed their Thoughts of them: And Then, in
comes a <hi>Philosophical Caution,</hi> not to give <hi>Credit</hi> to <hi>Vnnatural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
that pass from One Extreme to Another at a Stride. If he
had look'd Both ways, he would have found as great <hi>a Leap of
State,</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> Side, as he does of <hi>Inclination</hi> on the <hi>Other:</hi>
For let a Man's Thoughts, and <hi>Purposes,</hi> be never so Sound, and
<hi>Reasonable,</hi> 'tis No <hi>Vnreasonable</hi> Thing yet, to Change Those
Thoughts, and Purposes upon Change of <hi>Accidents,</hi> and <hi>Occasion.</hi>
He says that <hi>the Dissenters Features are not Altered;</hi> but I shall take
leave to say, that the very <hi>Cause it self</hi> is <hi>Alter'd;</hi> and that During
his Majesties <hi>Suspension</hi> of the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> they are, in a Fair
Equity of <hi>Construction,</hi> no longer <hi>Dissenters.</hi> But whether this
Gentleman hits the <hi>Papists Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>Not,</hi> is the teast Part of
the Care of This Paragraph: For the Author seems much more
sollicitous, for fear the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Dissenters</hi> should agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on't
to think <hi>Well</hi> of One Another, then for fear that the <hi>Crafty,
Jugling Papists</hi> should put a <hi>Trick</hi> upon <hi>the Poor Innocent Lambs on the
Other side.</hi> And I would, in One Word more, now put it to the
Authors <hi>Conscience,</hi> Whether the <hi>Papists,</hi> and his <hi>Own,</hi> with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> be not the very <hi>same Case,</hi> and the very
<hi>same Trick.</hi> He would have them stand upon their <hi>Guard,</hi> he says;
but against <hi>What?</hi> And what to <hi>do?</hi> As if <hi>Good Discretion,</hi> and
<hi>Good Nature</hi> could not stand together: As if People could not be
<hi>Prudent,</hi> without being <hi>Inhumane.</hi> It was <hi>such Hints,</hi> and <hi>Touches</hi>
as <hi>These,</hi> that turn'd the <hi>Hearts,</hi> and the <hi>Brains</hi> of the <hi>Common
People</hi> into <hi>Wax,</hi> to stamp <hi>Forgeries</hi> upon: But God forbid, that
the <hi>same Scene</hi> should Open Once again, and that the <hi>Epilogue</hi>
to <hi>One</hi> Sham, should prove the <hi>Prologue</hi> to <hi>Another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Worthy of Observation, that in All Officious Discourses of
This Quality, there are Certain <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Common-Place,</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd
up and down, that when the <hi>Pen</hi> grows <hi>Dull,</hi> are made use
of, as a Butcher does of his Steel when his <hi>Knife</hi> is <hi>Blunted,</hi> to give
it a <hi>New Edge:</hi> As here's <hi>[IDOLATRY]</hi> brought in, <hi>p.</hi> 2. of the
<hi>Sheet-and-Half-Edition.</hi> And then <hi>p.</hi> 9. he he is pleased to give it
<hi>Another Whet,</hi> upon the <hi>Word [TRANSVBSTANTIATION.]</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:41026:10"/>
Now I do Previously Declare my self to be Perfectly a Church of
<hi>England Man,</hi> upon These Two Points: And yet, saving all Possible
<hi>Veneration</hi> to my <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> to my <hi>Profession,</hi> I cannot
Imagine any other End, or Reason, for the very <hi>Mention</hi> of
<hi>[IDOLATRY]</hi> in This Place, then to <hi>stir the Bloud</hi> of the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Reader,</hi> and to <hi>Brand</hi> the <hi>Romanists,</hi> with a Mark of <hi>Odium,</hi>
and <hi>Reproche.</hi> Here's a <hi>Civil Question</hi> started; Not so much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> and <hi>Dissenters,</hi> with regard to their <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
Perswasions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> as with a Respect to the <hi>Interest</hi> of
the <hi>Common Peace,</hi> and <hi>Safety,</hi> in the <hi>Agreement,</hi> or <hi>Disagreement</hi>
of <hi>These Two Bodies</hi> of His Majesties <hi>Subjects.</hi> And what's This to
the <hi>Polemicks</hi> betwixt the <hi>Two Churches?</hi> The <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques</hi>
Believe as they <hi>Did;</hi> And the <hi>Dissenters</hi> Believe as they
<hi>Did;</hi> So that [the <hi>Papists Favour,</hi> he says, <hi>is Inconsistent with this
Single Article:]</hi> And is not the <hi>Dissenters Favour,</hi> on the other
side, as <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with the <hi>same Article?</hi> So that there's no more
<hi>hope</hi> of <hi>favour</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> side, then there is on the <hi>Other.</hi> Now
if they are Resolv'd, on <hi>Both Sides,</hi> not to Yield, what are All
These <hi>Elaborate Disswasives,</hi> but only <hi>so many Fine Words thrown into
the Air?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Think a little,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> how dangerous it is to build upon a Foundation of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes.
<hi>Popery</hi> now is the only Friend to <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the known <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
to <hi>Persecution:</hi> The Men of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Tiverton,</hi> are above
all other eminent for Loyalty. The <hi>Quakers</hi> from being declared by the
<hi>Papists</hi> not to be <hi>Christians,</hi> are now made <hi>Favourites,</hi> and taken into
their <hi>Particular Protection;</hi> they are on a sudden grown the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
men of the Kingdom in Good Breeding, and give Thanks
with the best Grace, in double Refined Language. So that I should not
wonder, though a Man of that Perswasion, in spight of his <hi>Hat,</hi>
should be <hi>Master of the Ceremonies.</hi> Not to say Harsher Words,
these are such very New Things, that it is impossible not to suspend our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
till by a little more Experience we may be informed whether they are
<hi>Realities,</hi> or <hi>Apparitions:</hi> We have been under shameful Mistakes, if
these Opinions are true; but for the present we are apt to be incredulous;
Except we should be convinced, that the <hi>Priests Words</hi> in <hi>this Case</hi>
too, are able to make such a <hi>sudden</hi> and <hi>effectual Change;</hi> and that
their <hi>Power</hi> is not limited to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but that it extendeth to
<hi>Alter the Nature of all other things,</hi> as often as they are so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
<hi>p.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:41026:10"/>
IT would be Good Advice to the <hi>Author,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> as well as to the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter,</hi>
to Consider <hi>the Danger of Building upon Paradoxes:</hi> For it
is to My Thinking, <hi>Extremely Paradoxal,</hi> to draw Arguments of
<hi>Inclination</hi> from Results of <hi>Necessity;</hi> and to make it an Act of
<hi>Friendship,</hi> for <hi>Two Bodies,</hi> or <hi>Divisions</hi> of Men, that have <hi>Need,
One of Another,</hi> to <hi>shake Hands</hi> upon Certain <hi>Terms</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> of
<hi>Composition.</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> would be at <hi>Liberty;</hi> and so would the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters;</hi>
And I think they should deserve to be Chronicled for <hi>Idiots,</hi>
and <hi>Mad-Men,</hi> not to Unite in any <hi>Common Medium,</hi> with <hi>Justice, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
and a <hi>Good Conscience,</hi> toward their <hi>Joint-Ease,</hi> and <hi>Relief.</hi> And
what's the <hi>Papists Friendship</hi> now, to <hi>Liberty;</hi> but that they would
fain be out of their <hi>Shackles, Themselves?</hi> And what's their <hi>Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to <hi>Persecution,</hi> but a Desire to stand upon <hi>Even Ground,</hi> with the
rest of the <hi>Kings Subjects?</hi> Especially, as they are Entitled to
it by the Kings <hi>Late Indulgence.</hi> God forbid, that any Honest
<hi>English Man</hi> should Envy any of his <hi>Fellow Subjects</hi> the Benefit of
the <hi>Kings Mercy;</hi> because (in Effect) a man can hardly do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some sort of Reflexion upon his Sacred <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness.</hi>
To proceed now from the <hi>Irony</hi> upon <hi>Popery,</hi> to <hi>the Men of</hi> Taunton,
<hi>and</hi> Tiverton; and so to the <hi>Quakers.</hi> It is not Good to <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi>
men that do but so much as <hi>look</hi> towards <hi>Loyalty;</hi> and
though Every body Cannot come up to the Good Breeding that This
Gentleman is pleased to make himself so merry withal; we might
Yet Methinks Arrive at such a Degree of <hi>Moral Civility,</hi> as to
give his Majesty leave to Dispose of his <hi>Own,</hi> without calling him
to <hi>Account</hi> for't. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> (he says) are <hi>the Papists Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi>
And are not the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> (at least as This Letter would
have it Thought to be) the <hi>Favourites</hi> of the <hi>Author?</hi> And so he
goes on still, sporting himself with these People, as <hi>[the Men that
give Thanks with the Best Grace.]</hi> Well! And when his Hand was
In, Why did he not take Notice, of <hi>Those</hi> too, that with a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>Ill Grace,</hi> give <hi>No Thanks at all?</hi> He Cautions the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> to
<hi>suspend</hi> their <hi>Belief</hi> till they know whether the <hi>Papists</hi> are in <hi>Jest,</hi> or
<hi>Earnest:</hi> And why not <hi>Suspend,</hi> as well, 'till they can have the
same Security for the <hi>Good Faith</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> too? <hi>[We have
been under shameful Mistakes</hi> (he says) <hi>if These Opinions are True.]</hi>
And I say, that we have <hi>Seen, Felt, Heard,</hi> and <hi>Vnderstood Mistakes</hi>
much more <hi>shameful</hi> then any of These. Nay, and we have had
<hi>True-Protestant Oaths</hi> for them too, in the <hi>same Case,</hi> and about

            <p>Let me now speak of the Instruments of your Friendship, and then
leave you to judge,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> whether they do not afford matter of Suspicion. No
<hi>Sharpness</hi> is to be mingled where <hi>Healing</hi> only is intended; so nothing
will be said to Expose particular men, how strong soever the Temptation
may be, or how clear the Proofs to make it out. A word or two in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
for your better caution, shall suffice: Suppose then, for Argument's
sake, that the Mediators of this new Alliance, should be such as have
been formerly imployed in Treaties of the same kind, and there detected
to have Acted by Order, and to have been Impowered to give Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
and Rewards. Would not this be an Argument to suspect
them? <hi>P.</hi> 3.</p>

But <hi>[Where</hi> Healing <hi>is only intended, there must be

            <p>I am sorry with all my Heart that this <hi>Healing Humour;</hi> Or at

<hi>Sharpness beyond Measure:</hi> But he is Resolv'd, from Henceforward,

putting of <hi>Cases</hi> and <hi>Cases</hi> allmost to the End of the Chapter.
<hi>Suppose</hi> (says he) that the Present <hi>Mediators,</hi> &amp;c. should be found

            <p>I Answer, First, that <hi>Supposing</hi> is not <hi>Proving. 2ly.</hi> That the
<hi>Supposed</hi> CASE on the <hi>One</hi>-side, till it be made out, is as <hi>Suspicious</hi>
as the <hi>Supposed</hi> PRACTICE on the <hi>Other.</hi> For the <hi>Supposition</hi> of
such a <hi>Practice</hi> may be a <hi>Fiction;</hi> or it may be <hi>Enflam'd,</hi> and
render'd <hi>Bigger</hi> then the <hi>Truth.</hi> 3ly. The <hi>Supposition,</hi> Thus Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
Works Equally, whether it be <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> without
<hi>Farther Evidence.</hi> 4ly. What if it were <hi>True,</hi> so long as it Is
not the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>Instrument,</hi> but the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41026:11"/>
that is to <hi>Govern?</hi> 5ly. 'Tis the <hi>Authority</hi> that must bear out
the <hi>Instrument;</hi> and not a Prejudice to the <hi>Instrument,</hi> that shall
Disparage the <hi>Authority:</hi> And if we cannot pay a <hi>Respect</hi> to the
<hi>Man,</hi> it is yet Due to his <hi>Commission.</hi> 6ly. If the <hi>Suspecting</hi> of
Any man, shall Extend to the <hi>Taking away,</hi> or to the <hi>Lessening</hi> of
his <hi>Credit.</hi> 'Tis in the Power of <hi>any One Man,</hi> to <hi>suspect any
Other,</hi> and No man can be <hi>Safe</hi> in his <hi>Innocence:</hi> Beside that, the
Stress of this Insinuation will put All men out of Capacity for
<hi>Publique Trust,</hi> if it shall but be <hi>Prov'd,</hi> nay, or so much as <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested,</hi>
that ever they made a <hi>False Step,</hi> in their <hi>Lives.</hi> The Next,
and Last Point, Expounds the <hi>Letters soft way of Proceeding,</hi> to
have had more in it of <hi>Prudential Caution,</hi> then of <hi>Tenderness</hi> for
<hi>Particular Persons:</hi> For they must be <hi>Detected,</hi> to have <hi>Acted</hi> by
ORDER; and [ORDER] runs up Stairs the Lord knows
whither.</p>
            <p>If they should plainly be under Engagements to one side,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the other, ought to be received accordingly; their fair Pretences
are to be looked upon as part of their Commission, which may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
give them a Dispensation in the case of Truth, when it may bring
a prejudice upon the Service of those by whom they are imployed. <hi>p.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>THE Short of This <hi>Supposition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> is, that their <hi>Arguments</hi> are
to be <hi>Judg'd</hi> by their <hi>Dependences;</hi> and that they are <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd</hi>
to <hi>Lye,</hi> and <hi>Juggle</hi> for the Service of their <hi>Masters.</hi> These
[IF's] are Deliver'd with the Ayre of a <hi>Patriote,</hi> and with the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>Free-born-English-man;</hi> Like a <hi>Censor Morum in fine.</hi> If
the Gentleman has an <hi>Ambition</hi> to be a <hi>Devote,</hi> for the <hi>Saving,</hi>
or the <hi>Redeeming</hi> of his <hi>Country,</hi> he will <hi>Vnriddle</hi> the <hi>Mystery; Lay
Open</hi> the <hi>Confederacy;</hi> and bring All These <hi>Monsters</hi> out of Their
<hi>Holes,</hi> into Open <hi>Day-light:</hi> Without which, we are so far from
being the <hi>Better;</hi> that in Truth, we are much the <hi>Worse</hi> for his
<hi>Suppositions:</hi> And without This, the Whole Pretended End of his
<hi>Letter to a Dissenter,</hi> is Entirely Disappointed.</p>
            <p>If there should be men who having formerly,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> had Means and Authority
to perswade by Secular Arguments, have in pursuance of that Power,
sprinkled <hi>Money</hi> amongst the <hi>Dissenting Ministers;</hi> and if those very
men should now have the same Authority, practice the same Methods, and
Disburse, where they cannot otherwise perswade: It seemeth to me, to be
rather an Evidence then a Presumption of the Deceit. <hi>P.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:41026:12"/>
If there should be <hi>Ministers</hi> amongst you, who by having fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Temptations of this kind, are in some sort engaged to continue their
Frailty, by the awe they are in lest it should be exposed: The perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of these unfortunate men must sure have the less force, and their
Arguments, though never so specious, are to be suspected, when they
come from men who have Mortgaged themselves to severe Creditors that
expect a rigorous observation of the Contract, let it be never so unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable.
<hi>P.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>If these, or any others, should at this time Preach up <hi>Anger</hi> and
<hi>Vengeance</hi> against the Church of <hi>England;</hi> may it not without Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
be suspected, that a thing so plainly out of season, springeth rather
from Corruption than Mistake; and that those who act this Cholerick
part, do not believe themselves, but only pursue higher Directions, and
endeavour to make good that part of their Contract which obligeth them,
upon a Forfeiture, to make use of their inflaming Eloquence? They
might apprehend their Wages would be retrenched if they should be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate:
And therefore whilst Violence is their Interest, those who have
not the same Arguments, have no reason to follow such a Partial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

            <p>HEre's <hi>Supposition</hi> upon <hi>Supposition,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> More, and More sill. What
if there should be <hi>Mony</hi> in the Case, among the <hi>Dissenting
Ministers,</hi> as there has been <hi>formerly?</hi> And what if the <hi>Agents</hi>
of <hi>Former</hi> Times should be now at their Old Trade again? Why
truly, for My Part, it shall be either So, or Not so, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
pleases; and e'en let him take his <hi>Choice.</hi> If there has
been <hi>No Mony</hi> given, the Author is out in his <hi>History;</hi> And if
there <hi>Has</hi> been <hi>Mony</hi> given, the <hi>Single Question</hi> is, Whether the
<hi>Thing</hi> was <hi>Honest,</hi> or <hi>Dishonest; Warrantable,</hi> or <hi>Vnwarrantable;</hi>
that was to be done for <hi>That Mony.</hi> I do not find that there
were any <hi>Bravo</hi>'s, or <hi>Church-Robbers</hi> employ'd in This most <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
Commission.</hi> I do not hear of any <hi>Murder</hi> or <hi>Sacrilege,</hi> in
the <hi>Question:</hi> But when it shall be <hi>Prov'd,</hi> that a <hi>Wicked Thing</hi>
was ORDER'D, and a <hi>Wicked Thing DONE, Then,</hi> (and not
<hi>till Then)</hi> will be the <hi>Time</hi> for <hi>This Supposition</hi> to take <hi>Place.</hi> Now if
it was a <hi>Lawfull,</hi> or a <hi>Righteous</hi> Bus'ness, I have very Good Authority
for't, that the <hi>Labourer is Worthy of his Hire;</hi> And it is the <hi>Wisdom,</hi>
and the <hi>Justice</hi> of All <hi>Well-Ordered States,</hi> to <hi>Reward Publique Services,</hi>
without Suffering <hi>Good Subjects</hi> to be Call'd <hi>Mercenaries, for Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's Mony;</hi> and likewise for the <hi>Credit,</hi> and the <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
of the <hi>Honour</hi> of the <hi>Government,</hi> not to suffer the <hi>Bountyes</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41026:12"/>
of the <hi>Prince</hi> to be <hi>Scandalously Represented</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> under the
<hi>Odious Names</hi> of <hi>Corruption, Bribery,</hi> or <hi>Subornation:</hi> Insomuch,
that the <hi>Presumption</hi> of <hi>Fraud,</hi> seems to lye much stronger on the
<hi>Supposers</hi> side, then it does on the <hi>Other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Letter is [IFFING] of it now again too; with a <hi>[What
if the</hi> Mercenary Ministers <hi>Before supposed, should be kept in Awe,
for fear of telling of Tales?]</hi> They are gotten into <hi>Hucksters
Hands,</hi> and there's No coming off without a <hi>Scratch'd Face.</hi> Now
am I, the very Same Indifferent Man, to <hi>This Supposition,</hi> that I
was to the <hi>Former;</hi> and believe it, upon the Whole Matter, to
be a <hi>Fiction:</hi> But I do not yet, either Pretend to <hi>Know,</hi> or to
<hi>Pronounce</hi> upon't; and whether it be a <hi>Truth,</hi> or a <hi>Figment,</hi> 'tis to
Mee <hi>All of a Price:</hi> So that for Quietness sake, I am content to
<hi>Reason</hi> with the Gentleman upon his <hi>Own Askings;</hi> His <hi>Own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions;</hi>
Nay, and I care not if I say, upon his <hi>Own Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
too; For This way of <hi>Casing</hi> a Matter, has the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting</hi>
it. If, in Good Earnest, such a Thing has been; and that
they dare not come off for fear of being <hi>Layd Open;</hi> 'tis the Case
(that I have had somewhere before) of a Gentleman that lay gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over by his Physician, in a Desperate Fit of Sickness. A
Friend and Companion of His, made him a <hi>Visit;</hi> layd his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
before him, and Advis'd him, by All means, while <hi>he</hi> had
Life yet, to <hi>Call upon God,</hi> and <hi>Repent. Why Ay,</hi> (says he) <hi>If
I were sure to Dye, I'de Repent with all my Heart; But then, if I
should happen to Live, the Rogues would so Laugh at me.</hi> Here's the
<hi>Perfect Image</hi> of the <hi>Author's Thoughts,</hi> upon the <hi>Supposed Dissenter</hi>
in the Second Period, Body and Soul. He's <hi>Affraid</hi> to <hi>Repent, for
fear the Rogues should Laugh at him.</hi> I do not know how far This
<hi>Bashfull Argument</hi> may Work upon the World; but I am persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that the Plea will hardly be admitted at <hi>the Day of Judgment.</hi>
And then he lays the <hi>Stress</hi> of the Case, upon a Point that's <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be Clear'd;</hi> 'till we have All of us Windows in our Breasts,
and <hi>Eyes,</hi> to <hi>See</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of one Another in our
very <hi>Hearts.</hi> And where's the <hi>Result</hi> at last, but that we are to
Draw <hi>Conclusions</hi> from the <hi>Bare Possibility</hi> of Things, to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi>
of a <hi>Demonstration!</hi> Let <hi>This</hi> be <hi>Granted,</hi> and the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
stands <hi>Firm;</hi> but <hi>Nothing Less</hi> then This, will be ever
able to <hi>Support</hi> it.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Case-putting-Humour</hi> goes on still too; though the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
succeeds no Beeter in his <hi>Third Supposition,</hi> then he did in the
<hi>Two Former.</hi> By <hi>[These, or Any Others Preaching up Anger, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:41026:13"/>
Vengeance against the Church of</hi> England] He can mean Nothing in
the World, but <hi>Popish Priests,</hi> or <hi>Dissenters;</hi> unless he should
Imagine, that <hi>the Church-of-England Ministers</hi> will lay <hi>Violent Hands</hi>
upon <hi>Themselves. Such Preaching,</hi> he says, is <hi>[plainly out of Season]</hi>
with a regard, he means, to the <hi>Timing</hi> of it: Which seems to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
that <hi>at some other time,</hi> it might do <hi>well enough.</hi> Now if it be
an <hi>Ill Thing</hi> to do at <hi>Any time,</hi> it <hi>will</hi> be <hi>ALLWAYS out of Season;</hi>
for 'tis not with <hi>Sermons,</hi> as 'tis with <hi>Mackrel,</hi> to be <hi>IN,</hi> and
<hi>OVT:</hi> But if <hi>Such Preaching</hi> may be <hi>Now Out of Season;</hi> Why may
not some Ways of <hi>Writing</hi> be <hi>out of Season too?</hi> And why may it
not be a Thing of as Dangerous Consequence, to set the <hi>Dissenters</hi>
and the <hi>Papists,</hi> as to set the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> and the <hi>Church-of-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land-men</hi>
together by the Ears? Not but that This Way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
Wounds the <hi>True,</hi> and the <hi>Genuine Church of England</hi> under
the <hi>Bare Denomination</hi> of a <hi>Church-of-England-Cause,</hi> more then it
does Either of the <hi>Other Two Parties,</hi> as I shall shew when it
comes before me. But the <hi>Corruption</hi> goes on still. The <hi>Cholerick
Part</hi> (he says) is but <hi>Acted; Higher Directions</hi> msut be <hi>Pursu'd,</hi> or
the <hi>Contract</hi> is <hi>Void.</hi> Nay, the <hi>Dissenters</hi> are in <hi>Pay</hi> too, and they
have <hi>Wages.</hi> The <hi>Design</hi> is to Work <hi>Violence,</hi> and There <hi>he
Pins the Basket.</hi> If the <hi>Cholerick</hi> Part be (as he says) but <hi>Acted,</hi> the
<hi>Dissenters</hi> and the <hi>Church-of-England-Men</hi> Understand One Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
before hand it seems, and the Whole Story of the <hi>Letter</hi>
is but a <hi>Banter:</hi> That same Expression of <hi>[Higher Directions]</hi> is a
<hi>Bugg Word</hi> or Two; and from <hi>Higher</hi> to <hi>Higher,</hi> there will be <hi>No
Resting Place</hi> found for this <hi>Oraculous Innuendo,</hi> till we come to the
<hi>Highest of all.</hi> Now I am not <hi>Lawyer</hi> enough, to know, What
such a <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>CONTRACT, CHEAT,</hi> and <hi>VIOLENCE,</hi> in
such a <hi>Train</hi> of <hi>Connexion</hi> may <hi>amount</hi> to. This is <hi>[a Partial Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample]</hi>
he says; And truly Mythinks, <hi>This Letter</hi> has a very <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
way of Proceeding;</hi> for it makes <hi>War,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> in the <hi>same
Breath;</hi> Rips up <hi>Old Wounds</hi> under the <hi>Colour</hi> of <hi>Healing</hi> them:
And I appeal to the indifferent World, whether a <hi>Cholerick Writer</hi>
may not be as <hi>Dangerous,</hi> as a <hi>Cholerick Preacher;</hi> and if the <hi>One
Example</hi> be not as much to be <hi>Avoided</hi> as the <hi>Other.</hi> Wherefore
I think it would not do Amiss, if the <hi>Dissenter</hi> should <hi>Counter-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise</hi>
his <hi>Remembrancer</hi> upon <hi>Two or Three of these Last Points:</hi> For the
<hi>Letter</hi> deals altogether by <hi>Secular Arguments</hi> too; and there may
be <hi>Mony Walking</hi> on the <hi>One</hi> Side, as well as on the <hi>Other.</hi> And
then again, the <hi>Disuniting</hi> of the <hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> of <hi>what Religion
soever</hi> they are, is a Point as <hi>Suspicious,</hi> As any that we have yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41026:13"/>
               <hi>Before</hi> us: And it is a Thing, every jot as much <hi>out of Season</hi>

the <hi>Conciliation</hi> of a <hi>Friendship</hi> betwixt the <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi>
and <hi>any other sort whatsoever of the Kings Liege People.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Rash,</hi> an

with an <hi>Opinion,</hi> that there is No <hi>Faith, Truth, Honour,</hi> or <hi>Justice,</hi>

themselves the necessity of an intire Resignation: Such Men are to be
Lamented, but not to be Believed: Nay, they themselves, when they
have discharged their Vnwelcom Task, will be inwardly glad that their

to their <hi>Consciences</hi> for the <hi>Continuance</hi> of that <hi>Security?</hi>
That is to say, upon <hi>Conviction</hi> that they were in an <hi>Error:</hi> But
if the <hi>Dutiful Conscience</hi> of <hi>Preserving</hi> the <hi>Publique Peace,</hi> Works
<hi>One</hi> way; And if the Letter will <hi>Suppose</hi> a <hi>Conscientious Obligation</hi>
(either so in <hi>Truth,</hi> or so <hi>Vnderstood)</hi> for the <hi>Destroying</hi> of a <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Government,</hi> on the <hi>Other,</hi> it is a kind of a Scandal upon the
very <hi>Rebellion,</hi> to call it a <hi>Crime;</hi> In Opposition to the <hi>Text</hi> here
that <hi>Implies</hi> it to be a Matter of <hi>Conscience.</hi> Here's the <hi>Present Case,</hi>
in short, <hi>Stated,</hi> and <hi>Read</hi> upon; And so we'le Proceed.</p>

If in the Height of this great Dearness by comparing Things,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> it

with those who are so far from allowing <hi>Liberty,</hi> that they allow

the <hi>Proper Judge</hi> of 'em is the <hi>Person</hi> that <hi>God</hi> has appointed to

            <p>Toward the Close of This Paragraph, he draws an <hi>Inference</hi>

Behaviour under <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealousies,</hi> at <hi>Present.</hi> Now if he had
taken into This <hi>Calculation,</hi> an Account of the <hi>Artifices</hi> that
<hi>Rais'd</hi> Those <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealousies;</hi> an Account of the <hi>Design;</hi> and
the <hi>Application</hi> of them; the <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Desolation,</hi> that they
brought upon the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Three Kingdoms;</hi> he would not have
Advised them, I hope, to the <hi>saying</hi> of the <hi>Same Lesson,</hi> and to the
<hi>doing</hi> of the <hi>Same Things over again.</hi> And whereas he calls <hi>Courage,</hi>
a <hi>Dangerous Virtue,</hi> at This <hi>Vnseasonable Time;</hi> It is the most
<hi>Daring,</hi> and the most <hi>Dangerous</hi> of All <hi>Courages,</hi> that he Himself
now <hi>Practices;</hi> That is to say; the <hi>Courage</hi> of Reading such a
<hi>Lecture</hi> to the <hi>Common People,</hi> as, if they were not <hi>Thoroughly Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed</hi>
with a <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of their Own Safety, in the
Hands where the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>Placed</hi> them,
might Endanger the Springing of a <hi>Mine,</hi> that would, most
Infallibly, Bury the <hi>Engineer Himself</hi> in the <hi>Common Ruine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then for these,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> and a thousand other Reasons, there is cause to
suspect, sure your <hi>new Friends</hi> are not to Dictate to you, or Advise
you. For instance, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Author</hi> is so Intent upon the <hi>Matter</hi> of his Discourse,<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
that I am affraid he has almost forgotten the <hi>Title</hi> of it. He
calls it <hi>[A Letter to a Dissenter,</hi> &amp;c.] and <hi>He Himself Personates
a Church-of-England-man,</hi> in the <hi>Manage</hi> of it: Now if there
be (according to his own reck'ning) <hi>a Thousand Reasons and Odd,</hi>
for the <hi>Dissenters Suspecting</hi> their <hi>New Friends;</hi> and against the
<hi>Entertaining</hi> of these <hi>New Friends,</hi> for <hi>Dictators,</hi> and <hi>Advisers;</hi>
Never any Mortal had a <hi>Clearer Cause</hi> on't; and These <hi>New
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41026:15"/>
Friends</hi> are not, upon any Terms, to take upon them to <hi>Dictate,</hi>
and to <hi>Advise.</hi> Upon This <hi>Joynt-Concession,</hi> I have a Civil Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
or Two to put to the <hi>Magisterial,</hi> and <hi>Fore-casting Author</hi> of
this <hi>Letter.</hi> First; Is he, in Very Very Deed, <hi>a True Church-of-England-man,</hi>
according to the <hi>Standard</hi> of That <hi>Communion?</hi>
If <hi>Not,</hi> Why does he tell the <hi>Dissenters</hi> that he is one? Nay,
and I'll Abate him somewhat of the <hi>Heights,</hi> and <hi>Pontificalibus'es</hi>
too, into the Bargain. <hi>Secondly: Admitting</hi> him to be the Man
that he <hi>Professes</hi> to be, we shall see presently what comes on't
That way too: And so let him e'en stick to which of the Two
He pleases, either the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Separation.</hi> If he be a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senter,
Himself,</hi> he should have call'd his Papers <hi>A Letter from a
Dissenter to a Dissenter:</hi> And in that Case, 'Tis Ten to One, he
has some <hi>Part</hi> to <hi>Play;</hi> Or some such ORDER, I Warrant ye,
as (he was a saying) the <hi>Dissenting Ministers</hi> have; How to <hi>Tread
the Stage,</hi> How to <hi>Govern themselves;</hi> and who knows but he may
have [HIGHER DIRECTIONS too] as well as some Others of
his Brethren? <hi>Warrants, Commissions,</hi> and <hi>Instructions</hi> for the
Composing of his <hi>Words, Countenances,</hi> and <hi>Designs:</hi> Nay, and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations</hi>
too, for <hi>Dissembling,</hi> and <hi>Equivocating,</hi> according to the
<hi>Supposed Case</hi> Again, of his <hi>Fellow Brethren?</hi> If, (as he suggests)
All These Things have been <hi>Done,</hi> and <hi>Acted,</hi> in <hi>Mans Memory,</hi>
and may be likewise <hi>Supposed</hi> to be <hi>Done,</hi> and <hi>Acted over again;</hi>
'tis the World to a Nut-shell, if he be One of <hi>That Party,</hi> that
he is likewise One of <hi>Those Managers, Himself;</hi> And <hi>'tis not Fair,
to Garry Two Faces under One Hood:</hi> For, at this Rate, the whole
Bus'ness is Nothing but <hi>Person,</hi> and <hi>Disguise.</hi> However, for the
Author's Reputation, I would rather find a <hi>Failing</hi> in his <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
then in his <hi>Integrity;</hi> for if he should chance to be found
a <hi>Dissenter,</hi> or as a body may say, but a <hi>Dissenters Fellow,</hi> it
would be enough to bring the Credit of his very <hi>History, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
Cause,</hi> and <hi>Design,</hi> in <hi>Question,</hi> to be taken Halting under a
<hi>Borron'd Character.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Allowing him now to be <hi>Aliqualiter,</hi> (with leave of the
<hi>Criticks)</hi> a man of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (though not so <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summated,</hi>
and <hi>Canonical,</hi> as a Body would Wish) he is Manifestly
<hi>Hamper'd</hi> in his <hi>Own Net.</hi> For the <hi>Church-of-England-Men</hi> are
to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> upon the Strictness of a <hi>Civil Point,</hi> to All Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,
as <hi>New Friends,</hi> as the <hi>Papists</hi> are: That is to say, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Authors <hi>Notion,</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of This <hi>New Friendship.</hi>
I speak This <hi>ad Hominem. He</hi> professes a <hi>Good Will,</hi> and a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41026:15"/>
               <hi>Friendship</hi> to the <hi>Dissenters;</hi> The <hi>Papists</hi> do the <hi>Li<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and their
<hi>Friendships</hi> bear much the <hi>same date.</hi> Now (says he) Your <hi>New
Friends</hi> are to be <hi>Suspected;</hi> He Himself is in the same <hi>Classis,</hi> and
as Lyable to be <hi>suspected,</hi> in the Quality of a <hi>New Friend,</hi> as the
Other. Nay, and a man might yet lay a little more <hi>weight</hi> upon't;
It is a <hi>Separation</hi> in <hi>Discipline</hi> that makes our <hi>Dissenter,</hi> and it is
the <hi>Dissent,</hi> so <hi>Distinguish'd</hi> and <hi>Restrain'd,</hi> that is here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion:
So that the <hi>Papist</hi> has no Quarrel to the <hi>Dissenter,</hi> but as
a Member of the <hi>Reformation;</hi> for in the Matter of <hi>Country,</hi> and
<hi>Allegeance,</hi> they do Both fall under the <hi>Common</hi> CASE of <hi>All the
King's Subjects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Addresses</hi> that fly abroad every Week,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> and Murder us with
<hi>Another to the same;</hi> the first Draughts are made by those who are
not very <hi>proper</hi> to be <hi>Secretaries</hi> to the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> and
it is your part only to Write them out fairer again. Strange! that
you who have been formerly so much against <hi>Set Forms,</hi> should now be
content the Priests should Indite for you. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Murdering Addresses</hi> that are here Complain'd of,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> in <hi>a
much more Murdering Letter;</hi> are a Certain sort of <hi>Murder,</hi>
that the <hi>Law</hi> neither of <hi>God,</hi> nor of <hi>Man,</hi> takes any Notice of;
and a <hi>Murder,</hi> that perhaps was never <hi>Heard</hi> of, 'till it came to
be set up for a Figure, in This <hi>Rhetorical Paper. They fly abroad,</hi>
'tis True; We <hi>Read</hi> them in the <hi>Gazettes;</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> takes
upon it self, to set forth by <hi>Mysterious Hints,</hi> and <hi>Intimations,</hi>
from what Hands they come too. Now This is Matter of
<hi>Fact;</hi> and where there's <hi>No Evidence Offer'd,</hi> there's <hi>No
Place</hi> for a <hi>Disproof.</hi> He gives to Understand, as a Thing
of <hi>Practice,</hi> and <hi>Reproche,</hi> that the <hi>Addressers</hi> only Write after
the <hi>Dictates,</hi> and <hi>Copies</hi> of <hi>Other People;</hi> and pleasantly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
them for Admitting <hi>Set Forms</hi> in These <hi>Addresses,</hi> (and
<hi>Set-Forms drawn by Priests too;)</hi> though they will have None in
their <hi>Publique Devotions.</hi> Now here's not One Syllable of the
<hi>Fact</hi> in sight; and the Stress of All, he says, comes to no more
then This; <hi>The People do not draw up their Own Addresses;</hi> To
which I Answer; that there was never any <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Addressers,</hi>
upon the Face of the Earth, that did not Stand Lyable to
the <hi>same Exception,</hi> in having their <hi>Addresses Drawn up for Them:</hi>
Neither is it so properly the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Words;</hi> but the <hi>Assent,</hi> and the
<hi>Subscription,</hi> that makes the <hi>Address:</hi> And it is enough for the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41026:16"/>
People to O<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>n, and <hi>Sign</hi> the <hi>Matter</hi> of the <hi>Address;</hi> without any
Pretence to a Hand in the <hi>Wording</hi> of it. I do insist a little the more
upon the <hi>Privelege</hi> of <hi>a Commoner of England,</hi> to have him Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
from <hi>writing his own Addresses,</hi> because it may so fall out,
that very Honest Man's Skill in <hi>Letters,</hi> may go no further, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
then the Bare <hi>Writing of his Name,</hi> or the making of his
<hi>Mark:</hi> Beside, that a Body does not know the <hi>Danger</hi> of such a
<hi>President,</hi> if our Author should Carry this Point: For the very
<hi>same Exception</hi> will hold against him upon a Suit in <hi>Chancery,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
forsooth, his <hi>Bill,</hi> or <hi>Answer,</hi> was not of his <hi>Own Drawing.</hi>

            <p>The nature of Thanks is an unavoidable consequence of being Pleased

either in Looks, Speech, Writing, or Action: No man wa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ever Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
because he was bid to be so, but because he had, or thought he had
some Reason for it. If then there is cause in this Case to pay such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
Acknowledgments, they will flow naturally, without taking
such pains to procure them; and it is unkindly done, to tire all the Post-Horses
with carrying <hi>Circular Letters</hi> to sollicit that which would be
done without any trouble or constraint: If it is really in it self such a
Favour, what needeth so much pressing men to be Thankful, and with
such eager circumstances, that where Perswasions cannot delude, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
are employed to fright them into a Compliance? Thanks must be
voluntary, not only unconstrained, but unsollicited, else they are either
Trifles or Snares, they either signifie nothing, or a great deal more then
is intended by those that give them. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>THe Author comes now to Enlarge himself upon the Text of
<hi>Thanksgiving;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> but he forgets, I fear, that there are <hi>Thanks</hi> of
<hi>Good-Manners,</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi> as well as of <hi>Passion; Thanks</hi> for <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection</hi>
in the <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of <hi>Benefits,</hi> as well as for
<hi>Actual Bounties</hi> in the <hi>Collation</hi> of them. Many stand in need to
be <hi>Taught</hi> to be <hi>Thankful,</hi> which he calls <hi>[Bidding]</hi> to be so, and
they had never <hi>Thought</hi> on't perhaps, if they had not been <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished</hi>
so to be. As to the <hi>[Such Extravagant Acknowledgments]</hi>
which he speaks of; I do neither <hi>Vnderstand,</hi> the <hi>[Such]</hi> nor the
<hi>[Extravagant;]</hi> Unless he Means, that in the <hi>Testimonials</hi> of the
Peoples <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> to his Majesty, as they are set forth
in so many <hi>Addresses, [the Play is not worth the Candle.]</hi> His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of <hi>Tiring Post-Horses,</hi> is an <hi>Allegation,</hi> without any <hi>Proof,</hi> or
so much as <hi>Probability</hi> to <hi>Back</hi> it: But I hope, if it were <hi>True,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:41026:16"/>
he would have the <hi>Charity</hi> to Allow the <hi>Government</hi> (for <hi>That's</hi> the
<hi>Innuendo</hi> of it) a <hi>Liberty</hi> to do the same Thing which he <hi>Practices
Himself.</hi> For (to his Honour be it spoken) never any Man, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
made more Work for <hi>Post-Horses,</hi> with Two or Three
Sheets of Paper, then the Author has done with <hi>This Letter;</hi> And
never any <hi>Letter</hi> perhaps, was more <hi>Vniversally Circular,</hi> then This
has been. And to What End, but to <hi>Sollicite,</hi> to <hi>Perswade,</hi> to
<hi>Threaten,</hi> to <hi>Fright</hi> People (These are his own Words) into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
with his <hi>Dictates.</hi> He is against <hi>Pressing Men to be Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
Nhw <hi>Gratitude</hi> is a <hi>Duty,</hi> both toward <hi>God,</hi> and our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi>
And certainly, a <hi>Duty,</hi> that may be <hi>Pressed,</hi> and <hi>Inculcated</hi>
in the <hi>Moral Offices</hi> of a <hi>Civil Life,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Chair,</hi> or
the <hi>Pulpit.</hi> To make an End of This Clause, Either he is gone
off from his <hi>Text</hi> of <hi>Thankful Addresses,</hi> or else he does a Worse
Thing in making either <hi>Trifles,</hi> or <hi>Snares</hi> of Those <hi>Applications;</hi>
which, in Common <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Modesty</hi> ought to receive a <hi>Fairer
Construction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If an Inference should be made,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> That whosoever Thanketh the King
for his <hi>Declaration,</hi> is by that engaged to Justifie it in point of Law;
it is a greater Stride than, I presume, all those care to make who are
perswaded to <hi>Address,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>IT must not be Forgotten,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> that though the Author of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
has Chang'd his <hi>Battery,</hi> from <hi>Invention</hi> to <hi>Rhetorique,</hi> from
<hi>Rhetorique</hi> to <hi>Calumny;</hi> and, now at last, from <hi>Calumny</hi> to <hi>Law;</hi>
That he is still <hi>Constant</hi> to his <hi>First Design,</hi> and to the <hi>Two Main
Topiques,</hi> viz. <hi>of the King's Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> and of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses</hi>
that have follow'd upon it: But Whether for <hi>Decency,
Affection,</hi> or <hi>Good Company,</hi> it Matters not to Our Present Bus'ness.
He enters upon his Subject, with a kind of an <hi>Exposition, Ex post
facto,</hi> of the <hi>Addressers Meaning; After</hi> the <hi>Addresses</hi> were <hi>Presented;</hi>
and without much Regard to What they thought, either <hi>Before,</hi>
or <hi>upon the Spot,</hi> at the very <hi>Presenting</hi> of them. This is much
after the President of the <hi>Protestation</hi> of <hi>Forty.</hi> First they made
the People <hi>Take</hi> it; and when they had once gotten it down,
the Imposers Publish'd a <hi>Comment</hi> upon the <hi>Meaning</hi> of it. The
First Step that he Advances toward his <hi>Law-Point,</hi> comes within
a Hair's Breadth of Pronouncing the King's <hi>Declaration</hi> to be a
<hi>Nullity.</hi> But he brings it In, with an [IF,] and an [I PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUME]
And <hi>What</hi> does he <hi>Presume?</hi> but that <hi>All the Addressers,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:41026:17"/>
are either <hi>Fools</hi> or <hi>Knaves,</hi> in either <hi>Taking,</hi> or in <hi>Addressing
Thanks,</hi> for that which they think in their <hi>Consciences,</hi> the King
has No <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Give.</hi> If he can sink the <hi>Reputation</hi> of the <hi>King's
Power,</hi> and <hi>Prerogative,</hi> the Whole work is done at a Stroke.
But he is Resolved, to have, at least, <hi>Two Strings to his Bow,</hi> and
to Try what's to be done upon the <hi>Passions</hi> of the People, if he
Cannot Captivate their <hi>Vnderstandings.</hi> And so he sets himself
to the Driving of <hi>Another Naile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it shall be <hi>supposed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter.</note> that all the <hi>Thankers</hi> will be <hi>Repealers</hi>
of the <hi>Test,</hi> whenever a <hi>Parliament</hi> shall meet; such an Expectation
is better <hi>prevented before,</hi> then <hi>disappointed afterwards;</hi> and the
surest way to avoid the lying under such a Scandal, is, not to do any thing
that may give a Colour to the <hi>Mistake. P.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>HIs First Attempt is to <hi>Invalidate</hi> the Kings <hi>Declaration</hi> it self;<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
and if he cannot Carry the <hi>Law-Point,</hi> he is now a Trying what
he can do upon the <hi>Poll,</hi> toward the Frustrating and <hi>Poysoning</hi> of it
in the <hi>Operation</hi> and <hi>Effect,</hi> upon the Meeting of <hi>Another Parliament.
If it shall be supposed</hi> (says he) <hi>that all the</hi> Thankers <hi>will be</hi> Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<hi>&amp;c. 'Tis Better</hi> Prevented, <hi>then</hi> Disappointed: As who should
say, Let the <hi>Next Choice</hi> be made according to <hi>our Authors Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,</hi>
and the <hi>Members</hi> must be neither <hi>Church-of-England-Men,</hi> nor
<hi>Papists,</hi> nor <hi>Dissenters,</hi> but a sort of <hi>Amphibious Republicans,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to This <hi>Letter-Model,</hi> and the Government will be, then,
most <hi>blessedly brought to Bed</hi> of a <hi>Representative Wisdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These <hi>Bespoken Thanks</hi> are little less improper then Love-Letters
that were sollicited by the Lady to whom they are to be directed:<note place="margin">Letter.</note> so
that besides the little <hi>Ground</hi> there is to <hi>give</hi> them, the manner of <hi>getting</hi>
them, doth extremely lessen their <hi>Valne. P.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>HE will not allow <hi>[Bespoken Thanks]</hi> in This <hi>Case,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> or in This
<hi>Manner,</hi> to have either <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Value.</hi> If there be such a
<hi>Fatality</hi> in the Matter, that there is <hi>No</hi> keeping the <hi>Author</hi> of
the <hi>Letter</hi> out of <hi>Harms-way,</hi> I had much rather that he should <hi>fall</hi>
upon his <hi>Own Weapon,</hi> then by Any <hi>Malicious Practice,</hi> or <hi>Address</hi>
of <hi>Mine:</hi> So that for <hi>a Dish of Coffee,</hi> These <hi>Thanks</hi> shall be BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPOKEN,
or NOT <hi>Bespoken,</hi> whether of the Two <hi>He</hi> pleases:
For they are never the <hi>More,</hi> or the <hi>Less due,</hi> for <hi>Being,</hi> or <hi>Not</hi>
Being, either the <hi>One,</hi> or the <hi>Other:</hi> And if they be <hi>Due,</hi> with a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41026:17"/>
respect to the <hi>Person,</hi> to the <hi>Occasion,</hi> to the <hi>Prudence, Good
Manners,</hi> or to Twenty other Circumstances that Enter <hi>into Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
of This Quality, 'tis Enough, to give them both <hi>Ground</hi> and
<hi>Value.</hi> The King speaks to <hi>All his People,</hi> in This <hi>Declaration,</hi> and
are they too <hi>Stout</hi> to make him a <hi>Leg</hi> for't? He speaks <hi>Kindly</hi> to
them too; and shall That <hi>Gracious Goodness</hi> not receive so much
as an <hi>Acknowledgment?</hi> He does it at a <hi>Time</hi> too, when Peoples
<hi>Hearts,</hi> and <hi>Heads,</hi> are <hi>Tamper'd</hi> with <hi>Jealousies,</hi> for fear of <hi>Popery,</hi>
and <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> when the very <hi>Season</hi> Elevates the <hi>Character</hi> of
the <hi>Mercy;</hi> And is All This to pass for Nothing now, in <hi>Our
Authors Opinion? [Set your</hi> Souls <hi>at rest, Every</hi> Man, <hi>and Every</hi>

If His Majesty had done any <hi>Particular</hi> Person, <hi>apart,</hi> the Honour
to <hi>Single him out</hi> for such an <hi>Instance,</hi> or <hi>Declaration</hi> of his <hi>Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>

            <p>Neither is it, in Truth, Only the [BESPOKEN <hi>Thanks,]</hi> at

<hi>Themselves,</hi> a sufficient Ground for BESPOKEN <hi>Thanks;</hi> Not
only in <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and in <hi>Justice,</hi> but in <hi>Mercy</hi> too: 'Tis Worth

It might be wished that you would have suppressed your Impatience,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> and
have been content for the sake of Religion to enjoy it within your selves,
without the Liberty of a Publick Exercise, 'till a <hi>Parliament</hi> had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
it; but since that could not be, and that the Artifices of some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
you have made use of the Well-meant-Zeal of the Generality to
draw them into this Mistake; I am so far from blaming you with that
Sharpness, which, perhaps, the Matter in Strictness would bear, that I
am ready to Err on the side of the more Gentle Construction. <hi>P.</hi> 5.</p>

They have been <hi>Fool'd,</hi> he says, <hi>[by the Artifices of some amongst

He seems a little Troubled at their <hi>Acceptance</hi> of <hi>Liberty,</hi> upon

that the Gentleman is <hi>Heart and Hand</hi> for the <hi>Dissenters
Breaking</hi> of the Laws, though he is against the <hi>Kings Dispensing</hi>
with them.</p>
            <p>There is a great Difference between enjoying quietly the Advantages of
an Act,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> irregularly done by others, and the going about to support it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Laws in Being: the Law is so Sacred, that no Trespass against
it is to be defended: Yet Frailties may in some Measure be excused when
they cannot be justified. <hi>p.</hi> 5.</p>

of the Declaration of <hi>Test;</hi> the <hi>Laws in Being</hi> would be of no
Force at all, if that <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Test</hi> should Prove <hi>Repugnant</hi> to the

There are several Snatches in This Paper, that are either <hi>Founded,</hi>
or <hi>Pretend</hi> to be <hi>Founded</hi> upon the <hi>Resolution,</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Laws.</hi>
I shall spend my Thoughts too much upon <hi>Fractions,</hi> to take them
<hi>One by One,</hi> as they fall in my way; but I shall ee'n do as a
<hi>Country Gentleman</hi> did at an <hi>Ordinary.</hi> The Company was set
round the Table, Wayting for Dinner; and in the <hi>Interim,</hi>
some Particular Acquaintances Entertain'd the Time with Toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Throwing Crumbs of Bread One at Another: <hi>My
Country Gentleman,</hi> that knew not so much as One Face at the
Table, Pick'd his Man, and fell to <hi>the same Sport too:</hi> The Other
took it up still, and Threw it over his Shoulder: But at last ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
civilly told him, <hi>Sir,</hi> (says he) <hi>I beseech you, will you keep your
Account, and when it comes to a Loaf, you shall have it All together.</hi>
I must Now desire My Author to give me Credit too, 'till it comes
to a <hi>Loaf,</hi> and I shall Then give him what I have to say upon
This Subject <hi>All at Once.</hi>

            <p>The Desire of enjoying a Liberty from which Men have been so long
restrained,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> may be a Temptation that their Reason is not at all times able
to resist. If in such a Case some Objections are leap't over, indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Men will be more inclin'd to lament the Occasion, then to fall too
hard upon the Fault, whilst it is cover'd with the Apology of a good
Intention. But, <hi>&amp;c. P.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>HEre is a very <hi>Friendly Apology</hi> for an <hi>Allmost-Irresistible Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note>
The Author is of Counsel for the <hi>Defendent;</hi> and
makes a Case of <hi>Equity</hi> on't, to set the <hi>Fault</hi> against the <hi>Occasion.</hi>
The <hi>Desire</hi> of <hi>Liberty</hi> might have been a <hi>Plea</hi> for the <hi>Forbidden Fruit</hi>
too. And now for Leaping over Objections, our Author has shew'd
himself as Good at it as any <hi>Dissenter</hi> of 'em All; For he has been
pleased to <hi>Exercise</hi> a <hi>Liberty</hi> in <hi>These Sheets,</hi> not only <hi>without</hi> any
<hi>Visible Temptation,</hi> but <hi>Against</hi> Any <hi>Visible Reason</hi> for so doing:
But he is his own <hi>Confessor,</hi> and <hi>Absolves Himself</hi> upon This <hi>Vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
Doctrine,</hi> that <hi>[The Apology of a</hi> Good Intention <hi>Covers the</hi>
Fault;] Which makes <hi>Every Man</hi> a <hi>Judge</hi> in his <hi>Own Cause.</hi>

            <p>Where,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> to Rescue your selves from the Severity of One Law, you
give a Blow to All the Laws, by which your Religion and Liberty are to
be protected, and instead of silently receiving the Benefit of this Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
you set up for Advocates to support it. You become Voluntary
Aggressors, and look like Counsel retained by the Prerogative against
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41026:19"/>
your Old Friend <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> who hath done nothing to deserve her
falling thus under your Displeasure. <hi>P.</hi> 5.</p>

<hi>Frame,</hi> of <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That Government:</hi> But it is yet No Further a <hi>Rule,</hi>
then as it Squares with the <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Fundamental Rules</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

            <p>If the Case then should be that the Price expected from you for this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,<note place="margin">Letter.</note>
is giving up your <hi>Right</hi> in the <hi>Laws,</hi> sure you will think Twice
before you go any further in such a Losing Bargain. <hi>P.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>IT will not be Denyed that the <hi>Subject</hi> has a <hi>Right</hi> in the <hi>Benefit</hi>
of the <hi>Laws;</hi> but he has none at all Undoubtedly in the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,</hi>
or the <hi>Administration</hi> of them: So that our Authors
Case, in This <hi>Expostulation</hi> is (Right or Wrong) an <hi>Vsurpation</hi>
upon the Province of his <hi>Superiors;</hi> for there's no longer any
<hi>Order,</hi> or <hi>Reason,</hi> in the Works and Offices of <hi>Providence,</hi> and
<hi>Nature,</hi> when <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> shall come to be <hi>Inverted,</hi>
or <hi>Confounded.</hi> He seems extremely Tender on the Behalf of the
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> for fear they should give up their <hi>Birth-rights</hi> in a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi>
for their <hi>Liberty.</hi> This is it which he calls <hi>[their Right in
the Laws;]</hi> but he hopes they will be <hi>Better Advis'd</hi> first. Here
is an <hi>Imperial Prerogative</hi> over-ruled by a <hi>Pamphlet;</hi> A <hi>Cause</hi> given
<hi>against</hi> the <hi>King</hi> by <hi>John-a-Styles;</hi> and First or Last, a whole <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme</hi>
of <hi>Republican Consequences, Built</hi> upon it; and it is upon a
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41026:19"/>
               <hi>Point</hi> too, that perhaps was <hi>never Controverted</hi> till now, in any
<hi>Setled State,</hi> and upon <hi>This Bottom.</hi> It is a <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Crown
Common to All Governments in the World,</hi> and so <hi>Essential</hi> to the
Maintaining of a <hi>Civil Polity,</hi> in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Security,</hi> that No
State can <hi>Subsist</hi> without it: And Consequently, No <hi>Act of State</hi>
can <hi>take it away.</hi> In one Word, I speak of the Power of <hi>Calling,
Forbidding, Continuing,</hi> or <hi>Dissolving Publique Assemblies.</hi> And the
<hi>Exercise</hi> of <hi>That Power</hi> is the Point in <hi>Question</hi> upon This <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
And <hi>without</hi> This Power he can neither <hi>Defend Himself,</hi> nor
<hi>Protect</hi> his <hi>People;</hi> neither <hi>Punish</hi> the <hi>Guilty,</hi> not <hi>secure</hi> the <hi>Innocent;</hi>
Nor finally, <hi>Discharge</hi> the most <hi>Necessary Duties</hi> of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After giving <hi>Thanks</hi> for the Breach of One Law,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> you lose the
<hi>Right</hi> of Complaining of the Breach of all the rest; You will not very

it shall be to your Prejudice. <hi>P.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>HE takes the Case all the way for <hi>Granted,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> and so Proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Presupposal</hi> of an <hi>Imaginary Breach,</hi> and <hi>Right.</hi> He

that they have No <hi>Pretence</hi> to: And, after All, not one <hi>Colour</hi> of
a <hi>Reason</hi> offered, why Sentence should not be given against him.
If it be Clear, that the People have Not This <hi>Right,</hi> truly, to My

<hi>Yield,</hi> that the People <hi>Have</hi> such a <hi>Right, the Authors Hand is yet

<hi>Place</hi> set for a <hi>Hearing.</hi> Briefly, If there were no <hi>More</hi> in't, the

Any <hi>Foundation. 2ly.</hi> A <hi>Right Supposed,</hi> and the <hi>Cause</hi> utterly
<hi>Spoil'd</hi> by <hi>Ill Management:</hi> But what if a Body should give him his
<hi>Vttermost Demands</hi> now; and take the Matter <hi>De bone esse,</hi> as He

to be <hi>Good;</hi> The <hi>Proceeding, Regular,</hi> and <hi>Modest;</hi> and the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
Right;</hi> in Strictness of <hi>Law,</hi> as <hi>Clear,</hi> and as <hi>Vndubitable</hi> as

with their <hi>Sovereign, Provoke</hi> him to Return <hi>Strictnesses</hi> for
<hi>Strictnesses</hi> upon them, by way of <hi>Reprizal;</hi> Our Author, I fear,

the KING shall come to take All <hi>Advantages</hi> against the <hi>Subject,</hi> on
the <hi>other</hi> hand, that the <hi>Rigour,</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> will <hi>Allow</hi>

            <p>If you will set up at one time a Power to help you,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> which at another

<hi>Caution,</hi> that they should not <hi>set it up,</hi> Imports, the <hi>bidding</hi> of
them to <hi>Disown</hi> it; and more then <hi>Insinuates</hi> the <hi>Antimonarchical
Doctrine</hi> of making the <hi>King's Power</hi> to be <hi>Radically</hi> in the <hi>People:</hi>
But here's a <hi>Bugbear</hi> started, and all long of themselves, it
seems, for being so [UNREASONABLY <hi>Thank full.]</hi> The King
<hi>Grants</hi> them an <hi>Indulgence;</hi> They <hi>Thank</hi> him for't; and That
<hi>Vnreasonable Thankfullness</hi> (says our Author) will be their <hi>Ruine.</hi>
I hope he does not mean the <hi>King,</hi> by that <hi>Destroying Power,</hi> though

            </p>
            <p>If you think,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> for your excuse, to expound your Thanks so as to restrain them to this
particular case, others, for their ends, will extend them further; and in these differing
Interpretations, that which is back'd by Authority will be the most likely to prevail;
especially when by the advantage you have given them, they have in truth the better of
the Argument; and that the Inferences from your own Concessions are very strong, and
express against you. This is so far from being a groundless Supposition, that there was
a late instance of it, in the last Session of Parliament, in the House of Lords, where the
first Thanks, though things of course, were interpreted to be the Approbation of the King's
whole Speech, and a Restraint from the further examination of any part of it, though
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41026:20"/>
never so much disliked; and it was with difficulty obtained, not to be excluded from the
liberty of objecting to this mighty Prerogative of Dispensing, meerly by this innocent and
usual piece of good Manners, by which no such thing could possibly be intended. <hi>p.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>I Find little more in <hi>This Paragraph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> (or in This <hi>Page,</hi> I might

to a <hi>Prince,</hi> for <hi>Subjects</hi> to be THANKFULL. The Great
<hi>Danger,</hi> and <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> that appears in <hi>This Section,</hi> is the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard

with. But I may venture yet without the Risque, I hope, of a
<hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> to take Notice, of the Author's saying that
the King's Speech was DISLIK'D; A Term, that I presume, he
had no Commission for: And then for his Irony upon the <hi>[MIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY

<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

that for some time you have enjoyed the benefit of the End, it is time for you to look into
the Danger of the Means: The same Reason that made you desirous to get Liberty, must
make you solicitous to preserve it: so that the next thought will naturally be, not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

            <p>There are certain Periods of time,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> which being once past, make all Cautions ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and all Remedies desperate. Our Vnderstandings are apt to be hurried on by the first
heats; which if not restrained in time, do not give us leave to look back, till it is too
late. Consider this in the Case of your Anger against the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and take
warning by their Mistake in the same kind, when after the late King's Restoration, they
preserved so long the bitter taste of your rough usage to them in other times, that it made
them forget their Interest, and sacrifice it to their Revenge. <hi>p. 6. &amp;</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>HEre's a kind of a <hi>Predestinarian Foundation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> with Certain <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophical,
Political,</hi> and <hi>Historical Meditations,</hi> and <hi>Reflexions</hi>
upon it. The <hi>Time Presses,</hi> and when 'tis too <hi>Late,</hi> 'tis too <hi>Late;</hi>
which is a Pithy way of Speaking a Great deal in a Little. His <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi>
to the <hi>Dissenters,</hi> of <hi>Moderation</hi> toward the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
is <hi>Good and Seasonable;</hi> but least the Church of <hi>England</hi> should
grow <hi>Proud</hi> of being so much in our Author's Good Graces, he
gives her a Box o'th' Ear at the very Next Word, that makes her
Stagger again; and in the <hi>Same Period,</hi> makes as Arrant a <hi>Jilt</hi> of
his <hi>Beloved Clyent,</hi> as ever he did of the <hi>Whore of Babylon.</hi> Take
<hi>Warning,</hi> says he, <hi>by the Church-of-England</hi>'s <hi>Mistake;</hi> And what
was that <hi>Mistake</hi> (in his Opinion, at last) but an <hi>Impotent Folly,</hi>
and a <hi>Diabolical Revenge?</hi> So that, to the <hi>Scandal</hi> of our <hi>Author's
Profession;</hi> he has set up <hi>Two Churches of England;</hi> The <hi>One</hi> of
them a <hi>Desperate, Hair-Brain'd, Vindictive Wretch,</hi> as He would
Represent Her; The <hi>Other,</hi> a <hi>Good, Peace-making Gentlewoman;</hi>
Whereof He Himself takes upon him to be a <hi>Son,</hi> and a <hi>Member.</hi>
And now to shew that he is all of a piece; and as <hi>Faithful</hi> an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian,</hi>
as a <hi>Canonical Church-of-England-Man;</hi> Nothing can ever
so Effectually Terminate <hi>THis Dispute,</hi> as the Issue of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> (soon after his Majesties late Return) toward a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41026:21"/>
General Accommodation. I forget <hi>Names;</hi> But they Brake, upon
This Point: Because the King's Commissioners would not
agree <hi>[That the Enjoying of Things</hi> Lawful, <hi>by</hi> Lawful Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
<hi>if they may by</hi> Accident, <hi>be the Occasion of</hi> Sin, <hi>is</hi> Sinful.]
His Majesty, for the Purpose, bids the Asserter of that Doctrine,
<hi>Light him a Candle: No;</hi> (says he) <hi>if it should happen to be Blown
out, and give Offence, some bodies Throat may come to be Cut upon't.</hi>
This is it now, that our Author calls <hi>The Church of England's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing</hi>
their <hi>Interest,</hi> to their <hi>Revenge;</hi> because they would not
Agree to a <hi>Principle,</hi> Absolutely <hi>Destructive</hi> of <hi>Human Society.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either you will blame this Proceeding in them,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> and for that Reason not follow it; or if
you allow it, you have no reason to be offended with them: So that you must either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
your Anger, or lose your Excuse, except you should argue more partially, then will
be supposed of Men of your Morality, and Vnderstanding. <hi>p.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>This Method of Reasoning is just as if a Man should Raise a
<hi>Building</hi> upon a <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Blown Bladders;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> where there's
nothing but <hi>Wind,</hi> and <hi>Blast,</hi> to <hi>Support</hi> the <hi>Fabrick.</hi> He runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with the <hi>Fact,</hi> for <hi>Granted; Dilemma's</hi> upon it, and so leaves
the Matter in the Hands of Men of <hi>Morality,</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you had now to do with those <hi>Rigid Prelates,</hi> who made it a matter of Conscience
to give you the least Indulgence,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> and even to your more reasonable Scruples continued
stiff and inexorable, the Argument might be fairer on your side; but since the common
Danger hath so land open that Mistake, that all the former Haughtiness towards you is
for ever extinguished; and that it hath turned the Spirit of <hi>Persecution,</hi> into a Spirit
of <hi>Peace, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Condescension;</hi> shall this happy Change only affect the Church
of <hi>England?</hi> And are you so in love with separation, as not to be moved by this Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?
It ought to be followed, were there no other Reason then that it is a Virtue; but
when besides that, it is become necessary to your Preservation, it is impossible to fail
the having its Effect upon you.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Party-per-Pale-Humour,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> runs to the Tune of the Old
Song: <hi>[And no body else shall Plunder but I;]</hi> For the <hi>Quarrel</hi>
does not lye to the <hi>Dissenters</hi> so much for any <hi>Animosity</hi> of <hi>Theirs</hi>
toward the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but for breaking in upon our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<hi>Patent</hi> of <hi>Sole Privilege</hi> for the Abusing of them <hi>Himself.</hi>
There was a Time, 'tis True, when <hi>Prelates,</hi> (says he) were <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid,
Vncharitable, Vnreasonable, Stiff,</hi> and <hi>Inexorable, Haughty,</hi>
and under the Power of the <hi>Spirit of Persecution,</hi> &amp;c. But All is
turn'd now it seems [into a <hi>Spirit of Peace, Charity,</hi> and <hi>Condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension]
(Quere</hi> if it should not have been, <hi>Comprehension)</hi> As wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
the <hi>Pacifick Genius,</hi> and <hi>Tenderness</hi> of the <hi>Author</hi> here, and
his <hi>Paper.</hi> Is the Church of <hi>England</hi> so <hi>Reform'd,</hi> (the <hi>Letter's</hi>
Church of <hi>England,</hi> that is) and will none of You, my Masters,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41026:22"/>
come in, to take your <hi>Parts</hi> in the <hi>Blessing? Are you so in love with</hi>
Separation, that when <hi>Wee</hi> come <hi>down</hi> to <hi>You,</hi> you'l be <hi>running
away</hi> from <hi>Vs?</hi> (For That's the Meaning on't.) 'Tis your <hi>Interest</hi>
as well as your <hi>Virtue,</hi> to <hi>Associate:</hi> And what's All This now,
but the <hi>Down-right Project</hi> of Uniting into a <hi>Republique?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it should be said, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is never <hi>Humble,</hi> but when she is
out of <hi>Power,</hi> and therefore loseth the Right of being believed when she pretendeth to
it:<note place="margin">Letter.</note> The Answer is, First, it would be an Vncharitable Objection, and very much miss-timed:
An Vnseasonable Triumph, not only Vngenerous, but Vnsafe: So that in These
Respects, it cannot be Vrged without <hi>Scandal,</hi> even though it could be said with <hi>Truth.</hi>
Secondly, This is not so in Fact, and the Argument must fall, being built upon a false
foundation; for whatever may be told you, at this very Hour, and in the Heat, and
Glare of your present Sunshine, the Church of <hi>England</hi> can in a Moment bring Clouds
again, and turn the Royal Thunder upon your Heads; Blow you off the Stage with a
Breath, if she would give but a Smile, or a kind Word; the least Glimpse of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
would throw you back into the State of Suffering, and draw upon you all the
Arrears of Severity, which have accrued during the time of this Kindness to you; and
yet the Church of <hi>England,</hi> with all her Faults, will not allow her self to be rescued
by such unjustifiable means, but chooseth to bear the Weight of <hi>Power,</hi> rather then lye
under the Burden of being <hi>Criminal. p.</hi> 7, 8.</p>
            <p>VVE have here as Lewd a Charactor given <hi>(betwixt Hawk

Pen of a <hi>Pretended Church-of-England-Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answer.</note> as the Concurring
<hi>Wit,</hi> and <hi>Spite</hi> of the Greatest <hi>Enemy</hi> she has upon the Face of the
Earth, could put together. Her <hi>Humility</hi> is made the Effect of
her <hi>Impotence;</hi> and therefore there's <hi>No Believing of her,</hi> (says the
<hi>Comment.)</hi> But then (says the Author <hi>Handy Dandy)</hi> That's a
little <hi>Vncharitable,</hi> and <hi>Miss-timed;</hi> and it is neither <hi>Generous,</hi>
nor <hi>Safe:</hi> So that at This <hi>Season</hi> it could hardly be said without
Scandal, tho among Friends, no more perhaps then <hi>Truth;</hi> But then
he Rubs up the <hi>Dissenters</hi> again, with a <hi>Politick</hi> Flint, that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> (Meaning <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>his Church of <hi>England</hi> still) is not
so <hi>Low,</hi> yet neither, as People Imagine; and that she <hi>Could in
the next Moment,</hi> Command <hi>Clouds</hi> and <hi>Thunder;</hi> Turn <hi>Heaven and
Earth</hi> Topsy-Turvj with <hi>[but a Smile, or a Kind Word:]</hi> But <hi>Our
Author's Church of England scorns to be Rescued by such Vnjustifiable
Means;</hi> (as giving the King <hi>Thanks;) and will rather</hi> beare <hi>the</hi>
Weight of Power, <hi>then the</hi> Burthen <hi>of being</hi> Criminal; which is
all one, as to say, Let the <hi>King</hi> do what he will, he shall never
make us Crouch, either to his <hi>Authority,</hi> or his <hi>Power;</hi> like a
Company of <hi>Sneaking, Sniveling, Loyal, Thankful Rogues.</hi> But
have <hi>His Church-of-England-Men</hi> a <hi>Power</hi> to do All This? (as he

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:41026:22"/>
               <hi>Word,</hi> and to <hi>Stop the Sun in his Course.</hi> In fine, his Majesties

as well as <hi>Wit</hi> in his <hi>Anger:</hi> For after the <hi>Crippling</hi> of the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> he Furnishes
a <hi>Crutch; and calls in the</hi> LEGISLATIVE <hi>Help to Support it;</hi> and so drops the

            <p>You have formerly blamed the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Letter.</note> and not without reason, for going so
far as they did in their Compliance; and yet as soon as they stopped, you see they are not
only Deserted, but Prosecuted: Conclude then from this Example, that you must either
break off your Friendship, or resolve to have no Bounds in it. If they do not succeed in
their Design, they will leave you first; if they do, you must either leave them, when it
will be too late for your Safety, or else after the squeaziness of starting at a Surplice, you
must be forced to swallow <hi>Transubstantiation. p.</hi> 9.</p>

Give <hi>My</hi> People the Exercise of <hi>Their</hi> Religion, (says the King) and do <hi>You</hi> Enjoy

            <p>Remember that the other day those of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Trimmers</hi> for

            <p>There's a <hi>Nest of Boxes</hi> in This Clause: The <hi>Author</hi>'s Church of <hi>England,</hi> has

not <hi>Half so much,</hi> nor in half so <hi>Good Earnest,</hi> as I am affraid of the <hi>Commonwealths-Men;</hi>

the Exclusion of a <hi>Third Party</hi> of his Majesties Subjects, out of All Terms of

You see how the <hi>Protestants,</hi> nay, and the very <hi>Converts</hi> too are used in

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Protestants</hi> have but one Article of Humane Strength,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> to oppose the Power
which is now against them, and that is, not to lose the Advantage of their Numbers,
by being so unwary as to let themselves be divided.</p>
            <p>HE is All,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 
               <hi>Poltiques</hi> here, <hi>up to the Hilts:</hi> He has Erected a <hi>Scheme;</hi> Found

what are Those Numbers to <hi>do?</hi> They are to <hi>Oppose</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> which is now <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>

of the <hi>Papists,</hi> Every Mother's Son of 'em. <hi>One</hi> and <hi>All</hi> is the <hi>Word;</hi> That is

            </p>
            <p>We all agree in our Duty to our Prince;<note place="margin">Letter.</note> Our Objections to his Belief, do not hinder
us from seeing his Virtues; and our not complying with his Religion, hath no effect upon
our Allegiance; We are not to be Laug'ed out of our <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Non Resistance,</hi> though even those who perhaps owe the best part of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
to That Principle are apt to make a jest of it. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>THis is one of the Trimmest Periods we have had yet:<note place="margin">Answer.</note> Men may <hi>Agree</hi> in
their <hi>Duty</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> and yet <hi>mistake</hi> That <hi>Duty;</hi> And neither <hi>Judge</hi> of
it, nor <hi>Practice</hi> it Aright. If by This <hi>Duty,</hi> he means a <hi>Duty</hi> so <hi>Qualified,</hi> as that
is which runs thorough This Paper, the Lord Deliver his Majesty from his Subjects
<hi>Agreement</hi> in a <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>That Complexion.</hi> A Man may <hi>see</hi> his <hi>Princes Virtue,</hi> without
loving him ever the <hi>Better</hi> for't. And what is it to say, that the <hi>Kings Religion</hi>
does not Operate upon <hi>My Allegeance,</hi> when my <hi>Allegeance</hi> may be <hi>Rotten,</hi> as well
<hi>without</hi> it, as <hi>with</hi> it. A Man may be <hi>Debauched,</hi> and <hi>Corrupted</hi> out of his

            <p>So that if we give no Advantage by the fatal mistake of mis-applying our Anger, by
the natural Course of Things,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> this Danger will pass away like a showre of Hail; Fair
Weather will succeed, as lowring as the Sky now looketh, and all by this plain and easie
Receipt; Let us be still, quiet, and undivided, firm at the same time to our Religion, our
Loyalty, and our Laws; and so long as we continue this method, it is next to impossible,
that the Odds of Two Hundred to One should lose the Bett; Except the Church of Rome
which hath been so long barren of Miracles, should now in her Declining Age, be brought
to Bed of one that <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

of This Discourse. <hi>Arger misapply'd,</hi> is a <hi>Fatal Mistake,</hi> he says, and he
has given us a <hi>Long Letter</hi> here, in <hi>Proof</hi> on't: But why does he bid us be
<hi>[Still]</hi> and lye <hi>Wrangling himself?</hi> Why does he Advise <hi>[Quiet]</hi> and <hi>Create Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet?</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:41026:25"/>
How comes he to Press <hi>Vnity,</hi> and at the <hi>Same Time</hi> to raise <hi>[Divisions?]
Religion, Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Laws,</hi> are <hi>Gay Words;</hi> but they have been Apply'd, we know,
to the <hi>License</hi> of the most <hi>Atheistical, Rebellious,</hi> and <hi>Dissolute Times.</hi> If his <hi>Counsel</hi>
be General, the <hi>Advice</hi> of <hi>This Clause</hi> Overthrows the <hi>Drift,</hi> and <hi>Contradicts</hi> the
<hi>Design</hi> of All that Went before; for the <hi>Papists</hi> are excepted out of the <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
If he Restrains it only to the <hi>Protestants,</hi> What Colour of <hi>Right</hi> can any <hi>One
Part</hi> of his Majesties Subjects <hi>Pretend</hi> to, for the <hi>Excluding</hi> of any <hi>Other?</hi> He closes
the Section with an <hi>Allegory</hi> upon <hi>Midwifry,</hi> which I have No Skill in.</p>
            <p>To conclude,<note place="margin">Letter.</note> the short Question will be, Whether you will joyn with those who must in the
end run the same Fate with you. If Protestants of all sorts, in their Behaviour to one
another, have been to blame, they are upon the more equal terms, and for that very reason
it is fitter for them now to be reconciled. Our Dis-union is not only a Reproche, but a
Danger to us; those who believe in modern Miracles, have more Right, or at least more
Excuse, to neglect all Secular Cautions; but for us, it is as justifiable to have no Religion,
as wilfully to throw away the Human Means of preserving it. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>HEre is indeed,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> as <hi>Short,</hi> and as <hi>Wild</hi> a <hi>Question,</hi> as a body would Wish, without

to any other <hi>Determinate Point,</hi> that a body might have known what to speak to,
One might have made a <hi>Bolt or a Shaft</hi> on't; but to talk of the <hi>[Same Fate]</hi> at
Large: why who knows, but he may Carry it to <hi>Election, Reprobation,</hi> or <hi>What
not?</hi> And, under favour, it was a Great Oversight in him, to lay the Stress of
the <hi>Persuasive</hi> upon the <hi>Train</hi> of the <hi>Company,</hi> that goes the same Way, rather
then upon the <hi>Reason</hi> of the <hi>Thing:</hi> Especially Considering, that the <hi>Same Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

the <hi>Authors Last Words,</hi> shall be the <hi>Answerers</hi> too. I am,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> Your most Affectionate Humble Servant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:41026:25"/>
IN the Course of This <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Answer</hi> I have dealt Faithfully in every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
both of <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Comment;</hi> but I have somewhat yet more to add upon
the <hi>Whole Matter,</hi> touching the <hi>Judgment, Candor,</hi> and <hi>Design</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the <hi>Conduct,</hi> and <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Paper it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> Writes himself a <hi>Church-of-England-Man,</hi> but it must be by a <hi>Second
Venter</hi> then; for he gives his <hi>Orthodox Mother</hi> most <hi>Bloudy hard Words,</hi> even in his
Pretended <hi>Zeale</hi> for the <hi>Interest</hi> of That <hi>Communion.</hi> A <hi>Papist</hi> is his <hi>Aversion:</hi>
And Then he is No <hi>Dissenter</hi> neither; for 'tis the <hi>Main Drift</hi> of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> to
<hi>Cluck</hi> the <hi>Dissenters</hi> over to him, and <hi>Gather</hi> them under his <hi>Wing:</hi> Only by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he is <hi>Not,</hi> he gives in some measure to understand what he <hi>Is.</hi> If one may
Judge of his <hi>Perswasion,</hi> by his <hi>Letter,</hi> it is an Hundred and Fifty <hi>Diversities,</hi> of
<hi>Opinion, Kneaded</hi> together according to the <hi>Amsterdam Dispensatory,</hi> into one <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Composition,</hi> under the <hi>Nick Name</hi> of <hi>[PROTESTANT:]</hi> So that a Body may
say of the <hi>Religion</hi> of This <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> as the Wench in the <hi>Comedy</hi> said of her
<hi>Bastard, 'Tis the TROVP'S Religion, 'tis the TROVP'S Child;</hi> and there went a
great many People to the <hi>Making</hi> of it. In one Word; it is a <hi>Coalition</hi> of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Nominal Religions</hi> into <hi>One State-Faction;</hi> for though there may be <hi>Conscience</hi>
in <hi>the Particular Opinions, Severally,</hi> and <hi>Apart;</hi> it is yet <hi>Impossible</hi> for the <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to be any thing but a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> in the <hi>Conjunction; Tha</hi> being the <hi>Only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
wherein they can <hi>Vnite.</hi> As to the <hi>Candor</hi> of the Writer, and his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;</hi>
It is as Clear as Day, that he has taken up a <hi>False Pretence,</hi> as well as a
<hi>False Person;</hi> and that he neither is a <hi>Genuine Son</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor
a <hi>True Friend</hi> to't; for <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness</hi> are not more Contrary One to Another,
then his <hi>Practice</hi> is to his <hi>Profession:</hi> Insomuch, that his own <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> are
<hi>a Thousand Witnesses</hi> against him.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> he says, upon the Late Kings Restauration, <hi>Sacrificed
their Interest to their</hi> REVENGE. RIGID PRELATES that kept People at an
UNCHARITABLE <hi>Distance:</hi> STIFF and INEXORABLE to <hi>Reasonable Scruples:</hi>
HAUGHTY, and Govern'd by <hi>the Spirit of</hi> PERSECUTION. Letter to a Dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>senter,
<hi>p.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>Is not This a Gracious <hi>Church-of-England-Child</hi> now, to talk at This Rate of <hi>his
own Mother?</hi> And then to shew that he has every Jot as little <hi>Reverence</hi> for his
<hi>Civil Parent,</hi> as he has for his <hi>Ecclesiastical;</hi> take his Papers from End to End,
and he has not so much as One Line in 'em that looks kindly upon the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
for what's the <hi>Drift</hi> of them, but to <hi>Debauch</hi> the <hi>Dissenters</hi> from their <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
to <hi>Possess</hi> the <hi>Multitude</hi> with <hi>Desperate Positions</hi> against the <hi>King's Power; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies</hi>
against his <hi>Administration,</hi> and <hi>Down-right Slanders</hi> upon his <hi>Honour</hi> and
<hi>Justice!</hi> To <hi>Hair</hi> Them out of their <hi>Wits,</hi> with <hi>Croking,</hi> and <hi>Ill-boding Presages;</hi>
Fill their <hi>Heads</hi> with <hi>Enflaming,</hi> and <hi>Implacable Jealousies, Alarm</hi> them with <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionary
Dangers; Stir</hi> them up to <hi>Outrages,</hi> by an Ostentation of their <hi>Numbers;
Flatter</hi> them into a <hi>False Opinion</hi> of their <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Privileges!</hi> And who but
the <hi>Mobile,</hi> all this while, for the <hi>Judges</hi> of the <hi>Controversie!</hi> What's the Whole
Discourse, in fine, but a <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Civil Power</hi> betwixt <hi>King</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> upon
the <hi>Text</hi> of PROTESTANT and PAPIST! And in One Word; A <hi>Paradox</hi> of
<hi>Conscience Dodg'd</hi> into a <hi>Popular Scheme</hi> of <hi>Government!</hi> But All, under the
<hi>Pretext</hi> still, of a <hi>Church of England Letter</hi> too; though <hi>Bloud</hi> was as much a <hi>Church
of England Doctor,</hi> when he <hi>Stole the Crown;</hi> And I would the <hi>Resemblance</hi> of This
Pamphlet did not look like the <hi>same Character Assum'd</hi> again, for the <hi>same End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter, they say, has made some <hi>Proselytes.</hi> (as they call them:) but <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Friends,</hi> and <hi>Abetters</hi> it has, in <hi>Abundance,</hi> though, most <hi>Infallibly,</hi> whoever
is a Friend to the <hi>Intent,</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> of it, is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to the <hi>True Church of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:41026:26"/>
England,</hi> as well as to that of <hi>Rome:</hi> to the <hi>Honour</hi> of his <hi>Majesty,</hi> and to the <hi>Peace</hi>
of his <hi>Dominions:</hi> And therefore People should do well to Consider the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
and the <hi>Biass</hi> of This Letter, before they take upon them to Judge of the <hi>Merits</hi>
of it. I reckon it My <hi>Duty</hi> however, not to let the <hi>Scandal</hi> of so <hi>Vndutiful</hi> a
<hi>Practice</hi> rest at the Door of <hi>the Church of England,</hi> if I know how to <hi>remove</hi> it.</p>
            <p>I have one Word more to say yet, upon a Fancy, that has taken People in the
Head upon this Occasion: <hi>First, That no Church of England man will Answer This
Letter.</hi> 2ly. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> of All <hi>Others,</hi> that has ever been so <hi>Bitter,</hi> and so <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
against <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> is the Unfittest Man in Nature, to take upon him
to <hi>Defend</hi> it: In <hi>Contradiction</hi> to his <hi>Toleration Discuss'd,</hi> his <hi>Observators,</hi> and
<hi>Twenty Pamphlets</hi> more upon This Subject. <hi>Generals prove Nothing;</hi> Beside that
they are commonly the <hi>Refuge</hi> of <hi>Shufflers,</hi> and <hi>Cheats.</hi> But I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
however, to put the Matter to <hi>This Issue:</hi> Let but any man that Charges Mee
with such <hi>Contradictions,</hi> submit to pass for a <hi>Fool,</hi> if he does not particularly
<hi>Prove</hi> them; and let me Wear the <hi>Reputation</hi> of a <hi>Knave,</hi> if (in a <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Equity</hi> of <hi>Construction)</hi> he makes his <hi>Accusation Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now but <hi>One Point</hi> more to speak to; And That's the <hi>Subject</hi> of the
<hi>King's Power;</hi> 'Tis no more then what the <hi>Letter Requires,</hi> and what I have <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi>
to do; And in Conclusion, a <hi>Right</hi> that I Owe, both to the <hi>Cause,</hi> and to
my <hi>Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Letter</hi> to a <hi>Dissenter</hi> has several <hi>Dangerous Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages,</hi>
p 5, 6, 8, a. upon the Argument of the <hi>King's Prerogative,</hi> and the <hi>Duty</hi> of a
<hi>Subject.</hi> He Questions the Kings <hi>Late Declaration,</hi> in point of <hi>Law,</hi> p. 5. And lays
down for a <hi>Maxim,</hi> that <hi>No Trespass against the Laws in Being, is to be Defended:</hi>
Though <hi>Vniversal Practice,</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> are agreed upon't, that the <hi>Obligation</hi> of
All <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> is in some sort, <hi>Conditional.</hi> He makes <hi>Addressing</hi> of <hi>Thanks,</hi>
upon That Declaration, to be the <hi>Giving up of a Right in the Law,</hi> p. 6. He sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
the <hi>King himself, Doubtful of his own Power,</hi> p. 9. He Reasons all he can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Dispensing Power,</hi> and <hi>Repealing the Test,</hi> p. 8. And he calls <hi>Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
to That <hi>Declaration,</hi> the <hi>Setting up of a Power to</hi> HELP <hi>the People, that will</hi> DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STROY
<hi>them,</hi> p. 6.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Positions</hi> are Communicated; in at Least <hi>Twenty Thousand Copies</hi> perhaps,
to his Majesties <hi>Subjects,</hi> in All <hi>Quarters</hi> of the Kingdom; and the <hi>Doctrine, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>〈13 letters〉</desc>
                  </gap>t'd</hi>
with the most <hi>Artificial Colours</hi> that the Matter will bear. Upon the whole
Business, there's Nothing to be done in such a Case as This, but by Encountring
<hi>Industry</hi> with <hi>Industry</hi> and <hi>Opposing Truth</hi> to <hi>Error.</hi> There will be No Need of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,</hi>
and a <hi>Particular Answer</hi> to This and That <hi>Clause,</hi> or <hi>Period,</hi> but rather to
speak to the <hi>Whole Question,</hi> at Once, in a <hi>Clear,</hi> and an <hi>Effectual Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO begin at the Root of the Controversie; The King puts out a <hi>Declaration of
Indulgence:</hi> The Author of the <hi>Letter to a Dissenter,</hi> Denyes his <hi>Dispensing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;</hi>
makes the very <hi>Acceptance</hi> of it <hi>Criminal</hi> in the Subject; and a <hi>Giving up of
their Rights;</hi> and Positively Pronounces <hi>the Law to be so Sacred, that No Trespass
against it is to be Defended.</hi> It rests now to Prove, that This <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
is not only <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and <hi>Pernicious,</hi> with a Respect to our Present <hi>Case,</hi>
and <hi>Constitution,</hi> but Utterly Destructive of <hi>Humane Society,</hi> and of the very <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations</hi>
of <hi>Government it self.</hi> To say nothing how Artificially the Writer of That
Letter has shamm'd upon the People his Maiesties Act of Grace in favour of the
<hi>Dissenters,</hi> for a Matter Concerted betwixt <hi>Them,</hi> and the <hi>Papists,</hi> without which
Pretence, the Incidians Part of the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> falls to the <hi>Ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the Clearing of This Question, He that would take the <hi>Just Measures</hi>
of the Prerogatives of <hi>Power,</hi> should properly look back into the <hi>Original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:41026:26"/>
and from thence Trace the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and the <hi>Providence</hi> of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, through the <hi>Means</hi> to the <hi>End;</hi> and through the <hi>Causes</hi> to their <hi>Effects;</hi>
There are, 'tis true, Certain <hi>Prerogatives Peculiar</hi> to <hi>This,</hi> or <hi>That Frame of State</hi>
and Differing in <hi>One</hi> Place, from what they are in <hi>Another:</hi> But These are of a
<hi>Humane Make,</hi> and may be <hi>Laid down,</hi> as they were <hi>Taken up,</hi> at pleasure. They
are <hi>Local, Temporary, Personal, Conditional, Occasional Privileges</hi> perhaps, and
not of the Number of Those <hi>Sacred, Vnchangeable,</hi> and <hi>Incommunicable Essentials,</hi>
that we are here speking of.</p>
            <p>It was the Work of an <hi>Omnipotent Power,</hi> to make the <hi>World</hi> out of <hi>Nothing;</hi>
As <hi>Order</hi> was the Work of the <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> consequently, of a
<hi>Divine Institution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Appointment. This Government</hi> was <hi>Ordained</hi> for the <hi>Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Men in <hi>Society;</hi> And <hi>That Ordinance</hi> would have been utterly <hi>Vain,</hi> and
of No Effect, without a <hi>Competency</hi> of <hi>Powers,</hi> and <hi>Faculties,</hi> for securing of All
the Ends of it. Now if <hi>Government it self</hi> was immediately from <hi>God</hi> Those
<hi>Eminences</hi> of <hi>Privilege</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> without which That <hi>Primary Power</hi> Cannot
<hi>Work,</hi> must needs be of <hi>Divine Right</hi> too; And <hi>Kings</hi> are so less Answerable to
their <hi>Principal,</hi> for the <hi>Maintenance</hi> of the <hi>Power,</hi> with which they are <hi>Entrusted,</hi>
then they are for the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it: So that if <hi>Rulers</hi> cannot Depart from These
<hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> without Breach of <hi>Faith;</hi> If <hi>Humane Laws</hi> shall be
found <hi>Insufficient</hi> to Answer all the <hi>Emergencies,</hi> and <hi>Variations</hi> of <hi>Humane Affairs;</hi>
And if the <hi>Reserve</hi> of a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Dispense</hi> with those <hi>Humane Laws,</hi> in case of
such and such Exigencies, shall be likewise found of <hi>Absolute Necessity</hi> for the
<hi>Support</hi> of <hi>Government;</hi> the Sum of the Question will be brought into a Narrow
Compass; and no more then <hi>This:</hi> Shall a <hi>Prince,</hi> in favour of an <hi>Imperfect, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Law, Dispense</hi> with an <hi>Vndispensable Duty</hi> to a <hi>Law Divine?</hi> And in so doing,
<hi>Dispense</hi> with <hi>God's Law,</hi> rather then <hi>Dispense</hi> with his <hi>Own?</hi> It is a Thing past
Dispute, that many <hi>Laws</hi> have been <hi>Nullities</hi> in the very <hi>Creation</hi> of them: And
it is <hi>Impossible</hi> to make Any <hi>Positive Law of Man</hi> so <hi>Extensive,</hi> as to Answer <hi>All
Circumstances</hi> of <hi>Time, Place. Condition, Change,</hi> or <hi>Occasion:</hi> The <hi>Force</hi> and the
<hi>Frequency</hi> of <hi>Over-ruling Necessities,</hi> is Granted on All Hands, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Government</hi> is, there is the <hi>Judgment.</hi> If the <hi>People</hi> may <hi>Judge,</hi> they
may <hi>Censure;</hi> If <hi>Censure, Punish,</hi> If <hi>Punish,</hi> they <hi>Govern:</hi> And the <hi>Yielding</hi> of
<hi>One Point</hi> to a <hi>Popular Vsurpation,</hi> does in Effect, <hi>Tacitly</hi> Entitle them to the <hi>Rest.</hi>
Neither is there Any other <hi>Limit</hi> set to this <hi>Power,</hi> then the <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi>
and the <hi>Justice</hi> of the Governer; For the Bare <hi>Admittance,</hi> of a <hi>Check,</hi>
or <hi>Controll,</hi> Implies a <hi>Superiour Power:</hi> Men are <hi>Corrupt, Frail, Short-sighted,</hi> and
their <hi>Works, Imperfect. Bills</hi> may be <hi>Carry'd</hi> by <hi>Passion, Interest, Power;</hi> and there
may be likewise <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> or <hi>Sinister Consideration</hi> in the <hi>Passing</hi> of them; but
the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and of <hi>Equity,</hi> are <hi>Sacred,</hi> and <hi>Certain;</hi> for That which <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
does, <hi>God</hi> does.</p>
            <p>This is Chiefly intended of <hi>Laws</hi> that were <hi>Well enough,</hi> or perhaps, <hi>Excellent
Provisions,</hi> at the First <hi>making</hi> of them; but in Tract of <hi>Time,</hi> upon some <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Revolution;</hi> or in such or such a <hi>Case</hi> perchance, may be found <hi>Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.
These,</hi> I say, may be <hi>Suspended;</hi> but then there are Laws of <hi>Another Sort,</hi>
that are <hi>Void, ab Initio,</hi> and upon <hi>No Terms</hi> to be either <hi>Defended,</hi> or <hi>Executed;</hi>
As I have Instanced formerly somewhat to this Purpose in the Case of the <hi>Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
under <hi>Charles the First</hi> against the <hi>Papists.</hi> That Excellent Prince according
to all <hi>Reasonable,</hi> and <hi>Humane Presumption,</hi> lost his <hi>Crown,</hi> and his <hi>Life,</hi> in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi>
to a <hi>Void Act of his Own,</hi> in pretending to Bar himself the <hi>Vse,</hi> and <hi>Service</hi>
of his <hi>Subjects:</hi> As if <hi>an Act of State could Supersede a Fundamental of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
I have the Authority of Great Man (Bishop <hi>Sanderson)</hi> to Back me in
the <hi>Casuistical Stress</hi> of This <hi>Instance: [God</hi> (says he) <hi>hath given to his Vicegerents
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41026:27"/>
here on Earth, a</hi> RIGHT <hi>In, and a</hi> POWER <hi>Over the Persons of</hi> ALL <hi>their Subjects,
within their several Respective Dominions, even to the spending of their Lives in their
Countries Service;</hi> WHENSOEVER <hi>they shall be by Their Authority called thereunto.</hi>
Five Cases, <hi>p. 71.]</hi> Now if they have These Privileges of RIGHT, and POWER,
from GOD; and Extending to ALL, and WHENSOEVER, without <hi>Exception,</hi>
either to <hi>Time, Number,</hi> or <hi>Distinction</hi> of Persons: What Earthly Power shall dare
to <hi>Controll</hi> This <hi>Commission?</hi> And I have One Word more to Offer now (that I
have formerly spoken to) which comes a little Closer yet to the Point.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>[Honour thy Father and thy Mother]</hi> is undoubtedly of <hi>Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi>
and a <hi>Command,</hi> of an <hi>Immutable,</hi> and <hi>Indispensable Obligation:</hi> And it
has <hi>Catholique Assent</hi> to't, that it Extends, as well to our <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Political,</hi> as to
our <hi>Natural Parents.</hi> By <hi>This Law, All Subjects</hi> are <hi>Bound</hi> in <hi>Conscience</hi> to Attend
the <hi>Call,</hi> and the <hi>Service</hi> of their <hi>Prince;</hi> for the <hi>Precept</hi> is <hi>Positive;</hi> without Any
<hi>Qualification, Limitation,</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> whatsoever. The Question will be Shortly
<hi>This</hi> now; Whether Any <hi>King,</hi> can by any Act of <hi>Civil Authority, Divest</hi> himself
of This <hi>Right,</hi> over the <hi>Persons</hi> of his <hi>Subjects?</hi> I do not say but he may Chuse
whether he will <hi>Command</hi> them, or <hi>Not;</hi> but he Cannot <hi>Discharge</hi> his People of
their <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Obedience,</hi> in case he <hi>Requires</hi> their <hi>Service;</hi> That is to say; In any
case, which is not <hi>Contrary</hi> to the <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God. No Humane Law</hi> Can
<hi>Absolve</hi> them from That Office of <hi>Allegeance:</hi> So that in the Conclusion, either
Those <hi>Subjects</hi> are <hi>Clear</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> that serve their <hi>Prince,</hi> when by him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<hi>required,</hi> notwithstanding any <hi>Law of Man</hi> to the <hi>Contrary;</hi> Or the <hi>Ten
Commandments</hi> may be turn'd to <hi>Waste Paper;</hi> If the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> shall <hi>Forbid</hi>
upon a <hi>Penalty,</hi> That which the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>God, Commands</hi> upon a <hi>Penalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is enough for my <hi>Present Purpose;</hi> and if it be not so for <hi>Common Satisfaction,</hi>
My Third Volume of <hi>Observators,</hi> has <hi>Fifty Times as much upon this Subject.</hi>
