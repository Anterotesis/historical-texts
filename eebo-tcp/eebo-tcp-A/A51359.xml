            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR TO THE Courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>IN the continual and laborious Service, for the ſpace of five and twenty years (in which time, I have always exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd the Charge of an Ingeneer, as well in the Wars of <hi>Germany, Dalmatia,</hi> and in the Defence of <hi>Candia:)</hi> Amongſt other my Mititary Obſervations, I have always much admired, the excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and prodigious Effects of Great Artillery. Of which having Compoſed a ſmall Treatiſe for my own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, which coming accidentally into the hands of my Friends, and being by them diſperſed in Manuſcripts into moſt Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> I have at last by their importunities, and eſpecially the earneſt ſollicitation of my
<pb facs="tcp:105660:3"/>
worthy Brother, and famous Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician, Doctor Segnior <hi>Andrea,</hi> permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to be publiſhed for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of thoſe who are curious in Artillery. Being a Sacrifice which I make, not to Ambition, but for the Friendſhip and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility of Souldiers. Some, perhaps have done better, but have inlarged ſo much for Ornameut and Elegancy, that they have made their Volumes almoſt as heavy, as the Artillery of which they Treat.</p>
            <p>I therefore have writ that which I judge ſufficient for the knowledge of a Souldier, and as ſuccinct as poſſibly I eould, being not willing to be tedious in things leſs neceſſary. As for me, I never was to ſee the Artillery in <hi>China;</hi> but in this Part of the World, in which I have practiſed, I have not been wanting to ſee and examin, as much as could be, the best Proportions and Operations; And have always ſought afer the Acquaintance, Practice, Advice, and Directions of the Eminent Profeſſors in this Art, and have read most of thoſe Books which have been written of this Subject.</p>

               <p>THe Efficient Cauſe for Expelling the Shot, is the Fire that is made of a Powder com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Saltpetre, Brimſtone, and Charcoal.</p>
               <p>The Saltpetre makes the Blow or Crack, the Sulphur takes fire, and the Coal rarifies the other two, to make them fire the better.</p>
               <p>Two ſorts of Gun-powder are commonly in uſe; One is made of five, one, and one, being compounded of five parts of Saltpetre, one of Sulphur and the other Coal,</p>
               <p>The other ſort, being ſtronger, is of ſix, one, and one, being made of ſix parts of Salt-petre, one of Brimſtone, and the other of Coal.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:105660:13"/>
For Artillery, that of five, one, and one, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed, and the other for Muſquets and ſmall Arms, although ſome uſe this for Artillery, eſpecially for Field-peeces. <note n="b">The worſt that is made for his Majeſties uſe in <hi>England</hi> is of the latter, ſix, one, and one. It would be a very advantageous Experiment, that from a Barrel of Powder one could ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Petre, and know what weight was of it exactly.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Anciently they made Powder of four, one, and one, <hi>viz.</hi> four parts of Salt-petre, one of Brimſtone, and one of Coal, which ſerved for the Artillery of thoſe times, being ſmaller than our modern; but this Powder being overweak, is not now in uſe.</p>
               <p>To compare together the ſtrength of theſe three ſeverally, the Gunners have commonly a regard to the quantity of Salt-petre which is found in each; from whence they ſay that theſe will make the ſame effect. 45l of Powder of four, one, and one; 42l of five, one, and one; and 40l of ſix, one, and one, finding in all theſe weights an equal quantity of Salt-petre, <hi>viz.</hi> 30l: and being to load an ancient Peece, it would be convenient, for example, to take 24l of Powder of four, one, and one, in lieu where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they will imploy 22l ⅖ of that of five, one, and one, or elſe 21l ⅓ of that of ſix, one, and one.</p>
               <p>Others in lieu of that of four, one, and one,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105660:14"/>
make uſe of ⅘ of that of five, one, and one; and in ſtead of that of five, one, and one, imploy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And although this manner is diſallowed by ſome, (notwithſtanding it is not to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) becauſe an equal quantity of Salt-petre mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a different quantity of other materials doth not equally operate, but is more efficacious being united with a leſs proportion of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (even to certain proportions) than with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <head type="sub">Of Shot, and its Vent.</head>
               <p>TO Field-peeces of the firſt and ſecond kind they give Shots of Iron, but to thoſe of the third, Stone-ſhot, and other Artificial Bodies not heavier than the ſaid Ball; and to Field-pieces of the leaſt nature Shots of Lead.</p>
               <p>Amongſt Balls of the ſaid Diameter, but the three Natures aboveſaid, is commonly aſſign'd this proportion.</p>
               <p>Iron weighs the triple more than Stone, as 3 to 1.</p>
               <p>Lead weighs one half more than Iron, 3 to 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>Lead to Stone is 4½ times more, as 9 to 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </p>
               <p>But to ſpeak more properly:</p>
               <p>Iron is to Stone, as 31½ is to 10.</p>
               <p>Lead to Iron, as 14¼ to 10.</p>
               <p>Lead to Stone, as 47½ to 10.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs not all Leads, Iron, or Stone, are of the ſame weight.</p>
               <p>To load Artillery with Shot, as well Iron, Lead, as Stone, they do not fill the Chaſe, but leave ſpace for vent; for the Peece not being perfectly round, the Shot may go in and out eaſily. But there may not be too much vent, leſt the Fire paſs, and the Blow may come too weak.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105660:15"/>
Therefore the Diameter of a Ball being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to have the Calibre or Diameter of the Mouth, you muſt adde its Vent; or the Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre being given, to find the Diameter of the Ball, you muſt ſubtract the Vent.</p>
               <p>In ſome the Vent is found, by adding to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry 10 Pound of ſhot, one pound, as 30 making 33, and taking the Diameter of the Ball from 33, by the Caliper-Compaſſes giveth 30 l.</p>
               <p>Others take for every 12l, 1l, <hi>viz.</hi> one Ounce in the Pound <note n="a" place="margin">All <hi>Italy</hi> over, 12 Ounces makes a Pound.</note>, and makes the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>But the uſual Rule is to make the Vent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the one and twentieth part of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ball, or 1/22 of the Diameter of the Mouth or Muzzle.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that to make a Gun bear a certain Load of Ball, one make it juſt its Calibre, according to the Diameter of the Ball of which it weighs, but then they work with a leſſer Ball: yet if one would make a Culvering from 30l, they take the juſt Diameter of 30l, then in action they uſe a Ball with the Vent, which will be leſs than 30l, but it ſeems more reaſonable to make the Calibre greater to uſe the Ball of its true Weight.</p>
               <p>The Diameter of the Shots of Iron, Stone, and Lead of all us'd Weights, is by Gunners deſcribed upon a Ruler of Braſs, of four Faces, called by them the Calibre, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the three Faces the Diameters of Shots of Iron, Lead, and Stone; and upon the fourth Face, the Foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105660:15"/>
into Inches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
               <p>We put here the ſaid Scale corrected and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted to the <hi>Venetian</hi> Meaſure, unto 150l, as repreſented in the ſecond Figure.</p>
               <p>Note, that the ſaid Scale, not holding lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Diameters than of 150l, one may yet work by greater Weights unto 1200.</p>
               <p>The Weight being given, to find the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Ball, divide the Number of Pounds propounded, by Eight, then the Quotient of this Diviſion being ſearched upon the Face of the Scale, will give you the Semidiameter, by redoubling of which you ſhall have the whole Diameter of the Shot required.</p>
               <p>For Example, if 280 Pounds be given, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide this Number by Eight, the Quotient is 35, then the Diameter of 35 being taken upon the Scale, and redoubled, will give the Diameter deſired of 20l.</p>
               <p>The Diameter of a greater Shot being given contained in the Scale, to find the Weight in Pounds, divide the ſaid Diameter in half, and applying it to the Scale, obſerving the Number to which it correſponds, which being multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Eight, will give the Number of Pounds of the Ball required. <note n="a">Spherical Bodies, of what Metal ſoever, are one to another in weight, as the Cubes of their Diameters; therefore if the Diameter and Weight of any known Spherical Body be given,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105660:16"/>
and the Diameter of any other like Body be given, and the Weight ſought; or the Weight given, and the Diameter be ſought: ſay, As the Cube of the Diameter given, is to the Weight given; So is the Cube of the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the unweighed Sphere, to its Weight: and contrariwiſe for the Diameter. By this Rule, having the Diameter and Weight of a Shot, one may find the Weight of another; or having the Weight and Diameter of a Shot, and the Weight of another, one may find the Diameter. My Father, the 14th of March 1671, weighing ſeveral Iron Bullets with a Curious Scale, found one very near round of 6 Inches and 63/100 parts, to weigh exactly 41 Pounds, which agrees exceeding neer to 9 Pound for 4 Inches; and from the afore ſaid Rule, a Bullet of 1 pound Weight will have for its Diameter 1 Inch, and 93/100 of an Inch. The Diameter of one pound of courſe Lead will be 1 Inch, and 69/100 parts, and of hard Stone 2 Inches, and 67/100 parts. For making the Ru ler for Calibres, the Author wants a Table of <hi>Solids;</hi> I here inſert one, made long ſince by my Father, more exactly than thoſe printed in <hi>Ars magna Artillerii,</hi> or <hi>Furnier,</hi> which ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</note>

Now if you deſire for Example to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Scale for each pound for Iron caſt Shot, by the Diagonal Scale, and the Table of Solids, take the Numbers in the Table an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the ſeveral Pounds or Parts, and from your Diagonal Scale</hi> (Fig. 3.) <hi>take thoſe parts, and prick them from</hi> A <hi>the beginning of the Scale to the place that ſhall ſignifie the Pounds anſwerable.

The ſame work is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Lines for Lead and Stone from their ſeveral Diagonal Scales; you may note that 100 from thoſe Scales is for</hi> 1l, 200 <hi>for</hi> 8l, 300 <hi>for</hi> 27l, 400 <hi>for</hi> 64l, <hi>and 500 for</hi> 125l, <hi>becauſe 1. 8. 27. 64. and 125 are the Cubes of 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

               <head type="sub">Of the ſeveral Natures of Artillery.</head>
               <p>ALL Artillery are commonly reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three ſorts. The firſt is that of the Culvering, the ſecond Cannons of Battery, the third Cannons Petrieri.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this Diſtinction ought to be taken from the end to which the Artillery ſerves.</p>
               <p>The intent of Artillery in general is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a far off; but ſometimes is principally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the diſtance of Place, ſometimes the Offence, although one never goes without the other: for being to ſhoot a far off, the Object muſt either be of a ſtrong or weak reſiſtance; but if you would offend not far off, the Object in like manner muſt be either of a weak or a ſtrong reſiſtance. Now there being four ends, it ſeems reaſonable that Artillery be reduced to four ſorts, according to the Intents for which they ſerve.</p>
               <p>To offend a far off, in caſe of ſtrong reſiſtance, the Culverings do ſerve, which carries a Ball of Iron from 14 to 30l weight, although ſome make them to 120l.</p>
               <p>To offend a far off, in caſe of weak reſiſtance, as in Troops, Squadrons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoſe Peeces do ſerve which are called Field-peeces, or the ſmall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105660:19"/>
Artillery, and not Royal, and carry an Iron ſhot from 1 pound to 10 or 12 pound.</p>
               <p>To offend not far diſtant, in caſe of a ſtrong reſiſtance, are your Cannon of Battery, which carry a Ball of Iron from 20 to 50l weight, although ſome are made which carry to 100l and more, and ſerve to break down Walls and Parapets.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to offend at a ſmall diſtance, an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of weak reſiſtance, as Ships, and other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines of Timber, they do uſe your Cannon called <hi>Petrieroes,</hi> becauſe they carry a Shot of Stone, or any other Artificial Subſtance, and never of Iron; and this Ball of Stone may weigh from 14l to 100l weight.</p>
               <p>Note, that theſe are the four principal intents of each of theſe Natures, but a Peece of one ſort may ſerve in point of neceſſity for ſeveral Services.</p>
               <p>We nevertheleſs will not diſcourſe of the common uſe, but will name three only ſorts of Artillery, reducing the firſt to <hi>Culvering,</hi> and <hi>Field-peeces,</hi> which come to one another in a neer proportion.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond they of <hi>Battery.</hi>
               </p>

               <q>THE Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> commanding in chief the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Armies in the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> and knowing of what great concern the Recovery or the Retaking of the City of <hi>Antwerp</hi> would be to his Maſters Affairs, laid Siege before it in the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the year 1584, &amp; having ſeized on ſeveral Forts and other important places about the City, reſolved to make and lay a Bridge over the <hi>Schelde,</hi> at two Leagues from the City, to hinder the Beſieged from Succours which might come from <hi>Zealand</hi> that way,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105660:20"/>
that being the onely place by which they could receive them. And being Maſter of the Shore as well on that ſide of <hi>Flanders</hi> as <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi> he rais'd two ſtrong Bulworks on both ſides, and then ſtruck Piles of 30, 35, 40, and 50 Foot long, and mortaſs'd them together with ſtrong Beams and Girders to uphold a wooden Bridge, which he called the <hi>Palliſade,</hi> and upon which ten men might march in front. The River was large in this place, 1500 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſo deep that it was impoſſible to find Trees long and ſtrong enough to reach the bottom; and not being able to carry on his work more then 1000 Feet into the water, he finiſhed the reſt, which was 1300 Feet, by 30 Ships, which were diſtant 30 Feet the one from the other: each Ship had two Ankers a head, and a Stern to hinder the impetuoſity of the Tides, and many Shipmaſts and Planks to make the Platform of the Bridge; the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were faſten'd together with four Chains and four Cables, and carried two Guns a head, and two a Stern, and thirty Soldiers: upon this Bridge one might paſs from <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> into <hi>Flanders.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>On the Bridge, at every 500 paces, there were Rafts made of Shipmaſts and other wood, to ſtop thoſe that came, and to give leiſure to thoſe of the Bridge to fire from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove and ſink them. Moreover there were many ſmall Veſſels loaded with Soldiers, who guarded the Avenues.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:105660:21"/>
               <q>At the time that they built the Bridge, the Baſtions on both ſides the River were well guarded with Infantry, and furniſhed with Cannon, which nevertheleſs could not hinder that in the ſpace of ſeven months which they imployed in making the Palliſade, but that many Veſſels went and came to <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where they alſo fortified themſelves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſeveral Inventions to break this Bridge.</q>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Frederick Junibell</hi> or <hi>Giambel,</hi> Native of <hi>Mantoua,</hi> an Excellent Ingeneer, who was ſent there by the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> having demanded of the Citizens three Veſſels, one of 150 Tuns, another of 350, and a third of 500 Tuns, and 60 others wide and flat, which he would have joyned together with Chains, and have them diſpoſed in form of a half Moon, to have them riſe with the Tide, well armed with Grapnals, but he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain but two of 70 or 100 Tuns, of which one was called the <hi>Fortune,</hi> the other the <hi>Hope,</hi> with ten other ſmall flat Boats.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Then ſeeing theſe two Veſſels well tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd, and of a juſt capacity, he made in each, with great ſquare pieces of white ſtone, a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer or Cheſt of five Foot thick, 40 Foot long, and three and a half large and deep; in one of which he put 10000l of Cannon Powder, and in the other 7500, and cover'd both of them with maſſive great broad Grave-ſtones, which might eaſily reſiſt the violence of the Enemies Cannon.</q>

               <q>There were laid croſs theſe Machins ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Matches dreſſed with Sulphur, and aboard each Veſſel there was an artificial Engine, which ought to burn a whole hour before that the Coffers took fire, to amuſe the Beſiegers, and to make them believe that there was no other thing then what appeared aloſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Beſides, there were 32 very flat bottom'd Shallops, full of Ingredients, of which eight at every half hour ought to deſcend with the Tide, beſides others full of wild fire, which were to burn leiſurely the Rafts before the Bridge, to the end that the Enemy being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by continual firing, for the ſpace of ſome hours, the great Veſſels might have an eaſier acceſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The fourth day of <hi>July</hi> being appointed for this Enterpriſe, all this Preparation had not ſuch ſucceſs as they promiſed themſelves, therefore they ſuſpected ſome Treaſon; for theſe four Squadrons of eight Shallops apiece, ſet ſail almoſt all in the ſame time, contrary to the deſign of the Ingeneer, the tide begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſlack, and the two great Veſſels going away ſooner than they ſhould have done, one ran aſhore, and wanting water, did no Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution then kill ſome Soldiers. The Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> believing that the reſt would work no other effect, and that all would vaniſh in ſmoak, retired into St. <hi>Maries</hi> Fort. But a little after, three Shallops having burned ſome Rafts; and the great Veſſel as it happen'd (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

of the Beſiegers being come to view the Shallops) arriving juſt upon the point of the Palliſade, fired with ſuch violence and fury, that it tore in a thouſand pieces ſix of the Ships of the Bridge, overſet and blew into the air ſeveral others, tumbled down the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Marquiſs of <hi>Peſcara,</hi> (who were returning with as many men as they could find within a league about,) made an Earthquake four miles round, and broke the the Glaſs windows at ſix leagues diſtance, kill'd more than 500 perſons, amongſt whom were the Marquiſs of <hi>Rubais,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Billy;</hi> moreover, emptied the very chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the River, that being dry, and the water rais'd in the Air, and falling in the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring fields, almoſt entirely fill'd with water an adjacent Fort, and the Soldiers in the field were up to the knees in water, had their Cloths, Matches, Muſquets, and Artillery all wet, and were rendred ſo unfit for ſervice, that they had been without queſtion routed, if the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> had been in readineſs to have made a brisk Sally. The Prince forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with repaired this dammage, and left an open place in the Bridge to let all ſuch like Veſſels paſs, if they ſhould make any more attempt. Once more thoſe of <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſent another Ship of vaſt greatneſs, with hopes to perform more advantageous effects, and called her the <hi>End of the War,</hi> but ſucceeding very ill, as ſome others which were ſent down in the ſame

               <p>The <hi>Proportions,</hi> are either general or parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>The General Proportions, are thoſe which ſerve in all ſorts of Ordnance, and thoſe are, as touching their <hi>Breech, Touch-hole, Alteration</hi> of the <hi>thickneſs, Trunnions,</hi> the <hi>Caſcabel,</hi> and <hi>Rings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Particular Proportions, are thoſe which change according to the Nature and Species of the Artillery, as the <hi>Calibre, length,</hi> and <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the General Proportions, the <hi>Breech</hi> is always thick, when the Metal at the Touch-hole is thick, comprehending alſo the Metal of the Chamber if there be any.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Trunnions</hi> are thick and long, one Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Chaſe or Concave (where they are made.) In Groſs Cannons very often they make them ſhorter, not finding Side-Timbers or Cheeks ſtrong enough to make the Carriages.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Axletree</hi> of the Trunnions is diſtant from the Muzzle 4/7 of the length of the Chaſe, and from the Touch-hole 3/7, to the intent that the Peece may be moved eaſily, and being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heavier behind than before, is not Muzzle heavy. Some by putting them far diſtant from the Muzzle, and from the Touch-hole ⅖, by which they are made too heavy at the Muzzle.</p>
               <p>They are placed before the Level of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal under the Chaſe, that the Peece may be the higher mounted upon his Carriage, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more degrees of Elevation. Some often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times place them not ſo low, but make them ſo, that their higheſt leine correſponds and paſſes by the Diameter of the Chaſe, and the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Trunnions, by the loweſt line of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder, as do demonſtrate the <hi>Fig.</hi> 3. and 4. <note place="margin">Fig III. <hi>and</hi> IV.</note>

                  <hi>Caſcabel</hi> or <hi>Pummel</hi> ſerves to elevate and to direct the Cannon, and is leſſer but longer than the Trunnions.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Maniglions</hi> or <hi>Dolphins,</hi> are two great Corniſhes at the Extremities, which riſe higher

                  <hi>FIeld Peeces</hi> are generally reduced into the ſame Natures as Culvering, and are alſo diſtinguiſhed into three manners: 1. as to the <hi>Calibre,</hi> 2. as to the <hi>richneſs</hi> of the <hi>Metal,</hi> and 3. to the <hi>Length.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Calibre, they have theſe principal natures following.</p>
               <p>The Smeriglio or Rabinet carries a Ball of Iron from ½l to a Pound.</p>
               <p>The Falconet from 2, 3, to 4l.</p>
               <p>The Falcon or half Saker, from 5, 6, to 7l.</p>
               <p>The Saker or ¼ Culvering from 8, 10, to 12l.</p>
               <p>Others with the ſame Calibre as theſe, will carry as before.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Richneſs</hi> of the <hi>Metal,</hi> they have the ſame diſtinctions that the leſſer Culverings have, Common and Reinforced, although theſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105660:27"/>
Field-peeces are generally uſed Fortified, and the leſſer they are the more Fortified, to reſiſt better the Force of the Powder in their frequent Diſcharges.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thickneſs of Metal</hi> at the Touch-hole, Neck, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the ſame as the Culvering.</p>
               <p>As to the Length, they are diſtinguiſhed into Ordinary, Extraordinary, and Common.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ordinary</hi> ought to follow the ſame Rule as the Culverings of 32 Calibre, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are made longer, <hi>viz.</hi> from 32 to 34. The Saker, Rabinet, and Falconet, from 38, to 40, and 42, becauſe the ſmalneſs of their Bore, if made 32, they would not advance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Circumference of their Wheels, and therefore would do no effect.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> are thoſe that paſs the ſaid meaſure, and amongſt thoſe is remarkable the <hi>Paſſavolante</hi> or <hi>Zabratana,</hi> long from 48 to 50 Calibres, and moſt rich in Metal, and which carries a Ball from 5 to 6 pound, as the Falcon, but now are ſeldom caſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Baſtard,</hi> are thoſe who do not arrive to 32 Calibres; amongſt which are found the <hi>Moyenne</hi> or Minion, which is a Modern Peece Fortified, and carries a Ball of 8 or 10l ſhot (as the Saker,) but is long onely 26 Diameters, uſed in the Gallies, being ſo ſhort for the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the place.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Aſpide</hi> is an ancient Peece, and poor in Metal, and although it carries 8 or 10 pound ſhot, is no longer than 22 or 20 Calibres.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:105660:28"/>
The Muſquet <hi>di Givoco,</hi> is a ſmall Peece uſed onely by the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gunners, carrying one Pound Ball of Iron as the Smeriglio, long 28 Diameters or 30, thick at the Touch-hole Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters 1 1/16, at the Neck ⅝.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saltamartino,</hi> is a ſmall Peece uſed by the ſaid <hi>Venetians,</hi> long 15 Diameters, carries ſhot 4l of Iron as the Falconet, thick at the Touch-hole one Calibre, at the Neck ½. Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>THE <hi>Carriages</hi> are made of two Cheeks, four Tranſomes, or croſs beams of wood, with two Wheels, the Axle-tree, and their Iron work.</p>
               <p>The Sides or Cheeks of the Carriage are once and a half as long as the Chaſe, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 32 Calibres long, the Carriage will have in length 48 Calibres. <note place="margin">Fig. XI.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Some make onely the Carriage long one and ⅓ of the Chaſe or Cylinder, ſome one and ⅘, but the firſt manner is moſt approved for the following reaſons.</p>
               <p>As to the length of the Carriage, the longeſt ſuffers leſs in the ſplitting of the Peece, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyl enough, but is more ſubject to break in the midſt, yet more ſpares the Wheels, is more eaſie to turn about, and mannage the Peece, and in ſhort will laſt longer. But the ſhort Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age makes a longer Shot, doth not recoyl ſo much, and is eaſie to break it ſelf in the Breech, is good for ſmall Platforms, and upon which
<pb facs="tcp:105660:35"/>
one gives more Elevation to the Peece. <note place="margin">Fig. XII.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The thickneſs of the Cheeks or Sides of the Carriages is ordinarily one Diameter of the Muzzle.</p>
               <p>The largeneſs of the Head, to the very end of the Length, is equally from <hi>B</hi> 2 to <hi>B</hi> 3½.</p>
               <p>The bending in of the middle from <hi>B</hi> 3 to <hi>B</hi> 3½.</p>
               <p>The Tail from <hi>B</hi> 1 to <hi>B</hi> 2½.</p>
               <p>The end of the Breech <hi>B</hi> 3 about; if at any time it turns or overſets, which happens when the Carriage is forward on the Wheel.</p>
               <p>The Trunnion-holes are cut in the uppermoſt ſide, diſtant from the upper part <hi>B</hi> 3 compleat, and deep ⅔ <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The holes for the Axletree are cut in the lowermoſt part large <hi>B</hi> 1½ ſquare, diſtant from the Front <hi>B</hi> 4 compleat, or at the leaſt <hi>B</hi> 3½ about, and diſtant from the uppermoſt Side <hi>B</hi> 2½ compleat. Some therefore do not make the Hole for the Axletree altogether ſquare, but do make it blunt on the two inferiour An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, <note place="margin">Fig. XIII.

               <p>Some do not make a thorow hole for the Axletree, but only a Joynt made hollow into the lowermoſt part, when the Cheeks are not very large, and into the Joynt they place either all the thickneſs of the Axletree equally, or only ⅔ binding it with a band of Iron, which paſſeth <note place="margin">Fig. XV.

               <p>Firſt, that towards the Mouth of Front hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <note place="margin">Fig. XVII.</note> that the Peece doth not ſplit. Secondly, that of the Breech ſerves to hold up the Breech of the Culvering, and upon which it reſts. The third, that of the <hi>Manovelle,</hi> or little Peeces, ſerves to reſt upon, in elevating the body of the Peece. The fourth, that of the Train or Tail ſerves to place into the hole the Bolt or Faſtning-pin of the Fore-Carriage of the Peece.</p>
               <p>All the Tranſomes are thick <hi>B</hi> 1, and large <hi>B</hi> 1½ (from that of the Tail except when it is large <hi>B</hi> 2) all equally long, <hi>viz.</hi> as much as the Diameter of the Peece is near the Trunnions; and moreover <hi>B</hi> 1, becauſe the middle Tranſome is joyned into the Sides, and ſo their Sides are parallel.</p>
               <p>Some make the aboveſaid Tranſomes equal in length, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the Breech as long as the diameter of the Breech, and moreover one dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter for the Morteſs, and the other for the <hi>Manovelle</hi> or flat Tranſome a little greater, but that of the Tail longeſt, and the Fore-Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſhorteſt of all; and the Sides or Cheeks are not parallel, but follow the unequal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Peece.</p>
               <p>When the Sides of the Carriage are parallel and narrow as above, they ought to be ſomewhat taken down betwixt the Trunnions and the Tranſome of the Breech, to the end that the

               <p>Beſides, ſome take down always the ſaid Sides inwardly betwixt the flat Tranſomes and the Tail-Tranſome, raiſing ⅛ of a Diameter to render it more light and more eaſie to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged.</p>

               <p>That of the Breech goes behind from the Trunnion-holes, as much as the Peece is long, from the Trunnions to the Breech, to the end that the Breech may lye juſt upon it, and is to lye as low as is poſſible, to give a greater Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the Peece; it is to be therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from the edge or lower ſide of the Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <hi>B½.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of the (flat Tranſome) is higher, and diſtant from the Line of the middle Plate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Trunnion-holes <hi>B</hi> 1, and under the upper ſide of the Cheek <hi>B½.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of the Tail, is placed in the part turned up, or over the ſame Tail, diſtant from beneath and from above of the ſide of the Cheek <hi>B½</hi> and from the end <hi>B</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>The Tranſomes do not enter with its whole piece into the Cheek, but grows ſmall above and beneath ⅛ of its thickneſs.</p>
               <p>The Iron-work neceſſary for a Carriage, are

four Garniſhing Bolts, great Bolts or Pins of Iron, <hi>viz.</hi> one near every wooden Tranſome which paſſeth through the ſides of the Carriage, and may have Plate-rings and Fore-locks for to <note place="margin">Fig. XVIII.</note> keep the Carriage ſides firm.</p>
               <p>In the Tail Tranſome there is a hole made, which is armed with Plates of Iron, in which is placed the Iron Pin of the Fore-Carriage, for as much as it conducteth the Artillery upon the Carriage.</p>
               <p>Againſt the Trunnion-holes are placed a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bolſter and Capſquare in the lowermoſt part, which doth ſhoulder or uphold the Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the recoyling, to ſave the wood of the <note place="margin">Fig. XIX.</note> Cheeks with his Contraforts behind.</p>
               <p>Of late, under the Trunnions they put the Counter trunnions or Capſquares, which is a Plate of Iron, which doth incompaſs the Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion-holes, and part of the upper ſide; to the end that the thickneſs of the Peece may not ſpoil it: and where they place the Counter-trunnions, there is no need of a Bolſter, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in ſome Peeces one may uſe both ways; the Counter-trunnion is ſhewed by <hi>Fig.</hi> 20. <note place="margin">Fig. XX.</note>
               </p>
               <p>All the forepart is covered with a Plate of Iron, or Binding, under to the very joynting of the Axletree, and over to the Trunnion-holes faſtned with Iron nayls.</p>
               <p>Above the Trunnion-holes paſs the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquares, or joynted Plates, which ſtay the Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in the Trunnion-holes, and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquares are faſtned by four long Capſquare-pins,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105660:39"/>
which paſs through to the very bottom of the Cheek, and under are faſtned with its Fore-locks and Linch-pins.</p>
               <p>One of theſe Capſquare-pins paſſeth by the <note place="margin">Fig. XXI.</note> Axletree to the Binding-plate below, where it is faſtned with its Forelockeyes.</p>
               <p>The Tail is alſo all bound over and under with its Plates faſtned with Nailes, and laſtly are placed two great Rings to the ſides of the Cheeks, half behind the Wheels, to faſten Ropes for to mannage and conduct the Peece; and there are nayled two Hooks in the outward ſide of the Carriage, <hi>viz.</hi> one on each ſide near the forepart, to faſten other Cords to draw the Carriage forward on. <note place="margin">Fig. XXII.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Axletree of the Culvering is to be as long as to paſs through the Carriage, the fore-part of the Wheel with that overplus as is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to contain the faſtning or Linchpins at the Nave, which may be 15 Diameters about.</p>
               <p>The Thickneſs, for as much as the exterior largeneſs of the Carriage is 1 and ⅛ <hi>B,</hi> ſo more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over on each ſide of <hi>B</hi> 1½ ſquare, and moreover that eighth part they leave; to the end that the Wheels in its motion do not touch the ſides of the Carriage.</p>
               <p>The remainer is round about the Carriage, thick in Diameter <hi>B</hi> ½ or <hi>B</hi> 1¾, and in the end thick <hi>B</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>It is made of hard wood, as of Elme, Oak, or ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Its Length is throughly fortified with its
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105660:39"/>
bar of Iron which paſleth through, of two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches about, to the end that being ſtrong, if the Axletree ſhould break, it might alone be able to govern the weight of the Peece; it is let into the Axletree underneath.</p>

               <p>Thoſe for <hi>Mortars</hi> are made of three Sides or Cheeks, two for Sides, and the other for the the Bottom, all thick B ½ of the Mortar.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the Sides are large or high B 2½: the Trunnion which is all mortaiſed into the Cheek, occupies B ½, the thickneſs of the Cheek at the bottom B ½, the other B 1½, and takes up almoſt all the inferiour part of the Mortar, <hi>viz.</hi> part of the Chamber B ½, the thickneſs of the Breech B ½, leaving a void place betwixt the Breech and the Bottom, to put the Coins more eaſily under.</p>

This length of the Carriage is neceſſary, to the end that the Mortar being depreſs'd to 45 degrees, then giving great Shocks with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and that it might not leap out, to which end it is neceſſary that the length of the Carriage be at the leaſt double the height.</p>
               <p>Others nevertheleſs make them only long B 6, becauſe perchance they never make ſo low Shots.</p>

               <p>They bind together the Carriage with four thick Tranſomes acroſs, two below, and two aloft, which encompaſs all the thickneſs of the Sides and Wheels, with a Plate of Iron nailed to and acroſs in moſt places for ſtrength, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when the Sides are made of two pieces.</p>
               <p>The Trunnion-holes are covered within with Iron, and there alſo they put their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traforts.

They fired many ſhots from on both ſides the River, which forced <hi>Timmerman</hi> to retire as faſt as he could, after whom the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made many Shots, but all in vain. The Ship arriving at the Bridge, one would have thought that Heaven &amp; Earth had finiſhed their courſe. When the Powder took fire, it gave ſo great a blow under water, that the water lept on the other ſide of the bank, filled the Fort on <hi>Callo</hi> ſide, and laid all the fields round about under water; all the Fire and Matches were extinguiſhed, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the ſaid Fort thrown down, and the Cannon loſt. One might have ſeen great heavy Stones fly in the Air, and driven half a League into the Countrey. It blew up ſix Ships of the Bridge, of which three were ſo
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105660:46"/>
torn, that one could not ſo much as find a piece, the others caſt and thrown with their bottom upwards, ſo that the Bridge was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely broke. There were alſo more than 800 people blown up, and ſome perſons of Quality, as the Marquiſs of <hi>Reesbork,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Cavalry; my Lord <hi>Billy,</hi> formerly Governour of <hi>Freeze,</hi> my Lord <hi>Torſy,</hi> and twenty three Captains, and ſome of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Court, the Prince himſelf being in great danger; for as <hi>Metteren</hi> relates, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made all their Endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the fire by caſting in of water, which they did all round about, (not dreaming of the Powder, and that the Matches were then ready to fire) begun to mock at its vain Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, thinking that all the outward fire was the product of this Engine. The <hi>Duke</hi> was ſo long time a looking on, that all the fire was quenched, but being already retired at ſome diſtance, the Blow was given with ſuch fury, that the Duke, and the Marquiſs of <hi>Guaſto,</hi> and others that accompanied them, were all blown down, and one could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leaſt trace of Footing of the Fort <hi>Awſterwell.</hi> But the ſaid <hi>Timmerman</hi> willing that they ſhould purſue the Victory, ſignified to the Lords, that there was made a ſufficient hole or opening in the Bridge; but ſome ſeeing from afar the <hi>Spaniards</hi> turning and returning with Torches and Lanthorns upon the Bridge, could not believe that there
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105660:46"/>
was a ſufficient overture made, or that it had done any great effect, and therefore did not at all follow that Advantage. In the mean time the Duke repaired it with all imaginable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, much admiring that the <hi>Antwerpers</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> had not taken hold of that occaſion, and given an Aſſault. For the breach was ſo great, that the City might have been eaſily ſupplied with neceſſary Proviſions: and from this, one may obſerve, how one ought to follow a Victory undertaken, and how one ought to conduct ſuch Works with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving of them in ſuch time, as the deſign is ready to take effect. Moreover the Figure <hi>(A)</hi> ſhews how the Ship was fitted a Stern, with its Maſons work, and the Cask; and how the Trains and Fuſes came within. Alſo the Matches were dipped in Oyl of Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to give better fire together, for that gives a blow as ſwift as Lightning. Above the Stones were Fagots with Straw, and great Trunks of green wood faſtned with chains of Iron together, all about the Ship, as the letter <hi>(B)</hi> doth ſhew, which could not but frighten the Beholders.</q>

               <p>The <hi>old</hi> and <hi>ſmall</hi> require Powder of 4, 1, and 1, as much as its proper Shot weighs of Iron: ſo that if there be 30l weight of Ball, it will have 30l of four, one, and one: or if one gives of five, one, and one, ⅘ of the weight of its proper Shot of Iron, ſo that if the Shot weighs 30l, the Powder of five, one, and one ſhall be 24l.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Common modern</hi> and <hi>fortified</hi> Peeces ſhoot Powder of five, one, and one, as much as the juſt weight of the Shot; ſo that if that weigh 30l, it alſo requires 30l of Powder of five, one, and one. Or if you would load it with Powder of ſix, one, and one, you may not give it above ¾ of the weight, <hi>viz.</hi> 22l ½. But theſe may very well ſupport a juſt and equal
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:105660:47"/>
proportion of Powder to the weight of its Ball.</p>
               <p>To put the Powder into the concavity of the Peece, they uſe either a Ladle, or a Paper-Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Ladle</hi> is an Inſtrument of Braſs, made as a gutter'd Pipe, and fixed at the end of a Staff; the form of it is ſuch, that for the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it may ſerve to load it at two or three times.</p>
               <p>If the Culvering is to be charged at two times, the weight of the Shot muſt not exceed 30 or 35l; but the ſaid Culvering at three times may carry 35 more of theſe Pounds.</p>
               <p>To load the Common Modern and Fortified Peeces at two times with Powder of five, one, and one, they make the Ladle with theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions: the part which is nailed upon the frame of the Handle, be long three Diameters of the Shot, (I do not ſay, Muzzle or Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Bore) and long one, that part which receives the Powder be long Shots 4, and large in the bottom Shots 2 leſs 2/6, and at the top Shots 2 leſs ⅓, that the point be round, making the Center one Shot, or at the leaſt ⅞. At the Ears they make inwardly two quarters of the Circle for ſtrength, and at the Point they cut away from ſome ⅙ of the Diameter, to the end that the Ladle may better touch the bottom of the Chaſe.</p>
               <p>Others make large the under part for the Powder, ⅗ of the largeneſs for the Model or Frame, leaving each Ear large ⅕.</p>

To charge the ſame Culverings, Modern and Fortified, at three times with Powder of five, one, and one, the Ladle is made long Shots 2⅔, the reſt as the others.</p>
               <p>To load the Ancient ſmall Peeces with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of five, one, and one, (for that of four, one, and one is now out of uſe,) the ſaid Ladle ſhall be ſhortned ⅕ about, (the two ſaid Powders be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not much different in maſs or weight,) or if with the Ladle you ſhall uſe that of five, one, and one, but ſmooth, not heaped up.</p>
               <p>To load the Common Modern Peeces with Powder of ſix, one, and one, the Ladle ſhall be ¼ part above ſhorter than that of five, one, and one; or if you will work by the ſame, but ſmooth, not filled top-full.</p>
               <p>To load the Modern Fortified with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſix, one, and one, or if it ſhall hold the common quantity, or if you ſhall yet uſe the ſame top-full, give it the full weight of the Ball.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, to load the Old ſmall Peeces with Powder of ſix, one, and one, the Ladle ſhall be uſed, ſhortned ⅖ or ⅓ of its accuſtomed meaſure.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Rammer</hi> is a piece of wood, round and thick one Sh. and long one Sh. ½ about, having a Staff or Handle like the Ladle, and ſerves to preſs and ramm home the Powder into the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, Wadd, and Shot, and is made of hard Wood, and is ſometimes plated about with a <note place="margin">Fig. XXXV.</note> Plate of Copper near the head for ſtrengths ſake.

               <q>ABout the latter end of the Summer 1584, the moſt worthy Captain and General, <hi>Alexander</hi> Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> with leſs than 20000 Soldiers beſieged <hi>Antwerp, Ghent, Tendermond, Bruxels,</hi> and <hi>Mecklin,</hi> all at once, and within the year took them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Cities beſides. <hi>Antwerp,</hi> a great City, wherein were 100000 Souls, beſides Seamen and Watermen, and whereto belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged above 1000 goodly Veſſels, and was then the greateſt City of Trade in the world, put the Prince moſt to it, having the River <hi>Scheld</hi> open, and thereby ſupplied with all Proviſions and Ammunition from <hi>Zealan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Holland.</hi> That after ſome time he found, that unleſs he could bridle the River by a Bridge, it was not poſſible for him with ſo few Forces to take the Town. Therefore betwixt <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Lillo,</hi> a little more than midway, over againſt <hi>Callo,</hi> he reſolved to build a Bridge, and to that end built two Quadrangular Forts, that on <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide called St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and that on <hi>Brabant</hi> ſide St. <hi>Philip;</hi> and cloſe to the water ſide at both ends, where he intended the Bridge ſhould end, he built two ſtrong Batteries or Caſtles, 50 Foot ſquare, upon long and big Timbers, and furniſhed them both with very great Guns, on purpoſe to ſtop the Veſſels, and ſecure the Carpenters and Workmen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bridge, and to be a Magazine for Ammunition. And to the end he might bring Timber, Ships, and other Materials for this great work, (after the Delivery of <hi>Ghent)</hi> he cut a Navigable River fourteen Miles long, which fell into the <hi>Scheld</hi> near <hi>Callo,</hi> by which he was ſupplied with Victuals and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proviſions, as well as Materials for the Bridge abundantly. The River at this place was about 2400 Feet over betwixt the two Caſtles, and towards <hi>Flanders</hi> ſide for 200 Feet, and on <hi>Brabant</hi> ſide for 900 the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was not ſo deep, but that long Timbers might be fixt into the bottom of the River, it being ſandy and ſound; therefore at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of eleven Feet, and thirteen alternately,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105660:56"/>
there were with Bell Beetles at each diſtance three long Rafters driven into the bottom of the River, five Foot aſunder, and formed like a Truſſel or Peer, [as our Bridges at <hi>Stanes,</hi> and like to <hi>Downham</hi> and <hi>Stow</hi> Bridges over the <hi>Oaſe</hi> in <hi>Norfolk]</hi> and bound with croſs beams and Timbers. Theſe Rafters or great Timbers, when driven ſufficiently down, were cut equally high, and mortaiſed into a ſtrong Timber, to bear the Liggers of the Bridge. Of theſe Peers or Truſſels there were 18 to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Flanders,</hi> and 74 towards <hi>Brabant,</hi> all ſtrongly cover'd with Plank 12 Foot wide, and on each ſide a Breſt-work five Foot high Musket proof, and eight Soldiers might well march a breſt on the top. Before each Peer or Truſſel there were many ſtrong Piles driven triangular ways, for the keeping Veſſels from running upon the Bridge, and at 20 Foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance on either ſide great Piles driven to that end. Now for the Remainer of the River, that lay betwixt theſe two ends, which was neer upon 1300 Feet, and which was ſo deep that no Piles could reach the bottom, there were thirty two Ships or Veſſels brought down <hi>Alexander</hi>'s new River, of 66 Feet long and 12 Feet wide (called with us <hi>Bylanders)</hi> and placed with Ankers and Iron Chains, in a four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold row, 22 Foot aſunder, ſo as they might riſe and fall with the Tides, which was about 12 Foot,) and the ſpace betwixt each Ship was laid over with five long Beams, plank'd,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105660:56"/>
and had Breaſt-works, and was as wide as the Bridges before nam'd were. On every Ship ſtood thirty Soldiers, and four Seamen, with two great Guns, one at each end of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. There were for the Defence of this Bridge near 100 great Guns ready planted into the two great Caſtles and Veſſels, beſides the great Guns in the Forts St. <hi>Mary</hi> and St. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> This Bridge being thus finiſhed, it yet was thought fit, before and behind the Ships or Veſſels <hi>(viz.</hi> for 1300 Feet) to arme the ſame with eleven Barricadoes, (like half Moons before Bridges or Gates.) Each Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado was made of three great Lighters, made faſt to one another, and formed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of a Triangle, with three Ankers and Chains, to ſuffer them to riſe and fall with the Tides: theſe were covered over with Maſts and great Timbers, and ſtood about 100 Feet one from another, and were placed ſome 150 Feet from the Bridge both wayes. From each of theſe Barricadoes came out 40 long Piles ſharpned at the ends, and armed with Iron, to terrifie the Veſſels, leſt by running upon them, they ſhould be deſtroyed. The Lighters were fill'd with empty Cask, Iron bound, leſt they ſhould ſink by Accident. Laſtly, the Prince armed fourty Veſſels, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on each ſide, for the defence of this Bridge, and ſo after ſeven Months hard working, this great Work was finiſhed, and gave paſſage to all, and the day was ſolemniz'd with great
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105660:57"/>
Joy. The <hi>Antwerpians</hi> were more remiſs in hindering the Progreſs of the making the Bridge, becauſe they thought it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſaid, <hi>that the</hi> Scheld <hi>would no more endure any to bridle it, then the Free</hi> Belgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>would indure the</hi> Spaniard'<hi>s Yoke:</hi> but when they ſaw the Work proceed on, and be almoſt finiſhed: They ſent a Spy out of <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>werp</hi> to view it, and bring them an account of the Prince's Actions, who was diſcovered and brought to the Prince; but contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation was ſent to ſee all the Forts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Bridge, and bid by the Prince to go and tell them that ſent him, what he had ſeen; and to aſſure them, that he ſhould not depart from that Bridge, before he ſhould find either a Tombe under it for his Grave, or to paſs over it into the City. The firſt thing that the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> did, was by help of Seamen in the Night to cut the Cables of the Floats or Barricadoes under water, which to ſome they did, which preſently the Prince altered to Iron Chains; and moſt of this time was ſpent by the <hi>Antwerpian</hi> Ingeneers, to whom was ſent an <hi>Italian</hi> by Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> called <hi>Frederick Jembelly,</hi> one that had extraordinary skill in Fire-works, and was famous for the ſame, neglected by the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> and therefore willing to do them all the miſchief he could. Theſe Ingeneers prepared many Fireſhips for the deſtruction of the Bridge, many whereof came to little effect.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105660:57"/>
There were two made, called the <hi>Hope,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> of about 100 Tun apiece: there were in each Vaults made of Stone and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, fill'd with 200 barrels of Powder each, and above great quantities of Grave Stones, Mill-ſtones, and other great Stones form'd up into an Angle, and the Concavity at the top was fill'd with balls of Iron, Marble, Chains of Iron, old Ankers, Plow-Coulters, and all that theſe Infernal Workmen could deviſe to deſtroy men withall, [a more perfect deſcription whereof you had at the end of the third Part.] The Prince hearing of all theſe Preparations, was not idle to ſtrengthen his Guards, and make ready for their coming, which was on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> at night 1585, when behold firſt three Veſſels appeared from the Town all on fire, afterwards other three, and ſo three after three, 'till fifteen Veſſels came down, and burnt ſo as if all thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels had been one fire. Had not the Spectators been full of Care and Fear, certainly a more pleaſant Spectacle could not be ſeen; all the Bridge, Caſtles, Forts, and ſides of the River were full of the Prince's people with their Colours, moſt with Torches in their hands, and all the Veſſels with Fire-works burning, ſo that it was light as day. Thus came theſe Veſſels, directed by Seamen and Pilots, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in 2000 Paces of the Bridge, down the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; when as thoſe Seamen and Pilots firing their Trains and Matches, leapt into their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105660:58"/>
Boats, and went back to obſerve what ſucceſs their Engines would have. But the Veſſels kept not their Channels as was expected, but ſome went one way, ſome another; four ſunk in the midſt, ſome run a ground on <hi>Callo</hi> ſide, and ſome were boldly boarded by the Prince's Souldiers, the Matches put out, and Veſſels taken. This made all the Beholders rejoyce, and ſcoff at theſe Engines, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the greateſt Veſſel, that had all thoſe dreadful Fires and Stones, and was fitted pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely for deſtruction, came clear off all the Barricadoes and Floats, and fell cloſe to the Bridge, which drew the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> thither with the moſt of his principal Officers, who command the Seamen and Soldiers to put out and quench the Fires, being ignorant of the Infernal works within, and that all this time the Fuſees were burning in order to the great Blaſt that followed. There was a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Enſigne, whether by the knowledge he had of <hi>Jambelly,</hi> or by Divine Inſtinct, that upon his knees deſired the Prince to get far from that Veſſel; the Prince was angry with him, but when the Enſign with more courage begun to preſs him, He, with <hi>Guaſto</hi> and <hi>Cajetanus,</hi> two great Lords, departed toward St. <hi>Maries</hi> Fort, leaving the Lords <hi>Billy</hi> and <hi>Rubais</hi> in the Caſtle or wooden Battery at the end of the Bridge, with many other Commanders; but juſt as the Prince with theſe Lords were entring into St. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's,</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:105660:58"/>
the Fuſees had come to the Powder, and this deadly Veſſel broke, and gave ſo great a Crack, that one ſhould have thought the Heavens had come down, and the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Earth had been ſhaken; and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad thoſe dreadful Stones, Chains, Shot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there followed a lamentable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſuch as never had been heard of before. For though the Prince had been gone a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Mile from the Bridge, yet not onely Himſelf, but the Marquiſs, and all thoſe by him, were violently blown to the ground, and ſome taken up for dead. That Caſtle or Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery next St. <hi>Marys,</hi> at the Bridge-end, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the aforeſaid Lords, and many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, Soldiers, many great Guns and Arms were all driven as leaves before the Wind, and ſunk down, without ſaving any Man's life, or leaving any ſign of ſuch a place. The <hi>Scheld</hi> ſhewed its bottom, and his Waters aroſe above the banks, and fill'd the Countrey a Foot deeper of Water than before; the Earth did ſhake for 9000 Paces off; the great Grave and Mill-ſtones were ſome of them found a 1000 Paces from the Bridge buried deep in the ground; many were kill'd who were near the Fire, many by the Water, and divers by the evil ſtink that was made there. Some were blown many Paces off into the River, and yet ſaved alive. The number of thoſe that were ſlain amounted to near 1000, and neer as many hurt and wounded.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105660:59"/>
This was a lamentable Night, nothing but Groans and Mourning to be heard; all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented for the Prince, thinking he had been in the wooden Fort that was deſtroyed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he ever ſo near Death, being taken up ſore bruiſed, &amp; not able to ſpeak, L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Guaſto</hi> having hold of his Legs, and <hi>Cajetane</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a Brick in the Head. But a little after the Prince recovered, and returned to the Bridge, where he found the Caſtle or Battery quite gone, ſix of his Ships tore to pieces, much of the Bridge torn and ſhaken, many of his faithful Captains and Soldiers kill'd, and his Deareſt Friends, Lords <hi>Billy</hi> and <hi>Rubais</hi> blown away. Yet for all this, calling together the Remainder of his Men, and many Commanders coming with their men from many parts to him, by the reaſon of the noiſe of the Blow, he ſo incouraged them, that before Light Day, by gathering together the Maſts, Raſters, and Veſſels, and other Materials, he had cloſed up the Breach, ſo that the Soldiers and Footmen might walk over, and which amazed the <hi>Antwerpians</hi> above the Bridge, and the <hi>Zelanders</hi> below, that they did not believe the Bridge was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, which was only the cauſe the Town was not relieved, there lying 200 Sayl at <hi>Lyllo</hi> ready to come to the City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>To <hi>Quadrate</hi> a Peece mounted, is to ſee if it is directly placed, and equally poiſed: which diligence is uſed in the Carriage, in regard of the Wheels and Axletree.

The <hi>Shooting</hi> or Shots in Artillery are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore three. The firſt called <hi>Point Blank,</hi> is that ſpace that the Ball flies in a line ſenſibly right, without any inclination.</p>
               <p>The ſecond called the <hi>Mean,</hi> which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all that ſpace the Shot flies in a curved line.</p>
               <p>The third, called the <hi>Dead Shot,</hi> which is the fall of the Ball by a ſenſible right line, towards the Center of the World, after that the violence is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The Gunners do take notice of theſe three parts of a Range, for three ſeveral ends.</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſhots of <hi>Point Black</hi> ſerve to batter the Rampires and Walls of Forts and Caſtles.</p>
               <p>The middle of the Range or <hi>Mean,</hi> to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt a far off the Troups in the Campaigne, and in their Quarters, and to ruine the Houſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Cities, Caſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Dead Shots</hi> ſerve for Mortars or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bucchoes, and Bombes, and other Artificial Fires, to be ſhot upon the Enemy, eſpecially when they cannot be otherways offended, nor ſeen, being covered behind with Ramparts, Trenches, Hills, and other Eminencies.</p>
               <p>A ſhot <hi>Point Blank,</hi> which is the moſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and moſt important, is diſtinguiſhed into two manners, <hi>viz.</hi> in regard of the Horizon, and in regard of the Object which it ſtrikes.</p>
               <p>As to the Horizon they are of three ſorts, firſt <hi>Level,</hi> ſecondly from <hi>Low to High,</hi> thirdly from <hi>High to Low,</hi> called <hi>under Metal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:105660:64"/>
The Horizontal, and by the Level of the Chaſe, is the moſt ſecure of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>That from <hi>low to high</hi> proves fallacious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the recoyling which the Peece makes, the Shot flies higher than the Mark.</p>
               <p>And that from under, or from <hi>high to low,</hi> is moſt fallacious, becauſe the Shot, beſides other notable effects, comes more low by the recoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Peece. Therefore an Experienced Gunner muſt remedy theſe faults, by taking the due advantages in ſhooting.</p>
               <p>As to the Object, a ſhot <hi>Point Blank,</hi> is made either at right Angles againſt the Superficies of the Object, or at oblique Angles.</p>
               <p>At right Angles it ſtrikes more furiouſly than at oblique Angles, therefore it is uſed againſt ſtrong Walls to batter them, and are uſed to make Batteries <hi>Cameretta,</hi> or Tire by Tire; which is done by diſcharging all the Peeces of Battery againſt the ſelf ſame Mark, and in the ſame inſtant, Holding it for a Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, <hi>that ten Cannons diſcharged together, do far more Execution than dicharged one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At oblique Angles, they ſtrike either Croſs-ways, or rebounding like a Tennis-ball.</p>
               <p>If they ſtrike croſs-ways, with two Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, one upon each ſide of the Object, it ruins more ſpeedily the Defence either of Earth or Wall.</p>

                  </gap>y, ſo that by the rebound the Shot may leap into the Flank, holding for a Maxime in this operation, <hi>that the Angles of Incidence and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection are equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>middle</hi> Ranges are divers, according to the divers Elevations of the Artillery.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elevations</hi> are regulated by the Gunners Square, which is an Inſtrument of Braſs, made of two right Lines, one longer than the other, both which makes a right Angle, from which as from the Centre is deſcribed an Arch divided into 90 degrees, or into 12 equal parts called <hi>Points;</hi> and moreover the ſaid Arch exceedeth a Quadrant by 45 degrees or 6 Points, and this Exceſs ſerves for ſhooting below the Horizon as the Quadrant doth for above; and from the Centre hangs a Thread with a Plummer, whoſe Leg being placed in the Chaſe, cutting the Arch, doth ſhew the degrees of Elevation, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. See the <hi>Fig.</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>mean</hi> ſhooting one doth obſerve, that always goes fartheſt from the Horizon which hath ſome Elevation, and eſpecially that of moſt points of Elevation, even to 6 points or 45 degrees, which is ſaid to be the greateſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which one never exceeds in long Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</p>
               <p>The <hi>dead</hi> Shot is that which is commonly worked with the Trabucchi or Mortars, and is
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:105660:65"/>
done by giving Elevation from the points 6 or 45 degrees to the points 12 or 90 degrees, which are meaſured by the aboveſaid Square; or with a particular Inſtrument like a Level, putting a Staff a croſs the mouth of the Mortar, and upon that the Quadrant.</p>
               <p>In ſhooting in theſe is obſerved, that at the ſixth Point is the fartheſt off, and that at the ſeventh Point comes the neareſt; and that at the eighth nearer, and ſo nearer and nearer to the twelfth Point, in which the Ball falls, in the ſame place from which it departed.</p>

               <p>FOraſmuch as the Randoms or Ranges in a Peece of Point blank, and of the greateſt Elevation, is difficult to be known without the Experience of every Point; yet in the War, for the length of every Cannon's ſhot, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally compute the length of three Muſquet ſhot, which will be from 400, to 450 <hi>Venetian</hi> Geometrical Paces. <note n="a">A Geometrical Pace is 5 Foot, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the Venetian Foot and Ours, is as 1000 to 1153.

                  <p>To make the Bombes break in the Fall, the skill is in the Fuſee fill'd with mixture of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is to be ſuch, that although the Bombe fall in the water, it ought to break.</p>

Moreover take a ſmall Barrel or Cane of Iron, of equal Bore to that of the Fuſe, but ſomething longer, with many little Holes all along its length, and filling it in the ſame manner as the Fuſe. Then the Bombe being fitted in the Mortar, you give fire in the ſame time to the Fuſe in the Mortar and the Iron Barrel, letting the Barrel burn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that you ſee the Bombe break, in which moment you obſerve the Barrel, and to what hole the Fire burns down, which will give an aſſured mark of the time that the Fuſe ought to have.</p>
                  <p>If the Bombe in the very Fall ſhall break, the ſame quantity of Compoſition ſhall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the Fuſe; but if it break before the Fall, you muſt abate the heat, by adding a ſmall mixture of Charcoal-duſt incorporated in the ſame compoſition: and if after its Fall it ſhall delay its effect, then you ſhall joyn with its mixture a little fine Powder-duſt. And ſo you may by experience with this Barrel obſerve unto what marke or hole it burns; ſo that with ſuch Fuſes the Bombe ſhall juſtly break in

                  <p>Being neceſſitated to uſe an Okam Wadd in lieu of a Tampeon, as was firſt uſed, ſo the Load of the Mortar ſhall be augmented to ſuch a proportion, that the Bombe may carry to the ſame place, as it did when it was loaded and ſtopt with a Tampeon, or if it ſhall require an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Elevation.</p>

                  <p>To ſee the different Randoms cauſed by the different Wadds of Okam and Wood, I have made the Experiment in Mortars and Bombes of 100l weight in a plain field, which loaded equally and weighing each 55l, and the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber loaded with fine Powder of five, one, &amp; one, 20 <hi>onz.</hi> and the Chamber ſtopped with a Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peon of Wood, and with the Elevation of the Mortar to 45 degrees. I ſay to the point of the Quadrant 6, the Bombe fell diſtant 600 Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Paces. <note n="a" place="margin">691 Engliſh Paces.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then with the ſame Mortar, Load, Bombe, and Elevation, but with an Okam Wadd in ſtead of a Tampeon, the Bombe fell onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant 480 <note n="b" place="margin">553 Englſh Paces.</note> Geometrical Paces.</p>
                  <p>For theſe two different, and all other Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms the aforeſaid Table will ſerve; in which one may ſee the Proportion each Shot ſhall make, with the Elevation of degree to degree, interpoſing the proportional Numbers, with which and with the help of the Golden Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or <hi>Rule of Three,</hi> one may find what ſhall be the Random made in this or any other Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, at any Elevation, at 45 degrees, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree being firſt known.</p>

                     <head>Example I.</head>
                     <p>Let it be propounded, that a Mortar of 300 with a Tampeon of Wood, and Elevation of 45 degrees, or Points of the Quadrnt 6, carry
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:105660:68"/>
a Ball 800 Paces; if one would know with the ſame Charge how many Paces it will ſhoot at the Elevation of 54 degrees.</p>
                     <p>See then, that at the ſaid 54 degrees of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble correſponds the proportional Numb. 9511, and at the aboveſaid Elevation of 458, or points of the Quadrant 6, correſponds the proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Number 10000, which by the Golden Rule is ſo worked.</p>
                     <p>If 10000 gives me 800, ſo 9511 gives me the number of Paces which is required.</p>
                     <p>Thus I Multiply 9511 by 800, and Divide the Product by 10000, the Quotient will be 760, which are the Paces that the Mortar will ſhoot the Ball, with the Elevation of 54 degrees.</p>

                     <p>Let it be granted or ſuppoſed, that a Mortar of 300, at the Elevation of 54 degrees, ſhoots the Bombe 760 Paces; if one ſhould deſire to know what Elevation one ought to give to the ſame to ſhoot the Bombe 550 Paces, you muſt work by the Golden Rule in this manner.</p>
                     <p>As 760 Paces give the Number proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal 9510, ſo 550 Paces will give its proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Number.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore if you multiply the ſecond 9510 by the third 550, and dividing the Product by the firſt 760, the Quotient will be 6882, which Number, if you ſeek it amongſt the proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Numbers in the Tables, and not finding it juſt, if you take its neareſt, it ſhall be the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 6947, to which correſponds the degrees 68,

which ſhall be the Elevation, and which ought to be given to the Mortar of 300, to fall in the diſtance of 550 Paces, with the ſame Charge of the firſt, and that is as much as I eſteem ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for every Soldier as well as for a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who intends to be ſerviceable for his Prince and Countrey.</p>

               <p>This Inſtrument was firſt invented by a Thief, or Robber, being firſt made of Wood, and bound about with Iron, not onely againſt Houſes, but alſo to enter into Towns; which being obſerved to work admirable effects, it was afterwards put into Exeeution by Princes againſt the Cities of their Enemies: and to give them greater Force, they made theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrs of Iron, but afterwards finding them too brittle, they were made of Braſs, as they are now in uſe.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of which the Petard is made of, is an Union or commixture of Copper, <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tin, and Latten well refined. Some do va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry both in proportion, and alſo in the Metal, ſince that ſome would have them all of beaten

Copper, without any other mixture: others to every 50l of Braſs, 5l of Tin, and two of Latten. Others to every 10l of Braſs one of Latten.</p>
               <p>The Copper therefore is ſoft, the Tin gives it hardneſs, but if it be overmuch it makes it brittle; they would have the Latten mixed with the Copper and Tin together.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Madrillo</hi> is a ſtrong beam of wood of Elm or Oak, ſhod with Iron, which is placed before the Mouth of the Petarr, and faſtned to the Gate which you would break, to make grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine. For every Petarr the Madrill is long B 3 of its Petard, meaſured and comprehending the Edge, and large 2 of the B.</p>

                  <p>Therefore if it have a Ditch, it muſt be hung on with a ſmall Bridge; but if it is without Ditch, or ſtrengthned with Iron, it may be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a Plank; or if armed with a Fork or Reſt, and in other particular manners, which would be too long further to explain.</p>

               <head>Of Canoneers neceſſary for the ſecurity of a Ship.</head>
               <p>BEfore <hi>Cannon</hi> was invented, they did uſe both at Sea and Land certain Machines which did throw Fire, Arrows, Stones, and Beams of Wood, which did as much dammage to the Enemy as our Cannon, but were not ſo eaſie to be governed. We do not know what were thoſe Engines that <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> did uſe for the Defence of <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> onely we are certain, that he had thoſe which did caſt great Stones a vaſt diſtance, and as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> obſerves, with Smoak, and a great Noiſe, and that he had Burning-glaſſes which did burn at indeterminated diſtances.</p>
               <p>In the Advice, which in times paſt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Leon</hi> gave to his Admirals and Sea-Captains, in ſeveral places he makes mention of Engines which did vomit fire and flames in cloſe fights, and Sea Combats. And the <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory doth relate, that <hi>Mithridates</hi> beſieging <hi>Rhodes</hi> by Sea, after he had made a breach did
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105660:71"/>
great dammage to the Beſieged by the means of a Sambuque or warlick Inſtrument of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious greatneſs, which being placed upon two Gallies, caſt forth at one blow great number of Arrows, Stones, and Beliers, being ſquare pieces of Timber pointed with Iron at both ends. All theſe Engines being very incommodious and troubleſome, by reaſon of their bigneſs, and requiring over great a Train: at preſent they uſe nothing but Cannon, therefore I ſhall only ſpeak here of this Machine, and only as much as ſhall be neceſſary for its well mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Sea, or perhaps ſometimes to make a Deſcent or Landing; judging it neceſſary not to omit this Treatiſe, ſince at preſent all the defence of a Veſſel depends on the Cannon, and that in the time of fight there are more Shots made in one day at Sea, than in a Seige at land in two months.</p>
               <p>The arming of a Gally is much different from that of a Ship or round Veſſel, as alſo the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Cannon at Sea differs from that at Land; at Sea the Ordnance are mounted upon ſmall Carriages, and upon four and ſometimes two low Wheels, without any Iron work. Each Gally carries ordinarily nine Peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in its Prow or Chaſe, of which the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and that which delivers his Shot juſt over the very Stem, and lies juſt in the middle, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Corſiere,</hi> or <hi>Cannon of Courſe,</hi> or <hi>Chaſe Cannon,</hi> which in time of fight doth the moſt effectual Service, it carries generally a Shot of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:105660:72"/>
33l or 34l weight, and are generally very long Peeces; it recoils all along the middle of the Gally to the Maſt, where they place ſome ſoft ſubſtance to hinder its farther recoyl, that it might not endammage the Maſt. Next to this <hi>Corſiere</hi> are placed two <hi>Minions</hi> on each ſide, which carries a 5 or 6 pound Ball; and next to theſe are the <hi>Petrieroes,</hi> which are loaded with Stone-ſhot to ſhoot neer at hand. Thirdly, there are ſome ſmall Peeces, which are open at the breech, and called <hi>Petrieroes a Braga,</hi> and are charged with a moveable Chamber loaded with baſe and bar-ſhot, to murder near at hand. And the furtheſt from the Corſiere or Chaſe-Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non are the <hi>Harquebuſs a croc,</hi> which are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſmall Croſs-bar ſhot, to cut Sails and Rigging. All theſe ſmall Peeces are mounted on ſtrong pins of Irons having Rings, in which are placed the Trunnions with a Socket, ſo that they are eaſily turned to any quarter.</p>
               <p>In Ships or round Veſſels are ſometimes mounted 200 Peeces of Ordnance, although at preſent, experience ſhews that 100 are ſufficient for the greateſt Ships, Carraques or Gallions, it being impoſſible to have a greater number, giving a juſt diſtance betwixt each Cannon, that there may be room for men to ply the Guns, and that the fire of one may not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to give fire to the other.</p>
               <p>All the Guns are mounted upon Wheels and Carriages; moreover the Petrieroes, which are planted in the Forecaſtle and Quarter to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:105660:72"/>
defend the Prow and Stern, are mounted upon ſtrong Pins of Iron without any Reverſe; the greateſt Peeces of Battery are planted the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, juſt above the ſurface of the water, the ſmalleſt in the Waſt and Steerage, and with the Petrieroes in Quarter-deck and Forecaſtle. Upon the Sea, to load great Ordnance they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver load with a Ladle, but make uſe of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, as well for Expedition as Security in not firing the Powder, which in time of fight is in a continual motion.</p>

               <head>The Qualifications of him who takes the charge of the Cannon of a Ship.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Gunner,</hi> whom they call in the <hi>Straights Captain, Maſter-Canoneer,</hi> and in <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> and in other places <hi>Conneſtable,</hi> is one of the principal Officers in the Ship; it is he alone with the Captain who can command the Gunners. He ought to be a man of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, experience, and vigilant, who knows the goodneſs of a Peece of Ordnance, the force of Powder, and who alſo knows to mount a Peece of Ordnance upon its Carriage, and to furniſh it with Bolts, Plates, Hooks, Capſquares, Axle-trees, and Trucks, and that may not reverſe too much; to order well its Cordage as Breeching and Tackling; to plant the Cannon to purpoſe in the middle of its Port; to know how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clow it, make ready his Cartridges, and to have
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:105660:73"/>
them ready to paſs from hand to hand through the Hatches, and to employ his moſt careful men in that affair; that he have care of all, that he be ready every where to aſſiſt where neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall be; and take care that all be made to purpoſe.</p>
               <p>He and his Companions ought with their dark Lanthornes continually to ſee if the Guns play, and if the Rings in Ships do not ſhake.</p>
               <p>If there be neceſſity of more Cordage, and to ſee that the Beds and Coins be firm and in good order; when the Ship comes to Anker, he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth Cordage, and takes care that all his Companions take their turn and quarters, that continually every evening they renew their priming Powder, and all are obliged to viſit their Cannon Powder every eight dayes, to ſee if it hath not receiv'd wet, although they be well ſtopped a top with Cork and Tallow; to ſee that the Powder-room be kept neat and clean, and the Cartridges ranged in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, each nature or Calibre by it ſelf, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked above in great Letters the weight of the Powder and nature of the Peece to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, and to put the ſame mark over the Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole of the Peece; that the Linſtocks be ready, and furniſhed with Match, and to have alwaies one lighted, and where the Cannoneer makes his Quarter to have two one above another be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; that his Granadoes and Firepots be in readineſs, and 3 or 400 Cartridges ready fill'd, Extrees and Trucks, to turn often over the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:105660:73"/>
Powder-barrels, that the Powder do not <hi>ſpoil; to have a care of Rings and of the Ports, that they have their Pins and ſmall Rings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although every man ought to be a man well approved and experienced in all theſe things, before he can be truſted with the charge of a Veſſel, which depends in time of fight more upon him than any other; nevertheleſs thoſe whoaſpire to the charge of a Maſter Cannoneer, ought to have the Theorick and Practick part joyned together, as well to practiſe themſelves, as to inſtruct and correct the faults of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergunners, and moreover to teach them all ſorts of Fireworks, which may ſerve as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall require. The Sub-gunners and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſſes ought to be ſo many, that each may have no more than two Guns to his charge. And for as much as one finds at Sea very few perſons who underſtand all that I intend to ſpeak of, and thoſe who underſtand very often cannot inform, or elſe will not take the pains to inſtruct their Companions, and the Matroſſe, who ſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, therefore I will prolong this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapter, of that which I have in general touched here.</p>
               <p>At Sea they never uſe the Ladle but Cartrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of Canvas or Parchment, to which they give three Calibres in breadth, and four in length, and two half Calibres for the lying, in caſe there is no Scrole; and before they put the Cartridge into the Chaſe, they open that end towards the Touch-hole with a Knife or Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:105660:74"/>
Iron upon that part which correſponds to the Touch-hole. If the Cartridge is well made there is no need of ramming it after the Charge.</p>
               <p>If with a Cannon or Pierrier you would ſhoot a Bullet red hot, before you put it into the Chaſe betwixt the Powder, in ſtead of Hay or Wadding you muſt put a Sod of Earth, and ſpunge well the Cannon.</p>

               <head>To lay a Peece of Ordance to paſs at Sea.</head>
               <p>TO point a Peece of Ordnance, or lay a Peece to paſs, is to level it directly againſt the Mark you intend to ſtrike.</p>
               <p>The practiſe whereof which they uſe at Sea, is different from that of the Batteries at Land. For at Sea all the exactneſs of Shot depends upon the motion of the Ship; when you give fire, the Heaving of the Ship, and ſetting of the Waves, are ordinarily ſo unconſtant, that if the Cannoneer doth not well obſerve his time, he miſſeth his Aim, and loſeth his Shor, and which depends wholly upon his judgment, having no other way to guide himſelf then this, which is ſo well to take time, that he expect and ſee that part the moſt elevated and raiſed up upon the water which he intends to ſtrike, that it may not be covered and under water at ſuch time as the Powder takes fire, and chaſeth the Ball, which may happen in ſeveral manners, to wit, If we give fire when one of the Veſſels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:105660:74"/>
or ingaged ſinketh it ſelf into the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of the Waves, then when that from whence you intend to ſhoot abaſeth or raiſeth its Deck on which is your Battery, your Peece then loſing its Horizontal Line, or when the Waves which are betwixt the Enemies Ships ſwell up and cover your Battery, Judgment only and Experience can put this Advice into practice. Thoſe that will apprehend, muſt firſt know the thickneſs of the Metal at the Touch-hole, and from thence judge the time that the Powder may be a firing to the Chamber. Secondly, they muſt well adviſe themſelves of the diſtance of moving of the Object againſt which they aim, which ought to be no farther diſtant than 1000 common Paces or more, and then they level the Peece about 20 Paces before, in which time the Veſſel overtakes the determinated di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the mean time that the Powder in the Touchole burns, and that the Shot ſlies. Thirdly, they muſt diligently obſerve the roling and motion of the Veſſel, according to which they make tryal of their Judgment.</p>
