            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>SEveral accidents have till now hindred the compleating the number of these Letters; thô such as make not to our present purpose to relate. Only it is fit I should let you know, that by the mouth of <hi>August</hi> last, mentioned in the third Letter, is to be understood <hi>August,</hi> in the year 1681.</p>
            <p>But if you would know why I publish these Letters: know, that the implacable hatred the Persecutours of the French Protestants do pursue these poor people with, who have taken Sanctuary under the protection of our good King; has made it absolutely necessary. For when by all imaginable ways of cruelty, they have forced them to a resolution of abandoning their Country and all they have; they not only make it the utmost penalty on this side life, so much as to attempt a departure, but after they are escaped, endeavour to prevent their subsisting any where else, especially in <hi>England.</hi> Amongst some they are represented as Enemies to our Religion Established: thô they desire
<pb facs="tcp:95734:3"/>
to be esteemed as Brethren, by professing the same Faith and submitting to the same discipline. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they are made appear as a mixt Multitude, part Protestant part Papist: whereas the strict Examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their testimonials by the Churches here of their own Nation, makes the suggestion impossible. But that nothing may be wanting to add affliction to the misery of these poor Fugitives, and render them at the same time worse than unprofitable to their Brethren: It is suggested to the common people, that they come to take the Bread out of their Mouths, by over-stocking those populous Manufactures, which seem already rather to be overcharged, and by surfeiting the Land with people. Which Objection, if we consider strictly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to interest, comes not up to any weight or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. For many of the Manufactures they bring over, are such as we had not before, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the greatest and most unexceptionable benefit to us. Others, tho not wholly new, yet bring so great improvement to those we had already of the same kind: that they do in a manner create a new Manufacture. There are likewise that give help to a full Trade that wanted hands before to supply it. And now if any are so unfortunate, as to bring over such as we are more than fill'd with already: I would beg, that as men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we would consider the common Laws of Humanity, and let necessity take place of inconvenience; and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to have especial regard to those that are of the Houshold of Faith. Now that we should be over-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
<pb facs="tcp:95734:3"/>
I think there is no danger; when no considering man but will allow that our Nation wants more than a Million of people, and that no Country is rich but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its number. But be the politick consideration what it will; never was there greater objects of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity and Compassion, than these poor people. 1. If we look upon the privileges of mankind, we shall find them here infringed to the scandal of our being. Men not only forced to renounce their thoughts, and say the contrary to what at the same time they declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevels to believe; but having by violence Holy Water cast upon them, and dragged at a Horse-tail to Mass, they shall be pronounced Roman Catholicks, and made to suffer as Relapse, if they dare renounce what they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver consented to. They are neither permitted to live at home, nor to go abroad. The Holy and Religious Duty (as the Papists account it) of Confession is prostituted to Oppression, and polluted with the intermixture of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Concerns. For the Confessors now in <hi>France</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure their Penitents, upon pain of Damnation not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal any Debt they owe to a Protestant, and when reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, immediately they attach it in the Debtors Hands, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same penalty. 2. If we consider them as they are Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> never had people greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, better settled, nor upon juster grounds; of which the first Letter will abundantly convince any reasonable person. And yet it will appear by the second Letter, that no people were ever reduced to a more miserable Estate, and lived. But that which ought to move an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:95734:4"/>
in all diversities of his passion at once is, not only that they are of our Communion, but that we are in a manner punished in them. For a great inducement to this inhumane Usage, not only seems to be, but is really owned by Papists to be from the rage they have conceived against us for preventing their bloody and hellish Designs by the exemplary punishment of some Popish Traytors. Nay, if they durst for shame speak out, I am sure they would tell us, That since they could not execute their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice upon English Protestants, they are resolved to wreak their Revenge upon the <hi>French</hi> and scourge them for our sakes.</p>
            <p>The three next Letters make good by invincible proofs the innocence of these poor sufferers, together with their affection and loyalty to their Soverains. And the last shews plainly that the Papists themselves are the real Enemies to all Crowned Heads.</p>
            <p>You will find that I use no Authority for the justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French Protestants, but what I have taken out of Popish Authours, who cannot be suspected of partiality.</p>
            <p>Since the finishing of my last Letter, I met with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous acknowledement of the <hi>Gunpowder-Treason-Plot</hi> by a <hi>Jesuite.</hi> Who tho he seems to speak with some abhorrence of the Fact, and would excuse <hi>Garnet,</hi> and others of his Society; does however acknowledge the thing in so Plain a manner, as makes all his excuses frivolous. You will find the story in a Book Entitled <hi>Historia Missionis Anglicanae Soc. Jesu, Authore Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rico Moro</hi> lib. 7. <hi>n. XIX. Printed at St.</hi> Omers <hi>Anno.</hi> 1660.</p>

               <head>LETTER I.</head>
               <p>YOu are not at all mistaken; I can now easily satisfie you in what you desire to know concerning the Protestants of <hi>France.</hi> One that is a Friend to us both, who is lately come thence, hath fully acquainted me with the condition they are in. I saw him the day after his arrival, and found him ordering his Books, and loose Papers, which were just opened. After our first Salute, I ask'd him what they were. They are, said he, French Books; and those Printed Sheets, are the new Edicts, Declarations, and Acts which the King of <hi>France</hi> hath lately publish'd against the Protestants of his Kingdom. I am very happy, said I, in lighting on you at the opening of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. I was extremely impatient of knowing, with some certainty, what it was drove so many of them from their Native Country; and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95734:5"/>
by the care you have taken to collect all the pieces which concern them, that I could not have met any one who might better satisfie my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity. They come hither in Troops almost every day, and the greatest part of them with no other Goods, but their Children. The King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his accustomed Goodness, hath had pity on them, so far as to provide means whereby they may be able to gain their Lively-hood; and amongst other things, he hath ordered a general Collection for them throughout the Kingdom. We were all resolved to answer the charitable Intentions of our Gracious Prince, and were beginning to contribute freely. But to tell you the truth, we were extremely cooled by certain Rumors. It is confess'd, that their King is very earnest to make them embrace his Religion: but they assure us, that he uses none but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>reasonable Means,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the 17th: of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1681.</note> and that they who come hither with such Outcries, are a sort of People not <hi>gifted with much patience,</hi> who easily forsake their Native Country, being dissatisfied, that their merit, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is not sufficiently rewarded. Besides, they are represented to us very much suspected in the point of their Obedience and Loyalty. If we may believe many here, they have been very factious and rebellious; such as in all times have struck at the higher Powers both in Church and State; which, you must needs see, would not be much for our purpose in these present Conjunctures. In truth, this is intolerable, (cry'd our Friend) I cannot endure that the Innocence of these poor people should be run down at this rate: I perceive Father <hi>La Chaise</hi> is not content to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them in their own Country with the utmost cruelty, but trys all ways to shut up the Bowels of their Brethren in foreign parts: he endeavours to ruine, and to famish them every where; in <hi>England</hi> as well as <hi>France</hi>: A Hatred so cruel, and, if I may so say, murderous, agrees not so well with the Gospel of the Meek <hi>Iesus,</hi> whose Companion Father <hi>La Chaise</hi> styles himself. For, he came not to destroy men, but to save them. Let this Jesuite alone, said I, and his Emissaries, I do not doubt but he hath too much to do in all the Affairs of Protestants. But tell me inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously, do they give just cause to them of <hi>France,</hi> to quit their Country as they do, and are they persons whom the State and the Church may trust? You your self shall be Judge, said he, and that you may be fully inform'd of the Cause, I will give you a particular Account of the State of these poor People. But before I speak of the Evils they have suffered, it is sit you should know, what it is that they have right to hope for from their King, and from their Countrymen; you will then be more affected with the usage they find.</p>
               <p>You cannot but have heard of the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi> Here it is, said he, (taking up one of the Books that lay upon the Table.) It is a Law which <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth confirmed to establish their Condition, and to secure their Lives and Privileges, and that they might have liberty freely to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95734:5"/>
profess their Religion. It is called the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> because it was concluded of at <hi>Nantes</hi> whilst the King was there. It contains 149 Articles, 93 general, and 56 particular. You may read it at your leisure, if you please: I will only observe some of them to you at present. Look, I pray, (said he) on the sixth general, and the first particular Article. Liberty of Conscience, without let, or molestation is there most expresly promised, not only to them who made profession of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, at the establishment of the Edict, but, (which is principally to be observed) to all those who should imbrace and profess it afterwards.<note place="margin">Art. 1. Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</note> For the Article saith, that Liberty of Conscience is granted for all those who are, or who <hi>shall</hi> be of the said Religion, whether Natives or others. The seventh general Article grants to all Protestants the right of having <hi>Divine</hi> Service, Preaching, and full exercise of their Religion, in all their Houses who have <hi>Soveraign Iustice</hi>: that is to say, who have the privilege of appointing a Judge, who hath the power of judging in Capital Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, upon occasion. There are a great many Noble Houses in <hi>France</hi> which have this privilege. That seventh Article allows all Protestants who have such Houses, to have Divine Service and Preaching there, not only for themselves, their own Family and Tenants, but also for all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who have a mind to go thither. The following Article allows even the same Exercise of the Protestant Religion in Noble Houses which have not the right of Soveraign Justice, but which only hold in Fee-simple. It is true, it doth not allow them to admit into their Assemblies above thirty persons besides their own Family. The ninth Article is of far greater importance: it allows the Protestants to have, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the exercise of their Religion in all those places where it had been publickly used in the years 1596, and 1597. The tenth Article goes farther yet, and orders that that Exercise <hi>be established</hi> in all places where it ought to have been by the Edict of 1577, if it had not been; or to be <hi>re-established</hi> in all those places if it had been taken away: and that Edict of 1577, granted by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, declares, that the Exercise of the Protestant Religion should be continued in all places where it had been in the Month of <hi>September</hi> that same year; and moreover, that there should be a place in each Bailywick, or other Corporation of the like nature, where the Exercise of that Religion should be established, tho it had never been there before. These are those places which since have been called, with reference to the Exercise of Religion, <hi>The first places of the Bailywick.</hi> It follows then from this tenth Article of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> that besides the Cities and Towns in which the Exercise of that Religion ought to be continued, because they had it in the years 1596, and 1597, it ought to be over and above in all those places where it had been in the month of <hi>September</hi> in the year 1577, and in a convenient place of each Bailywick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> altho it had not been there in that Month.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95734:6"/>
The eleventh Article grants also this Exercise in each Bailywick, in a second place where it had not been either in the Month of <hi>September,</hi> 1577, or in the years 1596, or 1597. This is that which is called <hi>The second place of the Bailywick,</hi> in distinction to that other place of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is granted by virtue of the Edict of 1577. When <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth sent Commissaries into the several Provinces to see his Edict put in execution, there was scarce found any considerable City or Town where the Commissaries did not acknowledge that the Exercise of the Protestant Religion had no need to be confirm'd, or re-established, because it had been used there in some one of the three years above-mentioned: in so much, that there were whole Provinces which had no need of those two places, granted out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Read, as to that, the thirty seventh particular Article. It declares, that they shall have publick Schools and Colleges in those Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Places where they ought to have the publick Exercise of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Edict having secured, as you see, the Exercise of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, secures also the condition of them who should profess it, to the end that they might, without any molestation, each one according to his quality, follow those Trades, Employments and Offices which are the ordinary means of mens Livelyhood.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the thing of it self speaks this. For it is plain that they do not grant in good earnest the free Exercise of a Religion, who debar the persons that profess it the use of means necessary for their subsistence. Nevertheless for their greater security, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth hath declared to all <hi>Europe</hi> by his Edict, that he would not that there should be any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, as to that point, between his Protestant and his Papist Subjects. The thirty seventh general Article, as to that is express. This it is: We declare all them who do or shall make profession of the pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, capable of holding and exercising all Conditions, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, Honours, and publick Charges whatsoever, Royalties, Seigneuries, or any Charge in the Cities of our Kingdom, Countries, Territories, or Seigneuries under our Authority. The fifty fourth Article declares, that they shall be admitted Officers in the Courts of Parliaments, Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, Chamber of Accounts, Court of Aids, and the Offices of the general Treasurers of <hi>France</hi>; and amongst the other Officers of the Revenues of the Crown. The seventy fourth Article puts them in the same state
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95734:6"/>
with their Fellow Subjects, as to all publick Exactions, willing that they should be charged no higher than others. Those of the said Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly Reformed (saith the Article) may not hereafter be overcharged or oppressed with any Imposition ordinary or extraordinary, more than the Catholicks: And to the end that Justice might be done and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred impartially, as the Edict explains it self, the 30th. 31st to the 57th Articles set up Chambers of the Edict in the Parliaments of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Roan,</hi> where the Protestant Counsellors ought to assist as Judges: and Chambers <hi>Miparties</hi> in the Parliaments of <hi>Guienne, Languedoc</hi> and <hi>Dauphine,</hi> consisting each of two Presidents, the one Protestant, the other Papist, and of twelve Counsellors, an equal number of each Religion, to judge without Appeal, (exclusive to all other Courts) all Differences of any importance which the Protestants might have with their Fellow Subjects as well in Criminal, as in Civil Matters. In short, this great Edict for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets nothing which might make the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> to live in peace, and honor: It hath not fail'd even to explain it self, as to the Vexations which might be created them, by taking away or seducing their Children. For, read the eighteenth general Article. It forbids all Papists of what quality or condition soever they may be, to take them away by force, or by perswasion against the will of their Parents: As if it had foreseen that this would be one of the ways which their Persecutors would use, to vex and ruine them. But the 38th. Article goes farther yet: That Wills, that even after their death, Fathers shall be Masters of the Education of their Children, and consequently of their Religion; so long as their Children shall continue under Guardians, which is by the Laws of <hi>France</hi> till the 25th year of their Age: <hi>It shall be lawful for Fathers, who profess the said Religion, to provide for them such persons for their education, as they think fit, and to substitute one or more, by Will, Codicil, or other Declaration made before Publick Notaries, or written and sign'd with their own hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You perceive then plainly, continued our Friend, that by this Edict King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth made the condition of the Protestants equal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all things to that of his other Subjects. They had reason then to hope that they should be allowed to exercise their Religion, to breed up and instruct their Children in it, without any disturbance; and that they should have as free admission to all Arts, Trades, Offices and Employments as any of their Fellow Subjects.</p>
               <p>This is very clear, said I, and I am much obliged to you for explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me what this famous Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> is, which I had heard so much discourse of. But they who have no affection for the Protestants tell us, that it is a Law which was extorted by violence; and consequently, is not to be kept. I will not stand now (said our Friend) to examine whether that consequence be good; you cannot but perceive that it is dangerous. But I dare assure you that the Principle from whence it is drawn; namely,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95734:7"/>
that the Edict was extorted by violence is very false. I would not have you take my word for it. But I will produce an unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. It is the Archbishop of <hi>Paris</hi>; he who writ the Life of <hi>Honry</hi> the Fourth. <hi>That</hi> one Witness is worth a thousand; for he was a declared Enemy of the Protestants. According to him: The general Peace was made, the Ligue extinguish'd; and all persons in <hi>France</hi> had laid down their Arms, when this Edict was granted in favour of them. It is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous now, to say, that it was extorted by violence, there being then no party in all the Kingdom in a condition to make the least attempt with impunity. Moreover, that Prelate could not forbear owning expresly what it was mov'd the King to grant them that Edict: It was the sense of the <hi>Great Obligations</hi> he had to them. See the Book it self; read the Passage. The <hi>Great Obligations which he had to them would not permit him to drive them into despair; and therefore to preserve them a just ballance, he granted them an Edict larger than any before. They called it the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed the Obligations he had to them were not small. They had testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied an inviolable Loyalty to him in all his Troubles. They had spent freely their Lives and Fortunes to defend his Rights, and his Life against the Princes of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> who made so many Attempts to keep him from the Throne of his Ancestors, and to usurp his place. Had it not been for their Valour, and their Loyalty, the Crown had gone into the hands of Strangers; and (since we must speak out) had it not been for them, the Blood of the <hi>Bourbons</hi> would not this day have been possessed of the Throne.</p>
               <p>The Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> then, was the Effect and the Recompence of the Great Obligations which King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth had to his Loyal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and not as is slanderously reported, the fruit of any violence, gained by force, and granted against the hair. But farther, the Law of Nature and common policy might challenge such an Edict for them as well as Gratitude. It is true, that Soveraign Magistrates are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God to preserve the publick peace, and by consequence, to cut off, or prevent, as much as in them lies, whatever may disturb it: It is true also that new Establishments in matters of Religion may cause great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in a State, and that there are Religions which have Maxims so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, that when Magistrates are of a different opinion, or but so much as tolerate such a one, their Lives and their Kingdoms are never in safety. But <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth found the Protestant Religion wholly establish'd in the Kingdom when he came to the Crown: Besides, he who had so long profess'd it, knew perfectly well that it had none of those dreadful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, which makes Princes and States jealous; that on the contrary, in it, Loyalty and Obedience of Subjects to Soveraigns of what Religion, and what humor soever, was to them an Article of Faith, and an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Conscience. He knew that Protestants, by their Religion were
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95734:7"/>
peaceable men, who sought but to serve God according to his Word, and were always ready to spend the last drop of their blood for the service and the honor of their King.</p>
               <p>But he knew also that the zeal of the Romish Clergy always animated the Popish Common People against them, and that they would be sure to fall upon them, unless he took them into his protection. The Law of Nature then did not permit him to abandon to the rage of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude so many innocent persons; and common policy warned him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve so many faithful Subjects for the State, so capable of supporting it on occasion, as he had so freshly experienc'd. It being certain, that had it not been for them, the Pope and the Ligue had ruin'd the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; But it was not possible, either to defend them from the fury of the People, or to preserve them for the service of the State, if he had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favour of them any thing less than the Edict of <hi>Nantes:</hi> so that this Edict in truth was to be ascribed to common Equity and Prudence no less than Gratitude.</p>
               <p>But, said I to my Friend, do you believe that the Grandson of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth is bound to make good what his Grandfather did? I do not doubt it at all (answered he) otherwise there would be nothing secure or certain in Civil Society; and wo be to all Governments if there be no Foundation of publick Trust. 1. For if ever Law deserv'd to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Successors of a Prince, it is this. It was establish'd by a Hero, who had recovered the Crown for his posterity, by his Sword: and this Establishment was not made but after mature and long deliberations, in the calm of a prosound Peace, obtained and cemented by many and signal Victories. That Hero hath declar'd expresly in the Preface of the Edict, that he establish'd it in the nature of an irrevocable and perpetual Law; willing, that it should be firm and inviolable; as he also saith himself in the 90th. Article. Accordingly he made all the Formalities to be observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its establishment, which are necessary for the passing of a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Law in a State. For he made the observation of it under the quality of an irrevocable Law, to be sworn to by all the Governors and Lieutenant-Generals of his Provinces, by the Bailiffs, Mayors, and other ordinary Judges, and principal Inhabitants of the Cities, of each Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Majors, Sheriffs, Consuls and Jurates, by the Parliaments, Chambers of Accounts, Court of Aids, with order to have it publish'd and registred in all the said Courts. This is expresly set down in the 92d. and 93d. Articles. Was there ever any thing more authentick? 2. The same Reasons which caused the Establishment, remain still, and plead for its continuance. 1. The Family of <hi>Bourbon</hi> preserved in the Throne. 2. The Law of Nature and common Policy. 3. The two Successors of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth look'd not upon themselves as unconcern'd in this Edict. Their Word, and their Royal Authority are engaged for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95734:8"/>
its observation no less than the Word and Royal Authority of its Illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth confirm'd it as soon as he came to the Crown by his Declaration of the 22d. of <hi>May,</hi> 1610, ordering, that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> should be <hi>observed</hi> in every Point and Article. These are the very words. Read them (said he) shewing me a Book in <hi>Folio,</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">P. 156, &amp; 157, of the <hi>Lions</hi> Edition.</note> 
                  <hi>The Great Conference of the Royal Ordinances and Edicts.</hi> I read there in the first Book, Title 6, of the second Part of the Volume, not only the Article he mention'd, but also the citation of nine several Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons publish'd at several times by the same King, on the same subject. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, who now Reigns, (says our Friend) hath likewise assured all <hi>Europe</hi> by his authentick Edicts and Declarations, that he would maintain the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> according to the desire of his Grandfather, who had made it an irrevocable Law. He himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges and confirms it himself anew; by his Edict of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1680, where he forbids Papists to change their Religion. There it is; pray take the pains to read it. Lewis <hi>by the Grace of God, King of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Navarre, <hi>to all persons to whom these Presents come, Greeting. The late</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the Fourth; our Grandfather, of Glorious Memory, granted by his Edict given at</hi> Nantes <hi>in the Month of</hi> April, 1598, <hi>to all his Subjects of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion pretended Reformed, who then lived in his Kingdom, or who afterwards should come and settle in it, Liberty of professing their Religion, and at the same time provided whatsoever he judged necessary for affording those of the said Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion pretended Reformed means of living in our Kingdom, in the Exercise of their Religion, without being molested in it by our Catholick Subjects: which the late King, our most Honored Lord and Father, and we since have authorised and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed on other Occasions, by divers Declarations and Acts.</hi> But this Prince is not content to tell what he hath formerly done, in confirmation of the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi>; read some Lines a little lower, and you will see that he repeats again his former Ingagements. <hi>We declare, that confirming as much as is, or may be needful, the Edict of</hi> Nantes, <hi>and other Declarations and Acts given in pursuit of it,</hi> &amp;c. That is to say: That by this new Edict he signs once more the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and for a more authentick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that important Law, he ratifies together with it, and seals with his Royal Seal all the Declarations which had already confirmed it. If all this is not sufficient to render <hi>His</hi> Word Sacred and Inviolable, there is nothing in the World can do it: all things are lawful, and it is to no purpose to talk of any Obligation, or of any Bond in humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. They cannot make void, or break the Clauses of an Edict so well deserv'd by the Protestants, so just and so wise in it self, so solemnly esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd, so religiously sworn to, and so often, and so authentically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by three Kings, without shaking all the Foundations of publick Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, without violating, in that Act, the Law of Nations, and silling the World with fatal Principles, which by ruining all mutual Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

men, render Divisions in States incurable; and consequently immortal.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir, said I, I am much pleased with what you have inform'd me. O how I shall dash them out of countenance, who hereafter shall compare the condition of our Papists in <hi>England</hi> with that of the Protestants in <hi>France.</hi> There is no sort of good usage but what is due to these in their own Country; of which they have deserved so well by preserving that Family which now reigns there. What have they not a right to hope for under the protection of an Edict so authentick? But our Papists in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> have they ever deserved a like protection? Hath there ever been pass'd any Act of Parliament in favour of them, like to this Edict? On the contrary, have not there been pass'd 1000 against them? And not one, but upon the provocation of some Sedition, or open Rebellion.<note place="margin">See Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures at large. 1 <hi>Elizab.</hi> 1. 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 1. 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>Iacob.</hi> 4. 3 <hi>Iac.</hi> 4, 5, &amp;c.</note> You need but review the Fundamental Laws of the Land now in force against the Pope, against the Jesuits, Seminary Priests, and in general against all the Papists.

               <p>You are much in the right (said our Friend) when you use the word <hi>justly</hi> on this occasion: Princes and Protestant Magistrates cannot look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor by consequence, treat Papists otherwise than as declared an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> in truth, every Papist is a man who takes the Pope to be the Soveraign Head of the Universal Church, and believes that on that very account, there is no Prince, nor King, nor Emperor who is not subject to his Censures, even to Excommunication. Now who knows not that it is a general Maxim of that Religion, that they ought to treat all excommunicated persons, as common Pests? Upon this all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are dispensed with from their Oaths of Allegiance to their Princes, Kingdoms are laid under Interdicts; and they are no way obliged to keep faith with Hereticks. This is the original and damnable Cause of the many Conspiracies that have been made against the Sacred Lives of our Kings: And if you will search our Histories, you will find none of the forementioned Acts ever passed but upon some previous provocation given by the Papists Insolence, or Rebellions: of the Massacres in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein they of <hi>Rome</hi> have so triumph'd, and of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral consternation into which so lately our Nation was cast.

               <p>The first is a Verbal Process of the extraordinary Assembly of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops and Bishops held in the Province of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Months of <hi>March</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> this 1681. It is a Piece which justifies a Truth, that the World will hardly believe: Namely, That whereas the Protestants by Virtue of the Edict had the Exercise of their Religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every where, they have it now scarce any where.

Winter, to hear the Word of God, and to have their Children baptized. But let us go on to a second Piece.</p>
               <p>Here is a Declaration hath lain heavy upon them, in reference to an infinite number of living Temples, who are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is of the thirteenth of <hi>March,</hi> 1679. Pray read it. It forbids all Popish Clergy-men, whatever desire they have, to turn Protestants; and even all those Protestants, who have forsaken their Religion out of Lightness, or Infirmity; to return to it again, upon better knowledge of the truth, press'd to it by their Consciences, and desiring to give glory to God. This dreadful Edict, will not suffer, that any of them shall satisfie their Consciences, in so important an Affair, under any less penalty, than that of the <hi>Amende Honorable,</hi> perpetual banishment, and consiscation of their Goods. I beseech you (said I) what doth the Declaration intend, by <hi>making Amende Honorable?</hi> You have reason to ask, replyed he, it is that you ought not to be ignorant of. Know then, that for them to make <hi>Amende Honorable</hi> is to go into some publick place, in their Shirt, a Torch in their Hand, a Rope about their Neck, followed by the Hangman, in this Equipage (which is that of the most infamous Criminals) to ask pardon of God, the King, and Justice for what they have done: that is to say, on this occasion, for having dar'd to rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Names do not change the nature of things: the Misery is, that all this is executed with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most rigor. The Prisons of <hi>Poictiers,</hi> and those of other places are at this present filled with this sort of pretended Relapsed Persons; and it is not permitted to any one to relieve them. What <hi>possibility</hi> is there then for such as are in like Circumstances, and whose number every day increases, to continue in <hi>France?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the mischief is much increas'd since this Declaration. What was particular to Ecclesiasticks and Relapse Protestants, is now become uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal to all Roman Catholicks. I shewed you the Piece yesterday. It is that very Edict of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1680, wherein they pretend to confirm the Edict of <hi>Nantes.</hi> A Blessed Confirmation! The Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi>

But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what doth this new Edict declare! <hi>Our Will and Pleasure is, that our Subjects, of what quality, condition, age or sex soever, now making profession of the Catholick Apostolick Roman Religion, may never forsake it, to go over to the pretended Reformed Religion, for what Cause, Reason, Pretence or Consideration soever. We will that they who shall act contrary to this our Pleasure, shall be condemned to make</hi> Amende Honorable, <hi>to perpetual banishment out of our Kingdom, and all their Goods to be confiscated.

(cryed I, as soon as my Friend had read it) do they call this confirming of Edicts in <hi>France?</hi> what a Violence is this to the Consciences of Ministers and Elders, to command them to shut the doors of the Church of Jesus Christ to all their Neighbours who come thither for admission: (and to have this done) by them who are called by God to open the Door to all the World? Is not this to force them to violate the most Essential and Sacred Duty of Christian Charity? In truth, if there were nothing else but this; I do not see how they can stay there much longer with a safe Conscience. They must swallow worse Potions than these (said my Friend) you shall see presently quite other Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What (replyed I) have they the heart to use thus cruelly those poor Churches within whose Walls any Roman Catholick changes his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? Don't doubt it (said he) they make no conscience at all to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> their Commission, whensoever they are enjoyn'd to execute any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I will give you an Example, which will amaze you There is a great Town in <hi>Poitou</hi> called <hi>La Motthe,</hi> where the Protestants have a Church consisting of between three and four thousand Communicants: a young Maid of about seventeen years old, who from a Protestant had turned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, had stole her self into the Congregation upon a Communion-day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now you must observe, that the Protestant Churches are full on those days. For they would believe themselves very much to blame, if they lost any Opportunity of partaking at the Lord's Supper. Nevertheless, without considering how easie it was for that young Maid not to be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the Consistory in such a Crowd, and tho those poor people were not at all within the Letter of that rigorous Edict, they have made them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo all the penalty. The Exercise of their Religion is wholly suppress'd there, and their Minister not allowed to preach in <hi>France.</hi> This is very cruel (said I to our Friend) and tho it were true that those Ministers and those Elders were guilty upon such an account, why should the whole flock
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95734:10"/>
be punished? Those poor Sheep what have they done? That is very usual for those Gentlemen (answered he:) I have a hundred Stories to instance in. I cannot forbear telling you one, which many of their own Devotees were scandalized at. S. <hi>Hippolyte</hi> is a place in where all the Inhabitants are Protestants, except the Curate, and it may be, two or three poor wretches, who are not Natives of the place neither. A fancy took the Curate to put a Trick upon the Protestants; for this he chose a Sunday; and the very moment that they came out of the Church, he came and presented himself before them with his Sacrament, as they were almost all come out. You must know that the Church is on the farther side of a Bridge, which must be pass'd over, going and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Several of them were upon the Bridge, others had pass'd it, and part were yet on the other side; when the Curate appear'd, all of them, who could possibly, got away and hid themselves: but neither the place, nor the great haste of the Curate would permit all of them to do so. He went up directly to one of the Company, whom he had born an ill will to for some time: he bids him kneel: and the other answering that his Conscience would not suffer him to do it; he gave him a Cuff on the Ear. He that was struck grumbled; and so did two or three who were about him. The Curate went on his way, threatning hard. Next day there were Informations made on both sides: the Curate in his, not complaining of any person but him he had struck, and two or three o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who had grumbled at it. The Friends of the Curate perceiving that he had done the wrong, propos'd an Accommodation. It was by misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune consented to. Prosecution ceased on each side, and it was believed that there was an end of that business: there was not a word spoken of it in above a year. But the Intendant of <hi>Languedoc</hi> revived it last Winter, when they thought of nothing less; and of a matter particular to two or three, made it a general Concern of the whole Congregation. He cites them before the Presidial of <hi>Nismes,</hi> to whom he joyn'd himself. He condemns them to demolish their Church in a Months time. Those poor people go and cast themselves at the feet of the Court; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The King's Council hears and confirms this strange Order of the Intendant, and the Church is rac'd to the ground. The Council which gave this Sentence was the first in which the <hi>Dauphine</hi> was present. The Report of such an Order being spred among the Courtiers, and all being amaz'd that heard it, a certain person took the liberty to tell the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> that for the first time he had been at the Council, he had assisted to a great Injustice. What say you to that? said a Duke and Peer, to the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> who had made no reply to the former. I say, answered the <hi>Dauphin,</hi> that he may be much in the right. I told our Friend, I had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of this. You must not be weary, said he, this is but the beginning of sorrows. Let's go on to the rest. Here is, said he, a Little Book
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95734:11"/>
which comes just now to my hand, in it are stitch'd up together, three Acts concerning Schools. The first is of the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> 1670. It forbids all Protestant Schoolmasters to teach any thing in their Schools, but to read and write, and Arithmetick. The second, which is of the 4th. of <hi>December,</hi> 1671, ordains, that the Protestants shall have but one only School in any place where they have the publick Exercise of their Religion; and but one Master in that School. The third is of the ninth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> this present 1681. Look upon them (said he) and give me your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. It seems (said I) that the first contains nothing which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants may complain of, at least, if that which I read there be true, namely, that by the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> it is expresly ordain'd, That in the Schools of those of the pretended Reformed Religion, there shall not any thing be taught, but to read, write, and cast account. For according to this, the Edict of 1670 is entirely conformable to that other Edict which is the Law. You are in the right, said I, but they who fram'd the Act, have deceived you, and have made no scruple to ground it upon a matter of fact entirely false. For the Article which speaks of Schools, doth not mention the least word of that restriction, which the Act assures us to be there <hi>expressed,</hi> namely, <hi>of teaching only to read, write, and cast account.</hi> See the Article length: it is the 37th particular. <hi>Those of the said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may not keep publick Schools, unless in Cities and places where the publick Exercise of their Religion is allowed, and the Provisions which have heretofore been granted them for the erection or maintenance of Colleges, shall be authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated where occasion shall require, and have their full and entire effect.</hi> Where is that <hi>express</hi> Order? <hi>It is expresly ordered to teach only to read, write, and cast account</hi>; upon which the Act is grounded. Is it possible (said I) that they should have no sense of the horrid shame which must arise upon conviction of forgery in a matter of fact of this nature? They never stick at so small a matter as that (said he) in the design they have of rooting out the Protestants. Those who are in <hi>France</hi> dare not open their mouths to discover such kind of Falsities; and Strangers, whom they carry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And what say you (continued be) to that other Act which reduces all Schools to one, in each City and Town where the Protestants have the publick Exercise of their Religion, and that which requires that there should be only one Master in that School. I replyed that it was an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent way to restore Ignorance, the Mother of the Roman Faith and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. In truth, says he, the care of one Master cannot go far. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides there is a Protestant Church which alone hath two thousand Children
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95734:11"/>
of age to be taught. Those poor people have done all they could to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Council, that at least there might be two Schools in each place, one for Boys, and the other for Girls. But it was to little purpose that they pleaded good manners for it, which such a mixture of both Sexes visibly was offensive to. They were deaf to all their Prayers and to all their Remonstrances. But this is not all yet. In the Execution of this rigorous Act, they have taken away <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rom them that little which was left them. For the Judges of the places will not suffer that any School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master teach, unless they have first of all approved of him, and receiv'd him in all their Forms. As therefore their approbation is a matter full of invincible Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>iculties; above all, when they are to give it to a man of merit, and who may do good, it is come to pass by means of these two Acts, that all the little Schools of the Protestants are shut up. From the little Schools they have proceeded to Colleges. You see by the Act of the last of <hi>Iuly,</hi> which suppresses <hi>for ever</hi> that of <hi>Sedan.</hi> They have taken away also the College of <hi>Châtillon sur Loin.</hi> So that, hereafter the Protestants in <hi>France</hi> are to lie under worse than <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkness. I leave you now to judge whether they are to blame to seek for light in some <hi>Goshen.</hi> In truth, said I, this is very hard. But if they who inspire into the King such strange Acts, have no respect for <hi>Henry</hi> the Great and his Edicts, at least they ought to be more tender of the Glory of their own Illustrious Prince, and not to expose him, as they do, to be ranked with that Emperor against whom the Holy Fathers have cryed so loudly.

But their zeal transports them above the most odious Comparisons. They stick not to give occasion for them every moment. I will shew you an Example which will astonish you, I have here light upon the Paper.</p>
               <p>They are now come to take the measures of that barbarous and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane King who us'd Midwives of his own Religion to destroy the Race of the people of God in <hi>Egypt.</hi> For by that Declaration of the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> 1680, It is ordered, that the Wives of Protestants shall not be brought to bed but by Midwives or Chyrurgeons who are Papists. This they make to be observ'd with the utmost rigor, so far that they put a poor woman in prison for being present at the Labour of her Sister,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95734:12"/>
whose delivery was so quick and fortunate, that there was neither time nor need to call a Midwife.</p>
               <p>That, you may in few words understand of what consequence this is to our poor Brethren, I need but acquaint you, that the King of <hi>France</hi> in his Edict of the Month of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1680, where he forbids Papists to change their Religion, acknowledges himself, what experience doth but too plainly justifie, namely, that the <hi>Roman Catholicks have always had an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,</hi> not only against the Protestant Religion, but <hi>against all those that profess it,</hi> and an aversion which hath <hi>been improv'd by the publication of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, Declarations and Acts.</hi> That is to say, that whatever pretence the Roman Catholicks make to the contrary, they have always been, and still are Enemies of the Protestants; and that the Protestants ought to look to be treated by the Catholicks as Enemies. After this what can they judge of the Design, and Consequences of a Declaration, which puts the Lives of their Wives and Children into those very hands which the King, who makes the Declaration, acknowledges to be hands of Enemies? But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Declaration it self discovers, that one of its intentions was, to make the Children of Protestants to be baptized by Midwives, or by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Chyrurgions. And what mischief do they not open a way for by that? The Protestants will hold that Baptism void, which hath been admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred by such hands, they will not fail to make it be administred anew, by their Pastors. This shall pass for a capital Crime in the Pastors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they shall be punished as sacrilegious persons who trample on the Religion in Authority, the Religion of the King: for the most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Representations are still made use of. Nay, said I, by this they will likewise claim a right, from the Baptism's being administred by Papists, to make themselves Masters of the education of their Children. You are in the right (said he) and that Article ought not to be forgotten. It is just, will they say, that they should be brought up in the Church which hath consecrated them to God, by Baptism, at least, that they should be bred up there, till they are of age to chuse for themselves: and when they <hi>are of age,</hi> they will say then, that it is just they should, as well as others, be liable to the same Edict which forbids Catholicks to change their Religion. Is not this enough already to make one forsake such a Kingdom? A Christian for less than this would surely flie to the utmost Parts of the World. But to proceed,</p>
               <p>Here is that terrible Decree which fills up the measure, as to what concerns the poor Children. It comes to my hand very seasonably. It is the Declaration of the 17th. of <hi>Iune</hi> last. This ordains that all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Protestants shall be admitted to abjure the Religion of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and become Papists as soon as they shall be seven years old: It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that after such an Abjuration, it shall be at the choice of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, either to return home to their Fathers, and there to be maintain'd,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95734:12"/>
or to oblige their Fathers and Mothers to pay for their Board, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, where ever they please to live. It adds extreme Penalties to be laid on them, who breed up their Children in foreign parts, before they are sixteen years old. But I pray read over the whole <hi>Edict.</hi> Upon that I took the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>aration from our Friends hand, read it, and returning it to him again, could not forbear declaring, that I did not now wonder any more that the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> were in so great a Consternation. They are much in the right (said I) Discretion and Conscience oblige them to depart out of a Country, in which there is no security for the salvation of their dear Children. They are of too great a value to be so hazarded. What is more easie, for them who have all the power, than to induce such young Children to change their Religion? There is no need for this, to shew them all the Kingdoms of the World and their Glory. A Baby, a Picture, a little Cake will do the business; or if there want somewhat more, a Rod will not fail to complete this worthy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion. In the mean while, what a condition are their wretched Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in, besides the most inexpressible grief of seeing what is most dear to them in the world seduc'd out of the Service and House of God; they shall likewise have this addition of Anguish of having their own Children for their Persecutors. For, knowing, as I do, the Spirit of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, I doubt not but they will all prove rebellious and unnatural, and renounce all that love and natural respect which is due to them, whom they owe their Lives to.</p>
               <p>They'll give Law to their Parents, they will oblige them to make them great Allowances, which they will dispose of as they list; and if their Fathers pay them not precisely at the time appointed, I am sure, no rigors shall be forgotten in the prosecution. No certainly, said our Friend, and I could give you an hundred Instances, if there were need. Even before this merciless Declaration was made, the Goods of Parents were seis'd upon, exposed to sale, to pay for the maintenance of their Children, who had been inveigled from them, and been made Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. If they dealt with them so then before the Declaration, what will they not do when they see themselves supported and armed with Royal Authority? But there is no need I should insist farther on the dreadful Consequences of this Declaration. It hath been lately Printed in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and Notes made upon it, wherein nothing hath been forgotten. The Book is written impartially: tho I can scarce believe what is express'd in the Title Page, that it was written in <hi>French</hi>; however, some Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisms are put in to make you believe it: but the Protestants of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not us'd to such <hi>bold</hi> Expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ssions upon such kind of Subjects: and I doubt much whether they could do it.</p>
               <p>If they have reason to fear for the birth, and for the tender years of their Children, they have no less for themselves. Here is a proof of it.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95734:13"/>
It is the Declaration of the 19th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1680: By which it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, That whenever they are sick, they shall suffer themselves to be visited by the Papist Magistrates. Thus, having made their lives <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome</hi> to them, they take a thousand ways to torment them in their Beds, as soon as any Disease hath seised them. It is not henceforth permitted to them either to be sick, or die in peace. Under colour of this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration they are persecuted, and all means are tryed to shake their Faith, under the pretence of being ask'd what Religion they will die in. First a Judge presents himself with the awe of his presence, accompanied by one of the King's Sollicitors and two Papist Witnesses. They begin their Work by driving all Protestants, who are with the sick man, out of his Chamber: Father, Mother, Wife, Husband, Children, none are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. After that, they do with the sick person as they list: they draw up a Verbal Process, or such as they like. Lies with them are but pious Frauds. Whatsoever the sick man answers, he hath still abjur'd, if these Gentlemen please to make a conversion of it; and there is no possibility of disproving it. The Verbal Process is drawn up in good Form. If the sick man recovers, and refuses to go to Mass, immediately he is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to all the penalties of a Relapse. If he dies and chances to be the Father of a Family, they take away all his Children, to breed them up in the Popish Religion; and his Estate, to preserve it, as they pretend, for the Children of a Catholick Father. Can any one who hath any care of his own salvation, or any affection for his Children, live expos'd to such dreadful Inconveniences, if God offers any means to avoid them?</p>
               <p>I am afraid I tire you with the Recital of so many Calamities. Fear not that, answered I, I am resolv'd to know all. You do not consider what you say, replyed he, I should need whole weeks to tell you all. Imagine all the Suprises, all the indirect practices, all the base tricks of Insinuation, and little quirks of Law are put in ure: together with all manner of violence, to accomplish the Work. Neither do those E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Protestants always neglect the Oracles of the Scripture. It says, <hi>I will smite the Shepherd, and the Sheep of the Flock shall be scattered.</hi> These Gentlemen then, that they may the more easily scatter the Sheep, smite, every where, the Shepherd, and constrain them to fly. They im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison one, for having by the Word of God confirm'd some of his Flock, whom the Popish Doctors would pervert: another, for being converted to the Protestant Religion in his youth, long before any Law was made against pretended Apostates. They hire forlorn Wretches to go to the Sermons of the Protestant Ministers, and to depose before a Magistrate, that the Ministers said, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was idolatrous, or that the Faithful are persecuted, that they spake ill of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or of the King. Upon this, without being heard, (and tho it be offered to be made out by the Deposition of an infinity almost of persons of credit,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95734:13"/>
that the testimonies of these two or three Wretches are absolutely false) Orders are issued out for the seising the Bodies of the Ministers. They are clap'd in Jayl as soon as taken: they are condemn'd to pay excessive Fines: they force them to make the <hi>Amende Honorable,</hi> they banish them the Kingdom. The Intendant of <hi>Rochefort</hi> suppress'd one there, upon the most extravagant Deposition that was ever taken. The Deponent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, been at the Sermon of that Minister, said, <hi>That there was nothing to be found fault with in his words, but that he perceiv'd his thoughts were not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi> If there are any amongst them so happy as to consound so the false Witnesses, that the Judges are asham'd to use all those rigors; none of the Charges of Imprisonment, or of the Suit are ever recovered against any one. A Minister who may have sixty or seventy pounds a year, and seven or eight in Family to maintain, must be condemn'd with all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence to pay all these great costs. I could, upon this Head, tell you a hundred Stories, but that it would be too tedious. I have met both at <hi>Paris</hi> and in other Provinces many of these persecuted Ministers, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me with their Adventures, <hi>Germany, Holland</hi> and <hi>Switzerland</hi> are full of them, and I am told, there are some of them here in <hi>England.</hi> Their absence from their Flocks is but too good a proof how hot the persecution is against them. And so let's go on.</p>
               <p>You may remember that the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> judg'd it necessary for the preservation of the Estates, and Credit of the protestants, and for the safety of their Lives, to erect Tribunals where supreme Justice might be administred by Judges of the one, and of the other Religion. But all these Tribunals are suppress'd: namely, the Chambers of the Edict of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of <hi>Rouen.</hi> It is some years since the <hi>Chambres Miparties</hi> were suppress'd by the Delaration of <hi>Iuly,</hi> 1679: so that here is their Fortunes, their Credit, their Lives, all at the mercy of their sworn Enemies. For you have not forgot that the King of <hi>France</hi> acknowledges, in one of his Declarations, that the Papists have always hated the persons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. Judge then if it be safe for them to stay longer in such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>But there is no method proper to ruine them, which is not made use of, that if one fails, another may be sure to take. Synods and Conferences are absolutely necessary, for the Admission of their Ministers, for the Correction of Scandals, for the preservation of Peace in their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the subsistence of their Colleges, and for the support and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their Discipline. At first they kept them with all sort of Liberty. Under <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, they thought fit to forbid them to hold any Synod, unless some Protestant Commissary, who was to be named by the Court, were present. This was observed till the year 1679, when a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration was publish'd, requiring that there should be a Papist Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary in their Synods. That is to say, Sir, said I, interrupting our Friend,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95734:14"/>
they will pry into their hearts, and perfectly know where their strength or their weakness lies. If there were nothing but that in it, replyed our Friend, that Declaration would not allarm them so much as it doth. For there is nothing done in their Assemblies, which they are not willing all the world should know. They defie their most mortal Enemies to prove the contrary. Can there be a more undeniable proof of this, than the practice of the Protestant Commissary, who sends to the Court a Copy well attested of all the Results of the Deliberations which are made, while the Synod or Conference is held? What do they fear then, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I, from the presence of a Papist Commissary? Because they know that the end of the Court cannot be to discover their Secrets, since they have none; therefore it is that they justly fear, that this Papist Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary hath been set over them, to create them trouble in the most innocent Affairs, to hinder those Deliberations which are most necessary for the due preservation of their Flocks, to silence those Ministers among them whom he shall perceive to be of greatest Ability, and of Credit, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten one by threatnings, to corrupt another by promises, to sow Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention and Division among them, and to employ all means possibly to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine them. These are the just fears which have hindred them till this present, from assembling any Synods with this so destructive a condition, hoping continually that, it may be, God would touch the heart of their King. But perceiving no favourable change, and not being able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist without holding their Synods, I learn'd, as I came out of <hi>France,</hi> that these poor people are resolv'd to run these hazards, and that their Synods are upon assembling in several places. May God vouchsafe to preside in the midst of them by his Grace, and remove far from them all the Evils <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hey have cause to fear. It may be, by their good Examples, and their Religious Behaviour they may convert them, who are set over them for a snare, as it happened to their Fathers in the last Age also. Then was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the placing of Papist Commissaries, to spie out their liberty. But these Commissaries were so taken with the Modesty, the Piety, the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Decency of Order, and the devout Prayers of the first Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they gave Glory to God, and embrac'd the Religion which they had persecuted,</p>
               <p>The Jesuites nevertheless have thought all these Evils of which I have spoken, too slack and gentle. That they may not be at any more trouble, they will do the business once for all. They have contrived to starve all the Protestants: and to effect this, they have made all the means of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a livelyhood, to be taken from them, by the Acts of the Council of State, of the sixth of <hi>November,</hi> 1679, and the 28th. of <hi>Iune,</hi> 1681. 1. They have turn'd out of all Jurisdictions and Seignuries (which are almost infinite in <hi>France</hi>) all Protestants who had been admitted Officers in those Jurisdictions. All Stewards, Bailifss, Sollicitors, Officers of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95734:14"/>
Exchequer, Registers, Notaries, Clerks, Serjeants and Ushers that were Protestants, of all sorts, throughout the whole Kingdom, are cashiered by virtue of these Acts; they have reduc'd to Beggary thousands of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which had no other subsistence, but by these Employments. 2. Look upon those two Pieces, which they procured also, for the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. The Title of the one is, <hi>The Order of the Council Royal of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances (or Treasury) of the</hi> 11<hi>th. of</hi> June, 1680. The other is, <hi>An Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Council of State of the</hi> 17<hi>th. of</hi> August <hi>of the same year.</hi> By the means of these two Pieces, the Jesuites have made the Protestants to be kept out of all the Affairs of the Finances, Customs, which they call <hi>Traites Forains,</hi> of Aids, Gabelles, Taxes of all sorts of Commissions, to which the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> ordered, that they should be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently with the Papists. This second hath taken away the Bread of a vast number of Families more. 3. They every day make the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Captains and Officers (who have serv'd so worthily by Land and Sea) to be turn'd out of their Commands. Those brave Men after they have spent their Estates to advance their Masters Honor, and ventured their Lives a thousand times for his Glory; see themselves shamefully, as so many Cowards, cashiered, without any exception for them who having signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd and distinguish'd themselves by particular Actions, had deserv'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Pensions. Because they will not be less faithful to God, than they have been to their King: they are resolved Disgrace and Beggary shall be the Reward of their Service. By this, they take away from all the Protestant Nobility the means of maintaining themselves in that Rank in which God by their Birth hath placed them. 4. As to the Merchants, look what the Jesuits have thought upon to ruine them. They have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an Order of Council of State, of the 19th. of <hi>November,</hi> 1680, which <hi>grants</hi> to all Protestants who change their Religion, <hi>the term and forbearance of three years for the payment of the principal of their Debts, with prohibition to all their Creditors to bring any Action against them, during that time, upon pain of Non-suit, Noli prosequi, and all Charges, Damages, Costs and Interests.</hi> I perceive very well, (said I to our Friend) that this puts those who revolt in a way to secure and withdraw their Goods; and to enjoy in peace the Fruits of their turning Bankrupts. But I do not see how this tends to the ruine of those Merchants in general, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe in the Protestant Religion. That is (said he, smiling) because you have not so subtle a wit, nor are so quick-sighted as the Jesuits. You know very well that Merchants subsist by their Credit: if their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit be low, they must fall; there is no more trading for them, their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness is done. Now do you not perceive, that the credit of all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Merchants is ruined by this Order, which puts them in a way of turning Bankrupts as they please, with all indemnity; and of inriching themselves with those Goods they have been trusted with? Who do you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95734:15"/>
think after this will be so silly as to take their word? Who can tell, with any certainty, whether they with whom they deal, are persons who will continue in the Protestant Religion? Is there any thing more common than such Changes in Religion now adays? It's enough (said I) I was mistaken, I perceive now very well that the ruine of the Protestant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants is unavoidable. Go on to the other Professions. For I see they are resolved that no Protestant shall get Bread among them. You are in the right (said he) you have seen it in many of them, I'll shew it you now in the rest. 5. All Papists who drive any Trade, or exercise any Art, are forbid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o take any Protestant Apprentice. I have seen the Order, but have it not now by me. By this you see that all young men of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion (who have not means of their own) are reduced to this extremity, either of starving in <hi>France,</hi> or turning Papists, or forsaking that Kingdom. For the same Order forbids any Protestant who drives or professes any Trade, to have under them any Apprenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist or Protestant, that so they may not be able to do work enough to maintain their Families. 6. The Grand Master and Grand <hi>Prêvot</hi> have given notice, by Virtue of Letters under the Signet, to all Protestants who had Privileges, whereby they had right to keep Shops, as Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, Apothecaries, Watchmakers, and other Tradesmen, to forbear using their privileges any longer, and to shut up their Shops, which hath been punctually executed. 7. They have establish'd Societies of Physicians at <hi>Rochelle,</hi> and in other places, where, as I am assured from good hands, there were none ever before. None but Papists will be received into those Societies. By this, the Jesuits have found out the way, at one stroke to hinder the Practice of all the Protestant Physicians; however able and experienc'd they may be. In so much that the Lives of all sick Protestants are by this means put into the hands of their Enemies. 8. In short, there is scarce now any place in all <hi>France</hi> where they may get their livelyhood. They are every where molested and hindered from exercising in quiet any Trade or Art which they have learn'd. To dispatch them quite; they require of them not only that they shall continue to bear all the Burdens of the Government, altho they take from them the means of doing it: but also that they bear double to what they did; that is to say, they use a rigor far greater, than what was practised upon the People of God, when they were commanded to <hi>deliver the same tale of bricks, and yet had not straw given them as formerly.</hi> In effect, at the same time that they will not allow them, of the Protestant Religion, to get a penny: they exact of them to pay the King double, nay, treble, to what they paid before. <hi>Monsieur de Marillac,</hi> Intendant of <hi>Poitou,</hi> hath an Order of Council which gives him alone the Power of the Imposition of the Tax in that great Province. He discharges the Papists, who are at ease, and overcharges the poor Protestants with their proportion, who before
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95734:15"/>
that fainted under their own proper burden; and could bear no more. I will tell you farther on this occasion, that the Jesuits have obtain'd an Order of the King, by which all Protestants who change Religion, are exempted for two years, from all quartering of Soldiers, and all Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of Moneys which are levied on that Account, which also tends to the utter ruine of them who continue firm in the Protestant Religion. For they throw all the burden upon them, of which the others are eas'd. From thence in part it is, that all the Houses of those poor people are filled with Soldiers, who live there as in an Enemy's Country.</p>
               <p>I do not know if the zeal of the Jesuits will rest here: For they want yet the satisfaction of keeping S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Day, as they kept it in the former Age. It is true, what is allowed them is not far from it. For which is the better of the two, to stab with one blow, or to make men die by little and little, of hunger and misery? As to the Blow (said I to our Friend) I do not understand you. Pray, if you please, explain your self, what do you mean by keeping S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Day? <hi>Monsieur de Perisix,</hi> that Archbishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who hath writ the Life of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth (answered he) shall tell you for me.

An execrable Action!

The Jesuits and their Friends set a great value on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the world, because they forbear cutting the Protestants Throats, as they did then. But, <hi>Merciless</hi> as you are, do you ere the less take away their lives! You say you do not kill them, but do you not make them pine to death with hunger and vexation? He who gives slow poison is he less a poisoner, than he who gives what is violent and quick, since both of them destroy the life at last? Pardon this short Transport (said our Friend) in good earnest I cannot restrain my indignation, when I see them use the utmost of cruelty, and yet would be looked on as patterns of all moderation and meekness. Let me impart to you three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which two of our Friends who are yet in <hi>France</hi> have written to me since I came from <hi>Paris.</hi> I received the two first at <hi>Calis,</hi> before I got into the Pacquet Boat; the last was delivered me last night after you went away from any Chamber.

                     <p>WE are just upon the point of seeing that Reformation which hath cost so much labour and pains, and so much blood, come to nothing in <hi>France.</hi> To know the condition of the Protestants in the several Provinces of this Kingdom, you need but read what the first Christians suffered under the Reigns of the Emperors <hi>Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Maximin, Dioclesian</hi> and such like. There are four Troops of Horse in <hi>Poitou</hi> who live at free Quarter, upon all of the Protestant Religion without any exception. When they have pillaged the Houses of them who will not go to Mass, they tie them to their Horse Tails, and drag them thither by force. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant whom they have sent thither, who is their most bitter Enemy, hath his Witnesses ready suborned, who accuse whom they please, of what Crimes they please, and after that cast the poor men into dark Dungeons, beat them with Cudgels, and then pass sentence of death to terrifie them; and afterwards under-hand, send others to try them by fair means, to promise them that their mourning shall be turn'd into joy, if they will but go to Mass. Those whom God gives the grace to resist, die in the Dungeon, through unspeakable anguish. Three Gentlemen of Quality who went about to confirm some of the poor people in their Village, that began to waver, were presently clapt up, Flax put about their Necks, then set on fire, and so they were scorch'd, till they said they would renounce their Religion. There would be no end if I should relate all that is done. This you may be assured of, that the People of <hi>Israel</hi> were never so oppress'd by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> as the Protestants are by their own Country-men.</p>

I say they, the Protestants: For none but they must quarter any of them. <hi>Monsieur de Marillac</hi> gives himself up wholly to the making of Proselytes. The

Deputies of <hi>Poitiers</hi> are now here to make complaint of the violences they still labour under. They offer, by a Petition which they have presented, at the cost of their lives, if they are found guilty of any Falshood, or if they do not make out what they say. They set forth, that by the Orders of <hi>Monsieur Marillac,</hi> the Protestant are dealt with as declared Enemies; that their Goods and their Houses are plundered; their persons assaulted; that the Soldiers are employed as Executioners of these Outrages. That they are quartered upon the Protestants only, that besides the excessive expence they put them to, they exact money of them with dreadful Oaths and Execrations. They knock them down, they drag Women by the hair of the Head, and Ropes about their Necks, they have put them to the torture with Screws, by clapping their Fingers into a Vice, and so squeezing them by degrees, they have bound aged Men, eighty years old, and beaten them, and have misused, before their Eyes, their Children, who came to comfort them: They hinder Handicrafts men from working; they take from Labourers what they use for their Livelyhood; they set their Goods openly to sale, and they clap their Swords and Pistols to their Breasts, who are not frighted with their other Usa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: they drag them in Sheets into their Churches, they throw Holy Water in their Faces, and then say they are Catholicks, and shall be proceeded against as Relapsed, if they live otherwise. It is not permitted to these miserable persons to complain; those who would have attempted it have been seised on, and the Prisons are full of them. They are detained there without any Process being made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and even without so much as having their Names en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Iayl-Books.

This is the Letter, dated the last of <hi>August,</hi> Old Style. I am now going out of <hi>Aulnix,</hi> where I meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Objects of Compassion. The Intendant of <hi>Rochefort,</hi> which is <hi>Monsieur Du Muins,</hi> lays all waste there. It is the same person concerning whom at the <hi>Marquis de Segnelay</hi>'s we were told so many pleasant Stories last Winter at <hi>S. Germain.</hi> Do not you remember that they talked much of a certain <hi>Picard,</hi> who owed all his Fortune to his Wife, and whom the <hi>Marquis de Segnelay</hi> treats always as the worst of men? That's the Man, he is born to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief as much as ever man was, and his Employment hath increas'd bis insolence beyond measure. To this he hath added, to the Protestants grief, all the barbarous zeal of Ignorance. And if the King would let him do it, he would soon act over again the Tragedy of S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew.</hi> About ten days since he went to a great Town in <hi>Aunix,</hi> called <hi>Surgeres,</hi> accompanied with his Provost, and about forty Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. He began his Feats with a Proclamation that all the Huguenots should change their Religion, and upon their refusal he quartered his Troop upon those poor people: he made them to live there at discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in an Enemies Country; he made their Goods to be thrown into the Streets, and their Beds under the Horses Feet. By his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Vessels of Wine and Brandy were staved, and their Horse Heels wash'd with it; their Corn was sold, or rather given away, for a fourth part of what it was worth, and the same was done to all the Tradesmens Goods: Men, Women and Children were put to the Torture, were dragged by force to the Popish Churches; and so great Cruelty was used towards them that the greatest part not being able longer to indure the extremity of the pain, renounced their Religion. By the same means they forced them to give it under their hands, That they had abjured without constraint, and of their own free choice. The Goods of those who found means to escape, are sentenced to be sold, and to be pillaged.

he commands them all to change their Religion in five days. This was done by sound of Trumpet, that no one might pretend igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The Term expires to morrow. After this he marched to <hi>Moze</hi> (it is another great Town in <hi>Aunix</hi>) where there is a very fair Church of the Protestants, and a very able Minister, there he set out the same Prohibitions, and the same Commands that he had at <hi>Rochefort.</hi> Upon this a very worthy person of the place, and Elder of the Church, named Mr. <hi>Jarry,</hi> addressed to him with a most humble Remonstrance; and this cruel and barbarous man made him presently to be clapt up in Irons.

                  <hi>Sir, with so much success to bring the Hereticks into the bosom of the Church, are becoming the Bounty and Goodness of your Majesty, and conformable at the same time to the mind of the divine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, who always retains Bowels of Mercy for these strayed Sheep: he wills, that they should be brought back, and not hunted away, because he desires their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and regrets their loss. How far is this conduct from the rigor wherewith the Catholicks are treated in those Neighbouring Kingdoms which are infected with Heresie. Your Majesty makes it appear, what difference there is between Reason and Passion, between the Meekness of Truth, and the Rage of</hi> Imposture, <hi>between the Zeal of the House of God, and the Fury of</hi> Babylon. In good truth, cryed I to our Friend, after the reading of this passage: this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable, and I cannot forbear taking my turn to be a little in passion. Methinks they should blush to death, who call those Cruelties, which have been executed upon innocent Sheep, Meekness; and that Rigor, and <hi>the fury</hi> of <hi>Babylon</hi> which we have inflicted upon Tigers, who thirsted after our Blood, and had sworn the destruction of Church and State. They plague and torment to death more than a million of peaceable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who desire only the freedom of serving God according to his Word, and the Laws of the Land, who cannot be accused of the least shadow of Conspiracy, and who by preserving that Illustrious Blood which now reigns there, have done to <hi>France</hi> Services deserv'd, together with the Edict of Pacification, the love, and the hearty thanks of all true <hi>French</hi> Men. And we have put to death in a legal manner, it may be twenty wretched persons (the most of which had forfeited their lives to the Law, for being found here) convinced by divers Witnesses, who were the greatest part Papists, of having attempted against the Sacred Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

said our Friend to me, I must needs interrupt you; to bring you back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to our poor Protestants. What say you to their Condition? I say (answered I) that there can be nothing more worthy compassion; and that we must entirely forget all that we owe to the Communion of Saints, if we open not our hearts, and receive them as our true Brethren. I will be sure to publish in all places what you have informed me, and will stir up all persons to express in their favour all the Duties of Hospitality and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Charity. To the end (said he to me) you may do it with a better heart, at our next meeting, I will fully justifie them against all those malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reports which are given out against their Loyalty and their Obedience to the Higher Powers. Let us take for that all to morrow seven-night, As you please, said I, so we took leave one of another: and thus you have an end of a long Letter, assuring you, that I ever shall be, Sir, Yours.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ince you know the reason why this my third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter comes so late, I will not take up your time in excusing my long silence. Our Friend being now recovered from his Indisposition, which was the main stop hitherto, we agreed upon a day, when I came to his Chamber at the hour appointed. I cannot tell, sais he, whether, before we enter upon this matter, to justifie our French Protestants in point of Fidelity towards their Superiours, I should not impart to you several Letters, which have since come to my hands, wherein I have an account of several fresh Persecutions since <hi>August</hi> last. I told him, No: For besides that what you related to me at our second meeting is more than enough to convince the greatest Infidel, That the Mischiefs are at the height in that Kingdom, and that there is no security of Conscience for the Protestants who stay there; besides all this, our Streets are full of instances of the new troubles they give them. There is no Man but knows what was the event of the Marquiss <hi>de Venour</hi>'s Deputation, wherein he gave a List of the cruelties used in <hi>Poictou</hi> against our poor Protestants: He was forced to fly from his Estate and Country. Every body has heard how many Gentlemen of good condition, and several Ministers, have been imprisoned for no other fault but their zeal for a Religion they believe to be the only true and safe one, the exercise of which is likewise tolerated by one of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, as you have already so well made out. In short, we are assured by a thousand credible Witnesses, as likewise by the sight of several Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95734:20"/>
That they ruine all the Protestants that are Taxable in <hi>France,</hi> by a Secret they have found out to Tax the people at Will, and then make one or more responsible for all the rest; That they are barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously cruel upon the least complaint of any thing, that falls from them in the height of their misfortunes; That they Demolish their best Established Temples, upon the least pretence; and that besides all this, they condemn them to the Galleys, if they offer to quit the Realm, to serve God according to a good Conscience in any other Countrey, with a Fine of a thousand Crowns for the first Fault, and Corporal Punishment for the rest, upon their Friends that shall any way coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, directly or indirectly, their departure out of the Realm. I have read the Proclamation, and you may read it, says our Friend, when you please, for it lies there upon my Table. The strangest thing in it is, that they glory of their pretended Conversions in <hi>Poitou</hi> and elsewhere, as if they had been carried on with all the gentleness and Christian temper imaginable, when all <hi>Europe</hi> knows they have used no other but carnal means, and since I am provoked to say it, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Weapons, the allurement of Riches, Promises of worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, Threats, Force, and a thousand unheard of Cruelties, whereby they have brought the poor People to this hard choice, either to turn Papist, or perish by Hunger and ill usage. And many times we see their Consciences will not suffer them to continue in that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they have been thus forced into; for they come over by Flocks, and the Prisons in <hi>France</hi> are full of these pretended Relaps. But because you know all this already, I proceed now, says he, to the Justification of our poor persecuted Brethren.</p>
               <p>I am very well satisfied that this groundless Accusation, as if they were Seditious Firebrands, and Enemies to Monarchs and Monarchy, has given them no prejudice with you. If Accusation were enough to render guilty of this Crime, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> the old and new people of God had certainly lost their Cause. The Enemy of Truth has ever made this his Charge against the Innocence of Gods Children. <hi>Moses</hi> was accused for <hi>Seducing the people</hi>;<note place="margin">

You see there, how the most innocent of the Primitive Christians, and the meekest of Men, were charged with the same Crime. Our Protestants of <hi>France</hi> have no reason to expect other measure than that of their Saviour and the Saints departed, since it is the same Religion they strive
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95734:20"/>
for: And by the Grace of God we shall with as much ease acquit them of all those Imputations laid to their charge.</p>
               <p>There is certainly no stronger Proof of what the Opinions of a Church are, than the publick Declarations her self has made of her Principles, by open Professions or Confessions of Faith; these are authentick pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, composed with the approbation of the whole Body, and published on purpose to declare to the World what in sincerity such a Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in matters of Religion. The Protestant Church of <hi>France</hi> has not been wanting in this particular, but has composed and published a Confession of Faith that all the World might be sure what really are her thoughts and belief: And certainly, without the highest injustice, we cannot reject what she has thus made Protestation of. Then I told our Friend, you need not enlarge upon this point, for no Man of sense will dispute this Principle with you. Let us come to the Question. I shall soon dispatch it, says he; I will read to you the two last Articles of our Protestants Confession of Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>We believe, That God will have the World governed by Laws and Policies,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 39.</note> to the end there may be a restraint upon the inordinate Appetites of Men; and for this end, that he has appointed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Commonwealths, and all other sorts of Government, Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary or otherwise, and whatever appertains to the dispensation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and that he himself will be acknowledged the Author of it. For this cause he has put the Sword in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o the Magistrates Hand, to punish Faults committed, not only against the second Table, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise against the first. We ought therefore, for God's sake, not only to submit to the Government of Superiors, but also to honour them, and hold them in such regard, as esteeming them his Lieutenants and Officers, whom he has constituted to exercise a Lawful and Sacred Trust.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>We hold it therefore our Duty to obey their Laws and Statutes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Art.</hi> 40</note> to pay Tributes, Imposts, and other Duties, and to bear the Yoke of Subjection with a cheerful and good will, be they Infidels, provided the Sovereign Empire of God be kept entire. Thus we detest those that would reject Authority, put all things in common, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the course of Justice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here you see the Confession of the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> where you find they make it a part of their Religion and Faith to believe that it is God who appoints Kingdoms, Hereditary, and others; That we ought to Honour Princes, and hold them in all Reverence, as the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants and Officers of God, to obey them, to pay them Tribute, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to them with a good will, though they happen to be of another Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than ours; and they reject with horror all those that reject the Powers. Can any thing be said stronger, or with greater exactness?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95734:21"/>Moreover these Protestants of <hi>France</hi> have a Liturgy, a Form of Common-Prayers, as well as our Church of <hi>England,</hi> There it is that in the presence of God, and speaking to God, they do confirm by a publick Act of Worship all that they say of Kings and Potentates in their Confession of Faith. After they have said to God, <hi>We have thy Precept to pray for those whom thou hast set over us, Superiors and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,</hi> they add, <hi>We Beseech thee therefore, O heavenly Father, for all Kings and Princes, thy Servants, to whom thou hast committed the dispensation of Iustice, and particularly for the King,</hi> &amp;c. If ever we ought to believe Mens words, no doubt it is when they speak to God in the Act and fervor of their Devotion: If a man be not wicked to the last degree, or an Athiest, he will then at least speak the thoughts of his Heart. And upon such an account it is that the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> own, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to their Confession of Faith, That it is God who <hi>has set Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over them,</hi> to Govern; That <hi>all Princes</hi> are the Servants of God; That the Justice they dispence to men, is that of God himself, of which God has committed to them the Administration or Rule. And upon that score it is they pray to God for their own King, and for all other Princes, That he would give them his holy Spirit, and all Graces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to well Governing. Is this the stile of a seditious People, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to Monarchs and Monarchy?</p>
               <p>Since therefore the Confession of Faith, and form of Common-Prayer, speaks the mind of the whole Body of the French Protestants, it will be needless to quote the Sermons and Writings of their particular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; yet because I observe, to my great grief, there are many here cry down the incomparable <hi>Calvin,</hi> as if, in this point of obedience to Monarchs, he were not very sound, I must needs read to you what he has said upon that subject in his excellent Institution: It is in his fourth Book, Chap. 20. where, after he has shewed, Sect. 22 &amp; 23 of this Chapter, the Duty of Subjects towards Princes and Magistrates, which he makes consist in having a profound Reverence for them, to observe their Commands with a perfect submission, to pay such Taxes and Rates as they put upon them, to offer up Prayers and Thansgivings to God for their Prosperity; and when he has there proved by Scripture, <hi>That we cannot resist the Magistrate without resisting God,</hi> who is prepared to defend them, he considers, <hi>Sect.</hi> 24. That there are many who fancy we owe not this respect and obedience, but to good Princes, and so may despise the wicked, and shake off the yoke of Tyrants. This Maxim he confutes, as a most pernicious error, in the following Sections, of which I shall here give you a taste.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:95734:21"/>
                  <q>The Word of God obliges us to submit, not only to the authority of Princes that use us well, but in general to the Dominion of all those, after whatever fashion, that exercise Sovereign Power, though they perform nothing less than the Duty of a Prince. For however the Lord assures us, that Magistrates are the Bounty of his Grace, set up for the conservation of Men, and that therefore he sets them bounds, within which they ought to keep, yet he declares at the same time, that whatever they prove, they hold their Power of him; that they who seek the publick good in their Sovereign Administration, are the lively Images of his Goodness; that they which rule with violence and oppression, were raised by him to the Throne for a Scourge to a sinful people; but that the one and the other are equally invested with that Sacredness of Majesty which he has stamped upon the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of all lawful Authorities. I shall insist upon this point, which the Spirit of the Multitude does not so easily conceive, to wit, that this admirable and Divine Authority, that the Lord by his Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon the Ministers of his Justice, remains no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

First, I would have it carefully observed, the special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God in bestowing Crowns, and setting up Kings, of which we are so often told in Scripture. <hi>It is God,</hi> says <hi>Daniel, that remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Kings, and setteth up Kings.</hi>

                     <hi>Samuel,</hi> telling the People of <hi>Israel</hi> what they were to suffer from their Kings, uses these words, <hi>This will be the manner or Right of the King that shall Reign over you; He will take your Sons, and will appoint them for himself, for his Chariots, and to be his Horse-men, and some shall run before his Chariots.</hi>

And he will take the tenth of your Seed, and of your Vineyards, and give to his Officers, and to his Servants. And he will take your Men-servants and your Maid-servants, and your goodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Young-men, and your Asses and put them to his Work. He will take the tenth of your Sheep, and ye shall be his Servants.</hi> Doubtless Kings have no Right to deal thus, those that the Law so carefully directs to Moderation and Temperance: But <hi>Samuel</hi> calls this <hi>the Right of the King</hi> over the People, because the People are under an indispensable Obligation to submit, and are not allowed to resist, as if the Prophet had explain'd himself after this manner, The mismanagement of Kings shall come to this height, and you shall have no right to oppose it, your part must be to take their Commands, and to obey them.</q>

                  <hi>Calvin,</hi> after this, produces a long passage out of <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> where great punishments are denounced against all those that would not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Government of <hi>Nebuch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And he concludes, that we ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject these seditious thoughts, <q>That a King ought to be handled as he deserves, and that there is no reason we should behave our selves as Subjects towards him, if he carries not himself like a King towards us.</q> After which, he most substantially answers the Objections which unquiet Spirits are used to make against this Doctrine. And now I leave it to reasonable Men to judge, whether it be not the greatest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice to this excellent Person, to declare to the World, That he was an Enemy to Kings.</p>
               <p>They that followed him, have after his example, all taken the same side upon this subject.

of a few Pages, the strongest things that can be said. The force of all this, is, that the performance of these Protestants has exactly answered their Confession of Faith, the Prayers of their Liturgy, and what their Doctors have taught, as often as there was occasion for it.

Whereas if there had been any pretence for Assassinates, it should have been the Hereticks that should have procured it and seen it done, because he had quitted and forsaken them, and they had reason to apprehend him: And yet they have attempted no such thing either against Him, or any of the five Kings his Predecessors, whatever slaughter their Majesties made amongst them.</q> You have here at once an authentick Witness of the exact Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> to their Soveraign, how viol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>However, said I to our Friend, do not conclude before you have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Subjects from that suspicion, which the proceedings of the present King of <hi>France</hi> has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And yet, which is the prodigious part of the History of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, there is nothing more certain, than that these very Protestants, to whom they have done so much mischief, have always ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served exactly their duty towards their King. One may safely say, by their behaviour, they have loved him as their Eyes: Their Loyalty has been yearly tryed, during the minority of this King. All the World knows it: neither could any thing ever corrupt or shake it. By their Care and Address, all the Towns, where they had any Interest at that time, as <hi>Montauban, Nimes, Rochel,</hi> declared for their King, and disposed not only the Provinces that belonged to them, but those adjoyning likewise. God knows what had become then of the Crown, had it not been for the warm Sermons of those Ministers, whose mouths are now stopt, and the courage of those very Protestants they now persecute with so much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Whil'st the Popish Prelates and great Lords drank publickly the health of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fifteenth, these poor persecuted People were with Sword in hand exposing themselves to the utmost dangers to preserve the Kingdom to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth. It is matter of Fact, which the King knows. He has born them witness more than once, that their Loyalty upon this account, had contributed in the highest degree to the security of his Crown.

               <p>After all this, to persecute them as they do, and proclaim them to be Firebrands and disturbers of the publick peace, Enemies of Monarchs and Monarchy; is it not to punish those that deserve Reward? Is it not by a shameful aspersion, no less ridiculous than fowl, to contrive the oppression of persecuted Innocence?

               <p>First, they accuse them for concealing dangerous poison under these words, in their Confession of Faith, <hi>So long as the Sovereign Power of God be kept inviolable.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>That is a Gloss, replies our Friend, that spoils the Text, and a new aspersion, these Protestants have given no ground for: Nay they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw, and have confuted it before-hand, in resolving, as they have done, <hi>That Subjects ought to bear the Yoak of their Subjection with a cheerful and good Will, though their Princes were Infidels.</hi> For this plainly intimates, That although our Kings were Enemies to our Religion, we are always obliged to submit to their Orders. And if you would know what then is the meaning of this exception, <hi>Provided the Sovereign Power of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inviolable,</hi> I answer, it means no more than what St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi> intended when they said to the great Council of the Jews, <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye:</q>

the Soveraignty of God be kept inviolable,</hi> that is, to the end we dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish not the Soveraign power of God, but that God be always owned for the King of all Kings: it is absolutely necessary, that in such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety between his orders and that of the Prince, we prefer his without any manner of hesitation. To do otherwise, would be to place the Prince in God's stead, and so make an Idol of him. This is all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants would say.</p>
               <p>But then I asked our Friend, what would they have the Subjects do upon such occasions, especially if Princes proceed to violence and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thereby to make themselves be obeyed with preference to God? Methinks, says he, they explain themselves clearly enough, when they say, <hi>We ought to bear the yoke of subjection with a chearful and good will, though our Princes were Infidels.</hi> For an Infidel Prince signifies here, a Prince that in his Laws and in his practice is opposite to the appointments of God: is an ene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To say then, as do the Protestants in their Confession of Faith, that <hi>although Princes were Infidels, we ought to bear the yoke of subjection</hi>: is it not to declare it to be the duty of subjects to suffer quietly whatever their Prince pleases to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict upon them? Indeed they do not mean, that we should exec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere to them. Whence it is plain from the Doctrine of the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, that Christian Subjects upon these unhappy occasions, ought to continue alike faithful to their God and to their Prince: to their God, in being careful to observe his Statutes in the midst of all the threats and outrages of men: to their Prince, by suffering with all humility and Christian patience, whatever is imposed upon them, either to torture their Conscience, or force them to renounce their holy Religion. Their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Calvin</hi> makes it evident, that this was his opinion, when from what the Scripture ordains, <hi>to honor and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore when <hi>Calvin</hi> teaches, that Christians ought to pay respect, even in the person of these sort of Princes, <hi>this mighty Character with which it hath pleased God to honor Kings</hi>: it shews plainly, that in his judgment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever wrong or oppression a Prince commits upon his Subjects, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main always under an indispensible obligation of being subject to his Scepter, so far from ever having a right to take up Arms to depose him, or to set force against force.

                  <q>He had no sooner done speaking (says this Popish Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian) but the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> seeming not to take it to himself, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed to him, and told him, That it was not to be endured so foul a Charge should be laid upon so great a Prince, and offered to be his Second, if there could be any so audacious as to maintain these false Accusations.</q>

                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95734:31"/>It appears by what Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> sets down and asserts, That the design of that business of <hi>Amboise</hi> was only <hi>to seize the Duke of</hi> Guise <hi>and the Cardinal of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>to bring them to their Tryal</hi>; That it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved at the undertaking of this business, <hi>That they would attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against the King, the Royal Family, or the State</hi>; That indeed the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> did not attempt any thing <hi>against the Kings Majesty or State</hi> in this <hi>business of</hi> Amboise. When therefore Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> so shamefully contradicting himself, dares say in another place, <hi>That you shall hardly meet with a more desperate Conspiracy than that of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots against their King in the business of</hi> Amboise:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 501.</note> What can he pass for less, in the sense of all honest men, than an infamous Libeller? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the testimony of his own conscience, against what himself had writ and avowed, does he lay a heavy accusation upon the Innocent; and all this in hopes to <hi>afflict the afflicted,</hi> and to shut up the Bowels of their Brethren in Foreign Parts, from taking compassion of the poor French Protestants, who are so terribly persecuted in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. He would make all the World jealous of them, that they might no where find reception, but be reduced, wherever they go, to dye with Hunger and Affliction. You see what a worthy Wight this Author proves, that they make such a do about amongst Persons of Quality, to prejudice them against their poor Brethren. For we must not think that the argument he makes in his Recital, to perswade us, That to attack the <hi>Guises</hi> was to fall upon the King, can excuse him from contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and calumny in this particular. They are not groundless proofs that will justifie an accusation of this weight, especially when it has been acknowledged that the persons accused designed neither against King nor State, but only against the <hi>Guises.</hi>

These Usurpers had laid their business so well, and were become so absolute Masters of the Person, the Mind, the Authority, and the whole Power of the young King, that it was impossible to carry any Address to the King, unless by their means: and to do any thing against them to bring them to Justice, but, as one may say, in the Kings presence, who was continually in their hands; and by consequence, to redress a mischief that so absolutely required a remedy, without resolving upon some great and extraordinary attempt. Either therefore the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> must have done what he did, or else have suffered the Throne to be usurped, and the Royal Family sacrificed, contrary to that duty he owed to <hi>France,</hi> to his King, to Himself, and to his whole Race.

They built another Citadel at <hi>Lyons</hi> in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>Huguenot</hi> party, who were yet the strongest in that place, and they ordered the slighting of those new Fortifications in the places they held during the War. They forbid the exercise of their pretended Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ten Leagues round such places as the Court should pass, though it was allowed by the Edict in certain Towns within that compass, which they interpreted to be when the King was not there, or within ten Leagues. They made a new Edict at <hi>Rouseillon,</hi> the <hi>Counte de Tournons</hi> house, by which they were forbidden, upon pain of death, to hold any meeting but in the presence of Officers appointed by His Majesty to attend there.

to Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> it is <hi>no ways to act directly against the Edict of Peace,</hi> to hinder the Exercise of the Protestant Religion <hi>in several Towns where it was permitted by the Edict,</hi> to impose conditions upon Protestant Congregations, enough to disturb that peace and repose the Edict had promised them; to deprive many of them of that freedom of Conscience the same Edict allowed them.

But his zeal was not displeasing to the Catholicks: besides, that regard was to be had to his Quality, and to so many Great Men that were engaged in this Affair: Which is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the King, to stop the <hi>Huguenots</hi> mouths, owns by a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that this Count and his Complices had done, as having had his Order for it.</q> This is that which Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> calls, <hi>To do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing directly against the Edict of Peace.</hi> It is fit you should know what the same <hi>Mezeray</hi> relates concerning the Conferences of the Queen at <hi>Bayonne</hi> with the Duke <hi>d' Alva,</hi>

The <hi>Huguenots</hi> believed, the Duke <hi>d'Alva</hi> had advised the Queen to invite them to some great Assembly, and so to rid herself of them without mercy: that he had let fall these words, <hi>That a Ioal of Salmon was better worth, then all the Frogs of a Marsh</hi>: that from the time of the Assembly of <hi>Moulins,</hi> the Queen had executed this Design, had things happened as she expected.</q> St. <hi>Bartholomews</hi> day does not a little confirm this mistrust of the <hi>Huguenots.</hi> But you shall hear what it was made the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> take those Resolutions Monsieur <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> so exclaims against.<note place="margin">

                  <q>The intention of destroying the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> was, evident, because they daily retrenched them of that liberty, which was given them by the Edicts, so that they had in a manner brought

it to nothing: The people fell upon them in those places, where they were the weaker party; where they were able to maintain their Ground, the Governor made use of the Kings Authority to oppress them; they dismantled those Towns that had shewed them any favour; they built Citadels in the same places; no Justice was to be obtained for them, either in Parliament or Council; they murdered them without restrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t, neither were they restored to their Estates or Offices. These complaints were brought two or three times to the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> and to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny, who at two meetings, had given this Answer both times, <hi>That thoy ought to endure all patiently, rather than to take up arms.</hi> But when one of the chief Men at Court, had given them certain notice that they were resolved to seize the Prince and the Admiral, to confine the first to perpetual Imprisonment, and bring the other to the Block: <hi>Dandelot</hi>'s advice, who was bolder than the rest, put them upon a resolution, not only of defending themselves, but likewise to attack their Enemies by open force; and for this end, to drive the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> from the King's presence, and cut off the <hi>Suisses.</hi>
                  </q> They were six thousand <hi>Suisses</hi> they had raised, under pretence of hindring the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi>'s passage, but indeed to destroy the Protestants, as Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> himself sufficiently hints,<note place="margin">

                  <q>The Prince was always in hopes, that the Queen would have procured for him to be Lieutenant General over the whole Kingdom: That she had promised to bring him to the point he aimed at, when the Treaty of <hi>Orleans</hi> was made. Tho she was no ways inclined to put so great a charge in his hands, but said it only to fool him. She was resolved to set the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> upon him, who was the dearest to her of all her children: And she instructed him so well, that when the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> came some days to the Queens Supper, Monsieur, who watched for an opportunity to affront him, took him aside to a corner of the Reom, where he treated him in a strange manner, so far as to tell him in a threatning way, laying his hand upon his Sword, That if ever he thought of this place, contrary to that respect he ow'd him, that he would make him repent it, and make him as inconsiderable as he aspired to be great. After this, the Prince touched to the quick,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 364.</note> disputed no farther with himself what party to take, though he concealed his resentment at that time, to make his Revenge the surer, of which from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95734:36"/>
that moment he laid the design. And this was the true cause of the second Troubles, which he cloaked with the pretence of Religion; which had the least share, if any at all, in that violent resolution which he took, and in that unhappy and abominable attempt at <hi>Meaux.</hi> Indeed he had already had two Meetings with the <hi>Colignies</hi> &amp; chief of his Friends, one at <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and the other at <hi>Valery,</hi> where nothing was as yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon. But presently after Monsieur had used him thus, and that he found himself thus tricked by the Queen, and all his credit at the Court lost, he went, and had a third at <hi>Chastillon:</hi> And there it was, that without discovering any thing more, than what had been said in the two former about the Ligue, which they said was made to oppress and ruine their Religion; they resolved to take Arms, not only to defend themselves, but likewise to assault, and to cut in pieces the <hi>Suisses</hi> which the King had caused to be raised, and to make themselves Masters of the whole Kingdom, by seizing upon the Sacred Person of the King, the Princes his Brothers, and the Queen.</q> Really this is intolerable. I could never have thought so private a Person, as Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg,</hi> could have dared to blast by so impudently false a story, the memory of so great a Prince, in the face of his Highness the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> now living, who no doubt shares in so foul a Disgrace cast upon one of the most renowned of his Ancestors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Mezeray</hi> gives Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> quite another reason of the second Troubles: and to find out those that were the cause of them, there was no need that he should go to make of one of the sincerest Princes the World ever had, a Hypocrite and a wicked Person that made a stale of Religion, using it for a cover to his pernicious Designs, and to a mad unbridled Ambition and Revenge. <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> says <hi>Mezeray,</hi>

In short, the learned President <hi>de Thou,</hi> whom he quotes some times in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, could have informed him of all that was needful to hinder him for ever doing so cruel an injustice to so excellent a Prince. For he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95734:36"/>
tells us in the beginning of his 42 Book, <q>That the Protestants met one and another time with the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> the Admiral, and <hi>d' Andelot,</hi> at <hi>Valery</hi> first, and afterwards at <hi>Chastillon</hi> upon <hi>Loin</hi>; That after having well discussed the matter <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> they at last una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously agree to try all means before they came to the last Remedy, that is, to take Arms: But that after this, Provocations growing high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, especially by reason of the Suisses, which the King would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss, though he was entreated to do it, and that the Duke <hi>d' Alva</hi> was now entred into the Low-Countries. There came Letters from one of the great Lords at Court, who was a Friend to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, by which the Prince was advised, that it was determined in a private Councel that they intended to seize upon him and the Admiral, to cramp the one in Prison, and cut off the others head: that at the same time they would put two thousand <hi>Swisses</hi> into <hi>Paris,</hi> two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand into <hi>Orleans,</hi> and as many into <hi>Poictiers</hi>: that then they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal the Edict, and set out others for the extirpation of the Protestants.</q> For that reason it was, according to Monsieur <hi>de Thou,</hi> that they came to a resolution: and not as Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> reproaches them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proof or ground, <hi>that they might seize the Sacred Person of the King,</hi>

And considering the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that has always been against the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> they would in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, have kept some of this Coyn very carefully, to have stopt their mouths, as often as they should reproach the Papists with the several at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts they had made against Kings. However it be, if the Story be true, they that caused such money to be coyned, are wicked Wretches, and have most insolently transgressed the 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Articles of the Confession of Faith made by the Reformed Church of <hi>France</hi>: So that the true French Protestants, are so far from owning them for their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that they detest them as utter Enemies to their holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

It is therefore an idle thing to reproach us with the Extravagancies and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises of such men. We have nothing to do with them. And if the Prince of <hi>Condè,</hi> was no otherwise a Protestant, than as Monsieur <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> would maliciously insinuate, if under a false pretence of Religion, to deceive a simple people that put great confidence in him, he concealed a Criminal Revenge and Ambition: the honest <hi>Huguenots</hi> disown him; and it would be an unconscionable thing to make them guilty of what this Prince had committed, when at the same time he must have declared himself an enemy to their Religion, by having violated, after such a manner, their Confession of Faith in so essential a Point.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95734:39"/>
a cruel Affront upon him, which touched him to the quick. Besides, the Prince knew upon very good grounds, that his enemies were about to seize his Person a second time: It is true, they talked only of shutting him up in Prison during life: But he could not forget, that they were not men to be satisfied with so little, when once they had got him in their hands. For when he was first in Prison, they condemned him to lose his Head by the hand of the common Executioner: And then, it was manifest, they designed the death of the Admiral, his great Friend, and of a Million of innocent Persons more. Suppose it therefore to be true, that at the sight of death, and of so many Injuries and so great a spilling of Blood, the Prince's head was a little turned, and that being intent upon saving his own Life and Honor, and the Lives and Honor of so many brave Men as were engaged with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he forgot that he could not, without a want of respect to his King, attack his Ministers, how wicked or injust soever they might be; supposing this to be true, ought he to be used after that insolent manner, as Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> treats him? Is he the only Hero, the only true Christian, that has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his Infirmity under so heavy a Temptation? And when is it, that a Fault is most excusable, if it be not, when a Man is hurryed away by such violent storms?</p>

The Prince by his Birth, and the great Concern that engaged him in, was under a particular Obligation to watch for the preservation of the Crown and the Blood Royal: all the World must grant it. It is most certain, that the Princes of the House of <hi>Lorrain</hi> aimed at the Crown, under a pretence that it belonged to them as the lawful Successors of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> and that they only waited a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to possess themselves of it. Experience shews plainly that he was not deceived, when <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, to escape the ambitious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> Nephew to the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> was forced to run from his Palace and his capital City, where the Duke had made every body against him, and where they <hi>shewed the Suissers with which they intended to make him a Monks crown,</hi>

The Prince knows moreover, that the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> to compass his wicked Design, was resolved to rid himself of all the Princes of the Blood, whatever it cost him. They had thoughts of stealing away the Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> and her Son, the first Prince of the Blood, to destroy them in a most cruel and shameful manner, by putting them into the <hi>Spanish Inquisition.</hi> They had raised Six thousand <hi>Suisses</hi> to seize his Person, put the Admiral to death, and to root out all the Protestants, that is, the main Supporters of the Rights of <hi>Hugh Capet</hi>'s true Line, against the false pretences of the Mock-posterity of <hi>Charlemain.</hi> The Prince, who sees and knows all this, is he not obliged to set himself

with all his might against this Bloody Conspiracy of Strangers, who are about to shed the Noblest Blood of <hi>France,</hi> to supplant the Heirs of the Family, and usurp their Place? There is no question of it. But things were come to such a pass, that the Prince could no longer set himself ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually against the wicked purposes of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon methods of Remonstrances and Petitions to his Majesty, and by the course of Justice either in Council or Parliament: For the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and his party, swayed all in the Parliament and Council: They had all the power at Court: There was no coming to the King, but by them: They were so got into this young Prince, who was, at the most, but sixteen years of age, that he would hear nothing but what these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple told him, and blindly took their advice in every thing. It was then absolutely necessary, either that the Prince, against his duty of Prince of the Blood and a faithful Subject, should suffer all the Royal Blood to be spilt, with that of all true French men, and that the Crown should be usurped by Strangers: or else that he should do something extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and put Himself in a posture to overcome all the difficulties, which hindred him from undeceiving the King, making him to understand who were his real enemies, and bringing them to condign punishment: which could never be done, without the assistance at least of several of his Friends, and cutting off the six thousand <hi>Swisses,</hi> who were to seize his Person and ruine all the honest party; unless, in short, he would become a prey to the Cardinal, when he should present himself before the King to request Justice. I must confess, the Protestant, that is, the Christian Religion, never allows a Subject to take up Arms against his Soveraign, upon any pretence whatever. But a Prince of the Blood does not take up Arms against his Soveraign, when he takes them up to no other end, but to hinder Strangers from laying hands upon the Crown, and changing the Succession. It is true indeed, that these Strangers, taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth his tender years, were predominant in his Court, and that it is an odd sort of a way for a Subject to come armed before his King, and to seize upon his chief Ministers before his face, and as it were tea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I do not think any one will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute it in earnest but that to suffer a Kingdom to be taken from its lawful Heirs, and all the Royal Family to be oppressed by Tyrants, who have ingrossed their King for no other end, but to destroy him, is an evil infinitely greater, than to come short, for some little time, of the Laws of good manners, till the King and Kingdom were safe. There are none, but such as would be glad to have the way left open, either to invade the Throne or Royal Authority, whereby to work the overthrow of the State; I say, there are none, but the ambitious and common Pests, that have the impudence to perswade the King, that to fail in these rules

of Good manners, when it is upon the utmost necessity, and in prospect to save the Crown, is to give a mischievous example, and encourage Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. Extraordinary actions upon absolute necessity, as this attempt of the Prince, never ought to be drawn into example for ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, which should always be directed by the Laws and Customs of the Country. Had the business succeeded, it had been easie for the Prince and his Friends to have excused to the King this indecent Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and justified by the event of the sincerity of their Intentions, in the same manner as by the event it proved, that when <hi>Charles</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, whil'st he was <hi>Dauphin</hi> took up Arms, it was neither against the King his Father, nor against the Kingdom: which was the Example that was brought to resolve the scruples of some of the Prince's Friends, who were afraid of the odious Reflections which might be made upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at <hi>Meaux,</hi> how necessary or innocent soever it might be in it self. And Monsieur <hi>de Thou,</hi> who gives us an account of this particular, tells us likewise, that the design the Prince and his Friends had in arming themselves, was to drive from the Helm the Enemies of the publick Peace, to undeceive the young King, and to settle all things quiet in his Kingdom.

Wherefore wholly changing his mind, he appointed the Tuesday following to appear himself in Parliament, where he declared, the same which he likewise caused to be writ to all the Governors, that

this Massacre was committed by his Order, though to his great grief, for prevention of a Hellish Conspiracy, which the Admiral with the <hi>Huguenots</hi> had entred into against his Person, and against all the Princes of the Blood, thereby to possess himself of the Soveraign Power and of the Regality, when they should at one blow have destroyed all the Royal Line.

               <p>What do you think, says our Friend, after he had read all this long story out of Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi>; what do you think of the enemies of the French Protestants, and their dealings? I assured him, I was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly surprised: and that out of respect to the quality of those that acted, I durst not tell him all I thought. But I heartily thank Monsieur <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> for letting the World know, that this pretended <hi>hellish Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy,</hi> charged upon the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> to take away their good Name, after they had taken away their Lives, was but a shameful Story, raised by a devilish malice to excuse a hellish action: and for so freely censuring the meaness of the Premier President, <hi>Christopher du Thou,</hi> who was so base to commend that in publick, which he abhorred in private, and to countenance such a Story, against the Dictates of his own Conscience. All the World may by this easily discern the Spirit of Popery: It is a Spirit of <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Lying.</hi> It causes the shedding Rivers of Blood, and it invents Lies to colour its Murders, and to commit fresh ones,<note place="margin">Joh 8.44.</note> by which <hi>Briguemaud</hi> and <hi>Cavagnes</hi> were hanged. This is to say much in a few words, says our Friend. And if Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> had been constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so ingenuous, as he is upon this occasion, his Book would be no Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95734:44"/>
but a true and righteous defence of the Protestants Innocence. All those dreadful things which he there alledges against them, are the stamp of the same Spirit, which vouches <hi>a Conspiracy,</hi> to justifie the Massacre. Neither was it harder for him to be assured of that, than to satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that this last report was a meer Story. This Story was, as he says himself, the first means his Church thought fit to use for the conversion of the young King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was afterwards <hi>Henry the Great,</hi> and the young Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion. <hi>They likewise believed,</hi> says he, <hi>that this,</hi> meaning the false rumour of a <hi>hellish Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy</hi> against all the Royal Line, <hi>would help towards the Conversion of the Princes, by making them believe, they were engaged with those that were their greatest enemies and the worst of Men.</hi> An excellent way of converting truly! And becoming the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will now read to you, what account Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> gives of <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth's proceedings in the accomplishment of this excellent Work,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Id. ib. p.</hi> 481.</note> after as Christian a manner, as it had been begun. <q>Whilst they were Massacring the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in the <hi>Louvre,</hi> and all over <hi>Paris,</hi> the King sent for those Princes into his Closet, where, after he had in short given them the reason of this bloody Proceeding, of which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had seen some part, and which was yet in execution, he tells them with a stern countenance, imperious and threatning accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his custom, that being resolved no longer to suffer in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom so wicked a Religion, which teaches its Followers to revolt, and even to conspire against the Person of their Sovereign, he expected they should presently renounce this cursed Sect, and that they should embrace the Faith which was always professed by the most Christian Kings, from whom they had the honor to be descended: and that if they refused to comply with him in this, he would use them just as they had seen them used, whose Rebellion and Impiety they had hitherto been directed by. To this the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> answered, with all respect, that he was no ways obstinate, but was ready to submit to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and sincerely to embrace the Catholick Religion when he should be convinced of the truth of it, which as yet he was ignorant of.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 482.</note> The Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> answered, That his Majesty, whose Subject he was, might dispose of his Life and Fortune as he pleased; but not of his Religion, for which he was accountable to God alone, of whom he held it. This answer given to a fierce and hasty Master, put him into so great a rage, that falling into hard words, calling him ever and anon, Seditious Mad-man, Rebel, and Son of a Rebel: he swore by God, that if he did not comply, in that little time which he should give him, he would have his life. Nay more, not being able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to see, that in spight of all their endeavors to convert him, this Prince should still continue unmoveable: he drew his Sword, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95734:44"/>
vowed he would destroy all the rest of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> that persisted in their Heresie, beginning presently with the Prince of <hi>Condè.</hi> And it was with much ado, that the young Queen prevailed with him to lay by his Sword, casting herself at his feet to entreat him, with hands lifted up, and tears in her eyes, but to forbear a little while. He yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but at the same time, making the Prince be brought before him, he cast two or three thundring looks at him, without saying any more than these three words to him in a threatning and frightful tone, <hi>Mass, Death,</hi> or the <hi>Bastile:</hi> and so turning away, he dismissed him. This wrought so strongly upon the Mind of the poor Prince, and so terrified him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 483.</note> that he solemnly abjured <hi>Calvinism</hi> in the presence of his Uncle the Cardinal of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> as had done before him, the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> the Lady <hi>Catharine</hi> his Sister, and the Princess of <hi>Condè.</hi>
                  </q> You see what were the motives, that <hi>converted</hi> the Princes. And this detestable Massacre <hi>was the introduction of the fourth War upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi> as <hi>Mezeray</hi> says.<note place="margin">

               <p>They took up Arms about the beginning of <hi>Henry the Fourths</hi> Reign, or indeed rather, they continued in Arms: but it was only to compleat his Conquests, and to settle him in the Throne, by dispersing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the League, which held out as long as it could, from own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him King, even when he was turned <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Pope.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Was no sooner come to our Friends Chamber, and that we were sate down, but we fell to our business. I am very well satisfied, says I to him, in all that you have told me hitherto in behalf of the French Protestants; and I am convinced, That till the Reign of their King <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. they cannot justly charge them with any Plot or Rebellion against their Kings. If at any time they have taken up Arms, it was always to secure the Crown to their lawful Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es, against the ambitious designs of the House of <hi>Guise,</hi> and under the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the first Princes of the Blood, who had a natural Right to oppose the Usurpation these Strangers would have made; who, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an ill use of the Simplicity, Minority, and Weakness of the Kings <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Scepter out of their hands, or at least would have deprived their Rightful Successors of it, had not the Protestants given Succour with their utmost Force, the great Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> first, and afterwards the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Therefore to say the truth, they armed only in their Kings Quarrel, and especially to secure to <hi>France</hi> the Illustrious House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which sits on that Throne at present. After all, it is clear, That hitherto they cannot question their Loyalty, or their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, but through the heart of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, by blasting his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and disgracing his Crown and all his Posterity. But I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess to you, That I am to seek, how well to defend them against the Reproaches for their several Insurrections under the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth. For in the Year 1615 they joined with the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> against their King, which had like to have set the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Flame. In the Year 1620 they sided with the Queen-Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who raised Forces against the King her Son. In the Years 1621 and 1622 they gave the occasion, by the Meeting they held at <hi>Rochel,</hi>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:95734:48"/>
contrary to the King's express Command, of a most bloody War, in which many of their Garisons were Besieged, Taken, and Sacked. In the Year 1525 they carried away their King's Ships from <hi>Blavet,</hi> they seized upon the Island of <hi>Oleron,</hi> they had divers Battels. Lastly, in the Years 1627 and 1628 they gave fresh disturbances under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and <hi>Rochel</hi> Revolted from its Allegiance to that degree of obstinacy, that nothing but the utmost extremity of Famine could make them open their Gates.</p>
               <p>These several Insurrections, which are continually objected against them, gives occasion to their Enemies to cry them down at Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Nobility, and indeed all over the Nation, as a restless sort of people, active, and dangerous, whose Religion inspires them with a Spirit of Sedition and Back-sliding, pernicious to Monarchs and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies. Therefore pray Instruct me what I may answer in their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and Defence.</p>
               <p>I know not, says our Friend, whether you are in jest or earnest, but for my part I find nothing more easie than to satisfie any reasonable Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And all the World agrees, That from this Year to the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, who was killed with a Lance by <hi>Montgomery,</hi> in the Year 1559, which was about 37 Years after, the Protestants continued all along exactly Loyal an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in the deepest Veneration for their Kings. Monsieur <hi>Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> indeed disputes the thirty Years under the Reigns of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, but I have confuted all his Calumnies in this particular, and you have allowed the strength of my Arguments for clearing the Protestants during these three Reigns; so that here are 67 Years of Allegiance and Loyalty. Neither have they any thing to say against them upon this account for the one and twenty Years that <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth Reigned, or for the four first Years of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, no more than for the 54 Years that passed between the Year 1629, at what time all the Wars about Religion ceased, and this present time 1682, when they are persecuted with the utmost Rigour. So that for a hundred and sixty Years that the Protestants have been in <hi>France,</hi> there are but fourteen in which they have any thing to object against them, that is, from their uniting with the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi> in the Year 1615 to the general Peace concluded in the Month of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1629. And of these fourteen Years, we must deduct seven, which are the Years 1616, 1617, 1618, 1619, 1623, 1624, and 1626. in which there were no Civil Wars. Thus when all is cast up, and due Deduction made, allow the worst that can be, there are but seven
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95734:48"/>
Years which they can reproach them with. And suppose it true, that the Protestants, during these seven Years, should have forgot themselves so far as to have come short of their duty towards their Sovereign; is it just to infer from thence, That the Principles they go by proceed from a Spirit of Sedition and Rebellion? Is there any proportion between se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Years misbehaviour and uneasiness, and above a hundred and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty Years Duty and Loyalty, such Duty and Loyalty, as have undergone the greatest proofs? And since they have testified twenty times more Zeal and Constancy for the service of their Kings, than they have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Disobedience and Opposition to their Orders; does not Reason and Justice plainly oblige us to conclude from thence, That they are ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by a spirit of Loyalty and Obedience? It must be confessed, That their Loyalty, which stood firm for more than fourscore Years, was shaken to some degree for the space of seven Years. But he that swounds away is not dead: The Sun goes not out when it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>clipsed; And the Loyalty of the Protestants is so well recovered from its faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fit, that it is more than half an Age that we find it resisting all manner of Provocations and ill usage, without yielding in the least. This long and constant perseverance of the Protestants in their duty, is that we ought to have regard to, if we would be just in taking the true Character of their Spirit, and not the infirmity of a hasty and short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived transport. This ought to be enough to satisfie all reasonable Men: and yet it is not all that can be said in behalf of these poor persecuted people.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a great matter, Sir, that they can with no Justice impute those Insurrections you spake of, to the whole Body of the French Protestants. For, First, There was an infinite number of them not in the least concerned. Secondly, they that were the Ring-Leaders,<note place="margin">See the following Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> were only Protestants in Name, but really men only of this World, Ambitious or Covetous, who only made use of Religion for a Mask to hide their wicked purposes, and for a pretence to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish in troubled Waters. But if there happened to be any sincere Protestants who were drawn in by these Hypocrites to take up Arms with them, as it is not to be doubted, they did it not in pursuit of the Principles of their Religion, which is point-blanck against such proceedings, but out of too great a fear of Death, or something worse, through a usual Infirmity of Nature, from which the best of Christians are not wholly exempt. The first need no defence; the second deserve it not, and the third sort plead their fear (the rather because just, as it were easie to prove) as well as their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. As the first are they that held to the true Principles of their Religion, it is but reasonble that we should make our judgment of the French Protestants from their behaviour. The second, as they did but act a part, and were Impostors, there is no reason their Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95734:49"/>
and Rebellions should be charged upon the true Protestants, who disown their Fraternity: And because the third falled out of weakness, it is the duty of a Christian Compassion, and the sense of our own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities to forget and forgive their Failures. I propose nothing in all this,<note place="margin">Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, by <hi>Anth.

                  <q>Many, says this King, speaking of the Protestants of his Kingdom, have taken up Arms against us, to assist the Commotion begun by our Cousin the Prince of <hi>Condè</hi>; amongst which, there are that use Religion only for a better Pretence to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their Ambition and extream thirst of bettering themselves by the disturbance and ruine of the State; and the rest have been Cheated, and Imposed upon by false suggestions and vain fears that the former sort have put into their heads, as if there were no avoiding Persecution, but presently to take up Arms with them in their own defence, making them believe, the better to work upon their easiness, That in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Article, upon the Match with <hi>Spain,</hi> it was agreed and covenanted to drive them out of the Kingdom, or wholly to destroy them; which they being too forward to believe, have run into this Engagement, out of a conceit that they are forced to it in their own defence, which makes their Fault pardonable, and worthy rather of Pity than Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But these tricks have not prevailed or seduced the wiser and better sort, who profess the same Religion purely out of Conscience, as expecting to be Saved by it, and not to promote a Faction; who, to a considerable number, as well Lords, Gentlemen, Towns, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, as other private persons of all qualities, condemn and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the wickedness and rashness of their attempt, and have publickly declared by word of mouth, and writing, That it ought to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as neither more nor less than a down-right Rebellion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have declared and ordained, and do declare and ordain, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, and in favour to the Loyalty which has been observed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us by an infinite number of our good Subjects of the said Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, amongst which there are of the chiefest and best Quality, who deserve a special Proof of our Good-Will, That what has been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by those of the same Religion, who have taken up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, or that have in any manner aided or assisted them, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the favour of our Edicts, and that they share in this Grace as if they had always continued in their Duty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>In all the following troubles, the same distinction is to be made. The whole Body of Protestants was never engaged in them; the greater and more sober part always kept to their Obedience and Duty, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite of all the Injuries that were done them. They were contented to encounter God and their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But after all, it was but a small number of the Protestants that gave in to those rough Provocations they then lay under: In so doing, they departed from the Principles of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Religion: Their own Brethren, <hi>an in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95734:50"/>
the troubles of the year 1615. or the Queen-Mother, <hi>Mary de Medicis</hi> in those of the year 1620. or the present Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the Civil Wars during the minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. I am confident the Papists would cry out against it, as a great and foul Injustice done to their Church. And yet why do they continually use the Protestants thus unreasonably? I presume this may serve for a full Justification, in reference to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Rebellion imputed upon the account of what passed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. They cannot wrong them more, than to make their Religion answerable for the weakness of some of them, who were disapproved by the wisest among them, who have more reason to be considered, than a few, who acted contrary to the Principles of the Protestant Religion, as they are contained in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith, established by their most eminent Divines, as I shewed you at our third Conference.

               <p>Yet methinks, said I, you should not have done, before you have said something particularly of <hi>Rochel.</hi> Its Rebellion and Siege have made too great a noise in the World, and perchance that which happened about this Town, is what has raised the greatest cry against the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, as Commonwealthsmen and Traytors. Therefore I shall no more question their Loyalty, and you will enable me to defend them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently under the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII as well as under those that went before; if you can set me right in the excuse of <hi>Rochel.</hi> It will be no hard matter for me, says our Friend, to satisfie you in this Point.

And by other Letters he promises them, that their Walls and Forts should stand; and that he would raise none upon them.</q> He goes on with the other great Immunities that were granted to <hi>Rochel</hi> by this King, and by his Successors, not sticking to declare ingenuously, that <q>
                     <hi>Henry</hi> II. and <hi>Francis</hi> I. by sometimes placing their Governors and Garisons, had infringed their Priviledges.

               </p>
               <p>By this you see that <hi>Rochel</hi> did not deliver it self up to <hi>France,</hi> but upon Conditions, and so were to continue their Obedience no longer than the Articles stipulated by the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> and accepted by the King of <hi>France,</hi> were observed.

And that, if he had any such thoughts, of so many Men as he has raised, which are the same charge to him, as if he had them here, and which he is always ready to send over, if the Churches want them, he should only send a handful, in comparison of so many as would be needful for so great an undertaking, besides the great Succors he sends at the same time into <hi>Germany</hi>? Who would not conclude rather, as in truth it is, that the Forces here, are but Auxiliaries, and that they are for no other purpose, but to assist the Churches, which for so many reasons, and upon such important accounts he finds himself obliged before God and Man to aid and protect? that if they will say, the King my Master was provoked to arm himself upon other considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the imbargo and seizure of all the Shipping, Goods and Effects of his Subjects at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and other places of this Kingdom, to the open breach and overthrow of the Treaties between the two Crowns, which are direct in this point, and to the irreparable prejudice, even the entire ruine of Trade, in the disappointment of which, the poor people of this Kingdom, not being able to put off their Commodities, groan not only under the Burden of so many Taxes and Impositions, but even of the Necessaries of Life it self; that the apprehension the King my Master has of the growth of the Most Christian Kings Power by Sea, has put him upon taking Arms, to hinder the progress; and in conclusion, that he was forced to put himself in a Warlike posture, through despair of an accommodation: The answer to all this must be, that whoever will take notice of the Stops, Seizures, and Prizes that were on the one side and the other, shall find that the King my Master and his Subjects have hitherto got most by this Breach, and that it has been an advantage to them in some measure. In the second place, he is so far from being jealous of the growth of this pretended power at Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the contrary is most apparent to any one, that will consider the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications that have been made at several times, as well by their own, as by the Ministers of stranger Princes to the King my Master, at their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, to treat about an accommodation. All which justifies the King my Master, who has not been forced to arm upon any private account, but only in aid of the Churches, for whose safety and freedom he had undertaken. And there are, that would possess the world, that his Majesty has a private design, and that he makes use of a pretence of the Religion to form a Party, by the help and addition of which, with his own forces, he thinks to carry on his design to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. But our Religion teaches us otherwise, and the goodness of the King my Master, in which he comes short of no man living, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver suffer him to do it. His purpose is to settle the Churches, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is their good, his end to give them satisfaction.

                  </gap>s of <hi>Rochel,</hi> which was undone only for committing its concerns to his Majesty. Honour, sincerity, publick faith, the Law of Nations, the urging Duty of conscience, all obliged us to run in to the succour of a Town, that had cast it self upon our Monarch, and that had full right to shake off the yoke of <hi>France,</hi> since it had been no otherwise given up to the French, but upon a condition that was broken, which was, that they should build no Fort upon its Territory, whereby to give cause of suspicion. Nevertheless, as the Declaration ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erves, they had not only built one, against the Article of the Treaty, which made the Treaty void, and put <hi>Rochel,</hi> into its full liberty, which it had acquired at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

times: but they had built several, which blocked up the Town on every side, and destroyed its trade,</p>
               <p>Our arming therefore upon this occasion, was just. It was justified by the publick faith, and the Law of necessity, and had no other end but to protect the weak, who were oppressed contrary to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngagement of the Treaty, which was the supporting of a good cause. For <hi>Rochel,</hi> which they wasted after so many manners, was then in right to defend it self, being no longer subject to the Prince, who attaqued it. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio non impleta liberat fidem,</hi> say the Civilians, <hi>A condition not fullfilled takes off all Engagement. Rochel</hi> had said to the King of <hi>France,</hi> you shall be my King, if you build no Fort upon my Territory, but not otherwise; and the King of <hi>France</hi> consented, or rather swore, to a solemne Treaty, that he would not be Master of <hi>Rochel,</hi> but upon this condition. So that from the moment, in which he had broken the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition agreed upon and accepted of, he put <hi>Rochel</hi> into its orignal right. The Rochellers are no longer his subjects; and therefore, if they shut the gates of their Town against him, if they defend themselves as well as they can against his invasion, if they call in their friends for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; they do it in their own right, and it is to do them open wrong, it is traducing them, to charge them with Rebellion upon this account. Are men Rebells, when they defend themselves against the invasions of a Prince, that is not their King? This is so evident, said I here to our friend, that you need say no more. I must confess, the French Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants are set right in my opinion. They are not guilty of the Wars, which infested <hi>France</hi> from the Reign of <hi>Francis</hi> the Second, to that of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth. They lived in perfect good understanding with their Countrymen during the Reign of this great Prince. The Wars under <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth cannot justly be imputed to them: because the greater and sounder part of them, were not engaged; because the real promoters of difference, were Protestan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s only in name; because if any true Protestants did go in, it was upon motives and mistakes, which in the opinion, even of their King, made their fault pardonable; and because the standing out of <hi>Rochel,</hi> must by no means pass for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. So that indisputably, it is the effect of a dark and devilish ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> and his Brethren, to cry them down, at such a rate, as incendiaries and seditious, by which they would render them suspected to the Magistrates and people, where they go to be out of the reach of that cruel persecution that was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All Europe, sayes our friend, is of the same mind. They say plainly, that the King of <hi>France</hi> cuts off the hand, which saved his Crown, and of which he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95734:54"/>
or his son may stand in need some time or other, to defend themselves against the Ligues of the Roman Clergy. It is more then fifty years, that they whom they persecute, have given the highest testimony of their loyalty and zeal for the service of their Kings. But what is yet more surprizing, they make use of their loyalty for an occasion of persecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them more severely. For I know it from the first hand, in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, which was Presented to their King by a certain Abbot some years since; to invite him to root them out, and to open to him the way, they lay down plainly their loyalty, which sayes this Memorial, they make an Article of faith and a point of conscience, to satisfie him that there was no danger from them, whatever injury or rigour they used towards them. I have seen this Memorial, of which there was means found to get a copy: the Abbot, who was the bearer, having forgot the Rule and charge, that he was under, to be secret. But I can assure you, the French Court were not a little pleased with this motion, since it doth only follow the Memorial step by step, in all the tricks and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages that have been practiced upon the Protestants against the security of the Edicts. To be short, that which will compleat your amazement, is that this Great <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth whom the whole World has in admiration, was disposed quite another way, as appears not only by his Letter to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> which I have already communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, and is but a private transaction; but by a solemne Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which I must needs read to you before we part.</p>

               <p>I was sure to come at the hour appointed. Our friend had two lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Books in his hands, just as I came into the room. He compared them one with an other, and I observed him to smile, whilst he was doing of it. Pray, said I, give me leave to awake you out of your pleasant Dream, and ask you, what you are so intent upon, that, for what I can perceive, pleases you very well. If you please to sit down, replied he, I will tell you in short. So I took my seat, and he went on. One of the two Books, that you saw me have, is <hi>The History of Calvinisme,</hi> and the other <hi>The Policy of the Clergy of</hi> France. Whilst I was expecting you, I read what Monsiuer <hi>Mainbourg</hi> says in the First, to take off the prejudice Protestant Kings and Princes might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against the Principles and usual practice of Papists. And I must confess to you, I could not forbear smiling, when I saw the ridiculous evasions this man made use of, especially after I had compared them with the objections of the Author of <hi>The Policy of the Clergy of</hi> France, which he pretends to confute. I must needs read all this to you. You shall find proofs enough there to justifie you in what I promised, That they are the Papists who are really to be feared in the point of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and conspiracies, into which the principles of their Religion have so often lead them; and not the Protestants of <hi>France,</hi> whose Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is so directly opposite to these sort of practices, and who, by the help of God, have never been guilty of them, properly so speaking, as I have before demonstrated to you.</p>

ease, and justly deal with the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> as the Protestant Princes do with the Catholicks. Nay, his glory seems to oblige him to it. For is it not a wonderful thing, to see some Princes, who come infinitely short of him in every thing, denying the Catholicks the free Exercise of their Religion within their Territories: and yet to have it expected, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> of late, to give the best answer he could to this powerful argument, which overthrows them. He thought to take it off, by saying, that there is a great difference betwixt the one and the other in this respect, in as much as the Catholicks believing that the Pope may depose a Prince, who is esteemed at <hi>Rome</hi> a Heretike or Excommunicated Person, there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be at defiance with them, and to apprehend their conspiring against such a Prince; which cannot be said of the Protestants, who are far from any such belief, so that there is no ground to suspect them, or imagin they should attempt any ill against the Catholick Princes their Soveraigns. To shew, plainly how little force there is in such an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, which is indeed but a poor shifting, we need only mark these two things, which have been laied down in this History of <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,</hi> and which cannot be denied. The first is, that more dismal conspiracies are hardly to be met with, then those the <hi>Hugunots</hi> have made against our Kings, such as the accursed attempts of <hi>Amboise,</hi> and of <hi>Meaux</hi>; not to take notice of their terrible Rebellions, which have cost <hi>France</hi> so much blood, and of the unhappy Plots they have entred into with their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The second is, that it is by no means our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that a Pope can depose Princes, though they be Hereticks, nor absolve their subjects from the Oath of Allegiance, and give up their right to him that can first take it. Far from this, our most Christian Kings, who are known to have been the most zealous Defenders of the Catholike faith, and the greatst Protectors of the holy See, to which they have always unmoveably held, notwithstanding all the differences they had with some Popes about temporal Affairs, and the right of their Crown, which they must never give up: our Kings, I say, have ever protested against this pretension, grounded upon a principle, which our Doctors have always condemned, as directly contrar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I should not have done to day, if I should take notice of all that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> says upon this subject. He makes it consistent with the <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to overthrow an Edict, which was the reward of the Loialty and of the eminent services of the Protestants, an Edict confirmed in all the Parliaments of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome under the title of <hi>a perpetual and irrevacable Law,</hi> Ratified by a thousand Royal promises, and by a thousand authentike Declarations, which <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth had himself solemnly sworn to observe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on so many occasions. <hi>It seems,</hi> says the Jesuite, <hi>that he is bound to do it for his glory,</hi> which is to say, according to this man of conscince, that one does his <hi>Duty,</hi> when he breaks his word, and his Oath; and that he acts for his <hi>Glory,</hi> when he dishonours himself and his Ancestors, by perjuries and overthrowing the most Religiously established Laws. But above all, it is a pleasant fancy, that the argument, he furnishes his King with to stop the mouth of the <hi>Huguenots,</hi> who do not prevail with the Princes of their Religion, to permit the free exercise of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Religion in their Dominions. <hi>Might he not very justly say to the</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots, says he, speaking to the King of <hi>France, either see that these Princes allow the free exercise of my Religion with them, or do not think to have the free exercise of yours and theirs in</hi> France. <hi>If it be expected that we should consider the Edicts which have been here made in your behalf, let them shew then the like favour to the Catholicks.</hi> Monsieur <hi>Maimbourg</hi> calls this <hi>a powerful argument, which overthrows the</hi> Huguenots.

He added to this, the examples of the many Parricides that have been committed, or attempted in pursuance of these Maxims. How many times, said he, would they have Assassinated Queen <hi>Elizabeth?</hi> Prince <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> was twice Assassinated, and lost his Life the Second time. <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, was not he killed by a <hi>Iacobin,</hi> as Excommunicated by the Pope, and stript of the Royal Dignity? <hi>Iohn Chastel,</hi> did not he attempt the same thing upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth?

of by the Pope, about the means of re-establishing the Catholick Religion in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>English</hi> Catholicks, seeing that the King was a Prisoner in the hands of the <hi>Independants,</hi> formed the Resolution of laying hold on that occasion to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>stroy the Protestant, and re-establish the Catholick Religion. They concluded that the only means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishing the Catholick Religion, and of laying aside all the Laws that had been made against it in <hi>England,</hi> was to dispatch the King, and destroy Monarchy. That they might be authorized and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this great Undertaking, they deputed eighteen Father-Jesuits to <hi>Rome,</hi> to demand the Popes advice. The matter was agitated in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Assemblies, and it was concluded, that it was permitted and just to put the King to Death. Those Deputies, in their passage through <hi>Paris,</hi> consulted the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> who, without waiting for the Opinion of <hi>Rome,</hi> had judged that that enterprise was just and lawful; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the return of the Jesuites, who had taken the Journey to <hi>Rome,</hi> they communicated to the <hi>Sorbonnits</hi> the Popes Answer, of which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Copies were taken. The Deputies, who had been at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to <hi>London,</hi> confirmed the Catholicks in their Design. To compass this point, they thrust themselves in amongst the Independants, by dissembling their Religion. They persuaded those people that the King must be put to Death; and it cost that poor Prince his Life some Months after. But the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> not having had all the Consequences that was hoped; and all <hi>Europe</hi> having cryed out with horrour against the Parricide committed upon the Person of that poor Prince; they would have called in again all the Copies that had been made of the Consultation of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and of that of <hi>Sorbonne</hi>; but this <hi>English</hi> Chaplain who had turned Catholick would not restore his; and he has communicated it, since the return of the Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> to several persons who are still alive, and were Eye witnesses of what I have now told you.</p>

                     </gap>s which render the thing apparent. For example, he that lately published this story, had already once published it in the year 1662, to answer a little Book that insulted over the <hi>English Calvinists,</hi> in that they had put their King to death. The Divine, who knew the story
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95734:58"/>
that I have related, published it to prove that the Catholicks were guilty of the Crime which the <hi>Calvinists</hi> were accused of. When this story came to light, there was a great alarme in the House of the Queen-Mother of the King of <hi>England,</hi> that House being full of Jesuits; and even that great Lord, who had lead the Jesuits to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had made himself chief of that Conspiracy, was one of the principal Officers of the House. They immediately demanded Justice of the King, by the means of the Queen-Mother, for the injury that he who had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished this scandalous story had done them. The Doctor offered to prove his Accusation, and to produce his Witnesses, who were still liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The great Lord and Officer of the Queens House, and the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, seeing the resolution of this Man, durst not push him on; they only obtain'd from the King, by the means of the Queen-Mother, that he should be silenced. You must avow that there are but few that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, who would have been so easie in so terrible an Accusation. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it is certain that this Consultation of <hi>Rome</hi> has been seen by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral persons. If it is false, it must have been forged by this Chaplain who was turned Catholick, and who shewed it since; tho it must be confessed that this is not very likely. However, as all this is reduceed to a single Witness, my Gentleman acknowledged that the proof was not wholly in forme; but he stood much upon the late Conspiracy of <hi>England,</hi> which was discovered two years ago, by which half the Kingdom was to have had their Throats cut to become Masters of the rest.</p>

                  <p>Be it as it will, my <hi>Hugonot</hi> Gentleman concluded from all this, that a Protestant Prince can never be assured of the Fidelity of his Catholick Subjects. On the contrary, said he, the Protestants are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Prince out of Conscience, and out of a Principle of their Religion: They acknowledge no other Superiour than their King, and do not believe that for the cause of Heresie it is permitted, either to kill a lawful Prince, or to refuse him obedience.</p>
                  <p>They oppose against us, said he to me, the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks: But what has been promised to those people that has not been performed? The United Provinces of the Low Countries are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the Union with this Condition, of not suffering any other Religion in their States, than the Protestant. Though <hi>England</hi> was reformed under <hi>Edward</hi> the 6<hi>th,</hi> afterwards under <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by several Acts of Parliament, which are the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, it was ordered that no other Religion should be suffered than that the <hi>Anglicane</hi> Church made choice of, and that they would not suff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95734:59"/>
was even forbidden to the Priests and Monks to set Foot in <hi>England,</hi> and to make any abode there. However they have not kept up to this rigour, and every one knows that there is at present above ten thousand Priests and Monks disguised in <hi>England,</hi> and that there has ever been so. Wherefore more has been given to the Catholicks, than was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised them. But in <hi>France,</hi> where we live under favourable Edicts, they have promised us what they have not performed: It is only against us that they make profession of not performing what they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised. The Edicts of Pacification are in all the Forms that perpetual Laws ought to be; they are verified by the Parliaments, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a hundred Declarations, which followed by Consequence, and by a thousand Royal Words: In fine, they have been laid as irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable Laws, and as foundations of the Peace of the State. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the good Faith of so many promises; and on a sudden we see snatcht from us, what we looked upon as our greatest security, and which we had possessed for above a hundred years Thus there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Title, nor Prescription, nor Edicts, nor Acts, nor Declarations which can put us in Safety. This is what he told me, and I avow to you, that this part put me in pain, for I am a Slave to my Word, and an Idolater of good Faith: I look upon it as the only Rampart of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society; and I conceive that States and Publick persons are no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>That is true. But do not you know that the safety of the people, and the publick good, is the Soveraign Law; Very often we must suffer, and even do some Evil, for the good of the State.

                  <p>My <hi>Hugonot</hi> made himself that difficulty, and told me thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, When War is declared against Neighbours, to the prejudice of Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace and Alliances, this is done in the Forms. They publish Manifesto's; they expose, or at least, they suppose Grievances and Infractions in the Articles of the Treaty, that have been made by those against whom War is declared. When a Soveraign revokes the Graces that he had done his Subjects, it is ever under pretence that they have rendered themselves unworthy of them. But are we accused, or can we be accused of having tampered in any Conspiracy, of having had Intelligence with the Enemies of the State, of having wanted Love, Fidelity and Obedience towards our Soveraigns? If it be so, let us be brought to Tryal, let the Criminals be informed against, and let the Innocent be distinguished from those that are Guilty. We speak boldly th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95734:59"/>
and we know that his Majesty himself has very often given Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our Fidelity. He knows that we did not enter into any of the Parties that have been made against his Service, since he has been upon the Throne. During the troubles of his minority, it may be said, that none but those Cities we were Masters of, remained Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. When the Gates of <hi>Orleans</hi> were shut upon the King, he went to <hi>Gien</hi>; and that City was going to be guilty of the same Crime, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the vigour of a <hi>Hugonot,</hi> who made way with his Sword in his hand to the Bridge, and let it down himself: This action was known, and recompenced; for the King immediately made him Noble who had done it. We had not any part in the disturbances of <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> in those of <hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Auvergue,</hi> nor in the Conspiracy of the Chevalier <hi>do Roban</hi>: Not one <hi>Hugonot</hi> was engaged in these Criminal Cases. The King has been pleased to acknowledge it; and we look upon the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of so great a King as a great Recompence. But our Enemies, who continually sollicit him to our ruin, ought to be mindful, that it would be more civil in them, to leave the King the liberty of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his inclinations: These would without doubt move him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the effects of his kindness for people who have preserved for him an inviolable Fidelity. This is what he told me upon that point; and I confess I was in great perplexity how to answer him; for I durst not make use of that Maxim that I have seen often maintain'd by some people, That one is not obliged to keep Faith with Hereticks. I have ever admired that saying of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth: He caused <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther</hi> to come to <hi>Worms,</hi> and gave him safe Conduct, and his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial word, that no hurt should be done him.

                  <p>The most part of the Catholicks reject that Morality, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we are obliged to keep Faith with all the World, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting Infidels and Hereticks; otherwise there would never be any Treaty between the <hi>Turks</hi> and the Christians, that were real. It is pretended that the Council of <hi>Constance</hi> has not established this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im, That we are not obliged to make good to Hereticks what we have promised them. <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> had no safe Conduct from the Council, he had only the Emperours; and thereupon the Council in the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Session declared, That any safe Conduct, granted by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, by Kings, and the other Secular Princes to Hereticks, could not do prejudice to the Catholick Faith, and to the Ecclesiastical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, and could not hinder from proceeding in the Tribunal of the Church, to the punishment of Hereticks, who had provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with such a safe Conduct, Thus the Council did not violate its promise, for it never gave any; neither did it oblige the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to violate his Faith: But the Ecclesiastical Tribunal, that had not given any word, made <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> his Process.</p>

                  <p>That distinction seems pleasant to me: I have heard say, that the Church does not put its hand into blood: When <hi>Iohn Hus</hi> was convicted of Heresie by the Council, he was delivered without doubt to the secular Arm to be burnt. Those Secular Judges, were not they Imperial Judges? Thus the Emperor violated his safe Conduct, in permitting his Judges to put a Man to Death, to whom he had promised all security. But what do they say of <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> to whom the Council it self had given a safe Conduct, and yet was burnt?</p>

                  <p>They say that the Council, in the safe Conduct that was given to <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> had inserted this Clause, <hi>Salva Iustitia</hi>; that thus they had only promis'd to warrant <hi>Ierome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> from violence, and not from the arrests of Justice: But I avow to you that all this is not capable of justifying the Conduct of that Council. Neither does it pass in <hi>France</hi> for a Rule that they will follow. If they do not keep with the <hi>Hugonots</hi> all that has been promised them, it is not that they ground themselves upon the Morality and the Conduct of the Council of

                  <p>This is good to amuse.

                  <p>The Faction of the House of <hi>Guise</hi> caused this to be done: And this poor Prince, after a thousand delays and troubles, resolved at length to make that execution so famous in our History; it is that of the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Guise,</hi> who were executed at the States of <hi>Blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is.</hi> That Prince must needs have seen his ruin approaching, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable to come to that, since that he well foresaw that this blow would raise him so many storms, and give him so much trouble. Who knows not that the Faction of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Spain,</hi> had a Design of raising the House of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to the Throne of <hi>France,</hi> for the excluding the House of <hi>Bourbon</hi>? In the year 1587. the Pope sent to the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> a Sword engraven with flames, telling him by the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> that amongst all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> it only belonged to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to bear the arms of the Church, and to be the Chief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

And in truth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, then Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> was President in the Council when the Resolution was taken of making the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacre of <hi>St. Bartholomew,</hi> in which the Admiral <hi>Coligny</hi> perished. But his Son, forgetting that injury, to save his King, answered those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels; You are Traytors to your Country; and when the Service of the Prince and State is concerned, I know how to lay aside all revenge and particular interest; he added, that after the Assassinate commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the League, in the person of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth was ready to see himself abandoned by his most faithful Servants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Protestant Religion, which he made profession of, which appears by a Declaration that this Prince made in the form of an Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue to the Lords of his Army, on the 8<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>August,</hi> 1589, in which he says, that he had been informed that his Catholick Nobility set a report on foot they could not serve him, unless he made profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and that they were going to quit his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Nothing but the firmness and fidelity of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> upheld this wavering Party. He must be, said my Gentleman, the falsest of men, who dissembles the Ardour and Zeal with which those of our Religion maintained that just Cause of the House of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> against the attempts of the League: And to prove, said he, that their interest was not the only cause of their fidelity, we must see what they did when <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth turned <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick. It cannot be said but that they then strove to have a King of their Religion: However, there was not one who bated any thing of his Zeal and Fidelity, the King was peaceable possessour of the Crown, the League was beaten down, he was Master in <hi>Paris,</hi> he was reconciled to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> when the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was granted and published: Our <hi>Hugonots</hi> were no longer armed, nor in a condition of obtaining any thing by force of arms. Since that the Change of Religion had reduced all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> to him, he would have been in a State of resisting their violence. It was the sole acknowledgment of the King, and of good <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> that obliged all <hi>France</hi> to give Peace to a Party that had shed their Blood with so much Zeal and Profession for the preserving the Crown, and the restoring it to its legitimate Heirs. I acknowledge that we did our Duty; but are not those to be thanked who do what they ought? How is it possible that these things are at present worn out of the memory of men?

                  <p>No man can be ignorant of the necessary dependance that must be between the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Clergy and the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> This Court is the Head, the Clergy is the Body, the Ecclesiasticks and Monks are the Members, and all these Members move by the Orders of the Head. Again, I have no Design to chocque the Gentlemen of the Clergy, whose persons I respect: I do not doubt but that they have good <hi>French</hi> Hearts; But in fine, they have their Maxims of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; they are of a Religion, and they must follow its Principles. Now the Principles of their Religion binds them to the Holy see, and its preservation preferably to all things; moreover, Interest deceives the Hearts and Minds of men. Their Interest obliges them to take the Popes part, who is their Preserver and Protectour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and what they do out of interest, they perswade themselves that they do it out of Conscience. First, it may be said of the Monks, that all the Houses they have in <hi>France,</hi> are so many Citadels that the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> has in the Kingdom. Those great Societies have withdrawn themselves from the jurisdiction of the Bishops, they depend immediately on the Holy See; they have all their Generals of Orders at <hi>Rome</hi>; and those Generals who are <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> are the Soul of the Society; they are obliged to follow their Opinions and their Orders; the <hi>Italian</hi> Divinity is the Divinity of the Cloisters. Thus the King may reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all the Monks look upon him as the Pope's Subject, as being lyable to be Excommunicated, his Kingdom put under an Ecclesiastical Censure, his Subjects dispensed and released from the Oath of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and his States given by the Pope to another Prince. And every time that this happens, they will believe themselves obliged, out of Conscience, to obey the Pope. If in those Orders of Monks there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be some particular men, who follow other Principles, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they are in no Number, so that the Body of the Monks is absolutely in the Interests of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by consequence in that of <hi>Spain.</hi> Thus you see already a considerable Party of whose Fidelity the Kings of <hi>France</hi> cannot be assured. And what is this Party? One may say that it is all <hi>France</hi>: for the begging Monks and the Jesuits are Masters of all the Consciences; they are Confessors, they are Directors, they persuade what they will to those that are devoted to them. The House of <hi>Bourbon</hi> ought not to doubt of this truth, if it never so little calls to mind the endeavours that were used by the Monks for the forcing from it the Crown, when the Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory tells us how impossible it is to be long without having Disputes with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is always attempting, and we are obliged to defend our selves against its enterprises. It is capable of setting great Engines a going, of making Engagements and Alliances: It had twenty times like to have ruined <hi>Germany,</hi> it has dethroned great Emperours, it has likewise caused great troubles in <hi>France,</hi> and one cannot be too secure against its ambition,</p>

That the King of <hi>France</hi> cannot be Excommunicated by the Pope. 2. That an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That the Pope has nothing to do with the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porality of Kings. 5 That he is not Infallible. 6. That he is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the Council. These, you would tell me, are the Maxims of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> that have often censured the contrary Propositions. This Divinity is maintained by the Authority of the Parliaments, who have often declared the Bulls of the Pope abusive, null, scandalous and impious, and have appealed from the Execution of these Bulls, when they found them contrary to the Liberties of the <hi>Gallicane</hi> Church. The Estates assembled at <hi>Tours,</hi> during the League, caused the Bul's of Excommunication to be burnt by the hands of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioner, that had been published against <hi>Henry</hi> the Third and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth.

All <hi>France</hi> struck with a sense of the two horrible Parricides that had been committed in the persons of the two late Kings, both of them assassinated out of a false Zeal for Religion, would draw up a form of an Oath, and establish a Fundamental Law of the State, which all the Subjects were to swear to; and this Law imported, that every one should swear to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and believe, that our Kings as to their Temporalities do not depend on any but God; that it is not lawful for any cause whatsoever to assassinate Kings; that even for causes of Heresie and of Schism Kings cannot be Deposed, nor their Subjects Absolved from their Oath of Allegiance, nor upon any other pretence whatsoever. This Law, methinks, is the security of Kings, this is a Doctrine which all the <hi>Hugonots</hi> are ready to sign with their Blood. What did the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> do thereupon? It formally opposed that Law; (Works of Cardinal <hi>du Perron, p.</hi> 600 and following) they were willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Independancy of Kings, in regard of the Temporalty; they consented that Anathema should be pronounced against the assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinates of Kings. But they would never pass the last Article; that for what cause soever it was, a King cannot be Deposed by the Pope, stript of his States, and his Subjects absolved from the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance. He who spoke for them, alledged all the examples of Emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erours and of Kings, who had been Deposed and Excommunicated by Popes, upon account of refusing Obedience to the Holy See, and approved them; he alledged the Example of St. <hi>Vrban</hi> the Second, who Excommunicated <hi>Philip</hi> the First, and laid an Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure upon his Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because he had put away his Wife <hi>Bertha,</hi> Daughter of a Count of <hi>Holland,</hi> to Marry <hi>Bertrade</hi> Wife of <hi>Foulques</hi> Count <hi>d' Anjou,</hi> then still alive.

But you have seen likewise, which ought to awaken the Protestant Princes to a purpose, that all these black attempts, have not been the fruit of impatience and human frailty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the temptation of some severe persecution; but the natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence and effect of the Principles of the Roman Religion, as we are assured by those very men, who pass for the Oracles of this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For you have seen just now out of Authentick pieces, that the Pope, the Cardinals, and all the Divines of <hi>Italy,</hi> who are the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Roman Catholike Religion, all the Regulars of <hi>France,</hi> who draw after them more then three fourths of the French <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> it self, when the rod is not over it, own publickly, that the Pope may Excommunicate Kings, when he judges them Hereticks or countenancers of Heriticks, to interdict their Kingdoms, absolve their subjects from their Allegiance, and expose them to the fury of all the World. You have also seen, that the whole <hi>Clergy</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was of this opinion, by the mouth of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> so that this pernicious Doctrine is the vowed Faith of the whole Popish <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, as well as of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> the great depository of the Roman Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and all its misteries. From whence evidently follows, what the Author of <hi>The Policy of the Clergy of</hi> France, infers, That there is no safety for the Crown, nor for the life of Kings, whether they be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants themselves, or only protect such as are, whilst they are beset with <hi>Papists</hi>: so that there is not the same reason to tolerate Popery in Protestant Kingdoms, as there is to to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this rate, the Pope, who is the head of your Church, this head, for whose infallibility you have so much disputed, knows not the belief of your Church: for he believes, that by the principles of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he has the power, which you seem to deny him: The Cardinals, the Bishops, and all the Divines of <hi>Italy,</hi> all your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars, all your Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> speaking by the mouth of your Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> your <hi>Sorbonne</hi> it self, so renowned for its great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of able men, did not know, in so important a case, what was the belief of your Church. For they have all held, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>the Pope can depose Princes</hi> &amp;c. At least he should have given some answers to the Authentick Acts and notorious matters of fact, which the Author of <hi>The Policy of the Clergy,</hi> had quoted to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. To say nothing of all this, and to think it enough, to say at randome, <hi>It is by no means our belief, that a Pope may depose Princes, even though they were Hereticks</hi> &amp;c. this is to pass the sentence of an unjust judge, who rather then fairly to confess his errour, makes no conscience of denying that in words, in which his heart gives him the lie. And I beseech you, consider what he adds, to make us believe, that the Roman Catholicks have not that belief, which the Popes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves attribute to them. <hi>So far from that,</hi> says he, <hi>that our most Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Kings, who are known alwais to have been the most zealous asserters of the Catholick Faith, and</hi>

I could tell you a great many things upon this subject, said our friend. For I have the whole History of it. I have it here in English. But to speak particularly to it, would force me to discover too many misteries. It would carry us a great way, and is much more proper for another time. I will only tell you, that this Declaration was drawn up for quite another person, then the late Dutchess of <hi>York</hi>; and it were easie to prove, that the greater part of what is there said, does not at all sute with this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
