         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Day before Execution, That on <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th
of <hi>March, Walter Parkhurst, James Slader,</hi> and
<hi>John Williams:</hi> committed a Robbery upon <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor-Coach</hi>

a dozen <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> well Armed and mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
who pursued us for five or six miles before we

            <p>That on the 18th of the same Moneth, we the

<hi>Bedfond-Lane</hi> near <hi>Stains,</hi> Robb'd two Coaches. We
struck off from thence into <hi>Acton</hi> Road supposing
our selves discovered by a Gentle mans Man in a

               </gap>r best course to make
<hi>Harrow</hi> on the Hill, and did suppose our selves pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
all the Way, though we never saw any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Evidence of it until we came there, where in the
Town we found about Fo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Weapons, so that we rode down the Hill by the side
of the Town, at the bottom of which we found a
great number of Horse and Foot ready to receive
us; Which we soon made run in<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the Houses for
shelter, and so rode on towards <hi>Paddington,</hi> and from
thence towards <hi>Kilburn</hi> and <hi>Hendon,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Hampstead-Heath;</hi> but was so hotly engag'd
all the way by our Pursuers, that it was about ten
or eleven a Clock, when we were at <hi>Harrow</hi> on the
the Hill, and it was six of the clock when we recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Hampstead-Heath,</hi> our Powder and Shot being
all gone, and some of our Swords, and most of us
sorely Wounded &amp; Bruised about two of the clock.</p>
            <p>There was a Life-Guard Man that fought with a
great deal of Courage most part of that day. There
was about two hundred Men upon <hi>Hampstead-Heath,</hi>
which was near about an hour before they could take
us; having nothing but our Swords, and some of us
not them: from thence to <hi>Newgate;</hi> from thence
to the Sessions House, where <hi>Parkhurst</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi>
pleaded guilty to their Indictments; the others the
contrary; but all Cast.</p>
            <p>We write not this as if we glorified in the Action,
the Cause being so <hi>Criminal</hi> and <hi>Bad;</hi> and yet if the
Cause had been good there could not have been a

            <head>A
RELATION
OF THEIR
TRYAL.</head>
            <p>A <hi>Middlesex</hi> Jury being called, the aforesaid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
were set to the Bar, and were severally
arraigned upon no less than 14. Indictments that were
brought against them by several persons whom they
had robbed at <hi>Hounslow, Hendon</hi> and several other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
upon the Road the 16th. and 18th. days of <hi>March</hi>
last; and taken from them their Horses, Gold, Silver,
Watches, Lace, Rings, Linnen and several other
things in the said Indictments particularly recited;
Ten of these Indictments were for Felony and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
the four last were for Murther of two of those
honest Country Men that assisted to take them; their
Names were <hi>Henry Miller</hi> and <hi>Edward Kemp;</hi> The
two first Indictments were taken upon the Coroners
Inquest for the killing of <hi>Henry Miller,</hi> against <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
Jackson</hi> one of the Prisoners at the Bar, who run
him through with his Rapier, and against the other
three as aiding and assisting him in the Murther.</p>
            <p>The other two Indictments were upon the Inquest
of the Grand Jury of <hi>Middlesex</hi> for the Murther of
the said <hi>Edward Kemp,</hi> by <hi>James Slader</hi> deceased,
and against the other four Prisoners for aiding and
assisting him, as in the former Indictment.</p>
            <p>It was held convenient to lay these Indictments
several ways, although the Facts were the same in
both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43123:4"/>
The first Indictment upon which they were Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
was for a Robbery at <hi>Hounslow</hi> upon the 16th.
of <hi>March</hi> last, where they Robbed one <hi>James Hepper</hi>
and several others in a Stage-Coach, and took from
them a Watch, Rings, Monies and other things of a
considerable value; to which <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi>
pleaded not Guilty, but the other two <hi>viz. Jackson</hi>
and <hi>White</hi> refused to plead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>White</hi> insisted that his Wife was taken Prisoner
(upon her going upon his occasions) upon suspicion of
Felony, whereas there was no just cause against her,
therefore desired that the Court would call her to a
Trial before he pleaded; that he might vindicate her
in that particular.</p>
            <p>The Court replied; there was no Inditement as
then ready against her, and therefore could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon her Trial, but that at her Trial she should
have justice done her, and willed him to plead.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jackson</hi> likewise refused to plead, alledging, That
the Country had Robbed him, instead of his robbing
of them, and had taken away 40s, of his own Mony
from him, which he desired might be restored before
he pleaded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Court</hi> answered, He should have all Justice
done him, but he must plead first; and that if he
should be Convicted, the Moneys ought not to be
restored to him, for it was then forfeited. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
neither the said <hi>Jackson</hi> nor <hi>White</hi> would
plead to the Inditement.</p>
            <p>Hereupon a second Indictment was read against them
and the other Two, for the Robbing of several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
upon the 18 of <hi>March</hi> last, to which they all
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>leaded not Guilty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43123:4"/>
A Third indictment was read against them for the
robing of one Mr. <hi>Periant</hi> about the same time. To
which again the said <hi>Jackson</hi> and <hi>White</hi> refused to
plead, insisting as before.</p>
            <p>They were told, They had already pleaded Not
Guilty to one Inditement; and if they refused to
plead now, they would be accessary to their own
Deaths, and be convicted as Mutes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
caused the words of the Statute to be read to
them.</p>
            <p>Wherein were set forth the Dreadful Punishments
that were to be inflicted upon such Convicts, by pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
Notwithstanding which, the many Arguments
that were tryed by the Court against such a destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
obstinacy, they wilfully stood it out till all the
Indictments were read over; to which the other
Two, viz. <hi>Parker</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> severally pleaded
<hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At last, after being urged with the danger of their
Refusals, and advised to consult together for their
own safety, they pleaded severally <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> to all
the Indictments.</p>
            <p>Then the Jury being sworn, and the Witnesses
called; the First Robbery was apparently proved by
a Watch and other things that were taken from them
by the Countrymen at <hi>Hampstead;</hi> which were own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by their Owners upon Oath. And so the Second,
Third, Fourth, and the rest of the Robberies were
so manifestly clear, that to most of them they could
say nothing; and what they could say, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by undeniable proofs that were brought against
them;</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Murther,</hi> it was proved by several of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43123:5"/>
Country-men that took them, That <hi>Jackson</hi> run
<hi>Henry Miller</hi> in at the Left-Side, upon which he
immediately dyed: And that the other, <hi>Edward
Kemp,</hi> was shot by <hi>Slader</hi> deceased.</p>
            <p>It being then urged, That they were all guilty of
the Murther, in that they were all together assisting
one another against a Power that was lawfully raised
to take them upo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> sent after them.
<hi>Parker</hi> insisted, That he was altogether Innocent of
the Murther, being before his Company as far as
<hi>Islington,</hi> when the Murther was done at <hi>Hampstead;</hi>
But that was disproved by Several Witnesses that
swore they were all together, or within a little one of
another when the Murthers were Committed. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Tryal having lasted above Six hours in all,
the Jury were sent out to consider of their Verdict;
which after a Quarter of an hours stay, they brought
in thus, That they were all Guilty of the Several
Facts laid in their Indictments of Felony and Robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
Except in the Two first, which could not be so
apparently proved against two of them.</p>
            <p>Upon the Two first Indictments for the Murther
of <hi>Miller, Jackson, Parker</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> were found
Guilty; but <hi>White</hi> was Acquitted, for that he was
taken before that Murther was committed; But upon
the Two last Indictments for the Murther of <hi>Kemp<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
they were all Four found Guilty. And the next day
