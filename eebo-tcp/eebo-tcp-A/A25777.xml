            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HE who Writes Argumentatively, must of courſe draw a Party againſt his Opinion. The Writer hereof Preſcribes not to any, but only puts in his Mite, in order to maintain, That <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> are an <hi>Engliſhman</hi>'s Birthright. And ſo by conſequence you muſt allow, that he is not for <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and wou'd be unwilling to furniſh one Board to make a Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold for ſuch a Building; and what he lays down, proves the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>But as he makes out the Happineſs of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, to be the Envy of our Neighbour-Countries; ſo likewiſe he agrees, That it is a <hi>Limited Mixt Monarchy,</hi> and endeavours in all places to keep an even Ballance betwixt the King and the People.</p>
            <p>He owns he has ſeen ſeveral Papers upon this Argument; but he is ſatisfied, his Readers will not think he is a Plagiary: ſome of thoſe who have
<pb facs="tcp:48354:3"/>
appeared, ſeem to have been angry, and others have not toucht upon our Author's Notions.</p>
            <p>The Ingenious Author of <hi>The Argument againſt a Standing Army,</hi> writes like a Gentleman of Quality and Parts, at leaſt his Stile ſpeaks him ſo, and he is all along treated as ſuch: and in return, he requeſts him, that if he reads this enſuing Paper, he will be pleaſed not to wreſt any thing to a wrong ſence, becauſe no hardſhip was intended.</p>
            <p>And will only add, that this is the firſt time he has appeared in Print; and that no Provocation from any Party ever induced him to this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking. He has delivered his Opinion, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to ſet all things in a fair Light, and leaves the Candid Reader to Judge of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and ſo bids him Farewel.</p>

            <head>THE ARGUMENT Againſt a Standing Army, DISCUSS'D.</head>
            <p>THAT the Author of the Pamphlet, which is here Examined, may not be prejudiced in the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Paper, ſhou'd it come to his Hands, I have thought fit to aſſure him on the Word of a Gentleman, That Liberty and Property are Glorious and Popular Names, and I hold them Sacred in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and therefore I will in all places, treat this Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Author with all the Reſpect due to a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Champion.</p>

To begin therefore with him, he meets you Cap in hand, with a fine Compliment,<note place="margin">Page 1.</note> 
               <q>ſetting forth the diſmal  Diſſolution which has been on the Theatre of the World, owing to the Growth and Progreſs of the <hi>French</hi> Power;</q> and draws from thence moſt admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, which are moſt certainly true, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>our thrice happy Situation, which has freed us from the Inſults of Foreigners, and made our Neighbour Nation the Scene of War, who lying open to the Inſults of Enemies, are forc'd to be upon their Guard, <hi>Hercules</hi> like, with Clubs in their Hands.<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> I agree alſo, that <hi>Neptune</hi> is our Titular God: That we are <hi>Medià Inſuperabiles undà,</hi>  and ſtand like the Earth, Immovable and Fixt. </q>But in the next Epithet we part: for tho' I agree with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Hiſtorian, who ſays, <hi>That our Wooden Walls are a good Defence;</hi> yet I fear, that the Internal Convulſions, which he ſays he dreads not, may come to paſs, unleſs ſome regular Forces (ſuch a Number as our worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives ſee fit;) be continued in Pay. And here I muſt beg my Reader to take along with him my Reaſons for the ſame, which may Bias his Opinion in my Favour.</p>
            <p>How long ago is it, That the Diſaffected to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, boaſted of their Numbers, and of having a <hi>Laodicean</hi> Party ready to cloſe upon fair Terms? Pray can you tell, that theſe Paſſive Gentlemen (becauſe at preſent, they vent not their Malice againſt the Government ſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they uſed,) are better Eſtabliſhed in the Notion of the King's Right? Alas! there are too many who look for Promotion on a Change, prompted by Duty (as ſome call it,) or an Indigency of Fortune, and will chop about like the Wind upon a proſperous Gale. Again, ought not means to be taken, to curb theſe Prancers, who (as our Authors Title Page has it,) wou'd put a <hi>Fraenum in Ore,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48354:4"/>
covering over their ſly Deſigns with pitiful Shams that will not paſs? but if it ſhou'd, they ſoon wou'd find out a Why-not, when the Tables were open, and ſo carry the Game: And Summoning the two famous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, Liberty and Property into the Field, will ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe Old Stories which have been in Man's Memory; and when we are deſtitute of Soldiers here, call in a Foreign Aid to back their Pretenſions. But of this, more when it falls in order and courſe; for now I muſt follow my Author into another Room, (and will not part with him where ever I find him Brave and Loyal.) He ſays, <q>Nature has been liberal to us in our Situation; our Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient Soil is productive of numerous Commodities, fit for Trade and Commerce: that Trade makes us Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Silver and Gold, which come without toiling in the Mine for it: that it Breeds us Able Bodied and Skilful Seamen, as much as even Luxury it ſelf can co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet.</q>  Methinks he has given us good Reaſons not to tempt any Ambitious Prince to venture at it: And if we have not a Power, (and that in Regulated Troops, not in his Militia Project, as I ſhall ſhew anon) pray what Aſſurance can we have of Peace and Quiet, longer then Grumblers ſee fit? Is it to be thought, that any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the Articles of Peace, will tempt the late King to be at Eaſe? Is he conſulted withal? or did he ſend any Propoſitions to the Congreſs? Is he of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving Temper? Pray put on a good Aſſurance in your Countenance, and tell me if he be. Is the Pretence of his preſumptive Son adjuſted, or not? Well, I find Silence grants the Point.</p>
            <p>This Point then being over, you are next pleaſed to put us in Mind, That the King is Mortal; and (to our Grief) we know it. On ſo ſad an Occaſion, give me leave to Remark, That by Virtue of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48354:5"/>
the Crown is likely to deſcend at his Death, on a Female; a Princeſs, who (tho' ſhe has all the Inherent and Noble Virtues of her great Anceſtors,) yet may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with Difficulties, to fix her ſelf Firm, if ſhe has not ſome Standing Forces of Regular Troops to oppoſe a ſudden Tumult: or ſhou'd ſhe Die firſt, a Prince in Minority is like to put in his Claim, who may meet with a Youth about his Age, to oppoſe him; the contrary whereof (as all good Subjects heartily wiſh, may never come to paſs:) ſo we ought to provide againſt: And what better way can there be, than having ſuch a Power who ſerved in that Capacity before. But now to go on with my Author, he ſays, <q>That we ought to be Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and not Slaves;</q> and goes here very wide of hisMark: for he tells us, <q>An Univerſal Deluge of Tyranny has overſpread the Face of the whole Earth.</q> (As for the word Whole, it might have been left out.) 'Tis well ſome Loyal Paſſages (interlarded like Bacon with Veal,) do acquit him of a malicious Cenſure: but as the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that were Aſſembled on <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Death, to conſult in the Choice of a King, ſaid, (ſo ſay I) <hi>I know not the Man, nor his Communication,</hi> ſo I am a ſtranger to his Perſon. I hope, as a Perſon of Honour ſaid in his Charge, <hi>That he has not</hi> Jacob'<hi>s Voice, and</hi> Eſau'<hi>s Hands:</hi> I only uſe this Expreſſion, becauſe he ſometimes (like a Cow). gives a good Meſs of Milk, and afterwards throws it down with his Tail.</p>
            <p>But I find I ſhall be too prolix in this Affair, if I ſally too far; and therefore I will endeavour to be as brief as I can.</p>
            <p>To go on therefore with him, I agree, <q>\That our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is a limited mixt Monarchy: that the King enjoys his Prerogatives:</q> (and why then wou'd you make them leſs than they are?) I alſo agree, <q>That the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48354:5"/>
People claim his Protection:</q> but unleſs you aſſign him a bigger Guard, an Army in diſguiſe at <hi>Knightsbridge</hi> will be to hard for him. You own, <q>That he is abridged from the Power of hurting us; and wou'd abridge him of the Pride he takes in defending you.</q> I alſo go along with you, when you ſay, <q>That ours is an Empire of Laws; that we have the ſame Right to our Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, as he has to his Crown.</q> But here the <hi>Jacobites</hi> will differ from you, and ſay, That they have a better Right to their Eſtates, than he has to his Crown. And are there ſuch Men, and muſt there be no Power to oppoſe them? I alſo agree, <q>That our Remedy is good againſt him in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi>
               </q> and I think the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Judges have ſufficiently attoned, for the Crimes and Errors of ſome of the former. I alſo avouch, <q>That only Law can put us in Priſon.</q> I think alſo, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were free; or St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have boaſted of being a <hi>Jew,</hi> of <hi>Tarſus</hi> a free City; nor thoſe that whipt him, have repented of the action. Thus far we go hand in hand. But methinks, His Majeſty's many gracious Aſſurances to his Parliaments, and the Honour he has of being known to keep his Word, might put this Point beyond all manner of Contradiction: and unleſs our Author had doubted of any Infringement of them he might have ſpared himſelf ſome trouble, and gone on to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now I find what <hi>Aeſop</hi> obſerves of Old to be true, that it is an eaſy matter to find a Stick to beat a Dog. <q>Now he dreams of Arbitrary Power, but couples it with the Licentiouſneſs of the People, which he ſays, may incline to Damocracy.</q> If our Author keeps a Kennel of Hounds, 'tis much he did not couple them better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He admires the Prudence of our Anceſtors, who made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48354:6"/>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 3.</note>a middle State of Nobility, to trim the Boat of the Commonwealth, to skreen the People from the Inſults of the Prince, and the Prince from the Popularity of the Commons; and gives a good Reaſon for what he  ſays, <hi>viz.</hi> To prevent the Ruin of either.</q>  And pray what is all this to the purpoſe? unleſs he would craftily inſinuate, that we were in ſome manner of Danger at preſent. What he goes on to tell us, is an Anſwer to himſelf, and ſpares me the trouble. He ſays, <q>That without the States in Parliament, no Laws can be made, nor a Penny of Money given: that the King ſummons the Grand Inqueſt, and the People boldly reſent their Grievances!</q>  A ſofter Word might have done as well.But now we are all one again, <q>He admires ſo juſt a Ballance, in making the one not too hard for the other two.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But now I muſt not ſet ſo cloſe to him, we have a little Difference, and I muſt go to the other end of the Table. For after he has ſpread the Cloth, and given us a Bill of Fare of very choice and rare Dainties, he begins to Tanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize us, as if he wou'd not have us eat: for he ſays, <q>The ſtrongeſt Conſtitutions are moſt liable to certain Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</q> A ſhame take it, he had rais'd my Stomach, and now I muſt not have what I expected: for after having deſcribed our Happineſs very pathetically, he ſpoils all, in telling us, <q>That the Wheel of this Noble Machin is out of order:</q> I am ſorry it was not the Wheel of Fortune: for now he doubts our Wiſdom, Integrity, and Courage. But preſently he begins to alter his Tune, and from ſaying, <q>That an univerſal Deluge of Tyranny had overſpread the Face of the whole Earth, he ſays that moſt Nations in <hi>Europe</hi> are oppreſt with Tyranny, and at the Will of a Mercileſs Prince's Fancy or Ambition, or the Inſolence of their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48354:6"/>
Officers. He talks of Nobility, (but names no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) that are only the Enſigns and Ornaments of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; and the People are the Beaſts of Burden, to ſupport the Luxury and Prodigality of their Maſter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 4.</note>Here I proteſt he has put out the Candle, and left me  in the dark, and I know not which way to turn my ſelf. But hold! I think I hear him again, it is he! What, are you come to own, that we have the Jewel Liberty ſtill left? then there is ſome Hopes: pray let us mind what he ſays, for this is the Corner-Stone of the Building; and for the ſake of ſuch, who may think there is more Beauty in the Fabrick, than you will find when you enter in, let us ſee what he has to ſhow, and by the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern judge of the Cloth.</p>
            <p>He lays it down as a Propoſition not to be oppoſed, That nothing but our Situation, has defended us from the Inconvenience of a Standing Army: (and pray may it not do ſo ſtill?) Have we loſt thoſe Conveniencies, have we a Prince on the Throne that we dare not truſt, that Jealouſies ſpring up before there are Occaſions? he has certainly a Proſpective-Glaſs, to ken farther than others; or wou'd raiſe Jealouſies, without any Cauſe of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition. Can the Actions of a Prince, whoſe Fame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds ſo loud in the Territories of diſtant Monarchies, be rendred Suſpitious at home, among ſuch who receive the Benefit of a juſt Adminiſtration? I muſt then needs deplore the Misfortune of ſo Great a Man, that he ſhou'd have Subjects not capable to diſcern the Bleſſings which daily ſhower down ſo plentifully upon us: and when our Conſtitution (as he himſelf obſerves) is Ballanced by King, Lords and Commons, and that by the mutual Occaſions and Neceſſities each has of the other; why; I ſay, ſhould we miſtruſt? It is granted on all Hands, That the Commons have the Right of diſpoſing of our Properties: and can we ſuppoſe, that thoſe who have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48354:7"/>
but the temporary Poſt of Three Years, and ſent from all Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and above 5000 in number, will give any Money out of their own Eſtates, as well as ours, to ſupport what is not convenient, or looks deſtructive to our Ancient Conſtitution. Admitting then this Point to be reaſonable, where is the Inconvenience of a preſent Standing Force? Let the Commons, when they find an Apprehenſion of Danger, (of which they are the moſt proper Judges) but withdraw their Benevolence to the Crown: or let them but give it as the Opinion of that Honourable Houſe, that it is likely to become grievous to the Subject: and then ſure no Man will miſtruſt, that a Prince, who came over on ſo Generous an Occaſion, will Eclipſe the future Annals of his Glorious Reign, by refuſing to grant their Requeſts.</p>
            <p>This Point then being cleared we will go on to what follows, in which I am certain I can make it plain that the <hi>Militia</hi> project can never take effect, and in this Point I muſt be very long, becauſe it is his Ladder of Ropes that he mounts by.</p>
            <p>I will not (as neer as I can) do my Antagoniſt wrong: He propoſes that the <hi>Militia</hi> (which ſhou'd be the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army) ſhou'd be compoſed of ſuch as have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. I proteſt I ſcarce underſtand his meaning, but if I do it is this, That the Yeomanry and the Farmers of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> who by Virtue of Freehold Eſtates ſend one, two, three, or four Men to the <hi>Militia,</hi> ſhou'd be obliged to go in perſon, 'tis granted that <hi>in propriaperſona</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repreſent this Number, but then he muſt get more where he can, for go he muſt and leave his Family to ſhift for themſelves, but here is a harder caſe yet behind; he who perhaps never Travelled to the neareſt Market Town without a Horſe muſt, take large Journeys on foot; nor is this all, it will look odd that a Man who perhaps dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48354:7"/>
employed three or four Men, muſt on a ſmall notice leave his Affairs at ſixes and ſevens: Nay his dear Wife and Children muſt put Finger in Eye at parting, who promiſed when they Married to be a mutual help and ſupport to each other, but alas there is no help, they muſt part. I think before this be put in practice, you ſhou'd get an Act of Parliament, or find ſome other way to alter the Marriage Service: I may alſo reaſonably imagine he is knockt o'th' head before he underſtands his Trade; the Widows of ſuch People will be wonderful fond of this Government: But theſe and many other things, he did not conſider, am ong the reſt perhaps the Wives fortune has much contributed to his Acquiſitions, but he (good Man) has his Mouthful of Dirt, and ſhe her Eyes full of Tears.</p>
            <p>But from the Foot let us travel to the Horſe, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how well thoſe that Ride will like their Poſt. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear ſome muttering as if they did not expect ſuch uſage, but they have the property and muſt go, or find out others which is as hard. Theſe in general have a real kindneſs for the Government, but is no regard to be had at home? There is perhaps an Heir in Minority to ſucceed too ſoon, ſhou'd he be ſlain in his Countries Cauſe, or perhaps the Maſculine Branch of an Ancient Family is in danger by this raſh undertaking to ſuffer a declenſion; you ſee Sir, I have ſet the Women upon you already but perhaps you are in hopes there may be ſome that want an occaſion to Marry again, I hope ſuch good Wives are not ſtrong enough to bring in the late King: for I really believe, the better ſort are greateſt in number.</p>
            <p>Pardon, Sir, this Digreſſion, and I will ſit nearer, that I may hear what you ſay. You appoint me my Servant, (I thank you Sir, and that's more than he will) for you
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48354:8"/>
propoſe, that he muſt be bound to perpetual Service during Life. Now I am come to the Point I drive at. I ſay then, what Servant will ever venture to take ſuch a Poſt upon him? and what Obligations can be fixt, to make this Servant, when he likes not his Maſter, to continue in Service: perhaps you wou'd propoſe to Bore him in the Ear at ſeven Years ſtanding, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did of Old) but I doubt the Promiſe of a <hi>Rachel</hi> and <hi>Leah</hi> both, will hardly induce theſe Itinerant ſort of Servants to ſtay. I my ſelf have heard divers of them declare, That a Curioſity to ſee other Countries in the Kingdom, was the ſole Motive; and that little or no Jars have ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in their former Service. Therefore I think this Project is like throwing Chaff to cunning Birds, it will not catch them.</p>
            <p>Or to go a ſtep higher, do you propoſe that any cou'd be liſted, the advance upon Wages wou'd be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. And if ever this Projector can bring it about to put ſuch hardſhips upon Men of Property, I think I am much miſtaken, but if he do I will averr that he has a Headpiece fit for a States Service.</p>
            <p>I cannot have done, yet I have another Suppoſal, you will ſure allow my Servant the Birthright of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man. Then as ſuch he muſt be told, that during Life (if his Limbs fail not) he is to be bound to perpetual Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, ſo that any thing elſe will be held a lame Excuſe. Had I been with my Author at his Penning this paſſage, I wou'd have got him (if he had not been in too much haſte) to allow a common Soldier this Priviledge, that if by the Death of any particular Friend he had aug mented his Fortune to live better, that he might have had power to put another in his Room; and it was the more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect it, becauſe on occaſion, he is ſuch a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for <hi>Britiſh</hi> Liberty, but I find he leaves him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48354:8"/>
with his Officers and will have nothing to do with him.</p>
            <p>But here alſo you ſeem to puzzle the Cauſe, by making no Proviſion if his Maſter and he ſhou'd fall out, 'tis no matter to me which may be in the wrong, but part they will, farewel ſays the Maſter to his Servant let me ſee who will Hire you, truly if I like the Man I cannot tell where to get him a Service. For who will venture to hire this Servant, who may on a few Days notice be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to his former Poſt? His new Maſter has no Title to him, and what is ſtill worſe, he has no Title to himſelf: an odd Method to ſecure Property. The unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs appears farther: he by this means becomes uſeful to his former Maſter, and he who Pays him his Wages, has no Benefit at all: Looks this like Freedom and Property? I trow not! Theſe Queſtions I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Men of a deep Reach in other Caſes, but never yet met with an <hi>Oedipus</hi> to unfold the Riddle.</p>
            <p>I am much afraid that thoſe who tell you, you may have Neighbours enough in whom you may truſt, have not ſpent their Time for 20 Years laſt paſt in a Country-Life, as I my ſelf have done. And therefore I will tell them, that I have had occaſion to make my Obſervations: and I proteſt that I am ſatisfied, 'tis not want of Loyalty in the Country People, that they covet Eaſe, but a deſire to Dye in their own Country Air, which makes them decline ſuch a Service: and tho' they have not many of them read <hi>Claudian,</hi> yet their ſtiffneſs herein puts me in mind of the Happineſs which he deſcribes, as pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Man that never went beyond his Pariſh-Bounds. Theſe are their Sentiments: and ſo you muſt look out for other Methods to ſupply the <hi>Militia,</hi> to have them uſeful.</p>
            <p>One Project is, That out of the Disbanded Forces,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48354:9"/>
Men may be procured to enter your Service. But let me ask you a plain Queſtion: What Reaſon have I to venture my Arms in the Hands of a Man you dare not truſt? Or what better Security can I have, that one who proffers me his Service, and is a Stranger, will be more for my dear Property, than if he were Liſted in a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Force. <q>And ſo (to uſe his own Words) this Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution muſt either ruin the Army, or the Army ruin the Conſtitution; which is offering a violence to Nature.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He goes on to tell us, <q>That where-ever the <hi>Militia</hi> is, there is, or will be the Government, in a ſhort time.</q> I will not be ſo Dogmatical, as to preſcribe to my Betters: but if you wou'd procure an Intereſt to bring in a Bill, to make the <hi>Militia</hi> uſeful; thoſe who ſend Men to it wou'd be pleaſed with the Project, to have the Gentlemen of the Country, without the addition of Inferior Officers, to be appointed by the King. And the Reaſon for it is plain, which is this, it is commonly a Truſt which divers Lieutenants of Counties have, to ſerve as Repreſentatives in Parliament, either for the County, or ſome Burrough-Town to which they may be Neighbours. Now it muſt be granted, That a Gentleman has a greater Regard to the County of his Nativity, than a Stranger can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to have; and thoſe whom they Muſter, in order to make uſeful, will with greater Alacrity undergo the Fatigue of Learning the Military Art; when many of thoſe under whom they ſerve, had their Votes and their Intereſt to ſend them to Parliament. They will then have more Patience to Learn, what a Stranger might by Blows endeavour to Inſinuate. So that upon the whole, it appears plain, That thoſe who fear Arbitrary Power, ought to find out Means to put this Project in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48354:9"/>
But perhaps a Man may object againſt this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' I might think it fair. He may perhaps ſay, it gives too much Authority to the People, and may prove detrimental to future Princes, ſhou'd the Commons not approve of a Prince's Adminiſtration. Liberty is a Popular Argument; and they will be apt to ſay, that we have no Cauſe to Miſtruſt, and therefore may baniſh our Fears. If there be any thing in the Argument, ſo good an Hiſtorian is capable of Anſwering it.</p>
            <p>But alas! you fear a ſmall Number may awe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The next time you Print, furniſh your ſelf with better Arguments; or elſe moſt People will be apt to conclude, That a ſmall Number of Standing Forces may be convenient in our preſent Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>That the Number intended or propoſed is to be ſmall, 'tis plain: for Orders are given to Disband divers Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments already. No notice is taken of the Wounds of ſuch, who ſuffered on ſo Publick an Occaſion: but it were well, if at the Head of their Regiments, when they are Disbanded, ſome Speech were made, in Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their former Service; and to tell them, That the Neceſſity of the Crown did not longer require their Aid. This Cuſtom wou'd not deviate from thoſe Commonwealths, which you admire for their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>But now having proved my Point, I muſt endeavour to be Friends with the Inn-keepers, who by this time will begin to Pray for me backwards. Why then Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men I have this to ſay, That the Number can never oppreſs you. It is propoſed to be but a Few, and your Repreſentatives in Parliament will give but what is neceſſary. So pray be content, and thank God you are rid of ſome, and in time I hope your Arrears will be Paid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:48354:10"/>
And now having ſufficiently proved, that our Author has ſtarted <hi>Chimaera's</hi> which enter not into other Peoples Heads; and therein proved, that if he ſhot at the White, he is far beyond the Mark: I come now to his <hi>Gothick</hi> Ballance, which I think is ſufficiently obſerved by the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and the Conſtitution in all Matters ſo exactly adjuſted, that he might have acquieſced in that Confidence: but ſince he goes on to aſſert a new Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That no Nation can preſerve its Liberties, which maintains an Army otherwiſe eſtabliſhed:</q> I hope he will give me liberty to make ſome material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to his <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray what was the Occaſion of the 23 Pitcht Battels betwixt the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter?</hi> but their confiding too much on the fickle Populace: and we find, that ſometimes one Houſe ſucceeded, and then another: but theſe many Revolutions were always owing to the want of a ſufficient Power at home, to ſuppreſs the ſtrength of Foreiners; which made it often end to the Advantage of the Invader. By which we may ſee, that Military Diſcipline is an excellent thing; and that the want of Standing Forces, has been the Cauſe of ſundry Revolutions. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army will always be for Property. Sure that which wou'd make our Enemies dread us abroad, ought not to be a Bugbear to our ſelves. Let us pauſe a while, and conſider; and then we ſhall find, that <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, a King of admirable Proweſs, wanting Strength at <hi>Boſworth-Field,</hi> proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to encounter his invading Antagoniſt, loſt his Life and Crown in the Cauſe. And a few Years before, <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth put that puſillanimous Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth to the Expence of his Life, for want of an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Power. This is certain, that <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter</hi> cou'd not be both in the Right; and yet Succeſs favoured
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48354:10"/>
both their Pretenſions: and thoſe frequent Changes are attributed by Hiſtorians to the Misfortune of Princes, that wanted a Land-Army in number ſufficient to quell ſuch un happy Tumults.</p>
            <p>By theſe Examples (and more I could add, were I not ſtinted in Time) it plainly appears, That a ſmall Number is for the Security of the Kingdom. And now I ſhall Methodically follow him.</p>
            <p>
               <q>He talks of ſome Men, who in the late Reigns aſſerted Liberty ſo vigorouſly, that they denied Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; and ſo very zealouſly, that they would ſcarce allow of the King's ordinary Guards:</q> but ſince he names not who they are, we may believe it, or not, as we pleaſe. But if ſuch there were, perhaps they ſooner pried into the Court-Deſigns than other Men; and ſo took care to prevent what might be Deſtructive by ill Management to the whole Conſtitution. Here he forgets to make a Diſtinction betwixt Circumſtances that happened at that time, and how the Caſe is now.</p>
            <p>We had then ſucceſſively two Princes on the Throne that had no pretenders to their Title, and tho' the laſt had a <hi>Perkin</hi> ſtarted upto give a defiance, yet the Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Power he brought made him a Scoff among his Friends; but when his preſent Majeſty arrived the Cauſe he came to maintain was ſo truly great and Glorious, that the ſame Prince with the advantage of a much greater power, was not able to oppoſe him: Does any one deſire a reaſon for it, why it was in brief a National Cauſe he came to ſupport, our Liberty and Property (moſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable Jewels) were his attendants, and he had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a juſt Cauſe: For that Army which was raiſed and kept on foot, as many Imagine for our deſtruction, theſe very Men turn'd to the Proteſtant ſide. From hence then let us draw this Natural Inference, That
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48354:11"/>
when a King of <hi>England</hi> endeavours to deſtroy our eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Conſtitution, (the which he is Sworn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) the Army (like true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Patriots) will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſent to it. Remember Sir the fate of <hi>Ship money,</hi> and end your fears, for <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> will never conſent to ruine themſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus I have I think fairly accounted for the great <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon,</hi> that without Force to back it Tyranny cannot be accompliſhed; let us be ſo fair to him (to whom we owe our eternal acknowledgments) as not to miſtruſt without Cauſe, and let this alſo be remarked, that when a Prince in poſſeſſion has an Antagoniſt alive who was himſelf in the Throne, he will not fail to take all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage he can of the miſrepreſentation of Things. Nay he has alſo one whom he calls his Lawful, Son who may in time grow to be Ambitious: This is enough to prove that it will be to the Nations Honour to have a ſetled Army, ſo proportioned as may ſeem beſt to the Judgment of our <hi>Auguſt</hi> Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who ruined the Bleſſed Martyr King <hi>Charls</hi> the Firſt, took occaſion to clip his Wings by leſſening the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Power, and then did an Act of Barbarity, which I wiſh had reach'd no further then our Native Country. <q>But my Author calls me again, and tells me that the Party who have thus veered about ſay, that if they do not comply with this method of a ſtanding Force, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party will be ready <hi>to gratify the Court</hi> in this affair.</q>  Truly I am ſorry any Party ſhou'd be againſt ſo modeſt a Requeſt, as a few ſtanding Forces, at leaſt let them be eſtabliſhed 'till the Projectors Friends can find out a way to make the <hi>Militia</hi> uſeful to their Country, and not oppreſſive to the People, let not the Kings Enemies have oppertunity to take away his Life, whilſt we want a Force to keep the next Succeſſor in the Throne. I am ſure then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48354:11"/>
'twill be too late to deplore, our Folly or our Overſight.</p>
            <p>And I differagain from our Author in this page alſo, where he ſays <q>that Arbitrary Power is the ſame in whoſe hands ſoever it falls,</q> for hereby he inſinuates that all thoſe who value the preſervation of his Majeſties Life are no better than <hi>Valet de Cambres</hi> to an ill deſign. I know none of them, but I am not ſo uncharitable, <q>He tells them alſo <hi>that the Party they fear will out flatter them, being Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Arbitrary power, and whoſe principles and Practices teach them to be Enemies to all Legal Rights,</hi>
               </q> To this Point ſuch as know his meaning are fitteſt to anſwer him, <q>becauſe he goes a ſtep higher, for he ſays they bring <hi>the Materials of Tyranny</hi> and <hi>are to give place to more expert Architects to finiſh the Building:</hi>

               <q>But now he is in good humour, and tells us we are free from any ſuch attempts in this Reign, and gives our  Prince Epithets of Praiſe, which all good Subjects know how well he deſerves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But ſtreight the Hypochondriac Fit ſeizes him, and he tells us, <q>That the King muſt Pay a Debt to Nature, and he knows not what may follow.</q> Pray Sir, to what purpoſe has the Parliament taken ſuch care to Point us out a Succeſſor? or, Do you doubt of Common Juſtice? I think, our <hi>Moſes</hi> has brought us within the ſight of our Promiſed Land; then let us not murmur, 'till we have Cauſe. What made ſo few go into the Land of Promiſe with <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua?</hi> Sure it was, Fearing where no Fear was. Let us not report our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be Giants, but glory that we have a <hi>David</hi> to defend us. Why then ſhou'd we miſtruſt a few Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Forces.

            <p>You have ſure in your Reading met with King <hi>Lear,</hi> his Story has been ſo often repreſented on the Stage, and acted with ſuch Advantage, that 'tis probable moſt Men of Underſtanding know his Caſe; his yielding too faſt to the Temper of a deſigning Party, reduced him at laſt to ſuch low Circumſtances, that his Miſery was deplored by his Friends, who cou'd not be capable to remedy the ſame.</p>
            <p>There is an excellent Story written in <hi>Italian,</hi> and from the Original Tranſlated into our Mother-Tongue by a Perſon of Honour, (now living) and Dedicated to our late Queen: it is called, <hi>The Count</hi> De Fieſque'<hi>s Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy to Destroy the State of</hi> Genoa; and the nearneſs of its being accompliſhed, ſhews us how much we ought to ſtand upon our Guard.</p>

               <q>For <hi>Agathocles,</hi> from being Captain-General of the <hi>Syracuſans,</hi> got ſuch an Intereſt in the Army, that he cut the Senators in pieces,  and the Richeſt of the People, and made himſelf their King.</q> He had better Fortune than <hi>Dennis</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> or elſe a late Poet in Verſe has done him wrong.</p>
            <p>But you have not done yet with your Fears; you ſay.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <q>The <hi>Romans,</hi> for fear of the <hi>Teutones</hi> and <hi>Cimbri,</hi> who threatned their Territories, choſe <hi>Marius</hi> to be their  General; and that he and <hi>Sylla,</hi> inſinuating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into the Favour of the Army, did much Miſchief.</q> So that not a Man or Farthing, is to be granted on this Score.</p>
            <p>You ſay Sir,<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> 
               <q>That the Prolongation of <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in <hi>Gallia,</hi> made him able to ſeiſe on <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf;  and alſo, that he was able to take upon him the Office of Perpetual Dictator. Thoſe things therefore which were</q> acted ſo many Centuries ago, muſt be a Bar to future Pretences. Had you been as fair as you ought to be, you might have told us, what ſuch of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Kings who aim'd at Arbitrary Power, got by the Bargain. But you are full of your Stories, and ſay, <q>
                  <hi>That</hi> Olivarotto di Fermo <hi>having leave of his Fellow-Citizens to enter the Town with 100 Horſe, he put all the principal Citizens to the Sword, and proclaimed himſelf their Prince.</hi>
               </q>

            <p>You add, <q>That <hi>Francis Sforza</hi> made himſelf, from General of the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> their Duke;</q> and you make ours a Duke of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now Sir you come to a more Modern Story, of <q>
                  <hi>Chriſtiern</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who was alſo King of <hi>Sweden;</hi>
               </q> and tells us of his Treachery: and I think he paid dear enough for his Treachery; for he was driven out of <hi>Sweden</hi> by <hi>Gustavus Ericſon:</hi> but alas! <note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note>

you ſay, they ſoon found their Miſtake, which I think, was not the worſe.</p>
            <p>Then the late ingenious Authors Story of <hi>Denmark,</hi> is brought upon the Stage, which is more to the purpoſe than any thing has been ſaid; but if they are miſerable, their over Credulity contributed to the Cheat: For as that Gentleman ſays, That King was willing to grant what their Modeſty never requeſted. And why ſhou'd our King not be thought as fair a Prince? I am of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion we are not half ſo Modeſt.</p>
            <p>Old <hi>Oliver</hi> muſt not reſt in his Grave, tho' an Act of Grace has pardoned the Tranſgreſſors. I really think, that our withdrawing due Relief from King <hi>Charles</hi> I. brought thoſe Miſeries upon our Heads.</p>
            <p>And now to pin the Basket for us; we Journey from our own Country, (and a good Journey it is we take;) 'tis only to the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> for nothing, but to prove, That provoked Servants will be revenged upon inſolent Maſters, when they have opportunity, which is no great Matter.</p>
            <p>Had his Hiſtory not ended here, he wou'd have told us, what Robberies have been committed on the King's High Ways by the Soldiery; but that I think wou'd not have ſerved his purpoſe; for then it wou'd have been returned upon him, that he muſt be more expoſed: for ſome of them (if Disbanded) are not able to Dig, and to Beg they are aſhamed; ſo he wiſely lets it alone.</p>
            <p>But ſince our Author is ſilent, I will crave leave to handle this Matter a little, and let us conſider what we ſhall do for them. Is the Danger they have undergone to be forgotten? Remember Sir, it was our Countries Cauſe. No, rather than that ſhall be ſuffered, I will pour ſome Oil into your Wounds, or at leaſt afford you a Noble Pity.</p>

Gentlemen, thoſe Common-wealths your Adverſary ſo much approves of for their good Laws, he owns, had always a good regard to Merit: but he has done with you, and is not ſo much as for giving you Thanks, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Proviſion for you. Holy Writ tells us, That of Ten Cripples which were healed, there was but one of them grateful to his great Benefactor; and as he is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for his Goodneſs, ſo is his Country taken notice of, for he was a <hi>Samaritan:</hi> and that good <hi>Samaritan</hi> I will be, in owning, That by your Valour and Courage, you have made other Countries the Scene of War, and left us to poſſeſs our Eſtates in eaſe and freedom.</p>
            <p>And ſince he has left Part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, I will tell you, That <hi>Caius Marius</hi> had never been choſen ſeven times Conſul of <hi>Rome,</hi> had not his Wounds pleaded his Cauſe. The meanneſs of his Birth was twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his teeth, by ſuch who oppoſed him, and were of Noble Parentage. But theſe wiſe <hi>Romans</hi> obſerved what <hi>Cato</hi> told a decayed Nobleman (who had upbraided his Parentage,) That he had rather be the firſt of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the laſt. Here Merit, and not Birth, got the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant: ſo true a value they ſet on Noble Performances.</p>
            <p>But to go on with my Author, and to ſhew, that he has read more Hiſtory than he has quoted; he owns, <q>That <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Venice</hi> had met with no Oppreſſions; and tho' they keep large Armies, they have not loſt their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties.</q> I thank you Sir, for this Favour.</p>
            <p>He goes on to tell us his Reaſon for it;<note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> That <hi>Venice</hi> cannot be Attack'd but by the Sea. And here he might  have inſtanced in the late Action at <hi>Scio;</hi> The <hi>Venetians</hi> we know, after they had taken it, loſt it again ſuddenly to the <hi>Turks.</hi> Now, had there been a ſufficient number of Regulated Forces in it, thoſe with the Fleet, might have done admirable Service.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48354:14"/>
'Tis not my deſign to reflect on a Fleet; I honour them ever ſince I read the Hiſtory of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in 1588. under the Conduct of Sir <hi>Francis Drake;</hi> and that Action ſufficiently proves the uſefulneſs of them, and ſerves to fill up the Annals of that Glorious Reign: No! all my Deſign is to prove, that ſome few Regulated Forces cannot hurt us; and I ſhould have been loath to have heard, that Expedition-Wind ſhou'd have proved in our Teeth, becauſe her <hi>Militia</hi> might not have met with that Succeſs; and then the caſe had prov'd too late the neceſſity of Regulated Troops. I hope <hi>Neptune</hi> will always extend his <hi>Trident</hi> in our Favour, and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament take care of Land Forces.</p>
            <p>Then he goes on to tell us, <hi>how Fortunate the</hi> Dutch <hi>are, and that Art and Nature have done their Parts; and that the Strength of their Towns, and ſhutting up of their Gates, can prevent any dangerous Deſign.</hi> Pray have we not Towns of Strength as well as they? Let <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and <hi>Hull</hi> tell him ſo! And till we have a viſible Cauſe, let us not be ſo over cautious as to fear, our late Prince is now out of doors; and to miſtruſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proweſs, we have no cauſe.</p>
            <p>What is it then he fears? I wiſh I knew, that I might tell you. He ſeems to acquit the King <hi>of any ill Deſign,</hi> (and if he had not, others would have done it for him;) Why then, I find it muſt be thoſe that come after that he is afraid of. I ſee, that whilſt he tells us, The King is mortal, he thinks not of Mortality himſelf; or would be more thoughtful of what becomes of his Poſterity, than others, who think it as dear to them. <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> are my Darlings; and if I thought them in danger, I aſſure him, that I would be as ſtrenuous an Aſſerter of them as any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man whatſoever. It was my Zeal for the Publick Good, made me rejoice at this Princes

Arrival, and I cloſed in with the Government when others ſtood at Bay, to ſee what might happen. On this account, I thought I might have a good pretence to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it; and I knew no time better than now, when I find that ſo great Merit is like to be Rewarded, only in making ſo great a Prince a King of Clouts.</p>
            <p>But for all this, our Author remains ſtill in his Fears, leſt the King ſhould be <hi>perpetual General.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 11.</note> He who has  ſuch Precaution, ſure takes great care not to put out his Money in ill Hands; for he who miſtruſts Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, can never be pleaſed with any Security.</p>
            <p>But now he owns, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>That the Family of the <hi>Medices</hi> and <hi>Lewis XI. laid a Foundation of Tyranny without the Aſſiſtance of an Army;</hi> and this makes me bound to tell him again, that <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hearts, and <hi>Britiſh</hi> Honeſty: ſo that, if any <hi>Prince ſhould hereafter</hi> (for I agree with you, that this will not:) <hi>endeavour to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave us,</hi> a competent number of them in a Regulated Army, will certainly prevent any ſuch a treacherous Deſign.</p>
            <p>On the whole therefore, it is plain, That Liberty and a Standing Army are not ſuch incoherent things; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prove a neceſſity on us, to bridle the Ambition of any future Aſpiring Monarch.</p>
            <p>I think by this time you will own, they are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if any Perſon comes who has nothing to do here; their Valour proves my Aſſertion. And the Great <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries, gives us occaſion to think well of our ſelves, when ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Colonies could not prevent our ſhewing our Reſentments.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note>But now you muſt make a ſtep along with our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor from the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> and 'tis on as frivolous  an occaſion as was that of his <hi>French</hi> Colony; for 'tis only to prove the Miſery of Tyranny, as that ſhew'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48354:15"/>
the great Folly of caſting away a neceſſary Defence.</p>
            <p>Our Author next makes a long Liſt, of what Countries are free, and what are not; of which, he aſcribes the Liberty of the one, and the Slavery of the other, to their having or wanting Standing Armies. It would be tedious to examin by piecemeal, all that he lumps in this Paragraph: <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Tuſcany</hi> have no Standing Armies, nor is <hi>Portugal</hi> an Enſlaved Country. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> all but the Nobility, live in more abandoned Slavery than the <hi>Chineſes.</hi> I don't know what he means by the Seat of the Government, unleſs he means <hi>Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and <hi>Venice:</hi> otherwiſe it is well known, that both the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> keep Regular Forces within their Dominions. The Liberty of <hi>Poland</hi> is ſo little to be boaſted of, that theſe laſt 18 Months Experience ſhews, what Convulſions every King's Death may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably make, even almoſt to the Unhinging of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and no Generation can be morally ſure of living Six Months without a Civil War.</p>
            <p>But now he comes on to tell us,<note place="margin">Pag. 12.</note> 
               <q>That ſome time or  other all Countries lye under an unhappy neceſſity of Defending themſelves by Arms; but he ſays, It is when Princes Rule with a Rod of Iron.</q> I ſee, his preſent Happineſs cannot eclipſe his Fears. I hope his extream Caution proceeds from a Fear of the late King's coming again, and then I can excuſe him; but 'till then, why ſhou'd his Melancholy diſcompoſe others, becauſe it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders him?</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that he owns, <hi>that that Nation is ſafeſt in Peace, that carry their Swords by their ſides, becauſe they have leaſt occaſion to uſe them,</hi> he cannot be thankful for that Bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Conſider, Sir, an old ſaying, <hi>No Peny, no Pater Noſter,</hi> when Army's appear dangerous, let the Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw

their Purſes and we are ſafe, but if he ſtill urges <hi>that they will plunder and take care for themſelves,</hi> let them if they are <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men attempt it, and at the loſs of their Lives they will pay for the Project, and then Sir I will be of your ſide: But he brings the Bravery of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in queſtion when he ſays, <q>
                  <hi>he doubts our tamely ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it:</hi>
               </q> Remember the late King's Fate, if you will not, thoſe that come after and follow his ſteps have a fair warning.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note>But ſtill he has not baniſht his fears, <q>
                  <hi>The Militia he ſays are not uſeful</hi>
               </q>  tho' he thinks them uſeful enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend  the King. This Sir I cannot thank you for.</p>
            <p>
               <q>From one Error he falls into more: He now fears <hi>that they will be Capable to Influence Elections;</hi>
               </q> this is very ſtrange indeed, did he never hear what the late King got by cloſetting? and can Inferiour perſons if they have ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns meet with better ſucceſs than a King in Power? Pray Sir how many Officers on Honour quitted Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Poſts when they ſaw what he drove at, and they ought to be taken notice of for their Bravery, ſuch again wou'd be quickly found on the like occaſion, and ſuch being backt with right on their ſides, wou'd with the <q>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Freeholders and Commoners ſhew how much they value property, by routing a Body <hi>of ſuch Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamuffins</hi> as you Term a <hi>ſtanding Army.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Miſery of Arms in the Hands of Slaves, he ſays, makes the Government of the <hi>Turks</hi> uneaſy:</q> and yet he preſcribes our Servants, <hi>To bear our Arms, for our Safety.</hi> This is going about by the Wood, when a Foot-Path will lead your nearer to the Church.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:48354:16"/>
But we have not yet done with his Fears, <note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note>
               <q>The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the King has, in giving ſo many Offices, ſticks in his Stomach; in which he is ſo modeſt, as not to exempt from the Laſh ſuch as are of his Houſhold, his Revenue, State, Law, Religion, or Navy; and theſe muſt of courſe ſtick to the Men that are for Arbitrary Power; and theſe will bring unhappy Quarrels among our ſelves, and put us upon a chargeable War, with a  vaſt Expence of Blood and Treaſure: and for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he tells us, That we muſt arm our ſelves againſt the Court. I confeſs he names not the King, but I thought he was part of the Court; and then the Author ſaid it, and not my ſelf; for he tacitly accuſes all the Eſtates of Parliament, for ſaying, 'That we are more beholden to Fortune, than our own Efforts, that this has not already happened.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then he brings in an Inſtance of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, <hi>That if he had had 5000 Men before-hand with us, our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had been gone without ſtriking a Stroke.</hi> Here he arraigns the Juſtice of the Nation, who ſolemnized the Day of his Martyrdom by Act of Parliament; which had they deem'd him a Tyrant in his Temper, 'tis not to be thought he wou'd have had that Favour: his <hi>Exit</hi> was Bloody, but 'tis more unnatural to Revile the Memory of the Dead.</p>
            <p>As for what you ſay of the late King, no body at this time will ſtand up to aſſert his Actions; but in what you ſay of him, I differ from you: <hi>For I cannot think that Army wou'd have brought in Arbitrary Power, had not Popery been intended:</hi> for which you had my Reaſons before. But we are not now debating King <hi>James</hi>'s Affairs; he knows better why he withdrew, than I can tell you.</p>
            <p>But again, Old <hi>Noll</hi> is brought upon the Stage, <hi>with the Story of 17000 Men, which he left in Arms at his Death.</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48354:17"/>
Pray did theſe Men hinder the Loyal Party from bringing back their Lawful Sovereign, No! they were ſo far from that, that they contributed to his Reſtauration. As for the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Expedition, it ſeems to have been at firſt a Trick of State, in which you are ſilent, he was perhaps the Darling of the People: but you know his Succeſs, and may have read, that the <hi>Amorites</hi> were not deſtroyed, 'till their Sins were ripe for Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As for <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s <hi>Pharſalian</hi> Battel, with 22000 Men, he had Succeſs wherever he went;</q> and is thought by many to merit what he got. But now the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empires run in your Head; and what was done there, is a Conſequence of what may be done here: a pretty ſort of Argument, as if our Conſtitutions were the ſame.</p>
            <p>I have been told, that the Triſling Ceremony of <hi>Striking a Flag,</hi> was one Pretence of breaking the late Peace: and according to your own Rule, <hi>What was done yeſterday, may again come to paſs.</hi> The ſame Prince is now on the Throne, as well as two Pretenders to ours, in his <hi>Territories;</hi> and he is ſo little of our Author's Opinion, that he purpoſes to keep a conſiderable Land-Army: Are their Swords to grow ruſty? or are they all to go into <hi>Poland?</hi> You give an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader great Encouragement to come hither, when you tell him, <hi>That little numbers may effect an Ambitious Deſign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I can tell you this, (of which you ſeem ignorant) that an Ignominious B reach of the preſent Peace, wou'd convince the Aggreſſor, That an <hi>Engliſh man</hi> can reſent Affronts; and Fight well, when he likes the Cauſe. And whent he Torrent of Arbitrary Power ſeem'd at any time floating in a Prince's Head, his Subjects have ſoon taken that Occaſion to make his Reign uneaſy. But you are of a contrary Opinion, and are commonly ready with a <hi>Doubt,</hi> or a <hi>May be:</hi> you doubt, <hi>If the King has an Army,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48354:17"/>
it muſt ruin us.</hi> You forget they are <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and repeat your Fears oftner than ſome do their Prayers.</p>
            <p>But you are ſo fair as to own,<note place="margin">Pa. 15.</note> 
               <q>That thoſe who are for  a Standing Army, would not have it made part of the Conſtitution, but be kept only 'till <hi>Europe</hi> is in better Circumſtances.</q> But at this you have alſo a ſling.</p>
            <p>You fear, <hi>it will last the Life of K.</hi> James; and then ſtart a Doubt, which perhaps we had not heard of; <hi>That Prince</hi> Prettiman <hi>may be in the flower of his Age, and in full vigour; and is more to be feared, than an unhappy Man ſinking under the Load of Age and Misfortune.</hi> And I can find, that on particular Occaſions, you can afford one Prince more Pity than another. 'Tis much you ſhou'd own the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>exhauſted;</hi> and think, <hi>That ſo ſoon as he has fetcht Breath, it may be dangerous.</hi> Remember Sir, he has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the contrary.

Why then you will reply, <hi>What need is there of an Army?</hi> I will tell you, that moſt Men wou'd think it ſtrange that came to ſee our Country, to find that we miſtruſted that our Prince wou'd turn Tyrant, and therefore we kept the power in our own hands, A Suſpition that never entred into the breaſts of thoſe Princes, whoſe Armies he had lead, but <q>alas this Gentleman only argues for argument ſake.

               </q> in which alſo I agree with you.</p>
            <p>But in his next notion we part again, for he tells us in <hi>Latin</hi> to this effect, <hi>that an Army will as certainly raiſe Money, as they</hi> will <hi>intrench upon our priviledges;</hi> or <hi>a little neerer to my Authors ſence, he who has power will obtain by force what Right denies.</hi> 'Tis hard to make the Irregularities of ſome Armies an Inſtance to all, but alas it is his precaution, and we muſt excuſe a good Intention.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he has done with his fears, I will have done with them too, he fears <q>
                  <hi>the ſhutting up of the Exchequer;</hi> which he ſays <hi>is only diſobliging a few Tally Jobbers, and 3 Millions according</hi>

he repaires to the Reign of <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> but the caſe is not a Parallel.</p>
            <p>From hence he proceeds to his Sentiments of <hi>the Exchequer Officers at this time,</hi> and tells us, <q>
                  <hi>that the Annuity-People are thoſe who Rely on His Majeſties Virtue, and not the Juſtice of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Officers.</hi>
               </q> And is His Majeſties virtue ſo eminent and cannot we think it to be convenient to preſerve his Perſon? No better way can be propoſed than a few Regulated Forces, and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Pay from the Bounty of the Commons, can have it withdrawn when reaſonable, and they then muſt ſink of courſe.</p>
            <p>But having had his fling at the Exchequer Officers, who know beſt how to defend themſelves, he ſays, that <q>
                  <hi>we ought not to hazard ſuch virtue by leading it into Temptation,</hi> which he ſays, <hi>is our Duty to pray againſt.</hi> And he thinks it <hi>an Age of Miracles if they be not Seduced;</hi> for <hi>our Heroes,</hi> (he ſays) <hi>are of a coarſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay and have too much droſs mixt with their Conſtitutions</hi>
               </q> for ſuch refin'd Principles. In this ſay I, <hi>qui capit ille facit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Fit comes on him apace again, he ſays, that <q>
                  <hi>in the little Experience he has had in the World, he has obſerv'd moſt Men to do as much miſchief as lay in their power;</hi>
               </q> this is a general drawing upon Mankind and this (if nothing elſe) ſhou'd keep him <hi>in Cognito.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he had proved his Aſſertion, I own what follows to be a Natural Conſequence, <hi>That we ought not to truſt our Weapons with Children or Mad Men;</hi> and for this reaſon his Inſtance of the Addreſs of the Sheep to <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Boccaline,</hi> is very proper, <hi>That they deſired for the future that the Wolves might have no Teeth.</hi> But in this, Sir, as you ſhow your Teeth, let them be Angry whom you Bite.</p>
            <p>Then he puts an Argument into our Heads; that <q>
                  <hi>'tis Tyrant neceſſity, and that France is great; and therefore an Army we muſt have and cannot be without it,</hi> and that if <hi>we muſt be ſlaves; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince is better than a Popiſh one, eſpecially the Fr—King.</hi>
               </q> I ſhou'd never have put this queſtion, becauſe I cannot be ſo ill Natur'd as to have any ſuch Melancholy apprehenſions; you own Sir that the Seas may Guard us, 'tis a Power I honour: but of old the Jews were amazed to ſee a Man who at a word cou'd Command the Winds and the Seas to obey him. And if we cannot be as certain of their aſſiſtance as we are of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48354:19"/>
a Critical Minute may happen; and then what Comfort will it be to cry, <hi>this was an unfortunate accident, who wou'd have thought it.</hi> On ſuch an occaſion I cou'd borrow your Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (for you have enough to ſpare) and in that humour reflect upon the great misfortune; but where wou'd be my Comfort to ſay, <hi>this was a complication of Cauſes that may never happen again:</hi> for if we have no ſtanding Forces what can be done on a ſudden to oppoſe this Force of an Invader? for I will grant with you, <hi>that we might know of his coming,</hi> but alſo I muſt allow the Managers of ſuch an Expedition wou'd not loſe a proſperous Gale; away he comes, and then I increaſe my fears for want of Forces.</p>
            <p>'Tis not ſo Ridiculous a thing as you make it, to have us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the thoughts, that we may be Invaded? Pray was not the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armado upon our Coaſts before we expected it; and yet'tis not unlikely but we knew of the preparation, had the Fleet fail'd our <hi>Militia</hi> powers had been try'd. As <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men, I ſhou'd not have doubted their Courage, but ſhou'd have ſuſpected their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, and Regularity in Fighting is a great advantage.</p>
            <p>But as I gave you ſome inſtances of the advantage Invaders have had, where a Competent Number of ſtanding Forces have not been ready to oppoſe them: So I cou'd raiſe Arguments from Examples that they have been of Excellent uſe, and not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in our own Kingdom; but for Brevity ſake I omit to name them, unleſs you pleaſe to aſſert the Contrary.</p>
            <p>I find our Conſtitutions differ ſtrangly, when you are moſt ſecure, then I am in fear; for whilſt you <hi>extol our ſecurity in a Fleet, I am afraid of a Contrary Wind.</hi> I doubt not of our <hi>Marine</hi> Bravery but dread their misfortune; ſtill I am afraid leſt <hi>Boreas</hi> ſhould blow in their Teeth, ſuch things have been heard of, and you know <hi>what has been may be.</hi> This is a fair propoſition you muſt own, and what ſhall we do in this Caſe my Maſters? why, you will ſay we may have the liberty to go to a <hi>Politick Coffee-Houſe,</hi> and ſay <hi>who wou'd have thought it.</hi> I cou'd alſo urge, that we may have diviſions among our ſelves which will do us no kindneſs; and what advantage we may reap by ſuch a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, you may gueſs when you call to mind the old Proverb <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and Reign;</hi> and ſure by this time you will ſay I have prov'd that a modeſt number makes us ſecure; and whilſt if they Land our Army Fights them, the Wind may chop about, and make our Fleet do us Service to prevent their Flight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48354:19"/>
But you ſay, <hi>That no Wind can deprive us of Intelligence from France:</hi> and purſuing your Humour, you ſay, <hi>There have been Errors in the Management of the Fleet.</hi> 'Tis well the Land-Army has one to help to bear their Burden: this is the firſt Broadſide you have given the Fleet.</p>
            <p>As you manage your Affairs, you leave no body to take your part: for having laid the Land Army and Fleet on their backs, then the <hi>wretched States-men</hi> are put in, to leaven and ſowr the whole Lump.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 20</note>Then, <hi>The Officers of the Fleet may be Corrupted:</hi> and pray  Sir, then why ſhou'd we not be, as <hi>Hudibras</hi> has it, with Two Strings to our Bow? Who angles, without a Reſerve of Hooks in his Pocket? Who goes to the Tavern, to Drink but once? Who would make but One Parliament-Man, if he cou'd have Two? and in more than theſe things, this Rule does hold: And why then ſhou'd we not have Land, as well as Sea Forces: for as you obſerve, Nothing but a <hi>Concomitancy of Cauſes,</hi> can ever make them both betray us.</p>
            <p>By the way, Sir, I doubt not of either; but you <hi>doubt them both:</hi> yet admitting one to be falſe, the other may do us ſervice; one God, and one King, is ſufficient: but Land and Sea Forces are beſt in conjunction.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">ibid.</note>But now you ſpeak what pleaſes me much, <hi>That a Well-train'd</hi>  Militia <hi>may do us Service.</hi> I wiſh you had acquainted us, in how long time they might have been made ſerviceable; for I ſhou'd perhaps be apt to lay it at a longer time than you. Muſt the Army be forthwith Disbanded, and the King have no body but his <hi>Penſioners</hi> and his <hi>Beef-Eaters</hi> to look after him? 'Tis an odd way of Rewarding Merit, and will ſound but meanly in Foreign Countries.</p>
            <p>But you go on with a Method I never heard of, <hi>viz Cudgelling a Man into a Hero:</hi> nor is it uſual to call thoſe Men <hi>Ragamuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins,</hi> and <hi>Henrooſt-Robbers,</hi> whoſe Employments it is to fight for their Country, and who have ſo ſucceſsfully fought for it. But I am in no Poſt of that quality, and ſo you do not in this Clauſe level at me.</p>
            <p>But to Sugar-over his ſowr Grapes, which have ſet my Teeth on Edge; he entertains us with an <hi>Account of the deteſtable Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the late Reigns, That they us'd their utmoſt Art and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to Diſarm the People, and make the</hi> Militia <hi>uſeleſs to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48354:20"/>
countenance a Standing Army, in order to bring in Popery and Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;</hi> and much more, to the ſame Tune. And then he diſcovers a ſtrange Secret, <hi>viz. That ſuch Officers as were more zealous in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing their Companies than others, were Reprimanded, as if they deſign'd to raiſe a Rebellion.</hi> I am apt to think, the Story may be true; and if I met my Author, I wou'd be out of his Debt, in telling him a Story much of the ſame nature; That <hi>Fowling-Pieces</hi> were thought <hi>dangerous Weapons,</hi> in the Hands of ſuch as were for the <hi>Bill of Excluſion,</hi> or againſt <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi> But now to the Matter in hand.</p>
            <p>And now you are come to your <hi>Why nots?</hi> which I ſhall ſet in their Files, and Muſter them, as well as I am capable. <note place="margin">Pag. 21.</note>Your firſt Project is, <hi>To have Croſs-Bows turn'd into Fire-Locks, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent number of them to be kept in every Pariſh, for the Young-Men to Exerciſe with on Holidays; and Rewards offered to the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, to ſtir up their Emulation.</hi> For this Project the Apprentices will thank you, more than their Maſters. Nor is this all the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; the <hi>Play-Houſes</hi> and <hi>Cheeſcake-Towns</hi> would be much diſappointed.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another unlucky Objection behind, which is, That it might be conniv'd at on Sundays; and then you muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the Book of <hi>Sports,</hi> which did a certain King no great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. I fear alſo, that the Parſons would catch Cold in their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, for want of the Breath of a good Audience.</p>
            <p>Then, <hi>Item</hi> Secondly, <hi>You are for reducing the whole</hi> Militia <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>to 60000 Men; and the third part of them to be kept to conſtant Exerciſe.</hi> But be ſure you firſt make them ſo uſeful, as that proper Judges may find no Objection.</p>
            <p>But your next <hi>Why not</hi> I cannot endure, it is meer Stuff; you ſay, <hi>Why may not a Man be Liſted in the</hi> Militia, <hi>'till he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by his Maſter?</hi> I will not diſpute, what ſuch a Favour wou'd coſt: but I believe, few Men carry ſo much Money about them as will do the Buſineſs. Nay more, what occaſion has a Maſter to diſcharge his Servant? he told him at firſt, what he muſt truſt to, and ſo let him compound as well as he can. And by this time ſure you will grant, that it is not ſo eaſy, as to be <hi>Diſcharg'd by his Captain.</hi> But you put harder on us ſtill, in <hi>Propoſing to have the ſame Horſe forth-coming, unleſs it can be made appear, that he is either Dead or Maimed.</hi> And who muſt be this <hi>Affidavit</hi> Man? why who ſhou'd, but the Man of Property; what has he to do at home?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48354:20"/>
More Reaſons I cou'd urge on this Head: but leſt you think this a Sham, I will tell you, he who ſends to Horſe or Foot, muſt be obliged on the Penalty of a great Fine, to appear according to his Qualification. If when I have uſed my endeavour, and found out a Man, I ſhall be much more plagu'd for my Horſe; I muſt either keep him for ſudden Service, or he is uſeleſs: he muſt not ſerve my Coach nor Cart, for then the Mark of his Traces will be a Grievance: and if I keep him too Fat, my Rider cannot Manage him. Hard Terms are theſe, to Men of <hi>Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had better not have ſo mean a Character of our King, ſince there is ſuch a difficulty in the manner of ſurbiſhing our Armes. Our Piſtols may lye damp and ſo make a falſe Fire, and then a Surgeon comes upon you for the Cure; A Man ſure wou'd not be fond of his Poſt, when he heard my laſt Man was ſlain in hot Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, with the accumulated misfortune of leaving behind him a ſorrowful Wife and Infant Children.</p>
            <p>But to your next <hi>why not</hi> you ſay <hi>private Soldiers in the Army when they are diſperſed in the ſeveral parts of the Kingdom may be ſent to the Militia, and the Inferiour Officers in the Army may in ſome Proportion Command them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe Sir the Gentry of the Country are Loyal, but this is a very Chargable poſt you ſix them in, for they muſt Treat as well as Teach their Soldiers, and you have aſſigned them no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. No matter you will ſay, they are Gentlemen of plentiful Fortunes, but I muſt remark this, that the Farmers Wives wereſate againſt you before, and now you have made Ladies of Quality not fond of your project. Remember Sir a multitude is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable thing, but it was your own act and deed, or elſe you ought for fear of Cenſure to clear your ſelf; for you propoſe <hi>they will fight</hi> and I muſt add another ſuppoſal to yours, <hi>viz. they may be Slain,</hi> and then you muſt pray to God to keep your Eyſight.</p>
            <p>But after theſe Objections, cou'd your Project come to any effect, they wou'd be as chargeable as a Standing Army.</p>
            <p>Your Inſtances of <hi>Jerſey, Guernſey, Poland,</hi> and <hi>Switzerland,</hi> nay and your beloved Country of the <hi>Griſons,</hi> are wide of the Mark, and hit not your Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>What the <hi>London-Apprentices</hi> did, is alſo an Argument againſt your ſelf; for there was <hi>Major-General Property</hi> led them on, and Raw Men quickly beat a Regulated Army. Conſider that! the Matter ſwells upon my Hand. This which I have ſaid, is an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48354:21"/>
Anſwer likewiſe to the <hi>Vaudois, Miquelets,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</p>
            <p>You are the firſt Man that ever doubted of the King's oppoſing Military Art, <hi>by appearing at the Head of an Army of Young Nobility and Gentry.</hi> Your Argument alſo, <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note>
               <hi>That the Officers durſt not truſt the Engliſh</hi> Militia <hi>too near the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, is a  Proof, That as his Pretences were plauſible; ſo <hi>Popery</hi> began to make them fear the ſad Effects of <hi>Arbitrary Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer you make to an Objection, That the <hi>Militia</hi> cannot be ſerviceable, is inſufficient: but that perhaps you will by this time confeſs.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons you advance, againſt <hi>keeping an Army 'till the</hi> Militia <hi>are Diſciplin'd,</hi> is ſhort of the Purpoſe; and none but a Man full of Fears, wou'd have urged That other Perſons cannot Exerciſe the <hi>Militia</hi> with Encouragement, <hi>Whil'ſt there is a Standing Army; and that the ſame Rule will hold Seven Years hence: you ſay, a ſmall Army is enough to oppreſs the People, and too few to defend our ſelves.</hi> I cou'd ſometimes hope you were not our Country-man, becauſe you very ſeldom ſpeak in our Favour. Your Champion <hi>Machiavel</hi> does you much Service, and his <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> is an Honour to your Cauſe.</p>
            <p>I find, when a Man is ſinking, he takes hold of any thing: <note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note>but your Citations out of my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi> and a  late <hi>French</hi> Author, are very little to the Purpoſe. But yet Sir I muſt do you the Juſtice to ſay, that you have handled an unreaſonable Argument very well. And I hope with you, <hi>That he who Plumes his Feathers beyond a Common Bound, may Mew them ſoon after.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 24.</note> I wonder much, that you who abhor Numbers,  ſhou'd Muſter ſo many Authors.</p>
            <p>I am glad to hear you own, <hi>That you think the Artillery of the World is chang'd, ſince ſome of theſe Men wrote; and more Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience goes to the making of a good Soldier, than there did formerly:</hi> and yet preſently after you ſay, <hi>It can be acquired in few Weeks;</hi> and that <hi>the Modern Exerciſe is more eaſy than the Antient.</hi> Then you ſhift up and down, and ſay, <hi>That a Man may learn it in his Cloſet, as well as in the Field.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 25.</note>You ſay, <hi>That Engineers can be made, without the Formality of Standing Forces:</hi> a pretty odd Notion. </p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>Actual Experience in War, is not eſſential at all to a Standing Army:</hi> and yet you preſently own, that <hi>This Army has
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48354:21"/>
Knowledge.</hi> And who I pray wou'd be at the Charge of ſending to School, who has an Army ready form'd to his Hands, an Army that knows Diſcipline; and who, as <hi>Engliſh-Men,</hi> cannot be fear'd.</p>
            <p>But an Army will not go down with you; you ſay, it is not <hi>neceſſary:</hi> and for your Inſtance of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> as I told you before, ſo I muſt tell you again, That it was owing to their not keeping up a <hi>Moderate Force,</hi> which occaſioned ſo many <hi>Bloody Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> has put you out of Humor: What makes that Monarchy now ſeem to have ſeen its beſt Days, but want of Force?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 26.</note>Then you tell us plainly, <hi>That the</hi> French <hi>are our Enemies.</hi>  A Paſſage which is pretty bold, I confeſs, for the <hi>Simile</hi> will not juſtify it. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Speech to the Duke of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> is to the Purpoſe: for the King has as intire an Aſcendant on the People; and this does proceed from a well-grounded Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He aims not at ſuch an Army as may be able to ruin us, but ſuch an one as may defend us on occaſion; and you know, <hi>Property</hi> is the Word, and ours a <hi>Mixt Monarchy.</hi> So that on the whole you may find, That the King keeps not his Army to Awe his Subjects, but to Correct Invaders, who may pretend to his Crown; and on that occaſion may be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relſom.</p>
            <p>Here follow a parcel of Inſinuating Queſtions; which relating to the Parliament, I ſhall not preſume to handle. All I have to ſay to your <hi>Is it not ſo, and ſo?</hi> it ſeems to be written on purpoſe to prevent an Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But your next Aſſertion I may ſpeak to, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſay it is your laſt: <hi>viz. That the beſt way of Reſtoring King</hi> James, <hi>is by Maintaining a Standing Army to keep him out.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Pag. 27.</note> You lay down your Reaſon for it, to this Effect, <hi>That the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Affection is the King's Safety, which nothing but a Deſign to overthrow our Liberties can deſtroy; and that a Standing Army depends upon the fickle Humour of the Soldiery:</hi> you quote <hi>The diſmal Effects in all Ages, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſarmed Governments: The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging two or three Officers and a Jacobite, Miſtreſs, or the King of</hi> France <hi>Buying Penſioners in the Court and Army;</hi> with ſuch a Bead-roll of Suppoſitions, that the Book proves it ſelf to be a Deſign. But theſe <hi>Innuendo's</hi> will affect none but light People.</p>

Then you fear <hi>a Rehearſal Revolution,</hi> and yet ſtrive to bring it about by making him <hi>a King of Brentford,</hi> and ſo out of the Cloud of your fears bring in your old King <hi>James</hi> (not the late King) by the power of the King of <hi>France</hi> (not the <hi>French</hi> King) he was called ſo in our Articles of Peace, but that being a ſort of Introductory Prelimenary, you might Slip it over in haſte.</p>
            <p>As your Book ends your Modeſty begins,<note place="margin">Pag. 29.</note> you ſay <hi>That what you have offered againſt ſtanding Armies is only where they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of Tyranny,</hi> and ſay <hi>that what you propos'd is not to touch on our own, which was raiſed by conſent.</hi> If thoſe you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon can forgive you, I ſhall, becauſe I love an Ingenious manager of a Bad Argument, and conclude that you wou'd write much better upon what wou'd bear the Teſt.</p>
