            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO HIS GRACE
THE
Duke of Ormond,
Lord High Steward of His Majesties
Houshold, Knight of the Noble Order of
the Garter, and one of His Majesties most
Honourable Privy Council.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>May it please your Grace,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the Presumption I might
have been guilty of in this
Dedication, is somewhat excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in your Graces Permission;
yet the meanness of this Trifle,
infuses a secret shame into me,
when I consider how ill a Present I have made to
a Person of such eminent Merit and Grandeur,
whose obliging, and not to be exampled Clemency,
induces him to Patronize a Piece that rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishes,
than brings the least addition to his
Fame. Had it been an Heroick Poem, I might
have open'd my eyes with greater assurance, and
<pb facs="tcp:103631:3"/>
cherish'd my ambitious thoughts with the resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of honouring some happy Heroe with your
Graces illustrious Character, and so under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of a slender merit springing from the Work,
have insinuated my self into your Favour. But
whereas other Authors are happy in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
how little have I to boast of, when all I can say
in my defence, is, That its only good Fortune was,
in being the Subject of the Courts diversion, where
their Noble Clemency and Good Nature were
extremely requisite, in covering its defects from
the too Censorious; His Majesty, according to
His accustomed Royal and Excellent Temper,
was pleas'd to descend so far, as to give it a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Applause, which was seconded by your
Grace, little considering, my Lord, the Pride a
young Author might be infected with, in seeing his
Play honour'd with so dignified an Approbation.
But when I had the honour to wait upon you, and
saw shining in all your Actions the glorious Beams
of Humility, Courtesie, true Honour and Virtue,
Perfections seldom seen in Great Men, 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for me to decipher my thoughts, nor had I
power to utter them; for my Minds surprize ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to the imperfection of my Speech, though I
<pb facs="tcp:103631:3"/>
had leisure to consider how despicable a thing is
Pride, when supprest by the pious Inclinations of
a generous Virtue. Pardon me, my Lord, if the
indefatigable Zeal I owe your Grace, makes me
wander from the nicer Rules of Dedication;
And I beseech you believe, that as to Admire you
I never can enough, so to Flatter you, is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
my power, you being far above it; I have
more reason to beg your Pardon for this Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass,
than to incur your Anger for another De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault:
A Buffoon, though he may be often stil'd
the sport and diversion of Princes, would very
ill become the Name of their Companion. And
so this Play, though it had the Fortune to please
you as Spectator, must needs blush at its insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
being receiv'd as a Bosome Friend. Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<hi>(my Lord)</hi> makes an abatement of the
Crime, and to make it wholly pardonable, the rest
must be impos'd upon your Graces Clemency that
authoriz'd my Boldness; the Clemency that drew
me from a melancholy Retirement, where Content
and I were often quarrelling about a slender For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to visit the blissful Habitation of Virtue
and Grandeur. Birds sing most sweetly that sit
in the Sun-beams; and 'tis, I confess, the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Ambition of most Poets, to shelter themselves
under the Wings of Nobility, Encouragement

            <l>Like her they are neglected by you Wits,</l>
            <l>And forc'd to trade with Country Squires and Cits,</l>
            <l>Who with their Eighteen-pence uphold the Stage,</l>
            <l>Which you would ruine with your Critick Rage,</l>

                     <p>How Sir: I'le tell you Sir—First thou art a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
Fellow, a kind of Hypocondriack, as I am told, and instead of
making, spoilst good Company.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Ioll.</speaker>
                     <p>Secondly: Sirra, thou hast quite forgot to sing a Quality that
was Hereditary, a Benefit that has Grac'd our Family for above these
20 years, and like a Varlet thou hast neglected it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>
                     <p>Not I i' faith Sir! You are mis-inform'd. I am not melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly,
nor any thing of that which you imagine. I can sing too,
loudly, and for the Benefit of Company. 'Tis true Sir, want of
Money—</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>Sirra, Sirra, a lye deserves a Cudgel. Do not vex me. Udsbores,
Did I not see you yesterday at Sir <hi>Arthur Oldloves,</hi> holding your hands up
thus—conning your Lesson? What business can you have with Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries,
except it be to practice disobedience, or turn Precisian to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
thy Family?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Sir. I'le tell you what.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioll.</speaker>
                     <l>No Sir: You need not;</l>
                     <l>I know the trick already. Speed the Plough Sir.</l>
                     <p>Alas! What shou'd you do with Money? To you that neglect the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103631:6"/>
World—Money's a Torment. I have consider'd it—and will not
tempt you—Money was made for those that laugh, and drink with
appetite, whose merry Souls—put Padlocks on dull Conscience, and
live the life of sence <hi>cum Privilegio.</hi>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>
                     <p>I will excel in Mirth Sir. Every day shall give you proof,
each hour variety, your House shall ring with shouts of Joy and Musick:
I long have wish'd it so: But still the Duty, the reserved Reverence that
I bore you Sir made me forbear—But since you'l have it otherwise,
it meets my wishes fully.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioll.</speaker>
                     <p>And mine too Sir. And a pox on Reverence I say, an Ounce
of true <hi>English</hi> Mirth is worth a Pound on't: But this Antiquary—What
Business had you there Sir? answer me that.</p>

                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, there is a rich Widow lodges at his House, one to whom
my private inclinations have been long devoted; and by feigning an
Austerity yesterday in Sir <hi>Arthur's</hi> Company, I got access to her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioll.</speaker>
                     <p>Is she merry, can she sing?</p>

                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>
                     <p>To a Miracle Sir. She's extreamly Musical: Plays o'th'
Guittar, and tells a Story with the best Grace I ever saw.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioll.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Harr.</speaker>
                     <p>She's very reserv'd; but withall uses a modest freedom that's
infinitely taking.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ioll.</speaker>
                     <p>Udsbores! I like it well, a merry Modesty, and an unstained In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
add much to Feminine Capacities: Let the world rub, <hi>Harry—</hi>
I say thou shalt have her. There, there's Money for thee—Nay if
thou wer't there upon design, 'tis another matter, I must allow that.
When I was a young Man I was the best at a design: Ah, I could ha'
gone through stitch i'faith: But come, hang pinching<hi>—Harry</hi> thou
shalt have her.</p>

                     <l>Shot from his darting Eye, me thought went through me.</l>
                     <l>I lov'd, nay and ador'd with so much zeal,</l>
                     <l>I cou'd have dy'd—nay willingly been tortur'd:</l>

better he may stay: The cold business of Consanguinity is seldom ty'd
to an hour, once a week, or a month will serve the turn well enough;

you have as large a portion as any one I know: What man but you

                     <p>What Woman but you durst provoke a Lover thus? Nay one
that is to marry you; and consequently to have power to Tyrannize
over you; To lie with you but once a week, and then with an ill
will too; To send you into the Country to look to your Dairy; To
keep a Mis in Town, and live three times beyond my Estate, according
to Custom.</p>

think you, that no one wou'd make Addresses? Lies it not in my
ability to wheedle you into a Belief of Love, and at last to forsake
you—assure your self it does—but Heaven knows I am too
constant.</p>

like your Estate, your Hope will have as ample a Field to range in, as any

How has my Soul and Heart been fetter'd to you? How have I dreamt
of you, and thought a look to any other man was an offence to Love?
slighted the Oaths of Gallants—shun'd their presents! despis'd
their persons, and refus'd their guifts all—all for you, And do you
still suspect me?—Would I could be unconstant! wou'd I had
the power to be so, that I might revenge my self—Oh misery!

a Revenge on all that should love me. To make it plainer to ye I am
marry'd. My husband fir'd with jealousie, forsook me to spend his time
in Travel; since I have liv'd a Widow in opinion, and wheadled many

            <l>You smile, and perhaps doubt my want of skill,</l>

            <l>I must confess there is a safer way,</l>
            <l>You may walk safely if you'll like the Play;</l>
            <l>But else, if you your Censures raise anew,</l>
            <l>Fate sends his Darts abroad, Blood must ensue.</l>
