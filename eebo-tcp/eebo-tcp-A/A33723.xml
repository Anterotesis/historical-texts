            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WHAT hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
published in the
hearing of many by
Preaching, is now put into private
hands by Printing; and because 'tis
easier to please many Hearers than
one Reader, Let me (whoever
thou art) bespeak thy Candor in a
few words.</p>
            <p>Readers should be Courteous;
there is a Civility due to Books as
well as Persons: 'Tis not Manners
to interrupt a Man in the middle of
his Discourse; and to censure a Book
<pb facs="tcp:103588:3"/>
before you have read it our, is much
the same. <hi>He that answereth a matter
before he heareth it, it is folly and shame
unto him,</hi> Prov. 18. 13. If what is
here delivered, fall not in with your
thoughts, I can only say this, That
my design was, to write down my
own Thoughts, and not other mens,
submitting all to the Judgment of
the Scriptures: every one knows best
what he thinks, what he believes,
and is persuaded of. A plain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal
of the Grounds and Reasons
of our present Judgment, leaving
'em to their own weight in every
Man's Conscience, is to act like men
one towards another; and the best
way to communicate Light to those
who are willing to learn. We cannot
differ about the Conclusion, when
once we agree in the Premises; but
to resolve upon Conclusions first, is
the ready way to put a Cheat upon
our selves, whilst we don't seek so
<pb facs="tcp:103588:3"/>
much to find out Truth, as to make
good our own Inventions.</p>
            <p>To be born again, was a hard say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Nicodemus</hi> could not receive it;
knew not how to make sense of it.
Had Christ intended only an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
reformation of Life, and not
an inward renovation of Nature;
he would not have explained our
being Born again, by being Born of
<hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit, Verse</hi> 5. which
are Evangelical terms of a much
higher signification, and do imply a
deeper change than that of Manners,
which at best reduces us but to a
practical conformity to those inbred
Moral principles, belonging to our
first birth as men; this is still but a
state of Nature; we are in the same
Spirit and Principle that ever we
were. Where is the new Nature?
that Spirit which is born of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
those supernatural Principles that
are above all our natural Notions,
<pb facs="tcp:103588:4"/>
carrying us out directly to God in
Christ? 'Tis Faith that gathers up
these supernatural Truths out of
the Gospel, and sets 'em home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Conscience with power, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
the Soul to the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Word, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
flesh and blood about these
high mysteries. Revealed Truths
are strange things to a natural Man,
and will never find acceptance with
him, till his mind be suited to them
by a supernatural irradiation; Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
things cannot be seen but by a
Heavenly Light: when God shines
in our hearts, then we are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into the very Image of those
Truths which that Light discovers to
us, and do experimentally know
what that renovation of the Spirit is
which the Word speaks of: Such
Gospel Truths are put into our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts, as were never there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
this enables us to understand
<pb facs="tcp:103588:4"/>
the Scriptures, to Read 'em with
pleasure; we delight in the Law of
God in our inward Man: This Man
within a Man, this hidden Man of
the heart is the new creature, the
genuine birth of the Spirit of God.
If thou art such a Man, thou art a
true Christian Reader indeed, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to receive the witness of Christ,
who speaks what he knows, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies
that which he hath seen,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 11. I have written this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourse to you, <hi>not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you know not the truth, but
because you know it, and that no lie
is of the truth,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 21. If
any, who may be yet spiritually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
shall take up this Book, and
Read it, they may see what they are
not, how short they come of that
Character the Gospel gives of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Souls: There are more <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demusses</hi>
than one, who cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riddle
the mystery of <hi>Regeneration;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:103588:5"/>
they will understand nothing by it,
but what they can bring 'emselves
unto, by an outward Baptism; there
is no Reasoning with these men;
while they live in one Nature, and
talk of another, they say they know
not what; 'tis impossible to have a
real feeling of that Nature that is
not in us: He is a Skilful Limner,
who draws to the Life; tho Life it
self can never be drawn, some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblances
of Life there may be;
the Cast and Colour of a Living
Face, but no breath; like Painted
Fire, without heat; or the Picture
of a Man running, without any
actual Motion; he is fixed in his
first step; you will always find his
feet where your Pencil left them,
standing still in a running Posture.
Thus it is with many Professors;
they are as Pictures hung upon a
Wall, dressed up in all the outward
Formalities of Religion; you would
<pb facs="tcp:103588:5"/>
take 'em to be real Saints; they
have a name to live, but are indeed
dead, without any inward living
Principle of Grace to animate and
quicken those forms, filling them up
with true, real Holiness.</p>
            <p>Acts flowing from a living Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
within, do carry their own evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
along with 'em, giving a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
sensation of their Truth and
Reality, as the genuine off-springs
of the heart, which nothing that is
forced or counterfeit can do; The
heart flows out with those actions
that come from it, but secretly turns
away, as unconcerned in every thing
that doth not correspond to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Sense and Inclination of the
Soul: This will help us to judg of
our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> by observing the
consent of our Minds to those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts of Religion we pass tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row;
what Complacency and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
we have in them, or what se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
<pb facs="tcp:103588:6"/>
aversion to them, which we
must needs be privy to; all mere
imitations of Nature, are defective
somewhere; this is more easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scernable,
when we practise upon
our selves, seeming to be what we
are not; as Actors upon a Stage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Disguise, who know we are
not the Persons we go for: When
the New Nature comes into us,
how kindly are the motions of our
Hearts towards Christ? How wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
is he to us? We are never more
in our own Element, than when we
are in closest Communion with him;
our Joy is then full, because we
have the very desire of our Hearts;
we are where we would be, we have
what we longed for. Every unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
man, in the very height of
his outward Profession, be-lies his
own Sense and Experience, and says
that of his Heart, which he knows
he doth not speak from his heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:103588:6"/>
When a humbling, overwhelming
Sense of Original Sin comes upon us,
discovering the Universal Pravity of
our Degenerate Nature, how is the
glory of all flesh stained? How vile
and mean a thing is Man, born of a
woman! he may well lye down in
his own shame, stand behind the
whole Creation of God, and blush
at the mischief he hath done the
World, groaning with all his fellow
Creatures to be restored to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Liberty of the Children of
God. Serious thoughts of our lapsed
estate, must needs beget this self-abhorrency
in us, that we should thus
unman our selves, and become like
the Beasts that perish, nay worse
than they, because we cannot so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
as to cease to be; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of our Souls making us
naturally capable of a miserable E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;
how should we then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounded
in our own sight, and be yet
<pb facs="tcp:103588:7"/>
more vile in our own Eyes? We
cannot presently take in the full
sense of our wretched state; the
grossest sins of our Lives, are not to
be compared to the sins of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
they might pass for particular
acts of folly, which we were hurried
into by the violence of some sudden
Temptation; we might hope that
Nature would recover it self; but
that being poysoned and turned into
a root of Bitterness, what fruit unto
Holiness can ever grow upon such e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Trees as we naturally are? 'Tis
not any improvement of Nature by
Art or Industry, that will recover
us; there must be a real Change of
Nature wrought in us; and how few
are convinc'd of the necessity of this?
A Toad may as soon complain of
his Poysonous Nature, as Fallen Man
of his Corrupt Nature; we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to every thing that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to us, else it could not be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;
<pb facs="tcp:103588:7"/>
whatever is a part of our selves,
can be no burden to us. 'Tis a sign
the Spirit of God hath been at work
in that Soul, who is grown into a
dislike of himself, hating what he is,
and what he doth from a carnal Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
Tis a sign there is another Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Principle stirring in him. 'Tis
impossible there should be true
Grace in that Man, who hath no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
sense of indwelling sin. The
flesh is flesh still, even after Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
the New Creature is raised
up in the presence of the old man,
they live together awhile, tho' at
continual variance, till the fleshly
part be abolished; then the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
will stand up by it self in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
state of Glory, in the stature of a
perfect Man in Christ. Sin, tho it
cannot hinder the Birth of the New
Man, yet it hinders his growth, and
depresses that for a season, till Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
with all that belongs to it, be
<pb facs="tcp:103588:8"/>
quite swallowed up of that Eternal
Life, which we derive from Christ
in our Regeneration; if we dye
strangers to this life of God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
we with all our Forms,
Names, and specious Pretences to
Religion, shall be swallow'd up of
Eternal Death, and never see the
Kingdom of God. <hi>Verily, verily,
except a man be born again, he cannot see
the Kingdom of God.</hi>

at the first reading, may
convince any Considering
Person, That Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is a great Mystery; the
way to understand it aright, is to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the internal Parts of it, not into the
Words, but Power of Godliness. Many
and various are the outward Forms by
which Professors are unhappily distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
pleasing themselves with different Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructures

is Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones, in
some Buildings; and too much Wood,
Hay, and Stubble in others. Before I set
fire to this by a spirit of Judgment and
Burning, let us all examine our Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and see whether the whole House is
not to be pulled down, and built anew;
we had better pull down a House weakly
founded, than suffer it to fall upon our
heads, then we perish in the ruins: My
Text leads me to this search. I hope you
will all join with me in feeling for the
Rock; if we find it, we may with more
comfort and success set upon the mending
and repairing what is amiss otherwise.</p>
                     <p>The Text speaks of the Nativity, or
first Original of a Christian, and derives his
Descent from above, from Heaven, from
God, from the Holy Spirit; this is very
high; we may look for something extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
in such a Birth, which is here cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Regeneration,</hi> or our being Born again,
or a second time. This is a great Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and cannot be understood, till it is in
some measure felt. <hi>Regeneration</hi> is not a
Notion, but a Nature; not a mere empty
Speculation floating in the Brain, but an
inward living Principle rooted in the
Heart: I am not speaking of things
without you, at a distance from you, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103588:9"/>
are foreign and extrinsecal to your souls,
but of that which is essential to the Being
and Constitution of a Christian as such;
you are not only my Auditors this day,
but each of you the subject of my present
Discourse; I am not only speaking to you,
but of you; 'tis what you are, or are not,
in the inward state of your souls, that I
am now enquiring after: By comparing
your selves with the word, you may know
how far you do, or do not, answer to the
Character that is given there of the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
soul; the essential Properties of that
Nature in which we live, must needs be
owned by us, they are in us, they are of
us, <hi>bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh;</hi>
they are our very selves; no sensible consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
man can be without this knowledg
of himself; he cannot deny his own Image
which he sees with his own Eyes. In a
glass, face answers face; so 'tis with the
heart of a Man, describe it as it is, in its
present Actings, Motions, Principles and
Inclinations, 'twill fall in with you to a tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
I would not speak a word, and I hope
God will so guide me, that I shall not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any thing concerning this new Birth,
which falls not under the experience of
the weakest Christian who is really born
of God: If I shoot over the heads of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103588:10"/>
'tis none of my fault, we must speak
of Divine Things, as they are laid down
in the Scriptures, whether we are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
or not understood. Preachers do only
explain the Object, they cannot enlighten
the Faculty; they may open the Text, but
they cannot open the Hearts of those that
hear them, to understand the Scriptures,
this is God's work; <hi>Faith cometh by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
therefore he that hath ears to hear, let
him hear.</hi> I cannot bespeak your Attention
by a stronger Argument than that in my
Text, <hi>Except a man be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,</hi>
&amp;c. That which the Word of God so
plainly puts as a bar to our entrance into
the Kingdom of God, we are all concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to see that bar removed, who have any
hope of entring into that Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Give me leave to reason with you out of
the Scriptures about this great Point of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:</hi>
Some place it in that which
a mere natural man may pretend unto;
passing over the whole Mystery of the
Gospel, they construe the Word of God by
Reason, bringing down all spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
to the level of Man's Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
And if no more be intended by them,
things are strangely worded in the Bible;
'tis not the manner of men to speak so, to
cloath their natural Notions with such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103588:10"/>
Phrases and Words (peculiar only to the
Scriptures) as do not at all symbolize with
any mere humane conception, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must needs signifie something higher,
something beyond all that ever entred into
the heart of a Natural Man; if not, then
farewel all Revealed Religion, it seems no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is revealed in Scripture but mere
words, Natural Theology is the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which all Scripture must be interpreted;
all the use we are to make of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
according to them, is only to borrow
some peculiar words and expressions, as so
many new Terms of Art appropriated to
Religion, by Divine Authority: What a
strange conceit is this, to borrow from the
Scriptures new Bottles to put our old
Wine into, our Sense into Gods word, so
spoiling both; God's Words are too big for
our sense, and our sense too low and mean
to fill up such high Expressions which can
never by any rule of speech be brought
down and contracted to so narrow a signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
so that whilst we accommodate
the Word of God to our own false Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Divine Things, we understand nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God nor our selves; we think absurdly,
and speak improperly. But those who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the pure Lauguage of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
they see a suitableness between the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103588:11"/>
Words of the Holy Ghost, and the things of
the Holy God.</p>
                     <p>I have read to you out of my Text,
the Words of the Holy Ghost; 'tis God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who must shew both you and me the
thing it self intended, and meant by these
words.</p>
                     <p>And now to come a little nearer, let
me begin with the Context.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 3. One would have thought the
high Opinion <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had of Christ,
<hi>ver. 2. As a teacher come from God, a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of miracles, and one whom God was with:</hi>
And Christs earnestness in asserting the
truth of what he laies down so positively,
<hi>ver.</hi> 3. under a solemn Asseveration, that
it was certainly so, should have led <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus</hi>
to the belief of what Christ affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but 'tis not the Opinion we have of
the Preacher, nor his earnestness in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor the certain truth of what he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
will perswade us to receive this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> till God enlighten
our minds, and give us experience of the
thing in our selves.</p>
                     <p>Observe, <hi>All natural Men have strange,
gross Apprehensions of the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.
Nicodemus</hi> applies all that Christ
said, to natural Generation, mistakes the
Mystery of the new Birth, not comparing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103588:11"/>
Spiritual things with Spiritual, but with
Natural. He cannot rise higher than a
natural Generation, and thinks that must
be repeated in <hi>Regeneration;</hi> if any such
thing be, though never so often repeated,
'tis still the same thing done the same way
by entring the second time, <hi>&amp;c. And how
can a man be born when he is old?</hi> But,
suppose there were such a thing as a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Regeneration</hi> in <hi>Nicodemus</hi>'s Sense; this
would not mend the matter in making us
more fit for Heaven, for we should be sent
again into the World, in the same corrupt
Nature as we had before; whatever is
born of the Flesh, is but Flesh still, <hi>omne
simile, generat simile;</hi> therefore a natural
<hi>Regeneration</hi> supposes no change, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>produces
a man in the same State, Form
and Nature, as he had before. If a Man
were ten thousand times Born naturally,
he would be the same Man still: But the
<hi>Regeneration</hi> Christ speaks of, makes him
a new man; and therefore could not be
by entring <hi>a second time into his mothers
womb: Nicodemus</hi> knows nothing of any
such new Birth, that should bring forth a
new Kind, or Race of Men into the World,
of a different Genius, Complexion and
Principle, from all that are Born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
but because the Scripture does so
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103588:12"/>
plainly speak of such a thing, they who
read the Word, dare not deny it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore place the whole My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of it in external Baptism; do suppose
it always compleated there of course, and
will hear no more of it ever after; they
count it absurd to call upon grown bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
Persons, especially old Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
to labour after a <hi>Regeneration;</hi> that
they think is past and over long ago, when
they were baptized.</p>
                     <p>Observe, <hi>None but a regenerate Person
understands the true nature of Regeneration.</hi>
Others can never reach it, because they
don't feel it in themselves; 'tis a personal
Change wrought in every individual Saint;
men may see our outward Profession, our
outward Walking, our Praying, Hearing,
Preaching, our Moral and Religious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices;
but the Principle from which we
Act, and by which we are carried out in
all these things, is infallibly known to none
but God, and our own Souls; we may
search into our own Hearts so far, as to
discern this new Birth, and we should not
rest till we have found it out.</p>
                     <p>That we might the better understand
the Nature of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> let us consider
the several Names given it in Scripture;
<hi>Regeneration, Renovation, New Creation,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103588:12"/>
Conversion,</hi> are Synonimous terms in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and do all signify the same thing, do
all imply the Corruption of Mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that produceth nothing but what is
like it self; how specious soever it may
seem to be, 'tis but Flesh; therefore all
fleshly Wisdom, Beauty and Glory, must
be mortified and abolished; the Scripture
calls for a new Birth, a new Creation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Image of God, that Man may be
enabled to do good, <hi>created in Christ Iesus
unto good works,</hi> Ephes. 2. 10. Baptism is
the Sign and Symbol of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and
does imply the thing it self, when the
inward Work of the Spirit goes along with
the outward washing of Water, which it
does not always do; this Wind bloweth
where it listeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Regeneration</hi> is of a larger Extent and
Signification than Justification and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
'tis initially all that belongs to a
state of Grace; 'tis fully described, <hi>Tit. 3.
5.</hi> by washing and renewing; there is a
double washing from Sin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> From the guilt of it, <hi>by the blood
of Christ, 1 Iohn 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Rev.</hi> 7. 14.
This washing is Justification, therefore
called Baprism unto <hi>remission of sin, Mark 1.
4. Acts 2. 38. Gal.</hi> 3. 27. This is Baptism
unto Justification <hi>by the blood of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:103588:13"/>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the filth of sin by the
Spirit of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11. 1 Cor. 12. 13.</hi>
This is commonly called <hi>Regeneration,</hi> Tit.
3. 5. <hi>Ioh. 3. 4</hi> Born of water, this is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
unto sanctification, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4. Col. 2.
12.</hi> These two internal Washings are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
joyned together, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 11.</hi> the
one perfect, the other imperfect; Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in nature only precedes Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and being the Act of God upon us,
and towards us, is perfect: but in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
God takes us along with him, we
concur in every Act of Sanctification; he
works in us to will, and to do; but 'tis we
that will and do.</p>
                     <p>I conceive it lies something wide from
the truth, to put (as some do) <hi>Regeneration</hi>
for <hi>Sanctification,</hi> lying in the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sin, and newness of life, which is
rather an effect of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> than that in
which it consists; the renewing of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
supposes a union to Christ, an ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into him, who is the Root that bears
us, communicating all spiritual virtue and
sap to those Branches that are vitally joined
to him.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I shall describe <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
or at large define it thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis a wonderful work of God, begetting
the Elect again unto himself, by implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103588:13"/>
them into Christ, from whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
a spiritual being, and in whom they
live spiritually for ever and ever; growing
up daily into his likeness, till they come
to the stature of a perfect man in him.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Regeneration</hi> there is a supernatural
form of true holiness impressed upon the
Soul, that the preternatural form of sin and
ungodliness brought in by the Devil, may
be abolished; nothing that is physically
natural, is abolished by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which
takes not away any natural faculty or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Soul, only sets them upon
right Objects. <hi>Regeneration</hi> produces a
new spiritual being in the Soul, draws the
Image of God upon the heart, sets the
Soul into a holy order and rectitude; when
the natural faculties of the rational Soul
are brought under the power of superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Principles, that man is regenerated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Regeneration</hi> implies the beginning of
the new Life, or new Creature; birth is
the beginning of life; <hi>we are born of God,
Iohn 1. 13.</hi> This is caused by God's quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5. in and through our
union to Christ by faith, who is our life,
a quickning Spirit in us, and to us, <hi>1 Cor.
15. 45.</hi> They who are born of God, are
not still-born, but born alive, quickned by
the Spirit of Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103588:14"/>
This new life appears most in the Will,
by its real tendency towards God, <hi>Phil. 2.
13.</hi> Where you see the will of a man turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to God and Christ, you may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
God hath been at work in that Soul;
this great quickning work of <hi>Regeneration</hi>
usually appears first in the Will, in the
gracious motions and inclinations of the
will of man towards God and Christ;
there may be an illumination of the Mind,
without any conversion of the Will; the
darkness of the Understanding is sooner
removed, than the corruption of the Will;
there may be many strong convictions
wrought, before there be any true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Will, that stands it out to the
uttermost, before it consents to come to
Christ, and cast the Soul upon him by an
act of faith; and when the Father has
drawn the Will to that act of faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is always joined with it, <hi>Acts 19. 4.
Mark 1. 15.</hi> Faith principally respects
Christ, but Repentance is towards God
himself, whom we have offended by our
sins, <hi>Acts 20. 21.</hi> therefore Repentance
turns us into the Will of God, seeks to
please him, by doing only what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
of, <hi>Works meet for repentance,</hi> Acts
26. 20. These Works are an effect of Gospel-repentance,
that flows from faith in Christ.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103588:14"/>
Legal Terrors that accompany a legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
are before Faith, and cannot be
removed but by faith in Christ Jesus; an
unregenerate man may attain to a Legal-repentance,
and be much terrified; but he
cannot attain to a Gospel-repentance, in
turning from sin as contrary to God's holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Indeed this Gospel-repentance that
flows from Faith, may be sooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
than Faith it self; a Sinner cannot
easily perswade himself that he is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
to God in Christ, before he finds in
himself that he hath left those sins that
separated him from God. <hi>Regeneration</hi> lies
in creating in us a habit and vital principle
of Faith, which disposes and inclines us to
actual believing; this very principle deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates
a man a Believer in the sight of
God, before he actually believes; so rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Infants may be said to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Regeneration</hi> there is a power put into
a man to believe and repent, which are acts
of the new Creature; so that a man must
first be a new Creature; and that which
makes him so, is <hi>Regeneration;</hi> before that,
an unregenerate person is called an old man,
the old man is distinct from our selves as
men; we must distinguish between the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of humane Nature, and humane
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103588:15"/>
Nature it self, which <hi>Regeneration</hi> does not
destroy, but perfect; it implies a change
of state, and a change of nature, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of both is laid in our <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
by virtue of our incorporation into Christ,
<hi>who of God is made unto us righteousness and
sanctification;</hi> the efficacy of his Blood and
Spirit does reach our Souls, being one with
him; we die with him, and rise with him,
are discharged from sin upon the account
of his Satisfaction, and are raised up unto
newness of life by vertue of his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>We pass through all the states that
Christ passed through; we die with him,
are crucified with him; we rise with him,
ascend into Heaven with him, are glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with him; there is nothing that God
requires of Believers in a way of faith and
hope, but he hath given some instance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
in his Son Jesus Christ of the actual
accomplishment of that thing. We hope
to be justified from our sins, because Christ
is justified from 'em; they were laid upon
him, but he has freed himself now from
the imputation of them; and therefore will
<hi>appear the second time without sin,</hi> Heb. 9.
28. We hope for a resurrection of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
because Christ is risen; we hope for
glory, because Christ is ascended and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103588:15"/>
So the Apostle argues, <hi>1 Pet. 1. 21.
Who by him do believe in God that raised him
up from the dead, and gave him glory, that
your faith and hope might be in God.</hi> There
is as much reason for the justification of a
sinner believing in Christ, as for the Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Person of Christ himself;
it is upon the same account; so that our
case is an adjudged case, already upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
in Heaven; it is no new thing for
God to pass by our sins, he having passed
them all by in Christ; no new thing for
God to justifie such sinners as we are, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
already justified Christ, admitted him
to Glory, and set him down at his Right
Hand: These are all instances of what you
may expect from God the Father: The
Covenant of Grace requires no other
Righteousness for your Justification, but
that of Christ; therefore I would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to keep up a high value and
esteem for the Righteousness of Christ; it
will support you under the greatness of
your own sins, and under all the defects
of your own Righteousness: What is it
that troubles poor souls? their sins are
great, and their Righteousness small, and
what will become of them they know
not. Set the Righteousness of Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the greatness of your sins, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103588:16"/>
all the Imperfections of your own
Righteousness, raise up your thoughts
in a high esteem of this Righteousness of
Christ. I would not have you say, as too
too many do, and may be they mean no
more than they say, if so, they do not say
all the truth; how many real Believers
have I heard say, Christ will cover the
Imperfection of our own Righteousness,
and so think they speak all the truth; but
they must mean something beyond all this,
or they do not speak right; for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Christ apprehended by Faith,
does not only cover all the Defects of your
own Righteousness, but covers your very
Righteousness it self, which must never
be brought in as an Argument, why God
should justify; you must not be found in
your own Righteousness; <hi>not having my own
Righteousness,</hi> says <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 9. that is,
not having it on; Faith in Christ does strip
a Man of his own Righteousness, does not
only speak comfortably, as to the Pardon
of all the Defects of our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but take it in its best State, and
highest Degree, as far as our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can reach, it must be covered when
we come to God for Justification. There
are two Seasons when Christ presents us to
the Father, the one for Justification, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103588:16"/>
other for Glorification; when he does the
first, he presents us sinners lying in our
blood, as having no righteousness of our
own, but what is imputed to us by God;
and then for Glorification, he presents us
perfectly Holy, inherently Holy, without
any spot or blemish upon us; and this he
doth with exceeding great joy: so that
when you would make use of Christ for
Justification, remember to cover all your
own righteousness, and put it quite off, as
to any trust or confidence in it; 'tis hard to
do Righteousness, and not to be proud of it,
conceiving we merit something by it; you
must be workers of Righteousness, but not
wearers of your own Righteousness: when
you stand before God for Justification, take
heed of having it, or being found in it.
Nothing can make a man see the weakness
and insufficiency of his own performances,
but a true principle of Faith, that humbles
him, and empties him, sending him stript
and naked unto Christ, to cover him with
the unspotted Robe of his perfect Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, The immediate effect of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
is Adoption: You see I have been
comparing <hi>Regeneration</hi> with other great
Gospel Truths, that I might find out the
proper place for it, and see what relation
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103588:17"/>
it stands in to all the other parts and
members of the body of Divinity.</p>
                     <p>I say therefore, the immediate effect of
<hi>Regeneration</hi> is Adoption; being born of
Man, we became the Children of Men; so
being born of God, we become the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God: <hi>Adoption</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
here; he that begets, adopts those
whom he hath begotten; 'tis not so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, for this is another peculiar
property of <hi>Regeneration:</hi> They who have
power to become the Children of God, they
are born of God; adopted, and yet born;
born, and yet adopted; so that it pleaseth
God the Father, by all the ways of Nature,
of Art, of civil Custom among men, to
set forth his Love by a natural generation,
or being born. 'Tis a natural thing among
men to be born, but adoption is a civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
thing, a thing of prudence and
custom among men, it is brought in by
Man: You know how fond men are of
those they have Adopted; 'tis next to the
natural affection they bear to the Children
of their own bodies; so that no doubt
there is much of mystery in this Doctrine
of <hi>Regeneration.</hi> There is not a Man in
the World almost, but lives in some hope
of going to Heaven when he dies; yet
the greatest part of mankind carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103588:17"/>
so, as if they would only make the
World believe they shall be saved, not as
if they were under any real hope, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of such a thing, nothing of this
appears by any serious preparation they
make for Heaven or Glory: But let their
hopes be what they will, <hi>except a man he
born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</hi>
Thus much in general. I shall now come
to particulars, and cast all I have further

God. 1 <hi>Ioh. 5. 18.</hi> We are said to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of God, born of God; and this is
sometimes ascribed to the Father, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to God the Son, sometimes to God
the Holy Ghost; all that is called God, is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103588:18"/>
concerned in Man's <hi>Regeneration.</hi> God
the Father is said to beget us, 1 Pet. 1. 3.
We are said to be <hi>Created in Christ Iesus
unto good works,</hi> Eph. 2. 10. To be <hi>in him,</hi>
even <hi>in his Son Iesus Christ,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 20. to
be <hi>born os the spirit,</hi> Joh. 3. 5. <hi>All the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the Trinity have a joint agency in
this work of our</hi> Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c. Page</hi> 1.
And great is the efficacy of Three such
concurring, total Causes of the same kind;
this is above all our Logick and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
which own no such Causes. God <hi>is
wonderful in counsel, and excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
Isa. 28. 29. We are in his hands, <hi>as
clay in the hand of the potter,</hi> Jer. 18 6.
He can make us Vessels of Honour if he
please; and this Honour have all his Saints,
his excellent ones, in whom he delights. The
moving Cause is God's meer Good Will and
Pleasure. <hi>Iames 1. 18. His abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and loving kindness,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 3. Tit. 3.
4, 5. Ephes. 2. 4, 5. We should be much
affected with the Love of God in our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation:</hi>
God stands in the relation of a
Father to all who are begotten by him.</p>
                     <p>1. He is the Father of Christ, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
person in the Trinity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 7.
whose Generation is Eternal, <hi>who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
it? Isa.</hi> 53. 8. It is the profound ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Faith, grounded upon Divine
Revelation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="21" facs="tcp:103588:18"/>
2. He is the Father of all true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
who are spiritually born of his Will,
at the time appointed of the Father for
their effectual Calling. 'Tis termed a Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because they are begotten by the
Word of God, speaking to their hearts by
it, and so turning them to himself: God
is the Father of Christ, and the Father of
Believers. <hi>Iohn 20. 17. My father, and your
father.</hi> Upon these accounts it is, that
God glories so much in his own Paternity;
not only in relation to Christ, his Eternal
Son, who is God equal with the Father;
but also in relation to the Saints, who are
his true-born Children through Christ.
See an instance of both:</p>
                     <p>1. <hi>In reference to Christ;</hi> Heb. 1: 5.
Thou art my son, this day have I begotten
thee. Let all the Angels of God worship him;
thy throne is for ever and ever. Sit on my
right hand, until I make thine enemies thy
footstool. <hi>So Psal. 2. 6, 7, 8. Thus was this
great Man, this Son of God, incarnate,
brought into Heaven in state and triumph,
at his Resurrection.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. In reference to the Saints; Jer. 31: 9.
<hi>I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my
first-born.</hi> So 2 Cor. 6. 18. <hi>I will be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unto you, and ye shall be my sons and
daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</hi> Tho
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103588:19"/>
God does greatly delight in his beloved
Son, loves to see the brightness of his own
glory shining out in Christ the express Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of his Person; yet next to his own
Image in Christ, he loves to behold the
Image of his Son in the Saints, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
has predestinated them to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Image of his Son, <hi>Rom. 8.
29.</hi> Christ indeed is the first-born, but
many Brethren are to follow (<hi>Rom. 8. 29.</hi>)
to be <hi>added to the Lord,</hi> as the Phrase is,
<hi>Acts 5. 14.</hi> God loves to see the number
of his Children encreasing; to see his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
enlarged. Under this consideration
<hi>Paul</hi> bows his Knees unto the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole
Family in Heaven and Earth is named,
<hi>Ephes. 3. 14, 15.</hi> With what reverence
doth <hi>Paul</hi> draw nigh to this great Father?
I told you but now, that God glories in
Christ his first begotten Son; you heard in
what triumph the great Man, Jesus Christ,
was brought into Heaven, how God wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed
him to Glory; so there is joy in
Heaven at the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of a Sinner;
Angels rejoyce, God rejoyces. This day
have I begotten such and such; Oh that
there might be Joy in Heaven upon this
account, this day, that it might be noted
down above, that this and that Man were
born here.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103588:19"/>
I will shew you the ground of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
of this great satisfaction that God
hath in his Children: Tho Christ be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed
above his fellows, yet there is a
great measure of anointing poured out
upon the Saints; the fulness of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
is in none but Christ, yet the fulness
of God is in all the Saints, <hi>Ephes. 3. 19.</hi>
they are not shut out from any of the
communicable Attributes of God, but
have their share of all that is in him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their capacities as creatures:
Cast an empty Barrel into the Sea, all the
Sea is not in the Barrel, but the Barrel is in
all the Sea; the Sea runs under it, over it,
on every side of it: Thus are we swallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up in God. He comprehends us, tho
we cannot fully comprehend him; we are
in Christ according to his infinite capacity,
and therefore are perfectly justified by the
infinite merit of his perfect Righteousness
imputed to us: But Christ is in us, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to our finite, weak capacities, and
therefore we are but imperfectly sanctified;
we have what we are able to receive, and
no more at present, till our hearts are far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inlarged.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see what it is to be a Child of
God; how the fulness of God is bestowed
upon us. God glories in this. And have
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103588:20"/>
not the Saints reason to glory in it also?
But alas, how do Men please themselves
with their Rich Relations, Great Families,
they are Nobly descended? But I must tell
you, all Nations are of one Blood, and
that is tainted too, we are a Seed of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers,
there is no Noble blood runs in
your veins, till you are born of God; 'tis
<hi>Regeneration</hi> only that makes you the Sons
and Daughters of the Most High; then you
are high born indeed.</p>
                     <p>To stir you up to a holy ambition after
this new birth, do but consider the Father
of the Family, the great God of Heaven
and Earth, blessed for ever, the Father of
Mercies, and the God of all Comfort.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Consider Christ the Elder Brother of the
Family,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. <hi>He</hi> is over all, God
blessed for ever. <hi>His Name is</hi> Wonderful,
Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting
Father, the Prince of Peace, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9. 6, 7.
You see how the Dignity and Majesty of
his Person is described.</p>
                     <p>3. Consider the many priviledges that
are intailed upon new-born Souls, Heirs of
God, joynt heirs with Christ; you are born
to nothing but woe and misery, till you
are born again. How should we long to
be related to such a Father, to such a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to such an Inheritance?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:103588:20"/>
I insist the more upon this, because
I am perswaded, discourses of your Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father must needs be very pleasing to
you who are his Children, whom should
Children hear of with more delight, than
of their Father that begat them? Be not
cast down at any thing that offends you
here below, you have a Father in Heaven
who takes care of you, numbers the hairs
of your heads, will interest himself in your
smallest concerns, and see that all things
shall work together for good to you.</p>
                     <p>We may notionally, and according to the
Letter, speak what we read and hear of
<hi>Regeneration,</hi> and be little affected; but
when once the New Nature begins to stir,
when a Spirit of Adoption begins to
breathe in us, 'twill carry us out by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
instinct to God as to a Father; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
works powerfully; we say, Love de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
more strongly than it ascends; so
'tis here, God loves his Children better
than they can love him; this is love, not
that we love God, tho there is a great
strength in the natural Affection of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
Children towards their Parents.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, nothing does more enoble
our Minds, raise our spirits to a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Magnanimity; nothing does more
uphold and encourage us in our way, more
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103588:21"/>
strengthen our Faith and Hope in Prayer,
than lively Apprehensions of God, as our
Father in Christ Jesus; see how Christ
hangs upon this word [<hi>Father</hi>] in his Prayer,
<hi>Iohn 17. Father, Father; Oh Father; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father; Oh Righteous Father;</hi> we should
eye nothing more in Prayer, than our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to God as a Father: How can an
unregenerate man say, <hi>Our Father which
art in Heaven?</hi> Alas! thou hast never a
Father in Heaven, thou art a Child of
Wrath, a Child of the Devil: Though
some unregenerate Persons may be within
the Election of God, yet the Scripture
speaks of them according to their present
state, calls them Aliens, Strangers, Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners:
Could we conceive aright of
our Covenant-relation to God, and keep
our thoughts working upon it, it would
afford an Argument to us, where all other
Arguments fail; as Isa. 63. 16. <hi>Doubtless
thou art our Father;</hi> it cannot be that our
Heavenly Father should forget us; a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may forget her Child,—<hi>but the
Lord is gracious and full of Compassion,</hi>
Psal. 145. 8. There is a greater fulness of
Compassion in our Heavenly Father, than
in our Natural Parents; they can do, and
will do, what God cannot do, because he
will not: Since the Priviledges of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103588:21"/>
Children of God are so great, how should
we long to be born again! to be <hi>born of
spirit,</hi> Joh. 3. 6. To be <hi>a new lump,</hi> 1 Cor.
5. 7. <hi>New creatures,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. To have
<hi>Christ formed in us,</hi> Gal. 4. 19. To be
<hi>quickned,</hi> Ephes. 2. 1. <hi>Baptized with the
Holy Ghost,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. To be <hi>renewed in
the spirit of our mind,</hi> Ephes. 4. 23. These
are Scripture-expressions of a great depth,
of a high signification, which if well stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
and pondered in our hearts, seriously
and often prayed over, will give us more
light into the Mystery of Regeneration,
than the tongue of Men and Angels can
utter; none can open these Scriptures to
you but the Holy Ghost; tho Ministers
cannot bring down these Scripture expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
to man's Understanding, yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God can lift up man's Understanding
to some discerning of the mind of Christ
in them, by shining in our hearts the light
of the Knowledg of the Glory of God in
the face of Christ. We see how much
Glory and Honour is derived to us by God's
being the Author of our <hi>Regeneration.</hi> I
will now look a little further into this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Regeneration</hi> is our passing over into
Christ, into his Life, Nature, and Spirit;
they who are thus joined to the Lord, are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103588:22"/>
one Spirit. Christ is their Life; being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Life it self, they must needs be
quickned by it; it is present death to be
separated from Life it self; in <hi>Regeneration</hi>
Life doth not so much enter into us, as
we into it; and being once born of God,
we gradually enter further and further into
his Life, till all Mortality be swallowed
up of it. Thus Grace reigns through
Righteousness unto Eternal Life, and this
Eternal Life is God; there is but one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life; when we are in him that is
true, in him that is Eternal, <hi>this is life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnl,</hi>
John 5. 20. Therefore to be in Christ,
and to be a New Creature, is all one. All
Creatures that have breath, live, move, and
have their Being in God, yet they are not
so in God, as the New Creature is in
Christ: God, as a Creator, bestows a
Creature-life upon man, distinct from his
own Eternal Uncreated Life; and man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this natural root of his own, from the
God of Nature, grows up by himself, with
all the specifical Properties belonging to
his kind, whereby he is distinguished from
his fellow-creatures, he stands forth at some
distance from God, yet under the general
influence of his Providence, without which
no creature can subsist: But in <hi>Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
God does not only breathe the breath of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103588:22"/>
life into us, making us living souls, but
breathes his own quickning Spirit into us,
that we may live the very life of God in
our measure; 'tis one thing for God to
give forth something virtually from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as he does in our first Creation; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to give himself really unto
us, as in the second Creation. God as a
Redeemer, raises up a new Creature in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
partaker of his own Divine Nature,
Life and Spirit; this <hi>life is hid with Christ
in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. and cannot in the Root
and Principle of it be distinguished from
God himself; Christ is our Life, which
according to our finite capacity as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
we partake of; the new Creature is
but a Creature for all this, though quite of
another make, constitution, and original,
from all the first Creation, and therefore
called a new Creature, standing in a nearer
union and conjunction to God, so born of
him as no other creature is; all Creatures
are made by him, non born of him but
the new Creature; as Christ took part of
our Flesh and Blood in his Incarnation, so
we partake of his Divine Nature in our
<hi>Regeneration;</hi> as the soul is the life of the
body, so the spirit of Christ dwelling in us,
is the life of our souls, acting them in a
supernatural way; we live the life of God,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103588:23"/>
which we were estranged from, knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of in our unregenerate state; 'tis
not we that live, but Christ living in us,
<hi>Gal. 2. 20. Because I live, you shall live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi>
John 14. 19. <hi>Christ in us the hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
Col. 1. 27. Till Christ be formed in us,
we cannot be said to be born of God; a
spirit of life must first enter into us from
Christ; and how does this spirit enter?
Not as a separate Principle from Christ, but
in and with Christ Jesus; <hi>the spirit of life
in Christ hath made me free from the law of
sin and death,</hi> Rom. 8. 2. Have a care of
leading a separate life from Christ, in the
strength of your own Graces, for they are
but streams issuing from the Fountain of
Life in Christ Jesus, and will quickly dry
up, if not continually fed by the Fountain:
Branches cannot bear fruit, if they abide
not in the root; as the life of the branches
is in the root of the tree, so our life as
new creatures is radicated in Christ; he is
the root that bears us under all our dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and dulness; we should go to Christ
for fresh quicknings; many times we seek
for life in our selves, and can feel none; but
if we would seek for it in Christ, and come
up closer to him, how reviving would that
be? <hi>animus cum sole redit;</hi> so get but under
this Sun of Righteousness, you'l quickly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103588:23"/>
find healing; your spirits will return, your
cold frozen hearts will grow warm, the
fire will burn within ere you are aware;
what is a state of death, but a state of alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
from Christ, who is <hi>our life?</hi> Eph.
4. 18. Put him on then, and wear him
next your hearts, let him but stretch him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
all over your dark dead souls, as the
Prophet did over the dead child, 1 <hi>Kings
17. 21. 2 Kings 4. 34, 35.</hi> and life will
return, you'l find a sudden Resurrection, a
fresh vigor of spirit will suddenly come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you; if ever you would be quickned, it
must be by Christ, and with Christ, <hi>who
hath quickened us together with Christ,</hi> Eph.
2. 5. What do you alone without Christ?
No wonder you are in a dead frame, while
you are musing upon what you are in your
selves, while you are in this solitary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wandring up and down without
Christ; let Christ and you come once to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and there will be life, there will
be strength, there will be another Spirit
in you.</p>
                     <p>If God be the Author of <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
let not the Eunuch say, <hi>I am a dry tree;</hi>
all things are possible with God, who can
raise up children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of stones. I
would have none despair of becoming the
Children of God, who do sincerely desire
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103588:24"/>
it, and long for that day. New Births
are sudden things. I am perswaded they
will be so towards the end of the world,
when a Nation shall be born in a day, and
sinners be converted by thousands, as in
the Apostles time. Now we travel in birth
a great while with one and another; many
pangs, many throws, yet they stick in the
place of bringing forth; we prophesie over
dry bones, but no ratling, no coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
no spirit of life yet entring into them,
they stick in the place of bringing forth;
how many hearers are there in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
who are stuck between Christ
and the World, can get neither backwards
nor forwards, are now where they were
many years ago? They dare not cast off Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
altogether, neither dare they come
up to the power of it; they come and go
to and from the place of the Holy One,
conversing only with the dead Letter of the
Gospel, are not yet brought under the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ministration of the Spirit; 'tis the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
gives life, by bringing in Gospel Truths
in their natural living Principle into the
Heart; then we live, and the Word lives in
us; the heart and the Word are quickned
together; one was in a dead frame, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lay in a dead Letter before, but now
both do live together, and agree with each
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103588:24"/>
other; the sense of the Soul, is the sense
of the Word; and the Sense of the Word,
is the sense of the Soul; they both mean
the same thing, they fall in with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
they dwell together in Wisdom and
Spiritual Understanding; there is but one
Spirit between them; what one says, the
other does; and this is the great work of
God as he is the Author of <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
to make our hearts thus to agree with his
Word, by casting them into the mould of
the Gospel. If ever the Word be ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Soul, it must be ingrafted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a living Principle of Holiness that suits
with it, for nothing else can receive it,
or hold it, and this is the Work of God
upon the Soul in <hi>Regeneration.</hi>

                     <p>II. THE Subjects of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> who
they are, <hi>viz.</hi> The Elect, only the
Elect, and all the Elect, <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Whom he
did predestinate, them he also called,</hi> &amp;c.
Let their outward Circumstances be what
they will, whether bond or free, male or fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
1 <hi>Cor. 12. 13. Gal. 6. 15. Regeneration</hi> will
reach them all first or last. I prove it thus:</p>
                     <p>It must be either by Gods Election, or
by Man's Election, putting himself by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103588:25"/>
his own free-will into this state; or by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
no body knows how. I will prove
it must be one of these three ways, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
'tis apparent, that all by Nature are
born in an unregenerate state, and that
the Devil does carry away the greatest part
of mankind into Hell in their unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
state. These Truths are plainly laid
down in Scripture, and are capable of clear
demonstration from thence. Since neither
of them need any proof, I'le take them
both for granted, and I argue thus from
them: If all are born in sin, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
part by far, dye in their sins, Who
makes the difference, and from whence
does it arise? It must come either from
the Eternal Purpose of God electing some
and not others, or from man's own choice
electing himself, and putting himself into
this state, by the power of his own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,
so that he is regenerate because he
will be so; he will regenerate himself, and
change his own nature, and make himself a
new creature. The absurdity of this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
by and by: or else it is by an unaccount<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>able
Contingency, no body knows how or
why. It cannot be by the two latter ways,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> by the First, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Election.</p>
                     <p>1. It cannot be by man's own free-will;
for it can't be supposed that corrupt nature
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103588:25"/>
should ever will its own destruction; the
flesh is not so divided against it self; Satan
will not cast out Satan; the Devil is more
at Unity with himself than so; he would
indeed set himself above God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
him if possible; as he is, he would
be a God, he would have the use of God's
Power, that he might abuse it, and play
the Devil the more, so far he would be like
unto the most High; but he is so much a
Devil, such an irreconcilable enemy to all
Godliness, that he would not exchange his
Devilish Nature, for the Holy Nature of
God; and so are all the Children of the
Devil, <hi>Acts 13. 10. Oh thou child of the
devil, thou enemy of all righteousness.</hi> A
natural man would be nothing but what
he is; he likes himself too well to part with
his own nature; 'tis unreasonable to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
such a self-destroying inclination in
any creature whatsoever; 'tis impossible
for any nature to will a change of it self. A
Principle of self-preservation runs through
the whole Creation of God; the Toad, as
full of Poyson as it is, would be a Toad
still; so sinful man is as tender of himself,
as much in love with himself, as the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Angel in Heaven is with himself.
Whence should such an actual Will arise in
man, as to desire his own Annihilation,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103588:26"/>
that he may cease to be what he is, and
become a new Creature? There must be
another Nature put into him before he
can desire to be another Man; all do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the course of Nature, and cannot do
otherwise; therefore till nature is changed,
the course is and must be the same as ever
it was; good inclinations are never found
in depraved nature; an <hi>evil tree cannot
bring forth good fruit; figs grow not upon
thistles, nor grapes upon thorns.</hi> To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
a man in a state of nature to will his
own Conversion, is to suppose him already
converted: if the Will be changed, the
Man is changed; the Will is the Man. <hi>Can
the Ethiopian change his skin, or the Leopard
his spots?</hi> Jer. 13. 23. they may as soon
do this, as one born in sin can cease to live
in sin; we must be born again first, for a
sinful nature will never carry a man out
to a holy Life. Nature is a constant fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Principle, always keeping within its
own sphere; 'tis not a mutable fancy, that
may be taken up, or laid down at pleasure.
We see all things keep their own shape
and form; and 'twould be monstrous, were
it otherwise. The whole Creation would
be confounded, if things could run one
into another, and Metamorphise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into what different species they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103588:26"/>
please; the God of Nature has fixed
things otherwise; and I am sure none but
the God of Grace can alter the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of fallen man.</p>
                     <p>It cannot be by chance, by a fortuitous
concourse of I know not what. None but
a downright Atheist will resolve it into
this; 'tis such a denial of Providence in
the chiefest design and contrivance of the
Infinite Wisdom and Goodness of God, as
no Christian ever can bear. What is Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating
Grace, but a special Providence
towards the Elect, carried on with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Wisdom and Counsel? Where known
causes, and special ends may be assigned,
there is no room for Chance; we may
steadily look from the beginning to the
end of such a production, and trace back
the effect step by step, to its first original
cause. He that is a Christian by chance,
not knowing how or why he came to be
so, will give but a sorry account of his
Faith, and may as suddenly, with more
reason, turn Infidel again.</p>
                     <p>Therefore since <hi>Regeneration</hi> does not
happen by an unaccountable Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
nor can ever be brought about by
any mere humane contrivance, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
but that we ascribe it, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
does, to the Divine Will of him, <hi>to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103588:27"/>
whom all things are possible;</hi> beginning at
the Eternal Purpose of God in Election,
so proceeding downwards through all
the methods, ways, and means appointed
by God for the carrying on this great
work of his in the hearts of men?</p>
                     <p>The truth is, the first breaking forth of
Electing Love upon us, is in our <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
'till something of it appears, we
cannot know any thing by all that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, of God's Eternal Love to us:
Our actual taking any thing up into our
hands, argues a previous choice, that our
eye was upon it before. So here, God has
from Eternity made choise of some for
Salvation, his Eye was upon them from
Eternity; and when his Grace takes
actual hold of them, we may then, through
our present effectual Vocation, see up to
our Eternal Election, and by these visible
streams, go back to the invisible Fountain
of Free-grace in the heart of our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Father: By what he does in time, we
know what he intended from Eternity.</p>
                     <p>Let none despair of this Grace, who
wait upon God for it; all those who have
already passed the streights of the new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth,
were once under as discouraging
circumstances as any now can be; but
God had mercy on them, and so he may
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103588:27"/>
on thee; he breathed the breath of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
life into them, and so he can and
may into thee; he is a God that raises the
dead, dead Souls as well as dead Bodies.
We may see in the eye-lids of some, the
very <hi>shadow of Eternal death;</hi> but God can
turn that <hi>shadow</hi> into the <hi>morning,</hi> and cause
the <hi>day-spring from on high to visit them.</hi>
Election alters no Man's state, till it issue
in Conversion; then you may see your
names written in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> from
a sence and feeling of that life in your
selves to which you were fore-ordained.
'Till we are regenerated, we cannot tell
whether ever we shall be; God knows,
but we do not: The Election shall obtain,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 7. Therefore all that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
must ascribe it to Election, <hi>That
the purpose of God might stand according to
election,</hi> Rom. 9. 11.</p>
                     <p>The cause of this great change that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>
makes, must be resolved
either into the Will of God, or Will of
the Creature; there is no medium be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and the Creature; whatever
is done, is by one or the other. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Conversion and <hi>Regeneration</hi> into
Man's own power, derived from that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
sufficient Grace purchased by Christ
for all men: But if man in his perfect
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103588:28"/>
state fell under that general sufficient
Grace which he was certainly endowed
with at his first Creation, How can we
now suppose any such general grace to be
sufficient to recover fallen Man, and to
keep him for ever from a relapse? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we must place fallen Man under some
stronger influence, even that of Effectual
Grace, which does not only shew unto
Man the way of Salvation by Christ, but
effectually draws his heart to an actual
closure with Christ, joyning him to the
Lord in one spirit. This Effectual Grace
in saving some, does no injury to others;
they perish justly from the demerits of
their own sins; these are saved freely
through the merits of Christ. Let us not
be too curious in enquiring why God
saves one and not another; there is a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
upon the face of this great deep.
<hi>The ways of God are unsearchable, and his
judgments past our finding out;</hi> all must be
resolved into the Soveraign Will of God:
Why should our eye be evil because his is
good, who does what he will with his own,
and gives no account of his matters? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God has purposed from Eternity to
shew mercy to some, not telling us who,
let every own study his own Salvation, and
put in for his share of this Free Grace,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103588:28"/>
which is offered to all, intended for some;
and why not for thee? Those who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Promise, and believe in Jesus,
will never find any Decree in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them hindering their Salvation;
and those who refuse the Promises, will not
come to Christ when called, shall never be
saved by virtue of any mere Decree.</p>
                     <p>Faith and Repentance are as much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the decree of God, as Salvation it self;
if the Decree of God bring not forth such
things in you now as accompany Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
'twill never bring forth Salvation it
self. The Doctrine of Election is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Doctrine, if we apply it to the
Means as well as to the End: They who
deny this Doctrine, and plead so much for
Man's Free-will, they do, and must hold a
falling from Grace; tho God loves them
now, they are not sure to continue in his
love, nor never will be, 'till they run up
all their hopes into Electing Love. When
once they see that God has loved them
from everlasting, which they may do, by
resolving all the present fruits of the spirit
into election, as the Scripture teaches us;
they can strongly argue from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness
of God, That he who has
loved them from everlasting, will love
them to everlasting; for whom he so
loves, he always loves to the end.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:103588:29"/>
Let me make some use of this Point;
there may be some difficulties in it, but I
hope God will clear them up to your
Souls.</p>
                     <p>If the Subjects of <hi>Regeneration</hi> be the
Elect, only the Elect, and all the Elect;
Then prove your Election by your <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>
you cannot prove <hi>Regeneration</hi> by
your Election; for bare Election, if you
know it, alters no Man's state. Many of
the elect of God lie long in an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
state: Election is never in Scripture
brought in as a proof of Grace in us; but
Grace in us is brought in as a proof of our
Election.</p>
                     <p>To prevent mistakes in some convinced,
tho yet unconverted sinners, ay, and in
some weak trembling Believers too, whose
convictions of sin do put them into no
small fright: When I say <hi>Regeneration</hi> is a
good proof of your Election, let not any
say, Then my unregenerate state is as good
a proof of my Reprobation; it does by no
means follow, for these Reasons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1st.</hi> Because an unregenerate state, or a
state of sin and unregeneracy, has not that
dependance upon, or relation to eternal
Reprobation, as <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or a state of
Grace has to our eternal Election. A
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103588:29"/>
state of Grace flows from eternal Election;
but a state of sin and unregeneracy does
not flow from eternal Reprobation, but
from the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> God permitting it
as a means through which his electing
love would effectually work for the more
glorious restauration of Man. They who
are regenerated, are elected, <hi>Rom. 8. 29, 30.</hi>
but those who are not yet regenerated,
cannot be said to be not elected or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2dly.</hi> A state of sin and unregeneracy
is common to all, both elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates;
but a state of <hi>Regeneration</hi> peculiar
only to the Elect. We are all born in sin,
all by nature the Children of wrath; all
the Saints here on Earth, and all the Saints
now in Glory above, were once in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
state.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3dly,.</hi> An unregenerate state is alterable;
we may pass out of it into a better state;
but a state of Grace is unalterable. We
may rise up out of a state of sin, but we
cannot fall out of a state of Grace; we
may, even in a state of Grace, fall into
many particular sins, out of which God
will recover us by repentance; but we can
never fall quite out of it into Hell.</p>
                     <p>The Decrees of God are unalterable,
and so is a state of Grace flowing directly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103588:30"/>
from thence; but a state of sin and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
is alterable. I speak this to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and comfort of all convinced sinners,
that none may sink into utter despair;
because there is yet hope concerning
them.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture does not put us upon
proofs of Reprobation, but Election. We
are commanded to make that sure. 'Tis
true, final Unbelief and Despair are the
certain consequent of Reprobation; but
we must stay till the end come, we can
positively determine nothing till then;
God calls some at one hour, and some at
another hour; till the day of Grace be
quite spent, and the last minute of the last
hour quite run out. We can conclude no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of any Man's Reprobation.</p>
                     <p>There are certain Men ordained
of old to condemnation,<note place="margin">Iude 4.</note> I do not
doubt of it: God may, and doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
<hi>swear</hi> against such and such,<note place="margin">Heb. 3. 18.</note> totally
withdrawing for ever from them; and yet
'tis hard for any man to know this of
himself, or any other; for we see some
who, in their own judgments, have been
left to a total, final despair, have yet been
recovered; those who, in their own and
others apprehensions, have been under in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
hardness and unbelief of heart,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103588:30"/>
yet that also has been overcome, and they
brought to a better frame and temper.
<hi>Secret things belong to God:</hi> Let us not be
too rash in this matter; 'tis enough for a
terrified sinner to know the badness of his
present state; should he know more,
'twould quite overwhelm him, he would
be fit for nothing but Hell. God hides
this usually from the wicked'st men upon
earth, to see how they will carry it under
the means of Grace, that they may be
the more inexcusable at last, who lived so
long in the view of their danger, and of
the only way of escape by Christ, and
would not come unto him for Life.</p>
                     <p>The best way to know your Interest in
the decree of Election, is to study your
present state well.</p>
                     <p>You'll say, What are we to understand
by the present state of our Souls? And
how shall we know what that is?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Answ.</hi> The present state of our Souls,
lies in the relation we stand in, either to
Heaven or Hell; in that capacity we are
in, for eternal Salvation, or eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
if we should dye this Instant. To
know this aright, we must consider how
God has stated it; every Man's present
state is stated by God in the Word: mark
well what his declared judgment is of such
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103588:31"/>
as we are, who live as we live, do as we
do, think as we think.—I stand not much
upon the judgment of a Man, concerning
his everlasting state, unless it fall in with
the judgment of God in the Scriptures;
many will judge themselves, as their fears
or hopes do lead them, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
at all to the Word of God. We that
are Ministers must join with the Word,
whether it be for you or against you. If
you come not up to the terms of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
you are cast by the Word, we
shall quickly understand your Case; but if
you'l make new terms for your selves, and
say, If I have not such gifts, such degrees
of Grace, such enlargements and sensible
comforts; if I still remain under such
temptations, such afflictions, I will never
believe I am a Child of God; you may
say and believe what you please, but I
know no Word of God, from one end of
the <hi>Bible</hi> to the other that says as you say.
There is no end of these Objections, you'l
be sure to hold to your Opinion, you give
so much credit to your self, and so little
to the Word in that case, that all we say
from thence, in answer to your doubts, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
nothing; whereas if you grounded
your scruple upon any Word of God, we
could answer you by some other Word of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103588:31"/>
equal authority with you, and then we
should be heard, and be able to satisfy you,
by reconciling Scripture with Scripture,
and consequently you to your self.</p>
                     <p>It may be some fearful Saint, or some
secure sinner will object and say, I am not
like to understand my present state this
way, for I can't believe the Word against
my own sense and experience, as I think,
to the contrary. Having already spoken
to doubting Saints, I'll suppose this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to be made by some secure sinner.
I Answer,</p>
                     <p>Admit this, <hi>viz.</hi> That you can't Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet however be persuaded to
draw up your case out of the Word, and
say, (what you cannot but say, if you
mind what you read) If the Word of
God be true, I am in a lost state; but I
have a better opinion of my condition
than so. Could we bring secure sinners
thus far, the time may come, and will
come, if you belong to God, when his
Word will have more weight with you
than your own present thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations;
and then you'l judge of your
selves, as the Word judges, and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
What ever your present hopes or
fears may be, you'l come over to the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103588:32"/>
Word, and be of the same mind with that
concerning your Eternal state.</p>
                     <p>Don't say as some generally do, If I am
Elected I shall be Regenerated and saved
at last; so putting off all from your selves,
upon God's Decrees, as if they left no
room for your Duty; as if the Decree of
Election had no determining influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your wills, to bring forth what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed,
in a way agreeable to your rational
nature, by inclining you to the free use of
all means appointed by God in order to
your Salvation. Whereas you say, if you
are Elected, you shall be Regenerated and
Saved, pray follow that thought home,
pursue it a little further, bring it to an is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
don't stop in the midst of a thought,
in the midst of your reasonings, but come
to some conclusion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>If I am elected, I shall be regenerated,</hi>
&amp;c. But I am not Regenerated, therefore I
am at present in a state of wrath, and for
ought appears yet in me, I may be in a
state of Reprobation. And is this a state
to be rested in? Do you make so light of
it? Can you eat, and drink, and sleep so
securely under it? Methinks your own
Hypothesis should lead you whether you
will or no, to some consideration of that
dreadful conclusion which may follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103588:32"/>
on it, since God has comanded you to
<hi>make your calling and election sure,</hi> and
shewed you how you may do it. Since
your present Comfort, and future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
depends upon the proof of your
Election, How should you long to see this
sure and infallible evidence of it in your
<hi>Regeneration!</hi>

                     <p>I Have already spoken of the principal
efficient Cause of <hi>Regeneration</hi> under
the first Head; I am now to speak of the
Instrumental Cause, or outward means of
<hi>Regeneration. viz.</hi> The Word Preach'd, as
appears by these following Scriptures,
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 23.</hi> where <hi>Regeneration</hi> is plainly
ascribed to the Word, <hi>Iames 1. 18.</hi> God
is said to beget us with <hi>the word of truth.
1 Cor. 4. 15. Paul</hi> is said to have begotten
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> through the Gospel, or by
the Word of God which is able to save our
Souls. These Scriptures are an undeniable
proof of these two things: 1. That there
is a Virtue and Power in the Word, to
work a change of heart and nature in those
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103588:33"/>
that hear it. 2. That this Virtue and
Power is from God, whensoever his Spirit
concurs with it, it becomes effectual for
our <hi>Regeneration.</hi> I shall give you some
Reasons, or rather some further Illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of this Truth, from the Scriptures;
we must say nothing of the Word, but
what we have from the Word, and what
falls in with the experience of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who live in any observation of
the way of the Spirit of God, in turning
their hearts to himself. I shall make out
this in sundry particulars:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>1st.</hi> The Word is a proper medium for
the Invisible God to work by; we cannot
behold his face because he is Invisible in his
Essence; but we may hear his voice when
he speaks to us in our Language.
God never acts more like a God, like a
Creator, than when he works by his Word;
<hi>He says,</hi> and 'tis done; <hi>let there be light,
and there was light: Lazarus come forth,</hi>
and immediately a Resurrection follows:
He can as easily do as speak; his Word is
operative. God chuses to work by his
Word, that he may appear to do all by
himself. As a Creator he has nothing else
to work by: Thus he brings all things out
of nothing; he that is the everlasting <hi>I am,</hi>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:103588:33"/>
makes that which is not, to be and exist;
the essence and being of all things that are
made, flows from the Lord <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the
fountain of all being.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>2dly,</hi> The Written Word is the most
suitable means for God to make use of in
all his dealings with his reasonable creature
Man: Speech is proper to Man, he only
of all creatures has Ears to hear and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
words; as men communicate
their thoughts one to another by words, so
does God communicate his sense to us by
words; he puts his sense into our words,
adapting them to Divine mysteries, and
thereby drawing them up to a higher sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
than the wit of Man can reach
unto. The VVord is a very proper means
for God to work upon Man by, because it
is full expressive of the mind of God; and
when the Spirit is given from above, we
shall have a right understanding of it; as
a natural Man cannot know the things of
God in the VVord, without the Spirit; so
neither can a spiritual Man in this VVorld
know them without the Word: we cannot
come nearer to God now than the VVord
brings us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>3dly,</hi> The Word is the Exemplar or
Pattern of the Image of God, which is
drawn upon the face of the new creature;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103588:34"/>
plainly representing it to us in all its spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
features. We have it before us as in a
Table, that we may often examine our
selves by it, and see how we answer to that
Character which the Scripture gives of
every renewed Soul, how like or unlike we
are to it; the Word is the Mould into
which we are cast.<note place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> The Glory of the
Lord reflected upon us through the Glass
of the Gospel,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> leaves its own Image upon the
Soul. As to know God in Christ is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Life, so to behold his Glory with
understanding, is the highest Glory we are
capable of; as his Righteousness makes us
Righteous, his Wisdom, wise, his Strength
makes us strong, so his Glory let in upon
the Soul, is our glorification. Thus God
is all in all to the Saints; there is some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God in every thing that is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in them; their All is Christ in
them, without him they are nothing; and
it is by the Word they are transformed
into his likeness. What is Grace but Truth
put into the inward parts? the Law written
in the Heart, the Word abiding in us, and
turned into grace in our hearts? which is
nothing else but a living principle of Faith
and Holiness, enclining us to keep the
Word, which is an authentick copy, and
transcript of the will of God to Man.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103588:34"/>
Where there is an inward Man delighting
in the Law of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> we may be sure the
Word has been effectual in that Soul. Who
is that inward Man, but the new Man,
the new Creature, born of the incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
seed of the Word?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>4thly,</hi> The Word works morally, the
Spirit Physically; in plain English, thus;
The Word makes an outward proposal of the
Object, the Spirit inwardly enlightens the
faculty, disposes the heart to receive it:
as things of sense are perceived by a more
gross corporeal contact, so things of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Faith are let in, in a more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
way, by mental conceptions. How
all intelligible things, purely rational, do
arise from Sense, I shall not now speak to;
but 'tis certain that all inward representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of things purely spiritual and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
are made to us by the Holy-Ghost;
revealing Christ in us, and in him disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
to us the reality and truth of all
the Word speaks of.</p>
                     <p>The Word is of a persuasive strain, full
of reasonings and arguings with Man; God
debates matters with us, would discourse
us into a right understanding of his Will:
Hence so many motives and exhortations;
Faith it self is but a persuasion, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> from
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to persuade; but because the things
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103588:35"/>
discoursed of in the Word are supernatural,
we must be spiritually illuminated before
we can perceive them; the Natural Man
perceives not the things of God. The
Word is but an outward light, let it shine
out never so brightly in the plainest and
fullest Exposition that can be given of it,
yet still 'tis but an outward light, which
our dark minds cannot comprehend, 'till
God enlighten them. Snuff a Candle
never so often, a blind Man will see never
the better; but when his eyes are opened,
then he can distinguish between the dim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and brightness of the Candle: So 'tis
with Believers, they are ready to take in
the most spiritual sense of the Word; 'tis
that they wait for, they know that God
does open his mind further and further to
the Saints by the Preaching of the Gospel,
which makes them so much in love with
Ordinances; and 'tis the rejoycing of their
hearts to have any further discovery of
the Mind of God made to them in any
point of Doctrine, which they were not
so clear in before, or at least did not take so
much notice of before. 'Tis observable
how strangely the Saints are affected, and
that on a sudden, with some old known
truths, which they have a long time own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and professed, but never found them so
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103588:35"/>
warm upon their hearts before; their
hearts do glow and burn within them.
What is this but the hand of the Lord
with them at such a season, letting in his
Word with power upon their Souls?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>5thly,</hi> The Doctrine of Faith laid down
in the Word, cannot be taken into the
Soul, but by the Grace of Faith; no other
principle will admit it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>The things of God
knoweth no man, but by the spirit of God.</hi>
That this living principle of the Grace of
Faith in the heart, may be exactly suited to
the Doctrine of Faith in the Word, God has
ordered it, that one should beget the other,
to prevent all strangeness between them,
that they may the better fall in with each
other.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>6thly,</hi> The Word, as 'tis the means of
<hi>Regeneration,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts. 5. 20.</note> is called <hi>the Word of Life.</hi>
Life is promised to the hearing of it.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 15.</note> 'Tis
therefore called <hi>the word of life,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. 55. 3.</note> because
'tis the Word of <hi>Grace,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 25.</note> in distinction from
the first Covenant,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 32.</note> which neither expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
nor intended any pardoning Grace to a
sinner: All the Words of the <hi>Bible,</hi> from
the <hi>3d</hi> of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to the end of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
are words of Grace, tho there
is frequent mention of the Law, of the
Curse of it, of fearful denunciations of
wrath against sinners; yet the end of all
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103588:36"/>
is to stir us up to accept of the Grace of
the Gospel. A pure Covenant of Works,
exclusive of all Grace, is no where spoken
of, but in the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Genesis,</hi> where God
places <hi>Adam</hi> under that Covenant before
the formation of <hi>Eve;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 15, 16.</note> 
                        <hi>And the Lord God
took the man, and put him into the Garden
of Eden, and the Lord God commanded the
man, saying, Of every tree thou maist freely
eat, thou, thou,</hi> &amp;c. Here was none but
God and <hi>Adam</hi> at the making of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
<hi>Eve</hi> was, no doubt, afterwards
informed of it by her Husband, as appears
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 2, 3. where she repeats over that
Covenant to the Serpent. Were not the
Word of the Gospel a word of Grace,
there would be nothing for the Faith of a
sinner to lay hold on; no virtue nor power
in it to beget life in a dead sinner. The
life we have by Grace, differs from the
life <hi>Adam</hi> had at his first Creation, that
came in with his first being; this is life
from the dead, life given after the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of life, which is an act of mere Grace:
To raise Man out of the dust of the earth,
and to make him a living reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
was an act of God's Power and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
good pleasure: But after the fall
to give him a new life, after he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
death, and sunk himself under the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103588:36"/>
power of it; What can this be ascribed
to, but those Bowels of infinite compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in God to Man? He was not willing
that Man should die but live; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
fixes him in a state of Eternal Life in
Christ Jesus. Since a creature-life was so
uncertain, God joyns Man to himself in
one Spirit, takes him into his own Life,
that he may live for ever. <hi>Because I live,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 19.</note>
                        <hi>you shall live.</hi> I am resolved not to live
without you: my delight is among the
Children of men. I have chosen you from
Eternity to be my Associates and Friends,
to be about my Throne, and to have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with me for ever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>7thly,</hi> There are as many instances of the
Power of the Word in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> as
there are Believers now in the World, who
do all ascribe their New Birth to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Virtue and Energy of the Word, set
home upon their Hearts by the Spirit of
God.</p>
                     <div type="application">

                        <p>You see your Calling, Brethren, what
outward Means God has appointed for your
Conversion; Means not put into your
hands for you to work by, and to shew
your own skill in turning your own hearts,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103588:37"/>
but a Means that God himself will work
by: The reason why so few are converted
by the Word, is because they don't put
their Conversion upon God, saying with
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31. 18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I
shall he turned.</hi> 'Tis our duty to submit to
the use of Means, to place our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, waiting for the coming down
of the Spirit to make the Word effectual;
did we thus wait upon God in a real De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
upon him, he would be found of
us, his Arm would be revealed, we should
see more of his Glory in the Sanctuary.
Let us come then with raised Expectations
of what God only can and may do upon
our Hearts, praying that he would give
some signal Testimony to the Word of his
Grace.</p>
                        <p>The Word of God is either a certain
Truth, or a cunningly devised Fable; if it
be a Fable, Why don't you throw away
your Bibles, lay aside your Profession, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
never to hear a Sermon more? If it
be a Truth, as I doubt not you all believe
it to be, Why don't you follow it home,
make something of it? 'Tis a Word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may be saved; give God no rest
day nor night, till you attain that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In our Saviour's time they follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him for the Miracles they saw done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103588:37"/>
the Bodies of men; the Word can do
as great Miracles now upon our Souls:
When you are going to hear the Word,
think with you selves, I am now going to
see what further change of Heart God will
work in me; what Renovation of Spirit;
what further Enlightnings; what fresh
Comforts; what further Increase of God
I may find in my inward man: Did you
come in expectation of these mighty
works of God in and upon your Hearts,
no place would be large enough to contain
the comers to the word, that they
might have some experience of his mighty
saving Power passing upon their Souls:
As <hi>Moses</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
so we lift up Christ that you may
look unto him, and be healed: You look
unto men, you judg how much of Mans
Wisdom, Reason, and Understanding there
is in a Sermon; but there is not that earnest
<hi>looking for the power of God unto salvation,</hi>
as there ought to be.—Many come with
itching ears to hear some new Notion set
off with the enticing words of Man's Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
as if the strength of Human Reason,
by a Natural Operation upon the minds of
men, could lead them into the belief of
any thing that is said in the Pulpit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any inward efficiency of the Spirit;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103588:38"/>
but if this be all you look for, 'tis not
worth your coming hither; we don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any such Rhetorical Charms, to
any such prevailing Influence over you;
you may excel us in Acuteness of Wit,
Quickness of Apprehension; you may be
greater Masters of Reason than we are;
but let me tell you, the right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what we preach to you, depends
neither upon your Reason nor ours, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the bare Testimony of God; we tell
you, <hi>Thus and thus says the Lord;</hi> that's
Reason enough for you to believe, and 'tis
the highest Reason we can give for your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief;
when you have once received any
Gospel-Truth by Faith, you will easily in
the light of that Faith, allow of every
thing that may be rationally deduced from
that Truth, as included in it, and belonging
to it, though not discerned when you first
believed; here lies your Edification, to
know the extent of those Gospel-Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which you first took in by Faith; this
Faith is the Gift of God; Ministers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
you to come to Christ, to repent
and believe the Gospel, but 'tis God that
turns the Heart to what we perswade you
to: we call upon blind, dead, dark sinners
to look unto Christ, but 'tis God must give
them eyes to see him; all the perswasions
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103588:38"/>
in the world, won't cause a blind man to
see.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>You'l say,</hi> To what purpose then is all this
moral Suasion in the Pulpit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer,</hi> To very good purpose, that
whilst we are proposing the Object to you,
God may take occasion to open the eyes of
your Understanding, that you may, as
men, discern the Object through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Medium of Scripture-language so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
representing it to you. Believers do find
by daily experience, that the Words of
the Holy Ghost in Scripture being so full,
so apposite and proper, do mightily help
them in understanding the things of God,
and to this end has God given all Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Gifts, That Preachers might be apt to
teach, gathering up the sum and substance
of the Gospel in their Sermons to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
God has appointed this way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
has promised to be with us to
the end of the world, and to work effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
upon the hearts of men by these
very means; therefore let not any despise
them, and count them foolishness; the
Preaching of the Gospel is the Power of
God to Salvation; these Weapons are
mighty through God, as they are in our
hands, they signifie little, if God did not
fight with them even in our hands; we
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103588:39"/>
hold the Weapons, and manage them as
well as we can, but the piercing edge, the
overcoming weight and irresistible force
of them is from God; 'tis he that gives the
blow, and does all the execution by
them. God has in Infinite Wisdom made
choice of such outward Means as have
least of Man in them, that whilst we
compare the weakness of the Means in a
human Judgment, with the wonderful Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of them in our hearts, we may be
convinced of a Divine Power accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
                        <p>Let us come then into these Assemblies
with raised Expectations of some signal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God in his Word, for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on this Great work of <hi>Regeneration</hi>
in our Souls; we should see the Glory of
God, and be convinc'd that he is <hi>among us
of a truth;</hi> you may come in one Spirit,
go forth in another; come in one Nature,
go forth in another; come in Scoffers, go
home Believers; a plain proposal of Christ
as Crucified for us, was the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
in the Primitive Times, and so I
am perswaded it is still: Some may with
more Art, Elegancy and Learning, preach
the Gospel, yet there is nothing in all this
for Faith to take hold of, but the naked
Truth; it brings nothing else into the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103588:39"/>
Conscience, but drops all the rest; What
is the Chaff to the Wheat? I see nothing
else required to believing, but a serious
looking up to God in the use of means, for
that anointing that teaches us all things;
the Gospel is plain enough in its own terms,
<hi>He that believes shall be saved; He that
believes not shall be damned; Vnless you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
you shall perish:</hi> What can be plainer
spoken? We do as men know the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Notion of Faith and Repentance;
tho what Faith in Christ Jesus is, what
Repentance towards God is, we know not:
Here we are at a loss, and ever shall be, till
our Heavenly Father reveals these things
unto us, giving us a true spiritual discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. You have had a Bible a
great while, but it may be have not taken
such notice of the Contents of it, as you
should; go home and open it once more,
and say, This is the word of God to Man,
and to me in particular; why should I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
him who speaks from Heaven? I will
sit down, and consider what I have read,
what I have often heard; you don't know
what hold the Word may take of you,
what impressions it may make upon you;
it may fill your hearts with such serious
thoughts of God and Eternity, as you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had before: And let me tell you, if
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103588:40"/>
ever you be born again, it must be under
the power of such thoughts, kept up and
impregnated in your hearts, whilst you
are thus musing the fire will burn, and the
work will be done, you'l find a real turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Heart to Christ, which is the
Obedience of Faith, that every New-born
Soul does yield to the call of Christ in the
Gospel.</p>
                        <p>'Tis a harder matter to Convert Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
now to the power of the Gospel, than
'twas to convert the Heathen World at first
to the Profession of it; then Profession
and Power went together; now they are
unhappily separated; men hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under a National Profession, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any strict inquiries after their Personal
Interest in Christ. They came out of
Heathenism one by one, into the power
of Religion: But now an hereditary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion come upon them, they
know not well how, they have <hi>Abraham</hi>
to their Father, born of Christian Parents,
and Baptized, this is all the account they
can give of themselves and their profession:
Here Religion sticks, and here I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
it will stick; till God by a special
dispensation of his Spirit suited to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of this professing Age, does send
out Ministers by a special mission, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103588:40"/>
such who have only a name to live,
but are indeed dead. When the Gospel was
first Preached to the Heathen world, they
knew they worshipped gods of their own
making, they knew they were unbelievers,
and enemies to Christ and the Gospel; but
we Preach the Gospel now, to those who
profess they worship the true God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
Faith in Christ, and love to Christ;
they profess themselves to be all that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
which we exhort them to. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
how should we pray that God would
pour out more of his Spirit upon his Holy
Prophets, and send them forth under a
fresh anointing, that they may convince
the constant hearers of the Word, that
something more is required to the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their Souls than an outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of Religion: And what that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else is, we are all concerned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
after.</p>
                        <p>We must not flatter those who have
lived long under the means of Grace in
an unregenerate state; but plainly tell
them to their faces, that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
outliv'd the most probable means of
their own Conversion: There is yet a pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of it, God calls some at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
hour; and if it be that time of day
with any that hear me this Morning, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103588:41"/>
the hour of Conversion not yet come, let
them wait upon God with trembling, for
that blessed moment wherein his Arm may
be revealed upon their hearts, before they
have quite done hearing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quite done
living in this world; if God do them good,
it must be by the Preaching of the Word,

you may wonder why I undertake to
speak of it: Truly the whole Gospel is a
mystery, and all the chief points of the
Gospel are deep mysteries; they do not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pass our humane understanding, as men;
but as to a perfect apprehension of them,
they pass the understanding of Christians
in this world; yet these things must be
studied by all Saints, they must be Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all Ministers. Tho we prophesy
but in part, and know but in part, yet
who can tell but God may reveal to us
the unknown parts of these known truths
which we have some understanding of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?
This is visible edification, a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
increase of light, a further discerning
of the Truth as it is in Jesus. <hi>As the wind

of God; but not so to the Spiritual Man

this work: you must not expect rational
demonstrations, but sensible experiences;
and so far as any thing I shall say, may
fall under that head, I know you will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

better aim by your own light that may

I impose nothing. The manner of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
is not one and the same in all who
are regenerated, tho the thing it self,
when done, be the same in all.</p>
                     <p>Elect Infants, dying in their Infancy, are
regenerated after one manner, and adult
persons after another; the difference lies
here, the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of Elect Infants, is
the sole immediate act of the Spirit of
God, without the Word; it is indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Word, and pursuant to the
Covenant and Promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
That God would be his God, and the God
of his Seed: But it is not by the Word,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103588:42"/>
because Infants are not subjects naturally
capable of being wrought upon that way.
You cannot expect I should look further
into this great Secret, it belongs to God
only, and not to Man to know this:
Therefore in my following discourse, I
shall confine my self to the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of
adult persons, and consider the manner of
that, as the Scripture has revealed it. I
describe it thus in general; 'Tis wrought
by the Spirit of God, as the principal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Cause; not without the Word, but
by the Word as the instrumental Cause, or
outward means of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Before I enter upon this, let me put this
Question, <hi>viz.</hi> I will put it, without any
positive solution, only I will suggest to you
my thoughts, and leave the matter to your
further consideration. The Question is
this: <hi>viz.</hi> Whether any who live till they
come to the use of Reason, are Converted
or Regenerated before they come to the
use of Reason, after the manner of Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
dying in infancy? I dare not deny but
it may be so, because of some Scriptures that
look that way.<note place="margin">Luke 1. 15</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> is said to
be filled with the Holy Ghost from his
Mothers Womb;<note place="margin">Jer. 1. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
from the Womb. Tho these Texts are
capable of another construction, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103588:43"/>
that <hi>Paul</hi> distinguishes his separation,<note place="margin">Gal. 1. 15.</note>
or sanctification, from the Womb, unto Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
from his effectual calling by Grace in
Conversion: But admitting this, that some
now living may have been regenerated in
their Infancy, before they come to the
use of Reason; yet this I may say, that
such persons, when grown up, must needs
be little acquainted with the manner of
their <hi>Regeneration,</hi> because 'twas done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they knew it: nothing can fall under
their observation, but the after effects of
it, manifested in their lives; How 'twas
at first wrought, is too hard a question to
put to such.</p>
                     <p>I will venture to say this, That I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is usually otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> That
those who live till they come to the use of
Reason, are not ordinarily converted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they come to the use of Reason.</p>
                     <p>Because God loves to be understood by
us in all the acts of his kindness towards
us, therefore he will have some part of the
known history of our lives to be a standing
witness to us of our former unregenerate
state.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>Such were some of you. I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a blasphemer, a persecutor; but I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
mercy.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note> He had undeniable proof
and evidence of this in his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and within his own remembrance;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103588:43"/>
which made him so much admire the free-Grace
of God towards him, that put such
a difference between him and others, and
between him and himself, heretofore and
now. So that as the matter is cast, I am
only to enquire after the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of
adult persons, and to shew the manner of
that. My Text leads me to speak of such
who are come to the years of discretion
and understanding, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was; my
Ministry leads me to it, being sent to
Preach to such: My Auditory consists of
such; and therefore I shall apply my self to
you, and every one of you, about the
manner of your <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Among grown persons, if you take the
day of Conversion more largely, as the
Scripture often does, for the day of their
Lives, for the day of their outward Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
generally termed the day of Grace,
<hi>i. e.</hi> of outward Grace, so they all agree
in the day of their Conversion; they are
brought home to Christ within that time,
or never; tho they do not all come in at
the same hour of the day: But more of
this by and by, when I come to speak of
the time of our <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which (to
avoid all coincidence of matter) I shall
comprehend under this Head <hi>of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Regeneration,</hi> which the Scripture
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103588:44"/>
gives us some light into; we may know
something of it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly, Regeneration</hi> does not only shew
the wide difference between the two states,
the Regenerate and Unregenerate; but it
comes in a different manner upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
themselves. I say a different
manner; for there is no difference in the
nature of the thing it self, That is the
same in substance, essence, and principle
in all who are Regenerate: yet there are
some circumstances attending <hi>Regeneration</hi>
sometime, wherein one Regenerate person
may greatly differ from another, even in
the first moment of <hi>Regeneration, e. g.</hi>
Some may be Regenerated and Converted
into higher degrees of Grace in the first
moment of their Conversion, than some
others (tho as truly Regenerate as they)
may attain to all their days; all in <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
do receive one and the same spirit
of Grace, but not in the same measure.
<hi>Paul</hi> was converted into an eminency in
Grace; he was never a babe in Christ, but
was born a strong Man in Christ the very
first moment of his Conversion. God had
present use of <hi>Paul;</hi> he had designed him
for eminent service, which he was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to enter upon, and therefore God
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103588:45"/>
furnishes him accordingly. Let not weak
Saints question the truth of their <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
because they are not presently raised
up to such degrees of actual Grace as they
see in others.</p>
                        <p>Another Reason I conceive of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Saint and Saint in their
first Conversion, may arise from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
circumstances Grace finds them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
in respect, 1. Of their Years; 2. Of
their Temptations: 3. Of their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Callings.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1st.</hi> In respect of their Years. Some
may be Regenerated in their Infancy, as
was at first granted; they are capable only
of habitual Faith, of the seed and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Grace. A Man is no further capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Grace than he is of Reason; 'tis
Reason that makes a Man a subject natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
capable of Grace, and Grace usually
comes in in a degree proportionable to the
strength of our rational faculties. Where
there is but a principle of Reason, there
may be a principle of Grace brought into
that Soul; and where there is an actual
understanding, there may be actual Faith
proportionable to our actual Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
I shall not speak of Infants who are
but habitually rational, and therefore can
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103588:45"/>
be but habitually gracious. But I shall
begin with those who are next to Infants,
newly come to the use of Reason, some
are more early Converts than others. Mr.
<hi>Cotton</hi> in his Exposition of <hi>1 Iohn 2. 13.</hi>
says, that Children may act Grace as soon
as they act Reason; may be made to know
their Heavenly Father, as soon as they do
their natural Parents. This is early in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
yet I doubt not, but so it may be;
only let me put in this Observation by the
way. <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Observe. <hi>The nearer our second birth
lies to our first, the more undisernable it
is.</hi> In its first rise and original, here Grace
seems to grow up with Nature; <hi>Howbeit
that is not first which is spiritual,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 46.</note> 
                           <hi>but that
which is natural, and afterwards that which
is spiritual.</hi> The Apostle applies it to the
Resurrection of the Body, and I may as
fitly apply it to the Spiritual Resurrection
of the Soul in <hi>Regeneration;</hi> so that you
see the new creature is still the youngest
Man, if compared to the old Man. The
new creature is of a later extraction, an
after birth, or a second birth; <hi>But every
man in his own order.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Verse 23.</note> Should Grace come
in with our first being, the first introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it could not be called <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="76" facs="tcp:103588:46"/>
God does proportion his gifts of actual
and efficacious Grace, according to the
strength and ripeness of our active facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
tho all Converts have the same prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of Grace, yet the younger sort in
their tender years, are not capable of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so distinctly as others may, who are
of full Age, and have their Senses better
exercised by reason of use. 'Tis said of
<hi>Iohn,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 1. 8.</note> That <hi>the child grew and waxed strong
in spirit.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Luke 2. 40, 52.</note> So of Christ himself, tho he was
fill'd with internal habitual Grace at his
first conception; yet proportionably to his
Age his Grace did actually and more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
manifest it self. So 'tis with all young
Christians, Grace in the active part of it,
keeps peace with Nature, and does not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
violence to it; Grace may elevate and
quicken our rational faculties, and bring
them sooner to maturity: But it always
takes our Understanding and Will along
with it, in every act we put forth. Faith
is a rational Grace, an understanding
Grace, a wise Grace; there is much of the
strength of a Man's rational Soul goes out
in every act of Faith. Tho Faith be above
Reason, yet Faith can give a Reason, why
we should believe things above Reason;
and so one way or other Faith doth deal
with Man's Reason, even when it lifts up
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103588:46"/>
Man above Reason. This may be one
ground of the different degrees of actual
Grace among some at their first conversion;
I say actual Grace, because that only is
capable of degrees. A principle of Grace
is the same in all, but variously acted, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
according to the natural capacity of
the subject, or the efficacious assistance of
the Spirit; for let our rational faculties be
never so quick and strong, they cannot
carry out a Child of God, much less others,
to the least act of Faith, without the help
of the Spirit.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly,</hi> In respect of their Temptations.
Those who have been exercised with strong
Temptations, born down by the power
of strong Corruptions, when converting
Grace comes, it comes with an actual
strength, proportionable to the actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
that 'tis like to meet with, so
pulling down the strongest holds of Satan:
Habitual Grace infused at our first Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
is the seed of God.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 39.</note> The Spirit sets
home the Word, and causes a spiritual
conception in the heart; raises up the
living Image of the living God in the Soul
of a dead Sinner. This Immortal Seed,
or Eternal Principle of Grace, has the
strength of Christ in it, and is able to
cope with original corruption: But when
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103588:47"/>
it opposes strong acts of sin in those who
have been accustomed to do evil, and by
their frequent practise do sin with a
stronger hand than ordinary; in this Case
a principle of Grace must be drawn out
into acts of a proportionable strength to
these mighty acts of sin, to put a stop to
them for the future, and to turn the sinner
from them.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 9.</note> God said to <hi>Paul, My grace is
sufficient for thee; my strength is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in weakness: the power of Christ did rest
upon him.</hi> That degree of Grace may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
over one sinner, that may not so soon
prevail over another; I speak in respect of
acquired habits or acts of sin, which hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
the heart the more; besides the Devil
does not always make the like furious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
upon all. God knows how to suit
the dispensations of his Grace to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
necessities of the Soul: A Disease, the
further it spreads, the deeper root it has
taken in the Body, requires stronger Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
and more effectual Remedies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
it. So 'tis with the Soul, and Christ
the great Physician applies himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
with a sufficiency of actual,
effectual Grace. As he took notice how
many years the Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> was
bowed down,<note place="margin">Luke 13. 11, 16.</note> and bound by Satan; So he
observes what power the Devil has got
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103588:47"/>
over such, or such a Soul; if his name be
Legion, Christ will cast him out, <hi>being
able to save to the uttermost.</hi> Christ is
more put to it to save some sinners than
others, in comparison. There is (in this
respect) a greater difficulty in saving
some,<note place="margin">Mark 10. 24.</note> than others. <hi>How hard is it for
them that trust in riches, to enter into the
kingdom of God?</hi> 
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

one who has a nauseating stomach, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

swallow; he kecks at every thing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will go down with him: you may
as soon draw a Camel through the eye of a
Needle, as bring a rich Man to Heaven:
But with God all things are possible.
God is here brought in acting according
to the utmost possibility of his power in
saving a Rich Man: This may be another
Reason why some are regenerated into a
higher degree of Grace, and spiritual
strength, than may be found in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
All have the same habit of Grace
in the principle, all have a sufficiency of
actual Grace, but all have not the same
measure, neither is it needful they should;
and so comparatively, one Saint may be
stronger or weaker than another in the
first moment of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>3dly,</hi> In respect of their Employments
and Callings, which may render them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103588:48"/>
capable of higher service for God in the
World, than others may be called unto:
I instanced in <hi>Paul</hi> before, so I may in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates
and Ministers now. God in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
gives in Grace suitable to their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Callings in the World. <hi>Saul,</hi>
when anointed King, was turned into
another Man; tho that was but a civil
Conversion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it holds true in saving
Conversion.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> Also, the Spirit of God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
to every man severally, as he will;
and sets the Members every one of them
in their proper place,<note place="margin">Verse 18.</note> 
                           <hi>in the body,</hi> under
their proper peculiar gifts and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that may render them useful to
each other. The Head cannot say to the
Feet. I have no need of you; yet the Head
is the most honourable part of the Body:
And you should covet earnestly the best
Gifts. There is a gradual difference in
the Gifts and Graces of the Saints, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the several Offices they bare in
the Body of Christ, as Eyes, Hands, Feet,—
and according to the several opportunities
that Providence puts into their hands, of
serving the interest of Christ in their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                        <p>Thus much of the <hi>Manner of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
in a more general way:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:103588:48"/>
I shall now speak to the <hi>Manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi>
with a peculiar respect to the
Gospel Notion and Nature of <hi>Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as it consists in the Souls ingrafture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ, by a vital Union to him
through Faith; Christ being the proper
Fountain of that New Life which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
from him in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> and which
is ever after maintained by him in all his
true Members, abiding under the quickning
Influences of Christ their Living Head.</p>
                        <p>The particular <hi>Manner of Regeneration</hi>
in this Gospel-Notion of it, will further
appear in the right stating of this following
Question, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Quest. <hi>Whether the first step in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
be from Sin to Holiness, or from a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
state and nature to Christ, that we may
be made holy by him?</hi> I affirm the latter;
There can be no Change made in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
by the Spirit of Christ in our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but upon a Change of State from
our closing in with the Blood of Christ for
Justification. The Spirit of Christ doth
always follow the Blood of Christ; 'tis the
Purchase of that Blood; so that the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit of Christ, extends himself in
all his saving Operations, no further than
the Body of Christ; none but Members
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103588:49"/>
vitally joined to Christ their Head, can
be quickned by him; therefore no man or
woman can be savingly wrought upon by
the Spirit of Christ, who continue in a
state of separation from him.</p>
                        <p>I grant many changes may be wrought
in a mere natural man, which amount to
no more than a Moral Reformation, and
do all lye within the verge of an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
state.</p>
                        <p>Were there no more in Regeneration or
Conversion, than a turning from Sin to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
than a change of Life and Manners,
arising, as some would have it from that
General Sufficient Grace, purchased for all,
and which we may make effectual when
we please; this puts Regeneration and
Conversion into Man's Power.—But
<hi>Regeneration</hi> implies more than all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to; not only a Change of Life
and Manners, but of Nature and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
we must first fix the Principle, before
we talk of doing; we may as well do the
Actions of a living Man without Life, as
act like Christians without Christ; Christ
is our Life, a quickning Spirit in all his
Members.</p>
                        <p>Therefore I state the Question thus, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That the first step in <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is
from a sinful State and Nature, to Christ.
Or thus,</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:103588:49"/>
                           <hi>Regeneration</hi> is the Implantation of the
Soul into Christ. Or thus,</p>
                        <p>Saving Conversion in the right Gospel-Notion
of it, is Conversion to Christ:
'Tis true, a turning from Sin to Holiness,
is the effect or consequent of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but 'tis not the thing it self; the Tree
must be made good, before it can bring
forth good Fruit;<note place="margin">Mat. 12. 32.</note> so that Regeneration
lies chiefly in our incorporation into Christ;
till we are joined to the second <hi>Adam,</hi> we
are and shall be acted by that corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which we derived from the First <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
There were but two publick men in
the World, and all men do take after one
or other of them, either after the First
<hi>Adam,</hi> or after the Second <hi>Adam;</hi> they
are the two Great Standards.</p>
                        <p>I will shew that this is the right Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Notion of Regeneration and Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to this end is Christ Preached, <hi>1 Cor. 1.
23, 24.</hi> No other Name under Heaven
by which we can be saved, <hi>Acts 4. 12.</hi>
This Name must be published, <hi>Acts 9. 15.</hi>
Regeneration, or our first Conversion,
what is it but a revealing Christ in us? <hi>Gal.
1. 16.</hi> Drawing unto Christ, <hi>Iohn 6. 44.</hi>
Receiving Christ, <hi>Iohn 1. 11.</hi> Following
Christ, <hi>Matt.</hi> 9. 9. 'Twas Christ they came
over to in Conversion; hence those Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103588:50"/>
of our being in Christ, and Christ's
being in us, living in us, <hi>Gal. 2. 20.</hi> Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. Put on by us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.
27. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. Thus you see how the
New Creature, or the Regenerate Person,
has his Life, Being, and whole Subsistence
in and from Christ. <hi>If any man be in
Christ,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>he is a new creature.</hi> We are taken
up so much with Duties of Evangelical
Obedience, that we commit a great error
in our first step; do not go over to Christ
and begin there; thence it is that the
Saints are called <hi>Christians,</hi> because their
Original is from Christ;<note place="margin">Act 11. 26. 2 Pet. 1. 4.</note> they bear his
Image, are acted by his Spirit, partake of
his Nature.</p>
                        <p>If this new Life be from Christ, what is
the way of its derivation from Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, or how comes this Virtue from
Christ into our Souls, that both our state
and nature should be thus changed in him,
and by him, in order to newness of Life
in our after Conversation? You must give
me leave often to put Questions, why,
and how, and which way; because I am
now enquiring after the Manner of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If you ask, How Life comes to be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from Christ into the Soul of a dead
Sinner?</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="85" facs="tcp:103588:50"/>
                           <hi>Answer,</hi> I say, this is effected by our
vital union to Christ.—We need not
wonder that such a change is wrought in
those who are thus joined to the Lord in
one and the same Spirit; we cannot come
so near to Eternal Life it self, and not be
quickned by it; we cannot remain dead,
when we thus enter into Life it self.</p>
                        <p>The main Query is, How this Union
is brought about between Christ and our
Souls?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Answer,</hi> The Spirit takes hold of us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 17.</note>
and joins us to Christ; working Faith in
us at the same instant;<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 8. 1 Cor. 1. 9. Joh. 6. 96.</note> by which we take
hold of Christ, improving the Grace of
Union to a real Communion with Christ,
<hi>we dwelling in him, and he in us.</hi> 'Tis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Christ, that gives Life at first, and
maintains it ever after in our souls. We
have our first quickning from this Union,
and all after increases of Spiritual Life,
are but so many fresh emanations from
Christ the Fountain of Life, flowing into
our Souls. Thus we have Life, and have
it more abundantly from Christ. I shall
prove this Union between Christ and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
as 'tis productive of Life it self in
its first vital Principle, and also as it is the
cause of all after-growth in Grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the higher and more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103588:51"/>
operations of this Life, raised and
kindled in the Soul by the enlivening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of the Eternal Spirit of Life in
Christ Jesus; in both these respects, as it
causes and continues Life in the Saints, is
this Mystical Union between Christ and
Believers, spoken of in the Scriptures;
<hi>The glory which thou gavest me, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joh. 13. 22, 23, 24.</note> 
                           <hi>that they may be one, even as we
are one.</hi> The Glory that was given to the
Man Christ, did all spring from the Union
of the Human Nature to the Divine;
next to this is the Mystical Union between
Christ and Believers;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12, 13.</note> the enlivening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of this Union are set forth by an
Incorporation;<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 17, 19. 23, 24.</note> by an Ingrafture. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the Word is an outward means of
bringing this Union about,<note place="margin">Joh. 15. 1, 2.</note> making a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Christ to us, and calling upon us
to receive him. Ministers are the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
cause of this near Conjunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and Believers; <hi>They are the
friends of the bridegroom;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 29.</note> who give the
Saints in Marriage unto Christ.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11. 2.</note> 
                           <hi>I have
espoused you to one Husband.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Col. 3. 4.</note> You see
how the Scripture variously sets forth our
Union to Christ, who is our Life. <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
is the beginning of this new Life
and Nature in the Saints, which shews it
self more or less, after an inward effectual
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103588:51"/>
call;<note place="margin">Joh. 6. 45.</note> we know 'tis God the Father's Voice
who so calls us; because a Spirit of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Revelation accompanies it, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
enlightning our Minds.</p>
                        <p>By our Union to Christ, we stand in a
spiritual Relation to him, as his Brethren,
Spouse, and Members; and this spiritual
Relation to him, gives us a right to all
that he hath purchased for us, <hi>He that
hath the Son, hath life,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 12.</note> We have an
Interest in his Righteousness; 'tis ours by
Imputation; we being his, his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
becomes ours;<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 3.</note> we cannot have Christ
without his Righteousness, which in the
Infinite Merit of it, extends it self to
all Believers, <hi>Rom. 3. 22.</hi> Thus we are
made the <hi>righteousness of God in him,</hi>
2 Cor. 5. 21. Christ takes hold of us by
his Spirit, and by so doing, enables
us to take hold of him, by Faith of his
own operation in us; such a <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
such a Conversion as this, derives from
him a Principle of Spiritual Life, by
which we are carried out to all good
works, <hi>Ephes. 2. 10.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I shall further explain the Manner of
our Union to Christ.</p>
                        <p>Christ took our Nature upon him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the sin that cleaves to it in us; this
was done by a Miraculous Conception;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103588:52"/>
when Christ took our Nature, his Eye was
upon the Persons of the Elect: The Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Union of the Divine and Humane
Nature in the Person of Christ, was in
order to the Spiritual Union of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the Person of Christ; Christ took
our Nature, abstracted from our Persons,
and consequently without sin super-induc'd
upon it by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; the Person cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the Nature in the First <hi>Adam,</hi> not
the Nature the Person, as now it does.</p>
                        <p>Though Christ have taken our Nature
upon him without sin,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> yet how can we
maintain this Union and Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and our Persons, in whom
there is so much sin?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ans.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Ans.</note> Christ joins himself to nothing
but the New Creature, holds Communion
with nothing else in the Saints. <hi>Light
has no Communion with darkness, nor Christ
with Belial.</hi> Nay, he does not so much
hold Communion with us, as takes us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Communion with himself.</p>
                        <p>2. This Communion between Christ
and Believers, is carried on and manag'd
on both sides by the Holy Spirit; and
therefore must needs be a Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103588:52"/>
3. The design of Christ in uniting us
to himself, is to cleanse us from all sin, to
purge them quite out, and to sanctifie us
wholly in Body, Mind and Spirit. The
Spirit of Christ is a Spirit of Burning, it
consumes by degrees all that is contrary
to it self in our Persons, and will at last
make us exactly conformable to himself:
we shall bear the image of the Heavenly
<hi>Adam,</hi> and take after the perfect Human
Nature of Christ, <hi>i. e.</hi> Human Nature in
us, tho it is now corrupted, yet when <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>
has had its perfect work upon
us, it shall even in our Persons be reduced
to that Rectitude, Harmony and Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as 'tis now in the Man Christ; then we
shall be men indeed, Glorious Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
when we have derived our Human
Nature from Christ in all its Perfections,
and under that Divine Tincture which
the Hypostatical Union gives it in Christ.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Regeneration</hi> we pass over (by
Faith) both Body and Soul into Christ;
some present effects of this, we see in our
Souls now; and when our <hi>vile Bodies shall
be made like unto his Glorious Body, we
shall to Eternity bless God,</hi> who has taken
us out of the First <hi>Adam,</hi> and put us into
the Second.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103588:53"/>
This Spiritual Union of Believers to the
Divine Person of Christ, makes a living
Impression of Godliness upon their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Persons, which causes them to grow
up daily into a further Conformity to the
Image of Christ, as God-Man, till they
come to the stature of Perfection in him,
resembling him in both his Natures; in
the Perfection of his and our human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in him; and in such a spiritual Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
of his Divine Nature, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are capable of; and standing in this
Mystical Union to the Divine Person of
Christ, <hi>they behold his Glory, as the glory
of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> it shines
out upon them in Heaven, to all Eternity,
and lifts them up to the highest Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God, that Creatures are capable
of, and this is their Glorification. Thus I
have led you from the first step in <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
to the last, that you may see the
Blessed Tendency of so great a work, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
here in this World, and compleated
in the next.</p>
                        <p>I told you, That <hi>Regeneration</hi> is initially,
and seminally, all that belongs to a state
of Grace, ay, and of Glory too; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I may instance in any thing that lies
within the Compass of a state of Grace,
whether Adoption, Vocation, Union to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103588:53"/>
Christ, Justification, Sanctification, and
not recede from the Subject I am upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Regeneration;</hi> for all these do
nearly concern it, and lye close about it.</p>
                        <p>Some would suppose our Union to
Christ, and consequently, by virtue of
that, our Justification by Christ, to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Actual Faith, even in adult Persons,
and consequently without it; they insist
upon a Priority in Nature and Time, and
build Positions upon that distinction that
will not hold; they who speak with the
Learned, must understand with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and use their terms in their sense; they
do not suppose this Priority or Posteriority
to be in the things themselves, but only in
our manner of Conception, we first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
one, and then another; tho we
may apprehend one thing without another,
or before another, it does not follow that
those things are really without or before
each other; things that cannot be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
may by a precise act of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
be distinguish'd; but these <hi>signa</hi> or
<hi>momenta rationis,</hi> that men of art make use
of to guide their Thoughts, are too great
subtilties for vulgar Heads to meddle with;
it may be you do not reach me in what I
am now saying, and it matters not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you do or no: it renders the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103588:54"/>
so much the stronger against the use
of such Scholastick Terms in Divinity;
I am casting them out, and perswading
you from mingling vain <hi>Philosophy</hi> and
<hi>Science,</hi> falsly so called, with the Mysteries
of Faith, which are best understood in
their own native simplicity, as they are
delivered to us in plain Scripture-language.
They who hold Justification before Faith,
are afraid lest they should be betrayed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Justification by Works, if they should
hold otherwise; and therefore chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to plead for a Justification before
Faith, and without Faith, lest they should
seem to be Justified by any thing in and
from themselves; but how contrary is
this to Scripture, <hi>He that believeth not, is
condemned?</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 18.</note> But he that believeth not, is
justified, is no where written in my Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                        <p>They will admit of habitual Faith, but
are afraid of actual Faith, lest that should
encroach too much upon free Grace, and
lessen that; for say they, an act of Faith
is Mans act; and nothing that is so, must
have any place in Justification.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>1st,</hi> I Answer, Is not a habit of Faith,
a Mans habit? Is it not infused by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Man, and placed in Man? Is not Man
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103588:54"/>
the Subject of this Habit? But this is
wrought by God; and is not every Act
of Faith wrought by God in the Soul of
a Believer? I see no more danger in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
actual Faith, than habitual.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>2dly,</hi> We must distinguish between an
Act of Faith, and Works of Faith; Works
of Faith, are not Faith, but an Effect and
Fruit of Faith; an Apple is not the Tree,
but something growing out of it, and upon
it, as distinct from it; but an Act of Faith,
is Faith it self; 'tis Faith reduced to Act,
or actual Faith. 'Tis true, an Act of Faith,
is mans Act, deriving all its Virtue, Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and Signification from Christ the
Object; but 'tis not properly a Work,
but Faith it self; so that I see no danger of
running into Justification by Works, by
asserting Justification by Faith.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>3dly,</hi> As an Act of Faith is not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Work, in the legal Notion of a
Works; it is not within the Covenant of
Work; is it any where contained there,
that we should act our Faith upon Christ,
for the free Pardon of Sin? Besides, the
Scripture expresly denies Faith to be a
Work in this Sense.<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 5.</note> 
                           <hi>To him that worketh
not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
ungodly, his faith is counted for righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
therefore <hi>believing</hi> is not working for
Justification.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:103588:55"/>
                           <hi>4thly,</hi> An Act of Faith is the only Act
of a Man, that entirely falls in with the
free Grace of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 16</note> 
                           <hi>Therefore it is of
Faith, that it might be by Grace.</hi> An Act of
Faith, is a receiving Act; it brings no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of our own to Christ, but an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hand receiving all from him, ascribing
all to him, excluding all manner of boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
how can such an Act of Faith inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere
with our free Justification?</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>5thly,</hi> We say, That the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>credere,</hi> or
Faith as our Act, justifies no Man, tho
we allow the instrumentality of it in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
as that by which we apprehend
the Object Jesus Christ, by whom alone
we are justified. When we say we are justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by Faith, we mean no more but this,
That we are justified by Christ received
and applied; does it therefore follow, we
are not justified by Christ alone?</p>
                        <p>Did we well consider the Nature of
Faith in its Principle and Relative Essence,
and also in its manner of acting, we should
better understand the matter, and clearly
see that Faith excludes all Works, even its
own Act out of Justification. Tho it self be
the Act of a Man, wrought in him by
God; yet 'tis an Act so subservient to free
Grace, so intirely falling in with it, that
it does not in the least derogate from it;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103588:55"/>
but declares to all the World, that Christ
is the Sinners only Righteousness, and
leaves him relying upon Christ only for
his Justification. This is the meaning, this
is the sense of an Act of Faith: Novel
Expressions are apt to beget strange no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
Opinions, and therefore we should
have a care of them: Faith well acted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ, will never injure the free Grace
of God; why should we run up our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>
and <hi>Iustification</hi> into such ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note
beginnings before Faith, which we
can give no account of to our selves or
others, before we believe? I see not of
what use this is, to soar aloft beyond the
Knowledg and Experience of all Christians;
let us not be wise above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                        <p>I am yet upon the Manner of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and all preparatory Works natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
running into the manner of <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
or <hi>Regeneration.</hi> I shall a little consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. The best way to understand
the manner of doing a thing, is by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
all Preparations made for it; all
<hi>Praeludiums,</hi> or Introductions in order to
it; therefore it will be necessary to look
a little into the nature of these Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
which some lay too great a stress up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
limiting the Spirit of God to their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103588:56"/>
own unscriptural Methods; and Error is
soon committed here. We may run upon
the Merit of Congruity ere we are aware,
if we don't hold the Ballance of Truth
with an even hand, keeping close to the
Genius and Spirit of the Gospel, in all that
we say of this matter; which I shall reduce
to these following Heads,—shewing
you,</p>
                        <p>1. What Preparatory works are.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether there be any such certain
Preparatory works always antecedently
necessary to Conversion, and what they
are, how they are all comprehended under
Conviction of sin.</p>
                        <p>3. That the Law is of excellent use to
work this Preparatory Conviction.</p>
                        <p>4. That there is Law enough taken into
the Gospel to do this.</p>
                        <p>5. That the Law is to be Preached, but
never alone by it self, without any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gospel-Grace.</p>
                        <p>6. We must not limit the Spirit of God
to such or such degrees of Humiliation,
Repentance, Contrition, or Terror. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Hinges my whole Discourse will
turn. If any Word or Phrase I shall use,
be not to your liking, you may please
your selves with your own way of Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103588:56"/>
and speak your own language; if
we agree in Principles, and understand the
same thing, as I hope we shall, it matters
not much whether we express it in the
same manner.—I shall keep to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
proposed, and not mingle things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

discovery does best.</p>
                        <p>1. What Preparatory Works are?—
In the Sense of those who contend most for
them, they are certain previous Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wrought in the Soul, in order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
yet short of Conversion it self.
Here are Two Opinions about this.</p>
                        <p>Some would have these Preparatory
Works to be Saving Works; I grant even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
they may be, and are so some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times;
but not being always so, I see not
how that can be called <hi>Saving,</hi> under which
a Soul may eternally perish; or how any
Saving Work can be wrought in any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are in Christ.</p>
                        <p>The Second Opinion more agreeable to
Truth, is of those who call these Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Works, yet common Works of the
Spirit, but always further carried on in
all elect adult Persons, till at last they issue
in true Conversion. Here we agree; but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103588:57"/>
for those who place this Preparatory work
in such and such certain degrees of Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
and Contrition, affirming, That
Conversion is not ordinarily wrought any
other way, than by those Legal Steps,
not one of which is to be bated; this
needs some Explication.—Of which more
anon.—That God does by his Word,
by his Spirit, by his Providence, prepare
all his Elect for Conversion, I no way
doubt; but how this is done, whether
God does observe the same way, manner,
and method in this Preparatory work in
all that are converted, as he may do in
some, is not so clear to me.</p>
                        <p>2. Whether according to Scripture,
there are any such certain Preparatory
Works, always antecedently necessary to
Conversion, and what they are; how they
are all comprehended under Conviction of
sin; whether Repentance, Humiliation,
Contrition, Terror?</p>
                        <p>This Conviction of sin must be presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
in all who come to Christ for Pardon;
<hi>The whole need not a Physitian.</hi> Here we
must distinguish between initial and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Conversion; I mean, between Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
begun, and Conversion rising up
to a sensible Closure with Christ: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Sin is always antecedent to an
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103588:57"/>
act of Faith upon Christ, for the Pardon of
sin, at least it must be concomitant with it,
else there can be no reason given of a
sinner's coming to Christ; but that such
or such a degree of Humiliation, Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is always pre-required unto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
I cannot say that, Conversion is
a sudden secret work of God upon the
Soul, as the Wind blows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
how the Spirit comes upon sinners
where it lists, of all sorts and tempers, of
all conditions and circumstances, drawing
their hearts to Christ, we shall find it a
hard matter to give this Preparatory work
any certain particular name; I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
'tis very various and different; it
may be, not altogether the same in any
two that are converted; therefore to lay
down a preparatory work in all its circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
common to all that are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is very dangerous; that which hath
occasioned this, is mens dwelling upon a
distinct work of the Law, as a School-master
to Christ; because the <hi>Iews</hi> of
old were trained up under a legal admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Gospel, therefore the whole
work was then ascribed to the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the Law was never separately propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> but always in some dark
Typical Conjunction with the Gospel, tho
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103588:58"/>
they did not see to the end of those things,
yet these Types, Shadows and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
had a Gospel-end. What tho there
was a Legal Discipline in the Church of
the Old Testament? This is no warrant
for us to set up pure Legal Preaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the New; the Law of it self works
no saving Conviction of sin in any, further
than the Spirit of the Gospel goes along
with it. We may tell men their doom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to a Covenant of Works, but we
are bound at the sametime to preach Christ
to them, and not leave them under the
Law, in hopes of a Preparatory work that
may fit them for the Gospel. The Law
alone works too violently; we cannot
stand under the terror of it, <hi>Heb. 12. 18.</hi>
We are not called to Preach Damnation to
sinners, but Repentance; Christ came not
to condemn the world, but to save it. We
do indeed preach Damnation to impenitent
unbelievers, but first we preach Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
which we cannot do from the Law
alone; therefore something of the Grace
of the Gospel must be mingled with the
severity of the Law; for if that alone be
pressed, we may drive men to utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair,
I mean an absolute despair of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which prepares none for the Gospel,
but quite alienates their minds from it, as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103588:58"/>
an offer made too late. Indeed a despair of
Salvation by the works of the law, may
prepare for Christ, but then we must Preach
Christ too; I think we ought not, no, not
for a Moment, to conceal all Intimations
of Gospel-Grace from convinced sinners
purposely to keep them under the terrors
of the law, till they are as we judg suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
broken and humbled. Some have
been put into such a fright by that way of
proceeding, that has distracted them all
their days. Certainly a Gospel-Ministry
is the only Ministry appointed by Christ;
there is law enough in that to bring us to
the knowledg of sin; the Gospel does hold
forth the danger, and the remedy too;
and so must the Preachers of the Gospel.
God is so far from expecting any prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in Man, that he calls men of all
sorts, which shews that Conversion is not
limited to such or such antecedent qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
in us. God knows best when to
begin his work in us; we must leave it to
his Infinite Wisdom to chuse the season
wherein he will shew us this Mercy; he
that gives the gift, knows the fittest oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
and moments to bestow it upon us.
How many are surprized with a sudden
Conversion, in a time when they looked
not for it; when their Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103588:59"/>
did little expect it, when they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be in a frame farthest off from it,
breathing out Cruelties and Threatnings,
as <hi>Paul;</hi> but when the time comes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the purpose of God, of their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Calling, the Work is done in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant;
the heart is suddenly struck, and
the Sinner turn'd into another Man, to
the wonder of all who behold it. God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
us by his Grace, turning us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
sometimes in the height of our obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy;
and when we are without all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
Dispositions to such a Conversion,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 65. 1. He finds a heart of Stone in us,
and turns it into a heart of Flesh. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of Sin is always included in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
'tis a part of the Call it self;
while a Sinner is in his way to Christ,
actually coming to him, he comes every
step he takes, under a Conviction of his
Sin and Misery, that Mercy may be the
sweeter to him; this is but as the opening
of a Wound, when a healing Medicine is
to be applied; some Wounds may be lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in opening and dressing than others,
we must leave this to the Wisdom of our
heavenly Physitian. Conviction of Sin is
not only necessary to our first Conversion,
but to all Acts of after Conversion in the
Saints themselves, when they have fallen
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103588:59"/>
into any foul sin.<note place="margin">Psal. 38 4.</note> God made <hi>David</hi> feel
the burthen of his sins. We must be made
to know what God in justice may do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us, before we come to him for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:
he is a just God and a Saviour.<note place="margin">Isa. 45. 21.</note>
Mercy is most acceptable when we see our
selves in misery.<note place="margin">Psal. 116. 6.</note> 
                           <hi>I was brought low, and
the Lord helped me,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Psal. 118. 13.</note> says <hi>David.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>3. The Law is of excellent use to work
this Conviction, that is absolutely necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to Conversion.<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 24.</note> The Law is our School-master;
we are under the tuition of the
Law, but not under the dominion of the
Law; not at the disposal of the Law. The
Law is our Counsellor and Director, but
not our Lord and Master; it has not
power of life and death, as formerly it
had: The Law was given after the Fall to
another end, than 'twas before the Fall.
The Law was a Covenant of Life to <hi>Adam</hi>
standing, declaring the justification of a
Righteous Man; but now 'tis as loud in
condemning the Sinner. The Law speaks
to Man according to the different state he
is in, of Innocency or Sin:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 19, 20, 21, 22.</note> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
voice of the Law is kept up in
the ears of sinners, to provoke them to
come to Christ. The Law was Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and thirty years after the promise
made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and could not disannul
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103588:60"/>
the Covenant of Grace, but only serves as a
School-master to lead us to Christ. The
great Lesson we are now to learn is Christ,
faith in Christ: The Law serves to evince the
necessity of this, the Law teaches the same
thing with the Gospel, but not by the same
argument: It argues from love, not wrath.</p>
                        <p>4. There is Law enough comprehended
in the Gospel to work this preparatory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of sin; we have an authentick Copy
of the Law in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> 'tis kept
there on record,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> 
                           <hi>in terrorem. Cursed is
every one,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 21.</note> 
                           <hi>Do you not hear the Law,</hi>
says <hi>Paul?</hi> Thus the Gospel sets life and
death before us: Death to all who are
under the Law, and Life to those who are
under Grace; therefore let us study the
Gospel, and study the Law in the Gospel.</p>
                        <p>5. The Law is to be Preached, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
alone by it self, without any mention
of Gospel Grace; nothing purely legal
can prepare a sinner for Conversion; the
Law must be Preached, not legally, but
Evangelically, as 'tis in the Hand of our
Mediator, who knows how to use it for
Conviction, for Humiliation and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The Law tempered with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
is an excellent means for the Spirit of
Christ to work by; the Law is now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
to the Gospel; so much of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103588:60"/>
Law is taken into the Gospel as is sufficient
to produce Conviction, Humiliation, and
Terrour too, if need be; but the Law
alone is not to be Preached; That is not
in our Commission, as we are Ministers of
the <hi>New Testament.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Preparatory work I am speaking
of, is principally ascribed to the Gospel,
as appears by <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Ministry.<note place="margin">Luke. 1. 16. 17.</note> 
                           <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Baptist was the greatest Legal Preacher in
all the New Testament, yet a true Gospel
Preacher too; <hi>viz.</hi> his special business was

                           <note place="margin">Luke. 3. 3.</note>

ground of comfort, had he had Grace to
consider it; we must keep back nothing
God would have spoken to sinners;<note place="margin">Acts. 20, 20.</note> we
must not be always affrighting your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
with Legal Terrours, 'tis necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sometimes to draw the Sword of the
Law, that sinners may see their danger;
but we must tell them also whither they
must fly for refuge; else we preach not the
Gospel; we don't know how far the Sword
of the Law may enter, how deep it may cut
into the Conscience of a convinced sinner; it
may be dangerous to leave the wound blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one night, without applying some Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Lenitive,
pouring in some oyl: our first
Faith in Conversion sometimes takes more
after the Law, sometimes more after the
Gospel, as the Spirit sets it a work either
for Terror or Comfort; we must not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the Spirit of God in one or the other;
we must not say such a one shall be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to such a degree, shall lie so long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Terrours of Conscience, before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
be spoken to him; the Spirit is the
best judge of this; and knows our frame
better than we do, and what way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure
is most suitable to the inward sense
and feeling of such a one's Soul; this must
be left to God to speak Comfort or Terror
when and in what degree he pleases. We
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103588:61"/>
who are Ministers, must lay down the
ground of both in our Preaching, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon one or t'other as we see occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
—But God may do as he will. If I
see a broken humble sinner a little revived
under a sense of Mercy and Pardon, I
would not check his comfort, nor seek to
bring him under terrors again: but if I
see a hardened impenitent sinner going
on in his sins, I would lay the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him in the most terrible manner I
could, and shew him the dreadful conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
of a Course of sin persisted in, that
the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
against all such who do not repent, and
turn to God, that they may find Mercy:
we cannot Preach the Gospel, but we must
refer to the Law; the Gospel shews how
we may be delivered from the curse of
the Law, and therefore must needs men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it, and I am sure we ought not to
Preach the Law alone without any disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Gospel Grace.</p>
                        <p>6. We must not limit the Spirit of God
in converting sinners to such or such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of humiliation, contrition, or terror
as we think necessary; for we are not
competent Judges in that matter: so much
Contrition of sin as causes a loathing of sin,
a desire to leave it, and to obtain Mercy
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103588:62"/>
of God, in the Pardon of it is sufficient for
conversion; God may carry on this Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
work farther or farther, to a higher
or lower degree as he thinks fit, as the
present frame of our hearts may require. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Conviction is the first thing in order
belonging to Conversion, but that convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to such a degree of Repentance. Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and Terror, should always be a fixed
constant Preparatory work, antecedent
to all beginings of true Conversion, is not
so evident. That all true Converts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of their Sin and Misery by Nature,
I no way doubt; and that the Law is of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use to work and heighten these
Convictions, is not to be denied; and
that many be under meer Legal Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Terrors, who may or may not be
afterwards converted, is not disputed
neither; the Spirit of God may improve a
common work, those terrors or any other
afflicting providences, to lead a sinner to
Christ; but it does not therefore follow
that such Legal Terrors must always go
before Conversion, no more, than such or
such awakening Providences made use of
by God to Convert some, should necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
befall all who are converted.</p>
                        <p>Saving Gospel Conviction of sin, includes
in it all that is in a mere Legal Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103588:62"/>
with this difference, that under a
Gospel Conviction of sin, we see the folly
of it as well as the danger, and always
have an eye to Christ, which does allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
the sinking overwhelming Terrors of
a meer Legal Conviction only, which is
as the nethermost Hell, a dark dungeon
indeed, without the least cranny for any
beam of Gospel light to shine in upon a
poor distressed Soul, trembling under a sence
of eternal vengeance. It is not the design of
Christ that any so concluded under wrath
by Law, should be left one moment without
any tender of Gospel grace, which if they
do reject and despise, God may and does
sometimes judicially give them up to a
final Tormenting despair. We cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
urge upon sinners that which is
the consequence of final unbelief, till we
have first Preached the Gospel to them;
and then at their peril be it, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it not.</p>
                        <p>Some Convictions of sin that issue in
Conversion, will be found to have their
beginning with it, <hi>i. e.</hi> some Convictions
that issue in a visible Conversion, may
have their beginning in an inward, latent,
and yet invisible Conversion to us, that
does not at present appear under that
name. To our discerning, the Soul may be
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103588:63"/>
in travel some time before the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
appears, before we can say such or
such a one is born of God, and yet the
Converting act of the Spirit of God may
be truly passed in that Soul, before it is
manifest to us, in the sensible effects of it.</p>
                        <p>Let us not separate saving Conviction
from true Conversion, and look upon it
as only Antecedaneous and Preparatory
to it, when indeed 'tis a real part of it,
and essentially belonging to it.</p>
                        <p>A true Gospel saving conviction of sin,
is a higher work of the Spirit of God in a
regenerate Soul, than a meer Legal Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of sin is in a Natural man, let it
run up into never such Frights, Fears and
Terrors.</p>
                        <p>There are some common lower works
of the Spirit, that may be, and are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
mistaken for saving grace, and there
are some special saving works of the Spirit,
that go but for a common work with
some.</p>
                        <p>Common works are not always in the
intention of God so much as Preparatives
for Conversion; it may be said to be <hi>finis
Operis,</hi> but not <hi>Operantis,</hi> God not giving
them Grace to improve their Legal Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
either they wear off, or else they
sink under them into despair.</p>

The Law may terrifie a sinner, but
till his heart comes to be affected with the
love and mercy of God, he will never
turn from sin; but then his Soul melts
within him, he looks unto him whom he
has pierced, and is in bitterness. The sense
he has of the love of God to sinners in
Christ Jesus, kindles love in his heart
towards God, which is a full evidence of
real Conversion. We never turn to God,
but we begin to love him, then we grieve
for sin as sin; with a true godly sorrow,
that causeth Repentance unto Salvation.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 10.</note>

                        <hi>To day if you will hear his
voice:</hi> And there is a particular hour in
that day, wherein Saving Grace takes hold
of us by God's Effectual Calling, which
is best known by our Obediential Hearing,
when we answer to the Call, Lord here
I am, ready to comply with thy Will in
all things; What wouldst thou have me
to do? and I will do it. Consult your
selves about this; when you first find your
wills brought over to Christ, write down
that as the day of thy Conversion; you

upon the Will, in turning that to God:

in Christ, let it fall in what year of thy
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103588:64"/>
life, in what hour of the day it will, so
the thing be done, it matters not when as
to the issue of it; to be converted, is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to Salvation; but to know precisely
the time when, is not necessary, provided
you know the time when it was not; or
at least not so manifest to you as now it is.
It shall be done unto the last as unto the
first; the last and the first Converts in an
Age are equally welcome to God, and
there is something peculiar in both, that
does very much set forth and signalize the
freeness of God's Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> That he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the one so soon, and the other so
late; that he came so early to one who
had heard so little, and that he came at all
to the other who had heard so much, and
despised it. Late Converts are very rare;
he that comes not in now, while 'tis called
to day, may slip his opportunity, and die
under a dreadful conviction, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately
refused a fair offer of life and
pardon that was made him at such a time,
in such a Sermon, by such a Preacher,
who may be called forth to witness against
him at the last day. Whether you believe,
or not believe, the Word will have its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
one way or other upon you all, either
as a favour of life or death. When the
favour of the knowledg of Christ is not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103588:65"/>
a sweet Savour,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 14, 15.</note> we take offence at it;
Death indeed may follow that deadly scent;
'tis a dangerous symptome of Eternal death
to be offended at Christ, at the purity and
strictness of his Heavenly Doctrine. A
distinct remembrance of the certain time,
means and manner of our conversion, is
very comfortable; but tho we be at some
loss here, yet if we can prove the thing it
self, 'tis enough. He that does the real
actions of a living Man, gives sufficient
proof and demonstration of his first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and real birth into the World, tho
he knows not the day and hour of either.</p>

                     <p>They are not my Marks, but God's, laid
down in his own terms, as 'tis written in
your <hi>Bibles;</hi> what you find in your selves
answerable thereunto, I must leave to God
and your own Consciences. The Text
tells you, <hi>Vnless a man be born again, he
cannot see the kingdom of God.</hi> And <hi>Iohn,</hi>
in his Epistle tells you, unless these marks
be found upon him, he is not born again:
and dying in that estate, is excluded Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for ever. <hi>Iohn</hi> foreseeing what false
notions of <hi>Regeneration</hi> men wou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> taks
up with, and rest in, to prevent all fraud,
all mistakes in so great a point, lays down
these infallible marks of true, real <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
as 'tis distinguished from that which
is but pretended, false and counterfeit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="118" facs="tcp:103588:67"/>
For ought I see, there is no more required
to <hi>Regeneration,</hi> in the judgment of some
men, than to be born in such a Country
where Christianity is professed, and to be
Baptized according to the custom of the
place; this is the whole of <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
as some state it, tho none of these marks
appear in them, but the quite contrary:
They commit Sin, they don't do Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
they hate Christ and his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
are overcome every day by the
World, and the temptations of it; yet
these must go for Regenerate persons, let
the Scripture say what it will to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
But let us not deceive our selves,
God will judge us by the Word, and none
will be looked upon at the last day as
truly regenerate, in whom all these marks
are not found. I do not say that all are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
who see not all these marks in
themselves, but those who have them not;
to be wholly defective in any one of them,
overthrows our state: These marks are so
linked together, as to the certainty of their
being, that they are inseparable, tho as to
our perceiving 'tis otherwise: we may not
so clearly discern some of these in our
selves, as we may some others. I would
carry it with as gentle a hand as I can;
I perceive these marks in the right appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103588:67"/>
of them, will bear hard upon us
all, and it may be, leave us under a godly
jealousy of our selves, examining our state
with trembling. Truly this I aim at, I am
sure we shall suffer no loss or damage by it
in the end. God has put his own stamp
upon his own workmanship, that it may
be known to be his. Shew me your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi>
under God's seal and mark, and
I shall rejoyce with you in it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
it to be his workmanship indeed.
And now Brethren, produce your evidences,
such as the Word of God calls for. I shall
begin with the first Mark:</p>
                     <p>1. He doth not commit sin,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 9.</note> he cannot
sin. He sinneth not,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 18.</note> but doth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Here is a Negative and a Positive
Mark,<note place="margin">1 Joh 2. 29.</note> what he doth, and what he doth
not. I shall first speak joyntly of them
both together, and then separately of each
apart by themselves.</p>
                     <p>The sense in general of this Scripture,
is, That he who is born of God, does so
far express his Image, and take after his
Holy Nature, as to hate that which is evil,
and to love that which is good; he has put
<hi>on the new man, which after God is created
in righteousness and true holiness.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph 4 23, 24.</note> 
                        <hi>Escaping
the corruption that is in the World
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103588:68"/>
through lust.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4. 1 Joh. 2. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>If ye know that he is righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ye know that every one that doth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
is born of him.</hi> He proves the
new-born Soul to be a true Child of God,
because he so much resembles his Heavenly
Father in Righteousness and true Holiness;
we cannot be partakers of his Nature, but
we must be also partakers of his Holiness:
they are inseparable. But to keep to the
Negative mark, <hi>He commits not sin &amp;c.</hi>
The common interpretation of this Text
is, That such who are born of God, sin not
with full consent and allowance, they go
not on in a course of sin, they sin not
the sin unto death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this is true,
and does belong to the interpretation of
this Text; yet I conceive there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
further intended as the ground of all
this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he who is born of God,
as such, sins not at all. He that is a new
creature may sin, but not as a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
this is an absolute truth contained in
the Text. Under all the distinctions, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and soft interpretations that are
given of this Scripture, we must be sure
to maintain the words of the Text as
they are expressive of a certain abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
truth, else we shall quite lose the
mark here laid down by the Holy Ghost,
of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> and therefore I shall
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103588:68"/>
first fix that, and make it as plain as I can,
that we may the better judge of our state
by it; 'tis matter of Life or Death; all is
now upon Tryal; your eternal Interest lies
at stake, therefore in so great a case we
had need go by sure marks and signs,
and none so sure as those that are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
terms laid down by the Holy Ghost, of
<hi>Regeneration;</hi> as we must not raise them too
high in contradiction to other Scriptures,
so neither must we sink them too low,
lest we lose that Characteristical diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that the Holy Ghost here puts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Regenerate and Unregenerate;
the mark lies here, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That there is in every Regenerate Soul
an inward living Principle of Grace and
Holiness inclining us to good, but never
to evil, always giving check to sin, never
approving or allowing of it.</p>
                     <p>A Regenerate person may fall into
acts of sin, through humane Infirmity,
but cannot give himself over to sin in a
constant habitual way; he cannot go
on in sin; 'tis against his Nature; he
may be surprized into an act of sin,
but the new Nature will quickly recover
it self, and cast out that sin by Repentance.
<hi>A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit;</hi>
sin is not so connatural to a Regenerate<note place="margin">Mat. 7. 18.</note>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:103588:69"/>
Person; he can't brook it, his heart rises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it, from the Antipathy he has to it;
when he does sin, he would not sin; and this
we say, is from the Grace of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The assertors of Free will, do hold, That
man cannot incline to good, without the
general assistance of the Spirit of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but they own only such an assistance as
may be resisted by us, and leaves it to our
option whether we will do good or evil;
but that the will of man should be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by God to a good act, and yet act
freely under that determination, is that
which some will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not understand, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
such an overruling efficacy of Divine
Grace to be inconsistent with the liberty
of man's will. The prevailing efficacy of
sin in fallen man is undeniable; whose
thoughts and imaginations are evil, only
evil, and that continually; yet those
thoughts and imaginations, with all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
acts proceeding from them, are free;
so that what they deny to the efficacy of
grace, they allow to the efficacy of sin;
That, it seems, does not destroy the liberty
of mans will, but the efficacy of grace
does: the mistake lies in a misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Nature of Irresistibility; grace
is irresistible, not because it cannot be
resisted, but because it cannot be
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103588:69"/>
overcome, else 'twould not be effectual;
the efficacy of Saving Grace lies in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the free consent of the will to
follow its motions and inclinations.</p>
                     <p>God made man perfect; and that he
might not impose upon his rational Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
left him a free agent, giving him li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to good or evil; his Perfection did
not lye in having liberty to evil, but in
not using it, in abstaining freely from evil
out of choice; when he fell, God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
and left him perpetually inclined to
his own first choice, which nothing can
draw him off from, but effectual Grace;
not by forcing, but changing his will. It
was never the intent of God in our first
Creation, that man should exert his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
both ways, to do good and evil; but
that he should freely chuse his own way
at his first setting out, and be delivered up
into that Power which he should first Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
By his obedience he would have been
confirmed in good, never to have fallen
from it; so by his disobedience he was
confirmed in evil, never to be recovered
out of it, till free Grace of its own accord
relieved him. And this it does gradually,
not all at once, which is the reason why
the Saints in their imperfect state here,
do both good and evil, being flesh as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103588:70"/>
well as Spirit. Grace has the Predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy,
because it enters in against the full
Power of reigning sin, breaks in upon
corrupt Nature whether it will or no,
sows immortal seed, where never good
fruit grew before; the Predominancy of
sin lies in a total exclusion of Grace,
but the Predominancy of Grace lies in
its gradual entrance into the Soul,
because it opposes the whole body of sin,
or indwelling corruption, in making this
forcible entrance, forcible in respect of
corruption that would keep it out; free in
respect of the renewed will, through which
it passes by consent; God in opening the
heart, makes the heart to open it self. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is our act, but the power of doing
it, is God's. They who are endued with
this Divine Power, cannot do the evil they
would do, and are inclined to by nature:
Gal. 5. 17. <hi>They are no more servants of sin.</hi>
Rom. 6. 17. <hi>But have ceased from it.</hi> 1 Pet.
4. 7. They cannot sin; there is something
in them called here the seed of God, that
cannot sin, <hi>1 Iohn 3. 9. They are born of
God;</hi> but he that committeth sin, is of the
Devil, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. a Child of the Devil.</p>
                     <p>To clear up this further.</p>
                     <p>There are two different Natures, two
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103588:70"/>
contrary Principles in the Saints, Flesh
and Spirit; the Scripture speaks of them
sometimes according to one Principle,
sometimes according to the other, and
sometimes according to both; as Flesh,
so no good thing dwells in us; we all sin;
he is a liar that says he has no sin; as
Spirit, so we don't commit sin, we can't sin;
are inclined only to good, by that Divine
supernatural Principle; as Flesh and Spirit, so
not a just man upon Earth but sins, tho he
be just and holy, truly sanctified in his
Regenerate part, yet he is unjust, unholy,
unsanctified in his unregenerate part;
there he fights against God; the law of
the Members wars against the law of the
Mind; the sense of this remaining enmity
against the Law of God, makes the Saints
complain of their wretchedness. <hi>O wretched
man that I am.</hi> Rom. 7. 24. What careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
what clearing of themselves, what
Indignation and Revenge? <hi>2 Cor. 7. 11.</hi>
Tho God has forgiven them, they cannot,
they will not forgive themselves, they cut
off their right hands, and pluck out their
right eyes.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture speaking of a Saint ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to one or other of these two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
speaks of him personally as two
Men, each distinct from the other; as if
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103588:71"/>
a Saint when acted by a carnal Principle,
were not the same Man with himself,
when acted by a spiritual Principle. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically
and substantially, he is the same
Man under both Principles; but spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
considered under those Divine Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
belonging to him, as a new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
he is not the same Person in God's
account, nor by his own reckoning; <hi>not
I, but Sin that dwells in me.</hi> Could we keep
up this distinction under a prevailing
Temptation, clearing our selves, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sin at its own door; <hi>not I, but Sin;</hi>
'twould afford much comfort to us, and
quicken us up to a speedy Repentance. An
unregenerate Man when he sins, he can't
say, 'tis not I; he lies if he says so; he
sees nothing in himself that opposes Sin
as Sin; no, 'tis his own proper doing,
his own act, his whole Will is in it; he
can't say, <hi>the Evil I do, I would not do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Can we in any sense say, That we do
not commit Sin, that we cannot Sin, do
no iniquity? Is there such a Principle
within us,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 3.</note> that we can say from our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
we would not Sin, even when
we do Sin? That 'tis against our Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">Rom 7. 16</note>
'tis a force upon the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
we are in Pain, and cry out under

'tis an unwilling Captivity that we are led

                     <p>I have done with the Negative part;
what a regenerate Person does not, He
does not commit Sin. I come to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
part,<note place="margin">1 John 2. 29.</note> He doth righteousness.</p>
                     <p>Negative holiness in abstaining from such
and such Sins, will never prove a Man to
be born of God; we cannot conclude
safely and strongly from this negative
Mark, That we are born of God, unless
it be from the universality of it; if we
can truly say, We hate every evil way,
do fly all appearance of Evil, cannot suffer
Sin in our selves or others, without a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Indignation against it; this indeed has
something in it, is very significant; we
may infer from hence, that we are born
of God; that which makes this Mark so
conclusive and significant, is not only the
universality of it; but chiefly this, that
where-ever this negative Mark is, there is
also the positive Mark to be found; he that
<hi>escheweth Evil, does Good.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 11.</note> The force of
one Mark is best understood in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ction
with some other; one single Mark
is but a slender evidence of a state of
Grace, unless it run into some other,
which is the inseparable consequence of it.</p>
                     <p>The Positive part is, He doth Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:103588:72"/>
what do ye more than others? <hi>Opè<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
sequitur esse;</hi> all things have their
active qualities especially where there is
Life, there must be active Faculties, and an
active Principle; life it self is an act; the
life of a Christian is a life of the highest
activity, from Principles truly Divine and
Heavenly, that have their energy, virtue,
and efficacy from God himself, who is a
most Pure, Simple, Eternal Act, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of all Action and Motion to his
Creatures, as he pleases more or less to
communicate himself unto them. Since
we are made partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
surely 'tis in order to a godly life,
that it may appear whose off-spring we are,
whose image we bear; being born of the
Will of God, we must do the Will
of God, which is the only rule and
measure of all Righteousness; in doing
which, we must respect the matter what
God commands, and the manner of doing
what is commanded. What is materially
good, is obvious to all who know but
the Moral part of Religion; all the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
lies in the manner of performing it;
the spirituality of the action lies here,
that it be done from a Gospel principle,
and to a Gospel end; it must be done in
Faith, and in a constant dependance upon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103588:72"/>
Christ for strength, doing what we do as
unto the Lord, out of a Religious respect
to his Holy will; whatever we do, we
must do to his Glory; 'tis below a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
to seek himself, to live to himself. God
hath set a part the man that is Godly, for
himself.</p>

me. When you drink any strong spirits,
they heat within; the vital spirits do take
them in, feed upon them, are raised by

after the Image of Christ, growing up into
his likeness, like in judgment and affection;
not that our natural Faculties are altered,

of other minds, spirits and dispositions, than
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:103588:74"/>
before, taking after the second <hi>Adam,</hi> not
after the first; being by Faith implanted
into Christ, we are made partakers of his
Divine Nature; this is called a second
Birth, or a new Creation, though out of
the same physical materials of Flesh and
Blood, the change is only spiritual; as the
Wild Olive, when engrafted into the True,
as to its materials remains still the same;
'twas wood before, so 'tis still, only there
is a new sap secretly convey'd through the
pores of it, which make it bring forth
more kindly, and pleasant Fruit: so the
Sinner, as to his physical substance, was
Flesh and Blood before conversion, and so
he is still; yet there is an inward spiritual
change wrought in him by his implanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
into Christ, who infuses his Nature,
Spirit and Grace through the Man, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him a new Creature, not taking away
his Manhood, but sanctifying his Nature.
God is the Fountain of all Holiness, 'tis es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential

God; being partakers of the Divine Nature,

God appropriates goodness and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness

                     <p>Corruption indeed is always active in a
Saint, because it acts naturally without
any cessation; but Grace does not always
act, at least so sensibly in a Saint, because
it must be first acted by the Spirit, who is
a free Agent: should Grace always be as
active in us as Corruption, we should mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
it for Nature, and ascribe all to our
selves; the Spirit of God is always in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
but does not always work so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
so sensibly; the operations of it are
not so manifest to us as sometimes they
are.</p>
                     <p>This righteousness that is said to be
done, lies not so much in the perfection
of the Deed, as in the perfection of the
Doer; he aims well, though he cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hit the mark; he cannot do the
good he would, yet he <hi>wills</hi> it, and that
is <hi>doing</hi> in God's account, who accepts the

                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:103588:75"/>
The inclination or tendency of a new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Soul to holiness, appears three ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> Before the Temptation, <hi>i. e.</hi> not
before the being or existence of a Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for there is no such season; we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
compassed about with many Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
a regenerate Soul is aware of this,
and fears always. But before we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this or that particular Temptation that
we see coming towards us, or have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to suspect from the present circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
we are under, here a regenerate
person watches and prays that he may not
enter into that Temptation, that God
would some way or other divert the
Temptation, or fortify our hearts against
it, that we may repel it. A Temptation
may enter into us, when we don't enter
into it; then it goes, as it comes, and
makes little or no impression upon us:
when a Temptation shews it self to us at
some distance, the Seed of God in a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
Soul presently takes the alarm,
puts on the whole armour of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> Under the Temptation, when
the Flesh has betrayed the Soul into the
hands of a Temptation, has been tampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
with it, then does Grace struggle and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103588:76"/>
fight, and cry out unto God for help; all
this shews the activity of Grace in a way
of righteousness, how loth it is to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of evil.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> After the Temptation, when
'tis ended, or finished, then it issues either
in the commission of the Sin, or conquest
over the Temptation. Grace shews it self
both ways.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> After the commission of Sin;
what repentance, what godly sorrow,
what shame, what indignation, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> After the conquest over the
Temptation; what rejoycing, what thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
what triumphing in the Grace of
Christ?</p>
                     <p>So that you see here lies the manifest
difference between the Children of God,
and of the Devil—An unregenerate man
cannot do righteousness; his skill lies not
that way; he is wise indeed to do evil;
but to do good, no knowledg, he is a meer
Bungler at a good work; his hand is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
out, because his heart is never right
with God. He may do what is materally
good, but always fails in the manner; those
spiritual Ingredients which the Gospel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
to a work truly holy, are wanting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="137" facs="tcp:103588:76"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Whosoever believeth that Iesus is
the Christ, is born of God.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 2.</note> And every spirit
that confesses that Iesus Christ is come in the
flesh, is of God.</p>
                     <p>They prove each other, being insepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                     <p>The going forth of the Soul, by Faith,<note place="margin">Observ.</note>
unto Christ, as the anointed of the Lord
sent and sealed by the Father, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the great work of Man's Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
is a sure evidence of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
All unregenerate men are strangers to
Christ, they know him not, they desire
him not, they think they can shift well
enough without him: None know the
Son of God, but those who are born of
God. When the Spirit comes into us, then
we confess that Christ is come in the flesh;
Christ conveys himself through our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to our persons; the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature must be first united, before
our persons can be admitted to any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with him. The Humane Nature
of Christ is the foundation of all our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God: our access to God is
through the veil of his flesh.<note place="margin">Heb. 10. 20.</note> Being born
of the Spirit, we stand related to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ, he is not ashamed to call
us Brethren; we can then call God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103588:77"/>
as he is the Father of Christ our elder
Brother. God was the Father of Christ
before his Incarnation, and continues still
to be so after his Incarnation, not only to
him, but to all who are born of his Spirit:
The Spirit of Christ being the Spirit of
him who is God and Man, knows how to
raise up a seed of godly men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
                     <p>The Infinite Eternal Spirit of the Son of
God, being poured out without measure
upon the Man Jesus Christ, operates
through both his Natures, hypostatically
united in his Divine Person, in whom all
the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily,
without any diminution of its infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
and Divine properties, from
the assumption of our finite humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
so the same Eternal Spirit of Christ
dwelling in us, in a lower way of union
to our persons, does act indeed Divinely;
but yet according to our finite capacities;
all intellectual acts are finite or infinite, as
the persons are that do them; the Person
of Christ being infinite, so are his spiritual
actings, notwithstanding his finite nature as
Man; so the actings of the Spirit of God
in the Saints are finite, because their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are so. <hi>Actiones sunt suppositorum:</hi>
Actions are personal, of greater or lesser
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103588:77"/>
degree of efficacy and power, as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are that do them.</p>
                     <p>Faith in Christ Jesus being the birth of
the Spirit, must needs be an infallible mark
of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> the design of the Spirit
of God in working Faith in us, is to bring
us to the knowledg of Christ, and through
him to the knowledg of God, wherein
consists our true happiness; <hi>This is life
eternal to know thee, &amp;c.</hi> Faith is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Eternal Life in the Soul; and
the manner of conveying this Eternal Life
from God unto our Souls, is called <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>
Thus you see how he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
that Jesus is the Christ, is born of
God.</p>
                     <p>The next inquiry will be, how Faith
does this; or how believing in Christ
does work that universal change in the
Soul, which the Gospel calls <hi>Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Tho the beginning, or rather all the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials
of <hi>Regeneration</hi> are found in the
first principle of Faith, created in us by
the Spirit of Christ, yet this does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us but by those lively operations of
this Faith put forth by us. We have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
feeling of these operations, the sense
of which does lead us to some discerning of
that spirit and principle from whence they
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103588:78"/>
flow. 'Tis actual Faith <hi>Iohn</hi> means in this.
Epistle, therefore he joyns it with Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he lays the Mark upon actual Faith;
for that only falls under our discerning.
God indeed sees the first seeds and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Grace; but they are known to us
only by the sense we have of their power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
actings in us: and therefore I shall consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the regenerating Power of actual Faith,
and shew how it does discover that new
birth that came in with a principle of Faith
at first.—The Regenerating power of
Faith, both in the principle and in the act,
is very great, it makes a marvellous change
in us.—So strong are the impressions of
Faith, about Christ and our everlasting
concernments in him, that we must needs
be much affected with the discovery;
which lies in two things:</p>
                     <p>1. In a convicting knowledg of our sin
and misery by Nature.</p>
                     <p>2. In an astonishing discovery of God's
Grace and mercy to us in Christ.</p>
                     <p>The Spirit of God demonstrating both
unto us with such clearness and evidence,
that we cannot but be persuaded of the
truth of them in our own case; and being
so persuaded, we must be concerned about
them. Faith draws in the attention of the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103588:78"/>
mind to those things we believe in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to our selves, fixes our thoughts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, dwells upon the consideration
of them; there is no evading the serious
thoughts of Faith, no getting them out
of our heads, nor out of our hearts; they
lye close, they lye next us, always in our
view, <hi>My sin is ever before me.</hi> Christ
dwells in our hearts by Faith, we have the
whole state of our Souls before us from
first to last; Faith shews us where our true
interest lies, what is of absolute necessity
to be done in order to Salvation. We see
all this in Christ, who is God and Man,
<hi>made sin for us, that we might be made the
righteousness of God in him.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 21.</note> In Christ we
see how matters stand between God and
Man, we see all that passed between God
and Man in order to his recovery; the
whole method, way, and manner of our
restauration from first to last; we see the
wages of our Sins, and the price of our
Redemption; we see the Law and the
Gospel both fulfill'd in Christ; God's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Justice and Mercy highly exalted and
glorified in him. 'Tis a pleasing ravishing
sight to behold God in Christ reconciling
the World unto himself; to observe the
mystery of his manifold hidden wisdom in
carrying on the great work of Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:103588:79"/>
all this Faith discovers to us in
some measure, filling us with a Holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of God's unspeakable kindness
and love to us, provoking us to pursue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the great ends of the Gospel. How
busie is the Soul? how full of discourse
with it self? What secret inferences does
an enlightned Conscience draw from what
it believes? This believing Jesus to be the
Christ, takes in all that belongs to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Christ, in all his Offices; takes in
the whole Doctrine of Christ, all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
all his Promises, applies all to the
Soul; Thou art the Man spoken of, and
spoken to in the Gospel; hear, and thy
Soul shall live. Now is the accepted time,
now is the day of Salvation; Faith admits
of no delays, won't give us one days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
from the work it hath cut out for us.
So Faith wrought in <hi>Paul,</hi> when Christ
was revealed in him, immediately he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted
not with flesh and blood; Faith
changes our Counsels, alters the whole
frame of the Soul; the Man is a new Man,
born again into a new World, into a new
Nature, quite of another spirit: This is
the Regenerating power of Faith. Let us
then judge of the truth of our Faith, by
the great change that it always makes in
those who are brought out of darkness into
this marvellous light.</p>

                        <pb n="143" facs="tcp:103588:79"/>
Should we ask some Professors, what
effect their Faith had upon them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon their believing in Christ they
found themselves born again, made new
creatures? It may be they will say, they
hope they are the better for believing, that
their Faith has not been without some
good effect. Alas, what a slender account
is this? how short of a new birth? You
may be the same Man that ever you were
for all this, in the same state in which you
were first born.—Art thou born again?
born of God?—Speak to this. Some
outward Reformation there may be, where
there is no inward <hi>Regeneration.</hi> Hast
thou a new heart? dost thou lead a new
life? is the whole course of thy life chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged?
are all things become new within
and without? Faith in Christ changes us
into the same image, transforms us into
his likeness, lets in the Spirit of Christ
further and further into the Soul, till we
are so filled with the Holy Spirit, that there
will be at last no room for a worldly spirit
to breathe in us; it will be quite extinct
and die away. The more we see of this
newness of spirit in any, the more of the
new creature appears in them. When the
Apostle would take off the <hi>Ephesians</hi> from
a vain,<note place="margin">Ephes 4. 20.</note> worldly course of life, he shews the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103588:80"/>
inconsistency of such a course, with the
true knowledg of Christ.—You have not
so learned Christ, you have been taught
better things by him than to walk as the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> do, in the vanity of their mind.
Faith in Christ works so great a change in
all the faculties of the Soul, in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
will and affections, and in our
outward conversation too, that a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
may well be said to be born again,
from the newness of life that appears in
him; and to be born of God, from the
holiness, spirituality, and heavenly nature
of that life which he now lives by Faith
in the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>Till the Regenerating power of Faith do
thus appear in us, we have no reason to
think we are born again.</p>

                     <p>That which overcomes the World, must
be of a higher extraction, of a more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

corrupt state; it must be something
distinct from the World, and above it,
whatever is born of the Flesh is but Flesh,
falls in with the World to which it belongs,
and of which it is a part: but God having
chosen some out of the World, and called
them to a Heavenly Life, has promised to
give them a Heavenly Nature, to beget
them again unto himself, to put his own
Spirit into them, that they may walk as
New Creatures, who are not of the World
though they live in it; they are Born of
God, do bear his image, their hearts are
moulded into the belief of his word, they
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:103588:81"/>
can do nothing against the truth, but every
thing for the truth; these are they who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the World, the men of the world, and
the Things of the World; the Spirit &amp; Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of the World, the Fears and Hopes of the
World, the Lusts and Pleasures, and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the World, they are dead to all
these, not moved by them, but do steer
their course by a higher light let down
from heaven into their hearts; and this is
their Victory, even their Faith; they have
nothing to oppose against the World and
all things in it that may disquiet and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose
their Spirits, but their Faith, and
by believing,<note place="margin">Heb. 4. 3.</note> they enter into rest; all who
are Born of God do thus live by Faith here
below; they consult not with Flesh and
Blood, their affections are suited to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of their Faith, they are filled
with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory;
by believing they see good days a coming,
when all Tears shall be wiped from their
Eyes, they wait patiently till then, rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
in the hope of the Glory of God. Till
we get into this frame, walking in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not seen, we shall never
overcome the World; for the things that
are seen, conceive them in what shape

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103588:81"/>
they are but finite and temporal; the
present Fashion of this World, be it what
it will, passes away into something else,
while we are a beholding it; all things
here below moulder and crumble away in
our hands, perish in the using, are always
the worse for wearing, which shews they
cannot last long; when they are in their

and makes it to decline ever after, till its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Glory be quite extinguish'd; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour not for the meat that perishes,
but for that which nourishes unto Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Life. Till we come to Live upon
Eternal unseen things, we live but meanly,
in the midst of our Earthly sufficiencies we
are in straights, still wanting something till
Christ be ours, and then all is ours. There is
no room left then for any further designs,
in him we have plenary satisfaction and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
rest, we shall never have true hearts ease
till then. But the difficulty lies in bringing
over our hearts to this Newness of Life to
this Noble Life of Faith, that fetches all its
Comforts from Heaven, casting up its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103588:82"/>
within the Vail, which is sure and
stedfast; Flesh and Blood cannot do this,
there is nothing in Nature that disposes us
to it, therefore we must be born again, be
made New Creatures, before we shall favour
the things of heaven; and such is the power
of Religion upon the minds of men, where it
is in truth, that it always works this change
in them; they find it, and feel it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Whether it be so with us, whether we
have any certain experience of such a thing
in our own Souls, we should do well to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that even upon our knees, and give God
no rest day nor night, till we see some better
symptoms of Eternal Life in our selves;
we may judge of our life whether it be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
or no, by the things we live in, and
live upon; they who are of the Earth, are
Earthly; they who are born from above, are
heavenly, to be carnally mindedis death, but
to be Spiritually minded is life and peace;
The inward frame of the mind discovers
what kind of Creatures we are,<note place="margin">Prov 4. 23.</note> whether old
or new, flesh or spirit; the issues of life are
from the Heart; as the pulse of your Souls
beats upwards or downwards, so you may
judge of your state, as you find your selves
most concerned in things above or things

and have overcome it, you are not born
again.</p>

                        </note> as directly

shew how this loving disposition arises out
of <hi>Regeneration;</hi> that the fundamental
ground of it is our conformity to Christ,
which necessarily follows upon our <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:</hi>
Christ is the express Image of his
Father; the Saints are in their finite capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
the express Image of Christ, in whom
they see the Father, who as God, is one with
the Son; whilst they behold the Son as
God-man, they see their humane Nature
hypostatically united to the Divine; they
see their humane persons joined to the Lord
in one Spirit.</p>
                     <p>I doubt not but the spiritual glorified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ is the medium of the beatifical
Vision to Angels and Saints above; the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
shines through it in all its brightness,
as the Sun shines through pure Chrystal;
shines upon it, shines into it, fills every part
with light; there is nothing to obumbrate
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:103588:84"/>
or shade it, it transmits the light to us with
advantage.</p>
                     <p>The Bodies of the Saints at the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
being freed from all mortality, and
natural weakness, being then immortal,
spiritual Bodies, like unto that glorious Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ, they are capable of receiving
this reflected glory from Jesus Christ; they
have a nearer and more inward view of God
in Christ than the Angels have, because they
see him in their own nature face to face,
and nothing between, the Glory of God
shines out upon them in the Face of Christ;
thus are they made light in the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
changed into the same Image by the
Spirit of the Lord.—What is thus done
unto perfection upon the Bodies and Souls
of glorified Saints at the Resurrection, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done in some degree upon the Souls of
the Saints in this life; the Image of God in
all his communicable Attributes is impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
upon them; they partake of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
Wisdom, Goodness, Love; are merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
as their heavenly Father is merciful;
and cannot but express something of all this,
as they are new Creatures, holding forth the
Image of the heavenly <hi>Adam,</hi> which carries
them out to a love and liking of it self, in
whomsoever it appears: therefore he who
says he loves God, and hates his Image in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:103588:84"/>
another, is a liar. Those who know God in
Christ,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 4. 20.</note> will be sure to take notice of his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in the Saints; God in Christ is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our worship, and Christ in the Saints
is the Object of our endeared love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
God is invisible, we see him not; it
must be pure faith that keeps up love to God;
but Christ in the Saints is more visible to us;
here; we have something to help our faith,
and to draw out our love; we see the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God, we converse with them, we
may lay our hands upon them, and embrace
them; God allows us to bestow our love to
him upon his Saints, 'tis still to him, when
showed to them for his sake;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note>

                     <p>There is a Creature life, which is but a

creature; and an uncreated and eternal life,
which is God himself.</p>
                     <p>A Creature life is either of Spirits or

                     <p>How immaterial spirits are maintained in
their created natural living beings, we must
leave to God that made them; only this I
may say, that the Eternal life of the Elect
Angels in which they were created, and
confirmed by Christ, differs from that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life which Believers have in Christ; the
one is a creature life, or a created life; it once
was not, tho it shall never have an end; the
other is the Eternal Life of God himself
communicated in time, and in some degree
to his creature Man, which makes him a new
creature, taken into the Eternal Life of God
himself, according to man's finite capacity.</p>
                     <p>All sublunary living creatures have their
proper nourishment assigned them by the
Providence of God; they all live upon their
fellow creatures, and have their food
suited to their several kinds, which by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
appetite they are carried out unto;
Man who has the dominion over the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
has his choice of every thing made for
food; but the new man, or the new creature,
being born of God, united to God in Christ,
and quickned by his Eternal Spirit entring
into him, has Eternal Life continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:103588:85"/>
to him from Christ the second
<hi>Adam,</hi> who is a quickning spirit, dwelling
always in the Saints. If it be asked, what is
the <hi>Patulum vitae,</hi> to the Saints, as they are
new creatures; I answer, they have meat to
eat that the World knows not of, <hi>hidden
Manna,</hi> secret communications from Christ,
who is their life; and because they have not
an immediate fruition of him here, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are commanded to feed upon
Christ by Faith in the Word, and to gather
up the Heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> they meet with
there. Faith knows how to live upon God
in the Word, till the Soul can have a nearer
access to him by vision above, face to face;
then we have life more abundantly, are even
swallowed up of life, are all life, without any
symptomes of mortality about us: then that
life and immortality which the Gospel has
brought to light, will more fully appear, and
be made manifest in all glorified Saints.</p>

of Religion will quickly be lost amongst
us, unless both be better exemplified in our
Lives and Conversations.</p>
                        <p>The Gospel is set before us as a new
mould into which we our selves must be
cast; it comes to work a great change in us,
not of our opinions only, but of our Hearts
and Nature, to create us again in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
unto good works; Is this done? where
this is not done, that man's pretended inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Religion will deceive him, and come
to nothing. You may be of this or that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion,
of this or that Party, have excellent
notions of Divine things in your heads, and
yet not have one tittle of the truth writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your hearts. I don't ask what you hold, or
what you profess, or what you know, but
what you are, what Newness of Spirit do
you find in your selves? My Text speaks of
something to be done in you, and upon you,
Is that done? Art thou born again? Art
thou a new creature? I speak the Language
of God to you, a new creature is that which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:103588:87"/>
you must be before you die, else you'l be
undone for ever; it concerns you to look
what that is, do you look to that; A new
creature you must be, else you perish eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally:
better you had never been born, if
you are not born again before you die. Let
not the strangeness of the expression, nor
the mystery of the thing it self, take you
off from seeking after this <hi>Regeneration</hi> in
the Text; 'tis something must be wrought
in you, you need not go further than your
own selves for a proof of it; let every one
view his own heart well, wait for a change
there, carry thy old, carnal, unbelieving
heart to God, and say, Lord create in me a
clean heart; take away this heart of Stone;
I lay it down at thy feet, I dare not take it
back again, I dare not go from thee in my
old sinful corrupt nature: O let thy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
power pass upon me this instant,
that I may become a new creature. Did
we come with raised expectations of such
a work, we should see the Glory of God in
some inward astonishing effects of his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power upon our hearts: He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
light to shine out of darkness, and
calls things that are not as tho they were,
gives them a being by his creating power.
Things that are not, do answer to this call
of God, as if they had been there before;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:103588:87"/>
they come forth out of their own nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
deriving a real being and existence
from the operative Word of the Lord; he
speaks, and it is done: So able is God to
raise up Children unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> even out
of Stones; a Stone may as soon turn it self
into a living creature, as a natural Man
turn himself into a new creature; only
there is this difference, a Stone has no sense
to perceive any such change brought upon
it, but a natural Man has; he is a living
Soul; and when converting Grace comes
upon a Man living in sin, to turn him from
it, he must needs feel the opposition that is
made to the whole course of his corrupt
nature; the conflict that is between two
living contrary principles is felt on both
sides; Sin feels it, and Grace feels it; the
Flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit
against the Flesh; the Flesh is hindred from
doing all the evil it would do, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
from doing all the good it would do;
they retard each others motions; one pulls
one way, and the other another; these two
are contrary, they never agree in any thing.
A sinner finds himself dying to sin, under
the quickning regenerating influence of the
Spirit of God; though corrupt nature per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
not the beauty and glory of Grace,
yet it sees and feels the contrariety of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:103588:88"/>
Grace to it self, and is full of enmity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it; as the Spirit of God does assist
our dying graces, so the Devil, that evil
spirit, does what he can to keep alive our
dying sins; he would fain prevent the utter
mortification of sin in Believers, if it were
possible: You see what striving and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
there is in every regenerate Soul, two
living men contending with each other,
the old man and the new; there is a mighty
strength in the old man, but the new man
is stronger than he, enters in upon him by
an irresistible force, binds him, and at last
casts him quite out. Let us either throw
away our <hi>Bibles,</hi> and resolve never to look
into them more, or else submit to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Scriptures in so great a Case
as this is—<hi>Verily, Verily,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>ROM. 10. 17.</bibl>
                     <q>So then, Faith cometh by hearing, and
hearing by the word of God.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE Apostle towards the close of
the Ninth Chapter speaking of a
twofold Righteousness, of Works
and of Faith, tells us that the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
did attain to the Righteousness of Faith,
but the <hi>Iews</hi> did not attain to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
of Works, which they so much
trusted in, <hi>for they being ignorant of Gods
Righteousness, and going about to establish
their own, have not submitted themselves to
the Righteousness of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 3. Hence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103588:90"/>
the Apostle takes an occasion to compare
the Righteousness of the Law, with that
of Faith; calling one our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the other the Righteousness of God,
which the Law do's tacitly point to, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
Life to perfect Obedience, this not
being found in any mere Man since the
Fall, we are directed to seek it in Christ,
who is the end of the Law to every one
who believes, <hi>ver. 4.</hi> he brings in <hi>Moses,
verse</hi> the 5th. describing the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which is of the Law, that <hi>the man
which doth thsoe things shall live by them.</hi>
Such doers of the Law we are not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can look for nothing but Death by
Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Verse</hi> 6th. He brings in the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Faith by a <hi>Prosopopeia,</hi> speaking
it self to an afrighted dejected sinner, who
is also brought in musing upon his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Condition, full of sad thoughts, saying
over many dismal things to himself in his
own Heart about his Eternal State, how
shall I get to Heaven, how shall I
escape Hell, how shall I dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Burnings which I see no way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
by Law, the righteousness of Faith
meets this convinced Sinner, in this great
distress of Conscience, communes with him,
discourses of Christ to him, minds him of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103588:90"/>
his Resurrection from the dead, and
Ascension into Heaven, you seem (says
the Righteousness of Faith) to deny both
in talking at this rate, your way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is plain, Christ is ascended, you shall
as surely go to Heaven, if you believe as
Christ is gone before you, as surely escape
Hell and overcome Death, as Christ is
risen from the dead, and the only way to
get an Interest in Christ is to attend to
the word of Faith that is preached, <hi>ver.
8.</hi> when once that prevails and brings you
to confess with your mouth the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
and believe in your heart that God
hath raised him from the dead, you shall
be saved <hi>ver. 9.</hi> this proved out of <hi>Isa.
28. 16. Whosoever believes on him shall not
be ashamed, whether Iew or Gentile, ver. 11,
12.</hi> and because Prayer is the principal
part of that outward Confession made
with the Mouth, and the best indication
of Faith in the Heart, he concludes <hi>ver. 13.
Whosoever shall call upon the name of the
Lord shall be saved.</hi> Whence Observe;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Observ.</hi> The chiefest thing we should now
pray for, is, that we may have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in Christ and his Righteousness,
desiring to be found in him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103588:91"/>
Having spoken so much of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Faith, he does in a certain gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
shew the way and means of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, it is not a Righteousness that is to be
done by us, to be wrought out with our
own hands, but prepared for us by another,
freely promised and given to us, therefore it
must be askt, it must be earnestly pray'd for,
we must beg hard of God to impute it to
us, <hi>v. 13.</hi> the Law propounds the work of
Righteousness to be done by us, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
(<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.) propounds the Gift of
Righteousness to be pray'd for and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
received, <hi>v. 14.</hi> there can be no Prayer
without Faith, no Faith without Hearing,
no Hearing without a Preacher, no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
unless they be sent, from all which he
draws this Conclusion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the next
immediate Cause of Faith is Hearing.</p>
                  <p>There is much Preaching and much
Hearing in this City, but what comes on't?
Truely if Faith does not come, nothing
comes that will turn to any good Account
to you: The Apostles in the Primitive
times so spake that many believed, <hi>Acts</hi>
14. 1. with that evidence and power, their
words had a special Accent in the Ears and
Hearts of those that heard them, God gave
a signal testimony to the word of his Grace,
than fear came upon every Soul, <hi>Acts</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103588:91"/>
2. 43. Those who were not savingly
wrought upon, were greatly astonished
at the Doctrine of the Gospel; 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
now, how little of this astonishment
does appear in our Assemblies, where is
this fear that came upon every Soul, 'twas
short of Faith, yet I am perswaded when
Faith comes in some open eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
that the whole Assembly is usually
struck with some present fear, the Word
comes like a mighty rushing Wind into
the Congregation, shakes all, when 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to Convert one; something like
this may be observed in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the
Apostles, and other passages in the New
Testament, it is sit that Grace should be
solemnly attended when it goes forth to
the publick Conversion though but of one
Soul: If God intend the coming of Faith
into any of your hearts this day, he'l come
along with his Work, he will prepare the
way, he'l bless your hearing, and speak
something inwardly to you from himself,
that shall incline your hearts to believe
the Gospel, though God speaks by the
Ministry of man, yet his voice is distinct
from ours, and begins where that ends,
carrying the Word from the Ear to the
Heart, there leaving it under those mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Faith that make it work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103588:92"/>
Hear I beseech you with diligence
least you obstruct the coming of Faith by
not attending to what shall be spoken to
you in the name of the Lord. <hi>So then
faith cometh by hearing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> Hearing the Word of God Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us, is the ordinary means of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
faith in us.</p>
                  <p>First, What are we in a more special
manner to understand by Faith here in
the Text.</p>
                  <p>The general Object of Faith is the
whole Doctrine of God laid down in the
Scriptures; the special object of Saving
Faith, is the Free-promise of Grace in
Christ Jesus, this supports the former, we
must believe the Divine Narrative of the
whole Will of God revealed in the Bible,
before we can pitch our Faith in any suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
actings upon any part of it, 'tis one
thing to assent to the Truth of the Word
in General, a further and indeed another
thing to apply the Promises; he believes
a Promise who do's fiducially rely upon it,
this is properly Trusting, we believe
something in reference to our selves, liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a comfortable Hope and Expectation
of it, respecting not only the Truth of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103588:92"/>
the thing, but also the Goodness of it in
reference to our selves under that possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
probability or certainty of obtaining
it, which our Faith, according to its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Degrees may represent unto us, Faith
in the Righteousness of Christ for justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is here principally intended.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Why must this Faith come
by hearing. Hearing is alwayes antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to Faith, though Faith be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the consequent of Hearing, <hi>ver. 16.
18.</hi> all Hearers are not believers, though
all Believers are first Hearers.</p>
                  <p>I shall evince the necessity of Hearing
in order to Faith, from these following
grounds:</p>
                  <p>I. <hi>Hearing is Sensus Discipline,</hi> the Sense
by which all Knowledge is let into the
Soul. There is a two-fold Knowledge
belonging to Faith, one leading to it, the
other found in it, arising from it, and is
the same with Faith it self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The First,</hi> is Litteral or Historical, 'tis
rather <hi>notitia</hi> then <hi>cognitio,</hi> a notice or
particular information given us of the
Contents of the Bible, especially of the
report which the Gospel makes of the
way of Salvation by Christ, we must
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103588:93"/>
know what we are to believe, before we
can be supposed to believe any thing;
<hi>How shall they believe in him of whom they
have not heard, and how shall they hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Preacher.</hi> Words are the proper
Object of this Sense of Hearing, where
nothing is spoken, nothing can be heard,
the sound of Words must reach the ear,
before the sense of those Words can enter
into the Understanding. This Historical
Knowledge do's not lye in Learning the
Scriptures by roat, without any Rational
Knowledge of the Litteral Sense and
Meaning of those Propositions of Truth
that are contained therein, this would be
only Memory without any Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
A Natural Man does not dis-believe
the Scripture, because he has not a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Conception of the common Notion
of things spoken of there, but because he
has, and finding them so uncouth, so
seemingly contrary to Humane Reason,
he rejects them as Foolishness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second,</hi> Is a Knowledge more than
Historical, and is of the Essence of Faith
all one with it, it is that which we call a
Saving Knowledge; it lies in the Use
and Application of Gospel Truths to our
own Souls, when we shape our selves to a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103588:93"/>
real Conformity to the Call of God in
every Gospel Truth, acting in a way of
Duty what the Word of God commands.</p>
                  <p>There is no Saving Knowledge of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Truths, but the Knowledge of Faith,
and no other Reason for Faith in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Misteries of the Gospel, but the bare
Word of God.</p>
                  <p>That Faith is Knowledge, I prove thus,
Because in Scripture, 'tis opposed to Folly,
Blindness and Ignorance, <hi>Acts 17. 23, 30.
Ioh. 17. 3. Ier. 31. 34. Isa. 9. 1, 2.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides it has all the effects of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the Soul, it gives full satisfaction
to the Mind of a Man, removes all doubts,
establishes the Heart in a full perswasion
of the Truth of the Word of God; Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Knowledge is liable to many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes
but a Divine Faith admits of no Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood,
therefore Faith perfects mans Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
because it brings in nothing but
Truth, no mans Errors do proceed from
Faith, he may err in matters of Faith, but 'tis
not from his Faith, but his Unbelief, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Faith is Knowledge, unerring Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
we believe and are sure, we may be
so, if we rightly understand our selves in an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103588:94"/>
act of Believing, no demonstrations of
Reason, do give that Evidence of Truth
as Faith do's, as mans Understanding is
too low, to take in Divine Truths, so
Gods Understanding is too high, for man
to comprehend, therefore we are called
to yield the obedience of faith to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Will, God governs man rather by
giving him the knowledge of his Will,
then lifting him up into his own Infinite
Understanding, that is above our Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
our Duty lies not in knowing what
God knows, but in doing what God
commands, who gives no account of his
matters to us, only commands us to believe
his Word, and to look upon that as a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground and reason of our faith,
when we hear it preached to us.</p>
                  <p>II. <hi>Because</hi> God has appointed hearing
the Word, as a necessary means of faith, he
will not immediately speak to our hearts
by his Spirit, but has appointed his Word
to be first spoken to our Ears, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
that way to let it down into our
hearts, thus <hi>Faith comes by Hearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How should Hearing of things
above our Reason contribute any thing to
our believing them? One would think
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103588:94"/>
the oftner we hear them, the more absurd
we should count them to be, and reject
them with greater Indignation, having so
often tried them by the Touchstone of our
own reason, and pronounced them unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Hearing alone will not let in
these Divine Mysteries into our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,
<hi>Isa. 6. 9, 10.</hi> God must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Teach us and reveal them to us
by his Spirit, before we can believe them,
which brings me to the third head, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>III. How faith is wrought by our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Word.</p>
                  <p>1. By a special Appearance of God to
the Soul.</p>
                  <p>2. By opening the Heart, enlightning
the Mind, and perswading the Will to a
thorough closure with Christ upon Gospel
Terms.</p>
                  <p>To these two heads may be referred
all that falls under our discerning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the work of the Spirit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
faith in us.</p>
                  <p>1. Faith is wrought by a special appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103588:95"/>
of God to the Soul, what this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of God is, how it rises out of
the Word, in what manner 'tis let into
the Soul, I shall endeavour to open to
the experience of those who know what
it is to hold Communion with God in
hearing his Word: there is some co-inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the particulars above-mentioned,
yet not without some distinction, which I
leave to your own observation, the less
of Art or Method there is in handling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental
points, the better, they come
with most power to the Conscience in
their own simplicity, therefore I shall in a
joynt Discourse run the matter close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
looking sometimes on one side,
and sometimes on t'other, till I have view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it round, that I may present the whole
Truth to you in so great and necessary a
point, we can have no saving knowledge
of God but in and by his word, we must
look through that Glass upon him, and
that appearance of God we meet with
there, is the beginning of all Religion,
the Word never comes with power to
our Consciences, till God appear in it.</p>
                  <p>How that is, I am now to shew. Whilst
we are hearing his Word we see God
standing forth, in his own words, declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103588:95"/>
himself to be the Author of it, this
draws in our attention, adds that weight
and authority to the Word, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but receive it as the Word of God,
and set our Seals to the Truth of it, we see
sufficient grounds for our Faith in God
from this manifestation of himself to our
Souls. Thus God wrought faith in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Gen. 17. 1.</hi> by appearing to him
several times as God Almighty and All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient,
that <hi>Abraham</hi> might not doubt
of any thing that such a God should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to him, and therefore 'tis said <hi>Rom.
4. 3.</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, being
fully perswaded that what he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
he was able to perform, <hi>ver. 21.</hi>
Thus God appeared to <hi>Samuel</hi> revealing
himself to him by his Word <hi>1 Sam. 3. 21.</hi>
So Christ appeared to <hi>Paul</hi> by a voice,
and a Light from Heaven, I am Jesus,
<hi>Acts 9.</hi> there are spiritual appearances of
God now to our Souls under the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel answerable to these Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Old. God lets himself down into
our Hearts, through the apprehensions of
our faith, which frames in our hearts a
right image of God answerable to that
Character he gives of himself in the Word,
he shines through the Word in all his
Glory, when he spake of Old to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103588:96"/>
by an articulate voice, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
word then was accompanied with
such convincing signs of his Presence, that
they could not but believe it, and so is the
written Word now as capable of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
God to us, when he has a mind
to be seen by us, as that was then; the
Letter of the Word is but a Creature, but
the Truths contained in it are Eternal, and
do all center in God himself, who is the
Essential Word, thus God rises out of the
Word, and looks a man in the Face, tells
him, thus saith the Lord, I am that Lord
God Almighty who now speaks unto you,
he leaves no Objection unanswered, shews
what sure grounds of faith, we have in
him, shall God say and not do? 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for God to lie, it must be so as
God saies, it can't be otherwise, Heaven
and Earth shall sooner pass away than one
Tittle of the Word be broken, thus in
God we praise his Word, <hi>Psal. 56. 4. 10.</hi>
Consider the Word out of God: 'twill
puzzle Men and Angels to make out the
meaning of it, to think the things spoken
of possible or likely to come to pass, but all
things are possible with God, and to those
who believe in God, they stick at nothing,
they are sure Omnipotency knows no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficulties,
the Counsel of the Lord must
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103588:96"/>
stand, his thoughts shall come to pass: a
Soul thus struck with a sense of Gods
Presence yields immediately, I believe
Lord with all my heart, am ready to do
whatever thou requirest of me, so <hi>Paul:</hi>
Oh that God would so manifest himself to
every one of your hearts this day, that he
would shew himself, come up close to
you, look you in the face, and say, I am
Jesus, you could not withstand this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
presence of God in Christ Jesus, O speak
Lord, 'tis but thy saying to each of us I
am Jesus, and we shall all be made to
know the Lord from the least to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
I hope the quickning voice of the Son
of God, is now sounding in the Ears of
your Faith, while I am speaking to you,
and that you do receive the Word, not
as the word of Man, but as it is indeed
the Word of God, quick and powerful,
sharper than a two-edged Sword in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of your hearts.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of the Truth as 'tis in
Jesus (<hi>Eph. 4. 21.</hi>) is one thing, and the
knowledge of the Truth as 'tis in Ink and
Paper is another; they are the same
Truths, but as they are in the Scriptures
they lie in the dead Letter, as they are in
Christ they are seen in their living root
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103588:97"/>
and principle from whence they spring,
meer Scriptural Knowledge is but Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
we look upon the things we read
and hear, rather as notions than realities:
till God fills up all expressions of Scripture
concerning himself, with a Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
answerable thereunto, we believe
nothing that is said of him, but such a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God in his Word, captivates our
hearts to the belief of it, we must believe
him to be such a God as the Word declares
him to be, before we shall count all his
sayings true, we must fetch strength from
the name of God, <hi>Rev. 2. 13.</hi> to support our
Faith in all its actings upon any part of
his revealed will, and we never deny any
Truth plainly revealed but we deny his
name, <hi>Rev. 3. 8.</hi> and question his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes;
some Truths bare more upon one
Attribute, some more upon another, but
all are founded in God and in the essential
properties of his Nature, from whence they
have their verification and accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
so that till God appear and shew
himself to the Soul, all that is said to us
out of the Scriptures in the name of an
unknown God affects us not, because it
wants that which is the ground of its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility,
no man can say that Jesus is the
Lord, but by the Spirit, <hi>1 Cor. 12. 3.</hi> he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103588:97"/>
cannot say so and think so, he cannot say
so and believe what he says, till the Father
reveal his Son in him, <hi>Paul</hi> by the Light
of that Revelation of Christ in him, knew
all Gospel Mysteries, and without such an
inward spiritual manifestation of God to
our Souls, giving us a sight of him who
is invisible, 'tis impossible we should ever
be throughly convinced of the Divinity
of the Scriptures, all Divinity springs
from God, leads to him, nay it looks him
directly in the Face, and can't be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
apart from him, there is but one
God and one Faith, God must be in the
view of our Faith whensoever we really
act it.</p>
                  <p>Neither can we have that inward testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Spirit convincing us of the
Divine Authority of the Scriptures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this special Appearance of God in the
Soul as a witness to the Truth of his
Word.</p>
                  <p>While we are hearing the Word, God
has invisible wayes of access to our hearts,
he conveys himself through his Truth to
our Souls, his Divinity leads the way,
without some appearance of this, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Word would have no place
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103588:98"/>
in our hearts, but coming with so
great a presence, in so great a name,
and with so strong an impression, God
himself writing them upon the heart,
we cannot but receive his Testimony, the
Word comes into our Hearts suddenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are aware, and seises them for
God, we cannot but think, speak, act
and judge as God does, the sense of the
Word is the sense of our Souls, so far as
the Word is written in our hearts, we read
it without the least variation, the Copy
answers the Original: Hence arises that
habitual disposition or inclination to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
God creates this new heart, I say
this infused habit or principle of faith, is
antecedent to all acts of faith put forth by
us, and is in it self the sole act of God
upon us in our first Conversion, it is from
this supernatural principle thus infused,
that the natural powers and faculties of
the Soul of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Understanding
and the Will, are enabled to take in things
purely Spiritual and Divine, Nature ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
acts above its sphere, those inbred
common Notions that are the Standards
and Measures of Natural Truths in all
their consequences will never lead us to
grant, or admit that which is supernatural,
when we do this, 'tis always from some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103588:98"/>
higher Principle; when we see men act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
above themselves, we may conclude
they are acted by something higher than
themselves, which is the Spirit of Christ
dwelling in them.</p>
                  <p>This special Appearance of God, with
those inward effects of it upon the Soul
which I have been speaking of, may be
known to Believers, they discern it in
others, <hi>Acts 11. 17, 18.</hi> and do when
they give a true reason of their faith, see
it in themselves, that all springs from the
Fathers, revealing his Son in them, they
can give no other reason why they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in Jesus, 'tis God that opens the door
of Faith and makes it effectual, <hi>Acts 14. 27.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are apt to be taken with any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Man in a Sermon, this we look
after, what words of Mans Wisdom, how
Man acquits himself in reasoning of this or
that Point. 'Tis true there is some skill
required in Planting, and Watering, but
all the encrease comes from God, your
Faith consists not in the Wisdom of Man
but in the power of God, if God himself
do not appear as a witness to his own
Truth, as the great undertaker of all that
he has promised, what we say will prevail
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103588:99"/>
little, your faith must terminate in God
himself, and in that Ability that is in him
to perform his word, this was the ground
of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Paul</hi> knew him whom
he believed, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 12.</hi> and so must
you if ever you believe to the saving of
your Souls. Did you go out of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
after every Sermon you hear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a sight and sense of this appearance of
God in his Word, speaking to you from
Heaven and shewing himself to your souls
in some spiritual resemblance suited and
adapted to that Word you are hearing,
how could you reject such a Word, so
full of God, so exactly corresponding to
what you see in God himself, you must
yield and cry out each of you, who am I
that I should withstand God?</p>
                  <p>This is the first way that God takes to
work Faith in us, by our hearing the
Word Preached to us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith is wrought by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the heart, enlightning the mind, and
perswading the will to a through closure
with Christ upon Gospel Terms.</p>
                  <p>I shall now shew you how God thus
appearing to us in hearing the Word,
does open the heart, enlighten the mind
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103588:99"/>
and throughly perswade the will, to a
through closure with Christ upon Gospel
Terms.</p>
                  <p>Naturally our hearts are shut up against
the Gospel, our Minds are blinded 2 <hi>Cor.
4. 4.</hi> till God shines into our hearts, to
give the light of the Knowledge of the
Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,
<hi>ver. 6.</hi> Enlightning the eyes of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,
<hi>Eph. 1. 17, 18.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is this Light of Faith, and
how does it differ from the Light of
Reason?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The Light of Reason lies in the
evidence of the thing it self, as it falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Humane Understanding, arguing
from the cause to the effect, drawing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
conclusions from undeniable premises,
granted and acknowledged by all men to
be Truths in Nature: Upon such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
they build all their acquired
Knowledge, and do put the stamp of
Truth upon all fair inferences from thence,
which they judge agreeable to those first
principles and notions of Truth, that pass
for currant under that name among cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
men, who do but think they know,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103588:100"/>
and do rather ghess than judge: so great is
the uncertainty of all humane Knowledge,
we have little cause to glory in it.</p>
                  <p>The light of Faith lies in the infallible
certainty of Divine Testimony, faith sees
not the causes of things in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but in God alone, to whom all
things are possible, faith excells all other
knowledge, in as much as it sees and knows
all things in their first Cause, God, and
takes hold of them by the very root from
whence they first spring, arguing from the
Veracity of God, to the Truth of all his
sayings, we know that God has spoken
thus and thus, as <hi>Ioh. 9. 29.</hi> we know
the Doctrine is of God, <hi>Ioh. 7. 17.</hi> and
that no prophesie of the Scripture is of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Interpretation, <hi>2 Pet. 1. 20, 21.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this conviction we cannot but yield
the obedience of faith to every word of
God: I do not deny but experience may
and does give Believers some Evidence
of the things themselves, but this belongs
rather to their after Edification, then to
the first act of Faith in their Conversion,
by which they close in with Christ, upon
the credit of a bare word of promise from
him who cannot lie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103588:100"/>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> Since these sublime supernatural
Misteries of the Gospel are so much above,
and so seemingly contrary to humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
how comes it to pass that any man
should own them for Truths, and be
brought under the power of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis by a Divine Faith, I call it
Divine because 'tis the work of God that
we believe his Testimony, <hi>Ioh. 6. 29.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> Does not this Operation of God
upon the Hearts of men in working faith
in us, offer violence to mans Nature and
force the Will to consent to that which
is above the Understanding: Or how can
the efficacy of Gods Grace in determining
Mans Will to such a Spiritual Act of Faith
in Christ Jesus be consistent with the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Many intricate disputes there are
about this Point, managed by subtil heads,
not without some shew and appearance of
Reason, who to secure the liberty of
Mans Will, have denied the efficacy of
Gods Grace, placing the power of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in man himself, to avoid the force
that otherwise they think must be offered
to his Will. But to clear the efficacy of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103588:101"/>
Gods Grace from this imputation, I need
say no more but this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Grace of God enters the Soul
of man as a New Nature, and therefore
cannot put any force upon him, Nature
works kindly in all, by Inclination, not by
Violence; as Nature is from Generation, so
the new Nature is from Regeneration;
one is the birth of the Flesh, the other
of the Spirit; as we are born Men by our
first birth, so we are born Christians by
our second birth. Artificial Christians
are all name, without any living Nature
answerable to it, being not truly born of
God and thereby made partakers of his
Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>The breathing in of this new Nature
into the Soul of man by the Spirit of God,
is that new Creation spoken of in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
'tis the first Act of God in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
'tis solely the Act of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any concurrence of ours, we have
only a passive obediential power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the impression! 'Tis God that makes
it, upon this supernatural Principle are
grounded all after proceedings in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Soul forward to an actual closure
with Christ, all the natural powers and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103588:101"/>
faculties of the Soul are gathered into this
supernatural Principle, do act under it,
are moved by it, and directed in all their
free motions to a supernatural end, which
they could not of themselves tend unto;
and let it not seem incredible to us that
God should do this, he can do no evil
from the perfection of his Nature, and for
the same reason all good must needs be
in the power of his hand, the greatest
good that can be done to fallen Man, is
thus to restore him. In this new Nature
are wrapped up the seeds of all Grace,
which by the efficacy of the Spirit, are
drawn out into act, with the free consent
of Mans Will: Should God determine the
Will of Man to a good act whilst it is in a
bad state and under a corrupt nature, this
would imply force and violence, but to
lead out a man according to his new Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
is not to put a force upon him. If
Sin had that efficacy upon Man in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
state, to encline his Will to Evil, why
should not Grace have the like efficacy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Man fallen to encline his Will to good.
Though an inclination to Evil in Man
standing was possible from the liberty of
his Will in which he was created, yet such
an actual inclination was inconsistent with
his perfect state, and left such an inherent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103588:102"/>
crookedness in his perverted Nature that
nothing but Grace can rectifie and make
streight again. What is a principle of
Grace, but liberty to Good restored to
fallen man, from whence an actual incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to choose what is good do's follow
of course, when God calls and excites
him thereunto, here is no force put upon
mans Will, it acts freely in the choice of
good, and it cannot be otherwise, since
Grace enters as a new Nature, ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
a powerful Principle of Holiness
in the Soul, that do's incline a man freely
to comply which the efficacious grace of
God exciting him to those acts of Holiness
so agreeable to the Nature of the new
Creature, as Sin reigns unto Death, so
Grace will reign through Righteousness
unto Eternal Life, <hi>Rom. 5. 21.</hi> Shall not
he that raises the dead be able to quicken
a dead Soul, but we are more sensible of
that power that God puts forth upon the
bodies of Men, then of that which he puts
forth upon their Souls, <hi>that you may know
that the Son of man hath power to forgive
sins, Take up thy bed and walk, Mat. 9. 6.</hi>
This you all see, but the actings of my
saving power upon the souls of men, that
power that works within, <hi>(Eph. 3. 20.)</hi>
you see not; let this that you see convince
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103588:102"/>
you of that which you see not, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dispute my power more to forgive
sin, I can heal the diseases of the Soul as
well as those of the Body, the power
that God has to forgive sin is the
great prerogative of God, belonging to
the soveraignty of his grace. God walks
invisibly thorow the World, doing his
mighty works of Grace, he touches some
mens hearts, not others; he draws some
and not others, by the sweet yet irresista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
force of his Grace; we see nothing but
man, mans Will, mans Choice, mans Act,
and therefore conclude all is by mans own
power, because we see not the wheel
within the wheel, the Spirit of God set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the whole soul in motion towards
Christ: This <hi>arcanum Iehovae,</hi> this secret
of the Lord is with them that fear him,
<hi>Psal. 25. 14.</hi> The way of the Spirit of
God in the hearts of men is discerned by
few, 'tis a very hard matter to understand
how God works in us to will and to do,
because we find it to be our own act to
believe, repent and turn to God, we
ascribe all to our selves as if our own arm
had saved us: The truth is, God in all
the efficacious operations of his grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the hearts of men, loves to conceal
himself, he will not be seen by others to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103588:103"/>
do what he do's in and for his Saints, <hi>no
noise in the streets, Matth. 12. 19. The
kingdom of God comes not with observation,
Luke 17. 20, 21.</hi> All is done within
secretly and silently, non are privy to this
heart-work, but they that feel it, this is
the hiding of his power from the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those whom he never intends to
work upon, and for the hardening of
their hearts, that they may still retain an
opinion of their own ability to do that
which they see others so freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
addicting themselves unto: Though
this be a cause of stumbling to many, who
boast of a supposed power and freedom
of will to believe and repent when they
please, yet such in whose hearts God has
wrought these mighty works of his grace,
they see and feel the weight of his Arm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
upon their souls, they know it is
Gods doing, that a divine power has touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their hearts, and carried them out to all
these acts of Faith that they put forth,
they openly acknowledge this, <hi>1 Cor. 15.
10. Phil. 4. 13. 2 Cor. 3. 5. Gal. 2. 20.
Not I but Christ.</hi> When they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
most strengthned by Christ, they
are then most sensible of their own self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insufficiency
and weakness, I can do all
things through Christ, yet not sufficient of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103588:103"/>
our selves to think a good thought; <hi>when I
am weak, then am I strong, 2 Cor. 12. 10.</hi>
They would not say so, if they did not
find a power more then humane exerting
it self within them, and strengthning them
with might in their inward man, I live,
yet not I, but Christ lives in me, till we
can thus distinguish between Nature and
Grace, and see God influencing our Wills
in all their free motions to that which is
good, we shall vainly assume to our selves
a power that never yet reduced it self to
the least real act of Faith in any man
whatever: 'tis easie talking of a power
to believe, before we come to believe in
good earnest, then our strength fails us if
God do not support us, and help our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;
<hi>I believe, help my unbelief, q. d.</hi> I
can't hold it, my faith will fail, if God do
not put his Everlasting Arms underneath,
if we consider what difficulties, what
strong Objections unanswerable by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Faith Acts against in keeping up a
lively hope of Pardon in the Conscience
of a convinced sinner, we must needs say,
'tis the work of God that we believe; we
may wonder at our selves as men, when
we consider what we believe as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:103588:104"/>
I have spoken all this to shew that God
is the Author and Finisher of our Faith,
'tis he only can open the heart, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it, to give Credit to the Word of
his Grace.</p>
                  <div type="application">
                     <head>Application.</head>

                     </p>
                     <p>How we may know when Faith comes
by Hearing, even at the time of Hearing,
and whether it be yet come into your

                     <p>Faith is a secret and a sudden work,
when it comes it gives some sense of it self
to an observing Christian, that quickly
convinces us of a change in our selves, a
heart truly turned to God, is not the same
it was before, not in the same posture,
not in the same disposition and frame,
there is something new appears in every
new Creature, that do's not belong to the
Old Man but rises up in opposition to
him: this newness do's not lye in some
one corner of the heart, but every where,
'tis universal in every faculty; all things
are become new, though the old leaven
be not totally cast out any where, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103588:104"/>
left as an occasional provocation and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
to the Grace of God to act in more
opposition to those motions of sin, that
put a force upon the New Creature, are
directly contrary to the bent and genius
of our renewed Nature; till Faith comes
we are never sensible of any such inward
Conflicts between the flesh and the Spirit;
but then the fight begins, the good fight of
Faith: 'Tis Faith strikes the first stroke,
makes the first assault upon our reigning
sin and corruptions, and will never cease
contending with them, till it has got a full
Victory over them, and throughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
them.</p>
                     <p>But how shall we know in the very
time of hearing, when Faith comes.</p>
                     <p>When the word Works effectually after
hearing, it usually gives some powerful
touch upon the heart at the time of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
so <hi>1 Cor. 14. 24, 25.</hi> he speaks there
of the occasional Conversion of an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer,
who came into the Assembly,
where there was Prophesying and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
'tis probable some such are come

meet with them, that they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
and fall down upon their Faces,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103588:105"/>
worshipping God, acknowledging that
he is among us of a truth; so <hi>Acts 2. 37.</hi>
their Hearts were prick'd, they cry out in
the midst of the Sermon, <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
what shall we do?</hi> We want such pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Conversions, had we more of these
New Births in our Congregations; we
should have more of these out-cries;
which would be very awakening to us all,
if God would honour his Ordinances with
such visible signs of his presence, as in the
Primitive Times the Word was preached
with that power, that it wrought a great
consternation and astonishment in the
whole Assembly, there was a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
upon their minds, which had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
effects; some blasphemed, and some
believed, but all were moved and stirred,
struck inwardly, though many saw not
the hand that struck them; 'tis otherwise
now; hearers are more unconcern'd, in
a more drowsie frame; we can hardly
keep them waking all Sermon time; they
say these were extraordinary cases, not
applicable to us now: I must tell you,
Conversions wrought by ordinary means

marvellous in our Eyes now, as 'twas in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103588:105"/>
theirs heretofore; they who find nothing
of this, neither in nor after Conversion,
would do well to make a stricter inquiry
into their state; sometimes we bring down
Grace as low as we can for the sake of
weak ones, but we must not make nothing
of it, to please some who would rest in a
silent easie Conversion, and think to go
Heaven by the charitable Opinion others
have of them; that so great a change as
Conversion is, should make so little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance

he did not consider which soot he should
put foremost, but leaped up on a suddain,
broke out into a passionate inquiry after
the way of Salvation.</p>
                     <p>Faith especially at its first entrance,
when it first comes into our Hearts, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103588:106"/>
accompanied with a through Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of our lost undone Estate: I don't
speak now of those legal Convictions that
in some may be preparatory to Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but of that saving Evangelical Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that is of the Essence of saving Faith,
alwayes accompanying it, it is the reason
of Faiths earnestness in its first actings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ, <hi>Master save us, we perish.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Acts</hi> we have several instances
of Faith wrought in the time of hearing,
<hi>Acts 10. 44. While Peter yet spake, the
Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the
word:</hi> So <hi>Acts 14. 1. Acts 18. 8. Acts
28. 24. Paul</hi> perceived Faith in the Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
by his attentive hearing, <hi>Acts 14. 9.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When Faith does not make this publick
entrance into the Hearts of those who hear
the word; as it did in the Primitive times,
in the view and face of the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
and 'tis much to be lamented
that it does not: I fear it portends more
than I am willing to tell you; yet I hope
Faith may and does come in a more silent
manner into your Hearts at the time of
hearing; this you may know by a sudden
astonishment, and trembling that sezes
upon the Soul, <hi>Luke 4. 33. Acts 13. 12.
Acts 9. 6.</hi> When a discovery of the Evil
of Sin, and of the Grace of Christ do meet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103588:106"/>
together in one saving Conviction in the
Conscience of an awakened Sinner, we
must needs be variously affected with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and hope; Grace clothes it self with
contrary passions at the same time, as it
looks at Sin, and at Christ, loathing the
one, and embracing the other; this may
be perceived at the first opening of the
Heart to believe the Gospel, a present act
of Faith is and will be the present sense
of the Soul in and about what it believes;
there is no putting the word from us,
when once we believe it in our Hearts:
Men may talk of Gospel-Truths under a
formal profession of Faith, and not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with them, but the Word works
effectually in them that believe. Faith tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
the Soul in the most sensible part of
it, gathers up the Mind and Thoughts of
a Man into a close and serious debate with
himself, about those things which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in reference to himself; his Heart
waxes hot within him; this is the
Power and Dominion that Faith has
over us, being the highest principle in
Man; it overcomes all contradictions
from the Flesh, answers all Carnal Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
throughly perswades a Man, firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
establishes the Heart in the belief of the
present Truth, so that we become unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103588:107"/>
from the hope of the Gospel.</p>
                     <p>These are the inward Commotions that
Faith makes in the Soul at its first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance,
you cannot so slight the impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith, as not to be greatly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
about them; 'tis not come to real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
till it comes to this; you are and
must be serious in and about that which
with your hearts you believe concerning
your Eternal State.</p>
                     <p>Whether you now are, or ever have
been in such a frame, God and your own
Consciences know best; they are not tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles
that you believe, but matters of that
moment that you cannot but be concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them, and there is nothing requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to fire your Hearts with a zealous soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and thoughtfulness about them, but
only your believing them; you can no
more step over such an act of Faith, than
you can cease to think while you are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
thinking, or cease to move while actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
moving: An act of believing is the
Soul in actual motion towards Christ, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for refuge to the hope that is set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. This is the way of the Spirit in
working Faith at the time of hearing;
and if you observe such a one whose heart
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103588:107"/>
the Word has reached; he goes home
musing upon what he has heard: Suppose
one standing in the Spirit of <hi>Isaiah</hi> at the
Meeting-door, as you go forth crying
out, <hi>Who hath believed our report, to whom
has the arm of the Lord been revealed this
day;</hi> how experimentally would such a
one say, I have believed, to me hath the
Arm of the Lord been revealed; follow
him further into his House, into his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
or Closet; behold he prayes, as the
Word brings down the sense of God into
the Soul; so Prayer carries up the sence
of the Soul, concerning that word, <hi>to
God above:</hi> Prayer, especially just after
Conversion, is but a Holy enlargement of
the Heart about those things that God
first speaks to us by his Word. <hi>I will say
'tis my people, they shall say, the Lord is my
God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In hearing expect no other reason for
Faith, but the bare testimony of the
Word of God, search the Scriptures whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things are so or no, as Ministers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
if you find them so, charge them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your Consciences as most worthy of all
acceptation and belief: Religion now a
dayes is branched out into so many specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
and subtle questions wrapped up
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103588:108"/>
in such terms of art, under such nice di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions,
that the power and simplicity
of the Gospel is almost lost, ordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
know not what to believe while
the Pulpit gives such an uncertain sound.</p>
                     <p>There is not so much Rational Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

and <hi>con,</hi> do you quote Scripture and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
begging of God to direct your faith
into right apprehensions of his revealed
Will, hold fast there and you are safe,
the greatest Scholars in the World must
come down to the plain mans Faith, if
ever they die in peace, in all Gospel
Truths, their consonancy, not to our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but to the Scriptures is to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Mans leaning rather to their own
understanding of the thing, than to their
faith in the Word, about that thing, hath
led them into Error, into false notions of
Divine Mysteries. I grant from your
faith in one Truth you may fetch Reasons
for some other Truth depending upon it,
these are Gospel Reasons not your own;
we don't believe because we know, but
we know because we believe; this is a
new way of knowing things, which the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103588:108"/>
world is not acquainted with, because it
cannot receive the spirit of Truth, the
spirit of Truth is a spirit of Faith; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

themselves, <hi>1 Ioh. 5. 13.</hi> to confirm
and strengthen your Faith, that you may
be built up further in it, furnished with
further matter to act it upon.</p>
                     <p>Let none be discouraged though never
so ignorant and unlearned, of a low,
mean, capacity, yet come to hear with an
expectation of Gods working faith in thee,
faith will overcome all these difficulties, as
weak and simple and ignorant as any may
be supposed to be, yet be not discouraged,
you may be made to believe more in one
moment, than the greatest Scholars in
the World can attain to the knowledge of
in many years study.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is written in the prophets</hi> (Joh. 6. 45.)
<hi>and they shall be all taught of God, every
man therefore that hath heard, and hath
learned of the father cometh unto me; Not
that any man hath seen the Father.</hi> 'Tis
not what men you hear, what Ministers
you follow, till God the Father do's speak
powerfully to your hearts by the Ministry
of man. It matters not who the man is,
your faith consists not in the Wisdom of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103588:109"/>
man, but in the power of God, when you
have a proof of Christs speaking in any,
<hi>2 Cor. 13. 3.</hi> then hearken diligently, till
you hear an inward Word from this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Teacher, you'l never come to Christ.
If all the Ministers in the World should
lay their heads together, they could never
bring a sinner to Christ, till the Father
speaks the word and draw him. We are
but Ministers by whom you believe, as
the Lord gives to every man; <hi>So then,
neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he
that watereth, but God that giveth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,</hi>
1 Cor. 3. 5, 6, 7.</p>
                     <p>The sum of all is this, We are sent to
Preach, that you may Hear; we carry
the Letter of the Word to your Ears, the
Spirit brings it home in the name of God
to your Consciences, convincing you that
it is his Word, under this Conviction you
see the truth of the Word, in the veracity
of God, this word of Truth and your
Souls meeting so close, as they alwayes do
in an act of Faith, sanctifies you; this
sanctification lies in the ready assent of
your understanding, and free consent of
your Will, the one is founded in light,
the other in love, so that when an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Understanding receives the Truth
in the love of the Truth, there is a firm
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103588:109"/>
Principle of Holiness fixed in that Soul,
flowing from that Union to Christ that
Faith gives us, this is the beginning and
progress of that Faith, the end of which
is the Salvation of your Souls.</p>

                     <head>The Second Point.</head>
                     <head type="sub">How we are Iustified by Faith.</head>
                     <p>WE ought to be Doers of the Word
and not Hearers only, to maintain
good Works for necessary uses, <hi>Tit. 3. 14.</hi> It
behoveth us therefore to know what use
we should make of our works and doings
in the great business of our Salvation, so
as not to entrench upon the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ, nor to degrade that from
being our sole and only justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
Some men are as much mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in grounding their salvation upon
doing, as others are in grounding it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
bare hearing; and therefore these
things must be warily spoken unto, and
warily understood. When we urge the
necessity of doing the Word of God,
Carnal Reason lies at the catch, and is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103588:110"/>
ready to take every thing in a wrong
sense and meaning, and to bring down
the Mysteries of the Gospel to a low loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
vulgar Notion more suitable to humane
Reason. There are two extreams that
men are apt to run into; either they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
good works, or else, they trust in good
works; either they do in a careless formal
presumptuous manner, pretend to cast all
upon Christ, without any serious inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
after the Truth of Grace in themselves,
or ever proving it by its fruits; conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it altogether needless to be any way
active in their own salvation. Secondly,
If upon search they find any actings of
Grace in their Hearts, any fruits of Grace
in their Lives, these are their own proper
goods they think, Money found in their
own Purses; it matters not how they
came by it, they have it, and they are
resolved to convert it to their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
use, making it nothing less than a part
of their Justifying Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>Those of this way, with whom I have
now to do, do state the matter thus.</p>
                     <p>They say, that Christ is the meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cause of our Justification, having by
his Death satisfied the Law, and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
us from the Curse of it; and so far
we agree with them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="43" facs="tcp:103588:110"/>
They say further, That Christ to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
our Justification, hath also purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us strength and ability to perform
the condition of the new Covenant (this
we assent to) the performance of which
according to them, is to be taken in as a
part of our Justifying Righteousness, and
this we deny.</p>
                     <p>We say the performance of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in the New Covenant, is a good
Justification of the Cause, whether it be
of Faith or of Good Works, or of any
particular thing or action, the sincerity
and truth of which may be in question.
But we deny that it adds any thing to the
Justification of the person, and therefore
they speak not <hi>ad idem,</hi> to the same thing,
when they deny Christs imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to be the sole Righteousness that
justifies the Person, because there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Righteousness required, upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
account to justifie or clear up the
sincerity of our Faith and Holiness; I say
to clear up this to our selves and other
men, which we deny not. For we do
not admit any Faith to be a justifying
Faith, but upon good evidence of the
Truth of it, neither do we admit any
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103588:111"/>
works to be good works but upon full
proof of the goodness of them.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of all is this; we say, Faith and
obedience once proved to be true and
genuine, are good evidences of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Christ, whose imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
is the sole and only Righteousness
by which our Persons are universally
justified from all charges and blame what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
in the sight of God, and to say o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
is in effect to say that Christ died
to justifie us, that we might be justified
without him; or at least not only and
solely by him; which is highly derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the death of Christ, neither will
their owning Christ to be the meritorious
cause of our Justification salve the matter
while they do in any sense require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Righteousness distinct from that of
Christs, for the justification of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the sight of God.</p>
                     <p>And having given you this brief ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the matter in difference, I shall
now proceed.</p>
                     <p>The Point in General which I am to
speak to is this. That though good works
are highly necessary in a justified person,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103588:111"/>
yet they not required in any way of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality
to the Justification of the Person.
Or thus, no part of our inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
can be any part of our justifying
Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>This I might prove to you many ways.</p>
                     <p>First, From the subject of Justification,
an ungodly Person; a believing Sinner
flying in the sense of Sin unto Jesus Christ
for Life and Pardon. Sin is that from
which we are Justified, the Righteousness
of Christ is that for which or by which we
are Justified, <hi>Act. 13. 39.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Because there must be a
change of state in Justification, and by
Justification, before we can derive any sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grace from Christ to enable us to the
least good work. I might also</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Argue from the weakness and
imperfection of all Inherent Holiness which
is not able to justifie it self, much less the
Person.</p>
                     <p>And many Arguments may be brought;
but my design is to contract this general to
a particular point, concerning the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:103588:112"/>
                        <hi>credere,</hi> or the act of believing; and I
shall shew that that part of our inherent
Righteousness that flows from our doing
the Word of God, that is, the Work of
Faith as done by us in an act of believing,
is no part of our justifying Righteousness.
This is that which seems to have the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
claim to, and interest in, our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and if this be disproved, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
will hold a <hi>fortiori</hi> against all the
inferiour branches of our inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
they must be forced to quit
their claim also.</p>
                     <p>That which seems to intitle Faith to
such an Interest in our Justification as is
pleaded for by some, is the phrase and
manner of expression which the Scripture
uses in speaking of Faith, telling us that
Faith is imputed to us for Righteousness,
that we are justified by Faith; that he
that believes shall be saved, and the like.</p>
                     <p>The question is, in what sense these
Scriptures are to be understood; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are to take up our standing part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the act of Faith, and partly in the
object of Faith, making up a Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
partly from our selves, and partly
from Christ, or whether we are by Faith
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103588:112"/>
to go out of our selves unto Christ for our
whole, sole and only justifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
and this is that which I affirm,
and shall endeavour to make good, and
shew you that the Scriptures alledged do
not ascribe our Justification to the Act,
but wholly to the Object of Faith; not
to our believing, but to Christ believed
on, which I prove thus:</p>
                     <p>First, From those Expressions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
peculiar to Holy Writ, by which
the Holy Ghost doth of set purpose limit
Faith to its Object, <hi>Iohn 6. 47. Rom. 9.
33. Ephes. 1. 13.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to believe
in, into, or upon Christ, which plainly
points out this, that Faith is alwayes to be
taken in relation to its Object; that by
Faith is meant Christ apprehended by
Faith. Life is promised, not simply to
believing, but to believing in; in whom?
in Christ, or nothing. Faith is a relative
term (as to its whole sense and significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
to the Object Christ. It must be
Faith in Christ, or Faith in nothing. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
is a Scripture Phrase, setting forth
our leaning upon Christ. Faith, as our
Act adds nothing to Christ, doth not
make his Death satisfactory; it was so in
its self before, though by an applicatory
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103588:113"/>
act of Faith it is made so to us; that is, we
do reap the benefits of his Death and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;
we are not united to Faith,
but by Faith we are united to Christ.
Faith is the <hi>Medium uniens;</hi> we do not
trust in our Faith, but by Faith we trust
in Christ; all that Faith signifies is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to Christ; all that it doth, is in the
Name of Christ; without Christ it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
nothing, it doth nothing, it is nothing.
When we are said to be justified by the
Faith of Christ, or justified by Faith in
Christ, <hi>Gal 2. 16.</hi> pray must the meaning be,
that we are justified by Faith, and Christ,
as some would have it, giving the priority
to Faith, and making Christ but a remote
cause of our Justification, and our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Righteousness to be the next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
cause? Were Men more willing
to exalt Christ, and debase themselves,
this would be <hi>English</hi> plain enough:
Faith in Christ would then signifie but one
Righteousness; it would not be Faith
and Christ. Let Men have a care how
they speak unadvisedly of Christ to the
lessening and diminution of his Honour:
God hath said he is our Righteousness
without any Limitation, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction:
Now for Men to say, ay but not
all our Righteousness, not our only Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103588:113"/>
I say, 'tis a bold word thus to
distinguish whatever remote inferences
they may gather out of Scripture to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
their meaning; yet since God hath not
thought fit to drop any such diminutive
expression of Christ in Scripture, I say it
is a bold word for Men to speak. You
may see how severely speaking against
God was punished, <hi>Numb. 21. 5, 6.</hi> And
God complains of it, <hi>Ezek. 35. 13. With
your mouths ye have boasted against me, and
have multiplyed your words against me: I
have heard them.</hi> We may safely deny any
thing of God that implies weakness or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection;
but to deny that of Christ
which tends to the Exaltation of his Name
and riches of his Grace; let Men distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
how they will, it is dangerous med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
here: This is a tender point; that is
the first.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> If the bare act of Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any relation to the object, justifies;
then any act of Divine Faith will justifie
us as well as Faith in Christ; for the Act
is specified by the Object: Take away the
Object, and all Acts of Faith are alike,
equally insignificant. But I proceed.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To the third Argument that
shall be drawn from the Nature of Faith,
which consists in receiving. As it is the
Act of a Believer, it implies doing; but
properly as an Act of believing; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
in receiving, and that with an empty
hand: Now the question is whether by
this receiving Act of Faith there do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
to us a Righteousness of our own,
distinct from that which we receive from
Christ? I say no: We are not justified by
a Righteousness that we do, but by a
Righteousness that we receive: Now the
bare Act of receiving in a common Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
way, is not counted morally meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
A Beggars receiving an Alms, argues
no merit in the Receiver, but meer Grace
in the Donor. We count that he who
only receives a benefit, he doth nothing
for it, it comes freely: Indeed he doth
something naturally in receiving, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
morally by way of merit for the
thing received. Thus it is among Men,
and so we understand it, in all such act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of ours; but when we come to deal
with God, how do our proud hearts put
a value upon them; then we put a value
upon every thing, upon our coming, upon
our adhering, upon our relying, upon
our asking, upon our receiving; We
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103588:114"/>
grow proud of those very Acts of Grace
by which we do express our Poverty and
Beggary, our absolute Dependance upon
another; as if Christ was beholden to us
for our accepting of him: So naturally
prone are we to rest upon any thing that
looks like our own doing.</p>
                     <p>Brethren! There are two things to be
considered in Faith.</p>
                     <p>(1.) The Motion of the Soul in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
which is an Act naturally necessary
to all manner of receiving; it is as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
forth, and opening the hand.</p>
                     <p>(2.) You may consider the passive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
it self, wherein the Nature of Faith
doth chiefly consist, in admitting, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and owning the Gift.</p>
                     <p>Though the word Believing doth Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically
imply an Action, yet really and
physically we are passive in believing:
For these Reasons.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>First,</hi> The first Reason is this; They
who make our Act of believing a part of
our Justifying Righteousness, do mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
make Faith to contradict it self
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103588:115"/>
in and by its own Act: If by an Act of
believing we go out of our selves to Christ
for all: I do not see how by the same Act
we can possibly settle upon any thing in
our selves that is not Christ: If by being
justified by faith they understand the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of faith, then we agree with them;
then faith and Christ is all one: By faith
we mean Christ applyed, and nothing but
Christ. But if they understand the bare
Act of believing in distinction from Christ
the Object; therein we differ from them.
And they must so understand it who make
our Act of believing a part of our justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Righteousness distinct from Christs
Righteousness; and therein I say, they
make faith to contradict it self in and by
its own Act: I do not know whether I am
understood; I think I understand my
self in what I have said: Take it thus,
Pray consider what is the sense of a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Soul under a present Act of faith in
Christ? I appeal to you all, I desire you
would all be Judges in this matter who
have ever been serious, and in good
earnest, dealing with God by an act of
faith for Salvation. You believe in Christ,
what is the <hi>English</hi> of that? What do you
mean by it? Is not this your sense; you
desire to cast your self wholly upon Christ,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103588:115"/>
to be found in Christ not having on your
own Righteousness; to be built upon that
Foundation, to lay hold on Eternal Life in
Christ; to go out of your selves unto
Christ for Righteousness and Life; to
seek that in another which you have not
in your selves; to count all things but
loss and dung that you may win Christ;
don't you mean this? Pray what an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
then is it, what a gross contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to say I am justified by something
in my self, by virtue of that very act of
faith, by which I do purposely go out of
my self to Christ for all. If this be Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and Sense, I have quite lost the use
of both, and will never pretend to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
any thing. But how do some
Men fight with their own shadows and
lose themselves in their own expressions.
They cannot speak of Christ, and of the
way and manner of applying Christ, but
presently they must be Co-workers with
Christ in their Justification.</p>
                     <p>Brethren! We must not be perswaded
out of our Christian Names, nay out of
Christianity it self by those who would
impose their own notions upon us, and
indeed preach another Gospel; let them
read on and tremble. But I will say this,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103588:116"/>
that if <hi>Paul</hi> were alive, and should hear
any man upon Earth, or Angel from
Heaven compound Faith and Works,
Works and Christ in the matter of our
Justification, I doubt not but he would
curse them in the name of the Lord. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
we are not to be Mealy-mouthed,
and silently suffer the grand principles of
the Gospel to be decryed, as if we doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
whether they were true or no. These
are the Pillars of the House, all fall with
them, if they be taken away. These are
the Ancient Land marks and bounds of
our Religion; they must not be removed,
for if you suffer that, you will quickly
have a dead Child in the room of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
New Notions, though not contrary
to any received foundation, should be
warily uttered; but supposing there is
the least discrepancy or opposition, it
is our duty and wisdom to be silent, and
not break the eye of the Needle, by forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Camel through. New Notions
must yield rather to antient received
Truths, they must be governed and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by them. It is dangerous to force plain
Scripture, and plain principles to make
good our own private interpretations.</p>
                     <p>2. Our act of believing is no part of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103588:116"/>
our justifying Righteousness, because justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is an act of God; not properly
subsequent to our Faith, but simultaneous
with it. They are concomitants, so close,
so instantaneous, that we cannot say which
is first, or last in time; we cannot say the
one takes its rise from the other. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
my self thus; it is one thing for the
Scripture to speak Doctrinally of Faith,
another thing to speak of a Believer under
the actual exercise of Faith. When the
Scripture speaks of the Doctrine of Faith
in the Abstract, it tells us the consequents
of it, that according to Gods order and
appointment, Faith is requisite unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and so Faith is antecedent to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and Justification is spoken of
as a thing to come, upon our believing.
The Doctrine of Faith shews what shall
be to all who obtain it; the actual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Faith shews, what is to them who
have it, and do believe it. It is not only
he that believes shall be saved and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
but is justified. It is true, who ever believes
shall be saved; the just shall live
by faith, this is Doctrinally true. But he
that believes hath everlasting Life, <hi>Iohn
3. 39.</hi> is justified; this is experimentally
true. God, if you rightly consider the
point, doth justifie us, by working Faith
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103588:117"/>
in us. It is his way of Justifying; it is the
way God hath chosen to communicate the
Righteousness of God, which is a stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Mystery, and cannot be otherwise
applied to the soul. He doth not justifie
us because of any antecedent act of Faith
we have lying by us, and which we could
now produce as a price (as it were) and
Meritorious Means of our Justification.
God justifies us by working Faith in us;
God being willing in so great an act of
Grace, to speak to our Understandings
and Knowledge, he hath appointed Faith
as a fit means by which the soul not only
doth the thing, but also lets in a sense of
what is done upon the soul; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith the Apostle, <hi>it is of faith that it
might be of grace:</hi> God will be understood
in all the acts of his Grace towards us. Now
that there might be in us a sense of recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so great a benefit, God resolves
to put it into the hand of Faith, which
hath a natural sutableness in it, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to receive what free Grace tenders to
it; and so it doth when it is in any
strength. Christ and our Souls would
never meet were it not for Faith. There
is no letting down any thing spiritual and
supernatural into the soul, but by Faith;
Faith is our <hi>modus habendi,</hi> it is the <hi>way,</hi>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:103588:117"/>
the <hi>means</hi> by which we come to have God
and Christ, and an Interest in the things
of Heaven. We have what we have from
Christ by Faith, and we hold it by <hi>Faith.</hi>
Faith and Repentance as acted by us,
and reflected upon, are very good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of our Justifications, for it is in that
reflection only that they do give evidence
of themselves, and of any thing produced
from them. Therefore, I say, as they are
reflected upon they have retrospection to
our Justification, of which they are very
good and evident proofs; but they have
no antecedent causality to produce the
thing signified, because they signifie it, as
a thing already done, past and perfect.</p>
                     <p>3. And lastly, Justification is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
set down in Scripture without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to these acts of Grace in us, to
shew that it wholly flowes from Christ;
and that by our believing we add nothing
to our Justifying Righteousness, but do
only apply it, as wholly derived from
Christ alone, <hi>1 Ioh. 5. 12. He that hath
the Son, hath life;</hi> they that are in Christ
there is no Condemnation to them, <hi>Rom.
8. 1.</hi> Now because we cannot admit sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
to be in Christ but by faith, therefore
what flows from Christ, is attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103588:118"/>
faith; which is, I say, our <hi>modus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi,</hi>
but still the real cause of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
that which makes us just in the
sight of God, is our being in Christ, and
our having the Son. There is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made of having any thing else; but
faith is our <hi>modus habendi;</hi> we cannot
have the Son but by faith, nor be in Christ
but by Believing. Therefore God speaks,
to our Understanding, and hath attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that to the act of faith, which is only
derivable from the Object.</p>
                     <p>I shall now shew you the weakness of
those grounds and reasons they go upon,
who differ from us in this point.</p>
                     <p>1. They speak much of a Charge of
Infidelity, Impenitency and Unholiness to
be drawn up against us at the last day, and
therefore it concerns us to muster up all
our good works, all our acts of Grace,
and every part of our inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that we may be in a readiness to
answer to this Charge and clear our selves.</p>
                     <p>A specious Argument! enough to amuse
the World, and fright men back into
the Popish Doctrine of Justification by
Works.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:103588:118"/>
Brethren! I do not deny that unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
impenitent and ungodly Persons
shall be charged with infidelity, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
and ungodliness, and be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
but to talk of a charge of Infidelity
against a Believer at the last day, I say, it
is a groundless, unscriptural Notion. I
do not deny that the faith of the Saints
that draws them to Christ, and its effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
afterwards in all its fruits, will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
notice of by Christ, when they are
admitted into the Kingdom, <hi>Mat. 25. 34.
Come ye blessed;</hi> and when that blessedness
is fixed, Christ doth not put them upon
the proof of their faith, but helps them
himself to understand the former actings
of their faith and love to God, which
they were ignorant of before. <hi>When saw
we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty
and gave thee drink?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In as much as
ye have done it to one of the least of these, ye
have done it to me.</hi> I see more Grace in
you saith Christ, than ever you saw in
your selves, so and so appearing in your
lives; <hi>Come ye blessed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Brethren, Good Works are good Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
to us, to make out the Truth of
Grace in us; but the All-knowing God
needs no such Evidences for his Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103588:119"/>
he knows what is in man, and needs
not that any should tell him. He searches
the Heart. Though we see Grace only
in the Fruit, yet God sees it in the Root
and Principle. Besides, I conceive, the
last Judgment is not to prove who is, and
who is not in a state of Grace; but rather
to pronounce the Sentence according to
the state that every one shall appear in
at the Resurrection. There will be no
doubting of any mans state at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
the method and manner of the
Resurrection will decide it. Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
will separate the Sheep from the
Goats; and he will do this before the
Judgement, <hi>Mat. 25. 32, 33.</hi> You shall
know a Believer then by his Station at
the right hand of Christ; by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
among the Sheep. The Angels are
sent forth, <hi>Mat. 24. 31.</hi> to gather up the
Elect from the four Winds, from the one
end of Heaven to the other. They will
ransack every corner of the World to find
out every Saint; not only the Ninety and
Nine, but the whole Hundred shall be
presented to God; not one missing, we
shall all stand together. Now after they
are thus ranked by Christ, and the Angels
have declared them to be Sheep, to be
true Believers, must they come under a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103588:119"/>
charge of infidelity? Who must draw
up this charge, and manage this false In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment?
Either God, or good Angels,
or Conscience, or the Devil. God he
hath justified them here, sealed them by
the Spirit of Adoption to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and he will never reverse his
judgment.</p>
                     <p>The judgment of God at the last day
will be pursuant to the judgment already
past by his Word and Spirit in the Hearts
and Consciences of Believers here. Good
Angels are imployed to gather up the
Elect, and consequently they have a true
discerning who they are. Our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
are sprinkled with the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
and have an answer in readiness, by
the Resurrection of Christ from the dead.
And the Devil will have something else
to do in that day, when he stands at the
head of the wicked to receive his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
with them, the time of his torment
being then come. Though he be now
the accuser of the brethren day and night
before God, he must then Eternally be
cast down. True, he is now our accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
and we must labour to overcome
him by the Blood of the Lamb, as <hi>Rev.
12. 10, 11.</hi> that is, by Arguments drawn
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103588:120"/>
from the Blood of Jesus; yet I say fear
him not after death. The last enemy that
shall be destroyed is Death, saith the
Apostle; and must we have an after ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with the Devil? Must we be set
upon a fresh by him? No, no, after
death he hath done with you for ever;
he will not dare to look you in the face
at the last day: He draw up a charge
against you? You shall accuse, judge and
condemn him, and all the Devils in Hell,
<hi>1 Cor. 6. 3.</hi> Never fear, you that dye
in the Lord, shall rise up under those
denyable evidences of a state of Grace,
that neither the Devils nor wicked Men
shall dare to gain-say. What, must poor
Christians who have lived under doubts,
fears, under buffetings and temptations,
under accusations and challenges from
the Devil and their own Consciences,
must they rise so? Is this to be raised in
power, with our Spirits made perfect?
Surely <hi>Paul</hi> was out in his triumph, <hi>Rom.
8. 33. Who shall lay any thing to the charge
of Gods elect?</hi> Do you make good your
Title to Christ now, and never fear any
charges afterwards at that day; it will
be a joyful day to Believers. <hi>Look up,</hi>
saith Christ, <hi>lift up your heads for your
Redemption draweth nigh, Luke 21. 28.</hi>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:103588:120"/>
And therefore comfort one another;
your Witness is in Heaven, and your
Record is on high, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, God,
Christ, Angels, Conscience, will all be
on your side.</p>
                     <p>Aye, but if this feigned process be not
observed, some mens notions will fall to
the ground. Aye, and let them fall;
no matter how soon; for they are not
grounded upon the Word of God that
endureth for ever. Brethren, we must
not draw Schemes and Models from our
own Brain, and when we have done,
impose them upon God, and make his
proceedings in every particular exactly to
suit the methods of Humane Judicatures:
The natural notion of these things is so
strong in some mens heads, that it doth
carry them out beyond the line of the
Gospel. Good works certainly do best
furthest off from the judgment seat of
God. They are good and comfortable
evidences here, but they will make but
a sorry Righteousness there for us to
plead. Though God may and will take
notice of all the fruits of his Grace ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
in our words or works, when he
passeth the solemn declaratory Sentence
at the last day, which is but a fuller ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103588:121"/>
of our justification. God will
personally and publickly own that which
he hath secretly in our Consciences, done
by his Word and Spirit in us. God doth
now act mediately by his word, then he
will act immediately by himself; we shall
hear the sentence of our Justification from
his own mouth, which now we hear on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the mouths of his Ministers that
speak to us in his name.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The second ground they go
upon is this, they say, that it is a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
service imposed upon us by God
in the new Covenant; and therefore the
performance of it must needs be part of
our Justifying Righteousness; which is
very specious, and very suitable to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Reason, as most things are that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Mysteries of the Gospel, but
it is of like sound and significancy with
the other.</p>
                     <p>Alas! At how little a hole will self-Righteousness
creep in? How apt are we
in the pride of our hearts to distinguish
our self-Righteousness into our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that we may have somewhat where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to glory. To prevent mistakes I will
premise one thing; that is this, I do not
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103588:121"/>
deny, but that to believe in God, in
Christ, is an eminent piece of service, a
great act of Divine Worship, the greatest
act of Worship we can perform to God
on this side Heaven. But I deny that
it is a service done in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
or purchasing those benefits which
we receive from Christ as his free gift.
Faith receives what Christ hath already
procured. Faith doth not come to Christ
to desire him to dye for us; but having
dyed for us, it comes for the fruit of his
death: It comes on no other Errand but
to receive what is already prepared.
Faith hath no causality or efficiency at all
in contriving, compassing, constituting
the great act of Grace, wherein the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of our sin and our justification is held
forth unto us. Our Faith did not move
God to promise pardon, but finding all
this Grace in Jesus, Faith applyes it, lays
hold on it, and God gives us leave, nay
commands us to do this. So that Faith is
a service we owe to God by way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in complyance with his free Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, but it is not a service done by
us in way of procuring that which is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given. No, no, we owe that to Christ
and not to Faith. Brethren! In common
acceptation, when we say come to me,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103588:122"/>
and I will do this and that for you; pray
who is the doer, he that comes to have
the thing done, or he that doth it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
if coming be a service in this case,
it is a service done to a Mans self, and
can never be urged as a service done to
God.</p>
                     <p>But they further say, that this is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
service: Why? Because God
hath commanded us to believe that we
may be justified. Commanded us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and pray, what is that? I told you
before the meaning of an act of Faith,
even to renounce our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to come in our nakedness and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
to Christ, without Money or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Moneys worth, that we may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
by him in all things. Is not this
the old, honest, plain down-right notion
of believing? And is this the Conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
service required? Why don't you do
it then? Who is against it? Only let
them attend to the sense of Faith, and
not be carried away with the meer word
and talk of Faith, as their own act, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
regarding the inward sense and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
of the thing it self. Hath God
required us to believe in Jesus; let us
know what that means and do it; no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103588:122"/>
body is against it. If that be the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
service, let them lye low before
God, and seem more vile in their own
eyes, and cast themselves upon Christ for
all. Let them learn to come without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
This is the proper Obedience of
Faith; that Obedience which the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Gospel doth require; and
since you will call this a condition, I say,
why don't you perform it? Is this the
performance of such a condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
according to the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of believing, to tell the World that
Christ is not our only Justifying Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
that we must seek for something
in our selves to joyn with him, if ever
we will be saved? Is this the condition?
Doth God mean this, when he bids me
believe in Jesus? Sirs! Let us not read
our Bibles backwards; wresting Scripture
to our own destruction: It is strange to
me, that Faith which is all along in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
opposed to Works in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and is appointed by God to shut all
good works out of Justification, should
be thus made an inlet to bring all good
works into Justification. Oh! That we
were more under the powerful actings of
true Justifying Faith, it would then open
it self more fully to us, and shew us its
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103588:123"/>
meaning. I wish we could a little better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the actings of our Faith, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the reason, the sense of it, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
the intent of an act of Faith,
what a thing Faith is.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They suppose a double Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
and a double Justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness;
the first to justifie us from the
accusations of the Law, the other to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the sincerity of our Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness;
and here comes in all our inherent
Righteousness. This is specious too: But
I would not have men coyn new heads
of Divinity to make good their own
notions. We know but of one Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I say, the second Justification,
which they talk of, it is implyed in the
first; and therefore needless and unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural:
For since the Revelation of the
Gospel, infidelity and unbelief is a sin
against the Moral Law; and Faith in
Christ is injoyned as a duty by the Moral
Law; by which we take God to be our
God, and consequently do bind our selves
over to believe whatsoever he had, or
hereafter should reveal to be his Will.
This we are bound to by the Moral Law;
therefore if we are (as they themselves
affirm) freed by Justification from the Law
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103588:123"/>
of Works upon the condition of Faith,
then we are on our first Justification ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
freed from infidelity, and our
Faith is sufficiently approved to be true,
and what then need a second Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
unless we will suppose an error in
the first Judgment; which is impious to
suppose; as if God should acquit us from
the accusation of the Law of Works up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the condition of Faith; which upon
after examination, Christ discovers to be
false and unsound. So that these things
do not hang together.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, They say that Faith and
Holiness are conditions and evidences of
our title to Christ, and all that comes by
him; and therefore part of our Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Righteousness.</p>
                     <p>It is hard to understand the strength of
some mens reasoning; but grant all
this, it amounts to no more but Christ,
and a title to Christ, so far we are agreed,
for we desire no more. But how they
will make Faith which is our title to
Christ, and unto which Christ and all his
benefits are by the Gospel granted, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
and made over; how they will
make this title never so well evidenced,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103588:124"/>
to be part of our Justifying. Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
I see not: A title adds nothing to
the inheritance, makes it neither more
nor less, but conveys it down to us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the intrinsick value of the
thing, be it more or less. A title to Land
is no part of the Land; only we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested
in it as it is, by vertue of our title.
Now therefore if the Righteousness of
Christ be not of it self sufficient to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us, I see not how a good title mends
the matter; for if the Estate be never so
great, and we have no good title to it, it
is worth nothing to us; and if our title
be never so good, we can have no more
then is, and belongs to the title. So that
after all this stir about conditions and
evidences of our title to Christ, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of all is this, we have a title, a good
title, are under all the conditions and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
of a good title; but to what?
To an Inheritance that is not sufficient to
maintain us, to a Righteousness that is
not sufficient of it self alone to justifie
us; and where are we now with our
conditions and evidences of our title?
For ever destitute of a compleat Justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Righteousness. Is this to Preach
Christ? To Preach the glad Tidings of
the Gospel? Is this the way to quiet and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103588:124"/>
settle the Consciences of poor distressed
sinners? surely no.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, They urge the literal sense of
some few Scriptures that seem to speak
for them; especially two; and I do not
know of more in the whole Bible, as to
the literal signification; if there were we
should hear enough of it. I know they
quote many others, which add no weight
at all to the Argument they would ground
upon them, Therefore I shall not speak
to them. Those two are <hi>Mat. 12. 37. By
thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy
words thou shalt be condemned;</hi> and that
in <hi>Iames,</hi> where it is said, <hi>Abraham was
justified by works, Iam. 2. 23.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that in <hi>Matthew, Calvin</hi> charges
the Papists with very great weakness in
offering to draw an Argument from that
Text for Justification by Works. <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donate</hi>
a Learned Jesuite on the other
hand is very angry with <hi>Calvin</hi> for suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be so
weak and injudicious, as to argue so from
that Scripture; for, saith he, we very
well understand that this Text doth not
speak <hi>De justificatione, qua justi efficimur,
sed de judicis sententia, qua, sumpto ex
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103588:125"/>
verbis nostris argumento, justi declaramur.</hi>
So saith the Jesuite; we know this Text
doth not speak of that which is the cause
of our Justification, of the thing for which,
and by virtue of which we become just
and righteous, only here is the appearance
of our Righteousness by our words, and
we are declared to be Righteous. So that
this doth not touch this cause of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and yet this is the main Text
brought for it, the main proof repeated
again and again, to prove inherent righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
to have an influence into our
Justification. I say let them take the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
from the Papists or Protestants, which
they please, they are both against them
in this thing.</p>
                     <p>As for the other Scripture, They will
take it in no other sense but what implyes
a contradiction to all other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
in the case. The whole current of
Scripture is against Works in Justification,
and leads us to a fair construction of that
in <hi>Iames,</hi> that it is to be understood of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
before men, and not of a justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
before God. Protestant Writers have
sufficiently cleared up this, to the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all but such who are resolved not to
be Convinced. Certainly they should have
a care how they abound too much in their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103588:125"/>
own sense. The Learned Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>
saith, <hi>that a little Phylosophy makes men A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,
but a great deal will convince them
of a Deity.</hi> Some mens Logick and School
Learning overthrows Reason, which due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
improved and well managed, would
teach them to argue otherwise: Certainly
in our reasoning about Divine things we
should be careful not to abound too much
in our own sense. It is better for us to
leave the Mystery of the Gospel in its
Mystery where we found it, than to seek
to draw it out, and so to explain it, as to
force it into the mould of Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
shaping it on every side to an exact
conformity to the thoughts and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our weak imperfect Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
I say, no Gospel Truth will bear
this. After all our Faith and Knowledge
and Experience, we know but in part,
and there is at the end of every Gospel
Truth, a Mystery; something that is pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
our Understanding, that calls for si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
for an holy Admiration, for an
humble submission in Faith to the Will of
God. Therefore I would not have men
speak as if they knew all, and draw par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Schemes, and it must be so, and
no otherwise; and thus and thus you must
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103588:126"/>
proceed in this and that way and form,
therefore things must be so stated.</p>
                     <p>I have done with the Argumentative
part. I will now speak a word or two in
a looser way of Discourse.</p>
                     <p>I say then thus, he may be a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
who doth not take his faith for any
part of his Justifying Righteousness; I
suppose that will be granted: But he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a true Believer who takes not
Christ for his Justifying Righteousness. I
do not say now for his only Justifying
Righteousness, because I would speak in
the sense of those I oppose. I say, they
cannot be Believers who do not look upon
Christ as their Justifying Righteousness;
but they may be true Believers who do
not look upon faith as a part of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying
Righteousness. For the first, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it an Error, it is only about the act
in our apprehension which doth not alter
the nature of the thing at all. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
is an Error in the act, which quite
destroys the very nature of faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the safer way is rather to press per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to believe, to see they have faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and in Truth, than urge them to such
an unscriptural construction of their faith,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103588:126"/>
putting such a title of Honor upon it to the
reproach of Christ and his Righteousness.
They honour faith sufficiently who only
prefer Christ before it. No doubt God
will give faith its due praise and place at
the last day; our not knowing or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
the reach and truth of our
faith in all circumstances of it, will be no
prejudice to faith at the last day. I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish, we were more in the Exercise
of Faith than in Controversies about it;
more in the Practise of Good Works than
in Dispute about them; we should then
sooner understand both the one and the
other. Sirs! the mysterious, sublime
Doctrine of Justification was revealed
for our comfort, and proposed to our
faith to be believed; not to our reason
to argue upon in a <hi>Quodlibetical</hi> manner
and to toss to and fro for Argument sake.
What if we know no more of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then is absolutely necessary for our
Justification? This is the case of many
plain, sincere hearted Christians; and if
it were so with us all, we may have fewer
Notions in our Heads, but possibly more
Grace in our Hearts. The Lord grant,
that we may know the Doctrine of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
so as they know it who are saved
by Christ. But <hi>surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103588:127"/>
Coelum, &amp; nos cum doctrinis nostris sine
corde, volutamur in carne &amp; in sanguine.</hi>
The Learned they dispute and wrangle
themselves into Hell; the unlearned they
believe, practice and gain Heaven, taking
up the truth in simplicity according to the
general scope of the Gospel, as it is held
forth to the meanest Capacity. Brethren!
what <hi>Paul</hi> said to the Jaylor, <hi>Acts 16. 31.</hi>
that I say to you all, <hi>Believe on the Lord
Iesus Christ, and thou and thy house shall be
saved.</hi> Don't you go home now, and tell
your Families that they must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this Text so as to look upon Christ
as their only justifying righteousness, but
look out for something in themselves if
ever they be saved. No, pray speak Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Language, expound Scripture by
Scripture, and tell them, that Christ is
all in all; tell them plainly that they must
not be found in their own righteousness;
they must be <hi>found in Christ not having on
their own righteousness,</hi> that they must <hi>count
all things but loss and dung that they may
win Christ;</hi> that there is no <hi>other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but Christ, no other name under Heaven
by which they can be saved, but the name of
Christ;</hi> tell them they must not come for
Justification and Life in the name of their
Good Works, of any thing that belongs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103588:127"/>
themselves; but only in the name of
Christ, promote this Doctrine in your
Families and among your Children and
Servants. This is the way to save you
and your Household. This is good, whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
household Divinity, and suited to
the ordinary Capacity of all serious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.
We must not send our Hearers
to intricate distinctions, to learn the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Doctrine of their Justification.
The sense of the Gospel is plain enough
in this thing, they that run may read it.
Come, come, you shall never be charged
at the Last Day for giving too much to
Christ in the matter of Justification. You
are bound to ascribe all to him, and you
shall never be charged for giving too
much. And certainly if it be possible to
err on that hand, I had rather err in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too much then too little to Christ. Do
you think that a true Believer, who doth
not look upon the act of Faith or works
of Holiness to be any part of his justifying
righteousness; but casts himself upon
Christ, do you think, I say, that God
will reprove such a person at the last day
for ascribing too much to Christ, and not
pleading his own righteousness? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Believer cannot plead the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ without Faith; his way of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103588:128"/>
arguing from Christ will sufficiently evince
the truth and reality of his Faith; there
needs no other proof and demonstration
of it.</p>
                     <p>I should have made some Application.
I will tell you what I intended.</p>
                     <p>First, To those who ground their Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
upon the sandy Foundation of
their inherent Righteousness; I would
exhort them to pull down the house pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
before it fall upon their heads; and
lay a better Foundation, if ever they think
to stand before the Son of Man in his
Day.</p>
                     <p>Then I should exhort them, and press
them to study other Arguments, (as there
are very many) to promote Good Works
and practical Holiness among men; and
not justle out Christ to make room for self
Righteousness in the matter of Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
What, must we work for Life still?
To work for Justification is to work for
Life, and why should we thus turn the
Gospel into the Law?</p>
                     <p>I should speak also to those who are
built upon the right Foundation, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103588:128"/>
have cast themselves upon Christs Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
for Justification unto Life. Let
such be careful to maintain good Works;
let them be Examplary in the practise of
them; and bring forth fruit meet for the
Kingdom of God. For as the Foundation
may be too weak for the Superstructure,
so the Superstructure may be too mean for
the Foundation. And therefore down
with all this Hay, Wood and Stubble,
and labour to walk more sutable to that
Holy Faith under the Profession of which
you live. Brethren! The unsutable and
uncircumspect lives of Professors, have
been the greatest scandal to the Doctrine
of Justification by Faith; it hath opened
the Mouths of men against it. Therefore
labour to live men into a Conviction of
this Truth. Disputes and Words will not
do it, till you make it appear, that the
Grace of God that hath brought Life and
Immortality to light through the Gospel,
hath taught you to deny all Ungodliness
and Worldly Lusts. This is the way to
promote the Doctrine of Justification by
Faith alone. You that are built upon the
right Foundation had need be careful and
circumspect. The House is not yet finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we do all of us lie open more or less to
Storms and Tempests here below, though
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103588:129"/>
they cannot throw down the house, yet
they may shake the house; the rain may
beat into the house, may soak through eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
room of the house, may foul the house;
may greatly incommode us and distress us.
Therefore keep your Souls in good repair,
keep them as tite as you can against Wind
and Weather.</p>
                     <p>And for your Comfort I would have
told you that Heaven will mend all the
Errors in the Superstructure, if the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
be right. God will then take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and separate all those weaknesses and
sinful mixtures that now run along with all
our Graces; all Cracks and Flawes, the
sinkings, and failings, the bendings and
leanings, this way and that way in any
part of the building, Heaven will mend
all, will set all right and straight; when
we are Sanctified throughout, and the
Top-stone is laid.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Distinguish between Legal and

                  <p>You see the Repentance and Faith spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

a reference to the Gospel; <hi>Repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103588:131"/>
the nature of Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
by comparing it with Legal
Repentance, observing as we go how
they differ from each.</p>
                  <p>(1.) Legal Repentance is the work of
the Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> The work of the Spirit by
the Law, for the Law works but faintly
under the influence of meer Natural Light,
unless the Spirit awaken the Conscience,
and set home the Law, little will be done,
such a work of the Law you have <hi>Rom.
2. 15.</hi> letting in a Spirit of Bondage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Conscience, accusing us for what
we have done against the Law, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us so convicted without any plea for
our selves.</p>
                  <p>Evangelical Repentance is the work of
the Gospel, sweetly melting the Heart by
Arguments drawn from the Love of God,
and his free Grace in Christ towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
it encourages a trembling Soul to
plead with God for Mercy as the Publican,
<hi>Lord be Merciful to me a Sinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(2.) Legal Repentance is all terrour
and no hope, it rises from the revelation
of Gods Wrath against Sinners; 'tis a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing
Repentance without any hope of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103588:132"/>
pardon, the Curse of the Law lies hard
upon a Man; he knows not how to get
from under it, but lives in a fearful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of fiery indignation to devour
him, he is a terrour to himself: But Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Repentance leaves not an affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sinner altogether without hope, as I
shall shew under the next head.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Legal Repentance is from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sorrow, not so much for the sin as the
penalty incurred thereby, the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of which is very dreadful to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
sinner; he is more affected with
the evil of punishment, then with the
evil of sin in it self; 'tis not for Gods sake
but his own, that he repents of sin; he
could love it well enough if it did not
damn him: Though I do not deny, but
a Repentance purely legal, may have
some sense of the evil of sin as sin, not
only as <hi>malum prohibitum,</hi> but as <hi>malum
in se,</hi> as evil in its own nature; where
common notions of good and evil are not
utterly extinguished, it must needs be so,
especially under a higher conviction from
the Spirit of God, that gives us a farther
discerning of the evil of sin, then the
meer light of nature under its greatest
elevation can possibly do. It was so in
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103588:132"/>
                     <hi>Iudas, Matt. 27. 34.</hi> he was convinced,
not only that he had broken the Law of
God, but that he had sinned in so doing.
<hi>I have sinned in that I have betrayed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
blood:</hi> He knew he had a hand in
murdering a Man, a good Man, a great
Man, who was more then Man; no doubt
all this came up into his mind, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christ, yet the knowledge of Christ
that <hi>Iudas</hi> had, did not reach so far as to
beget the least hope of Mercy from him;
and here lay the legality of his Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
it was a despairing Repentance,
he conversed only with the Law, and so
sunk under the wrath of God, and the
curse of the Law; he had none to accuse
him but his own Conscience, the Rulers
and chief Priests were for him, had set
him a work and rewarded him; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him under such horror of Conscience,
he had done their business, what care
they, see thou to that; unconvinced sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
do slight the convictions of others,
they may go hang themselves for all them,
they have no pity for them.</p>
                  <p>I speak this to shew that legal Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
may take in something of the evil of
sin in it self, as well as the destructive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it to us; though these legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103588:133"/>
of the evil of sin in it self, are
far short of those more through convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that accompany true Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:
Though the sorrow that is in
legal Repentance be but worldly; yet 'tis
very pungent, it pierces us thorow, and
pretends to some Devotion too, as if it
were for Gods sake, when self is only at
the bottom. <hi>Pharaoh confessed his sins,</hi>
and desired the Prayers of Gods People,
<hi>Exod. 9. 27, 28. Saul wept for his sins,
1 Sam. 24. 16.</hi> The effects of Gods wrath
are very dreadful upon convinced sinners,
may draw Tears from their Eyes, when
they see what mischief they have brought
upon themselves; they repent, but how?
Not of the sin, but of the punishment:
Alas! What does that signifie, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
is it? What have we to do to
repent of the punishment? We can't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
it; 'tis Gods part to repent of the
punishment, to turn from his wrath, to
cease from his anger, which he will do,
when we repent of the sin that occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
                  <p>To repent of the punishment, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
to be sorry that God is so just, that
he so severely animadverts upon sinners;
we wish he would let them go unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103588:133"/>
that we might more securely go on in
our sins; the only way to escape venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
is to acknowledge the sinfulness of
sin, and to repent of our great folly in
committing it; such a frame of Spirit
bears some proportion to the Holiness of
God, argues true Godly sorrow, which
worketh Evangelical Repentance unto
Salvation. <hi>2 Cor. 7. 10.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(4.) Legal Repentance is before Faith,
without Faith may never issue in saving
Faith, as in <hi>Cain, Saul, Iudas,</hi> but Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Repentance does alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
saving Faith; and of this I am now
to speak under the second head; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The nature of Evangelical
Repentance; what it is in its first rise and
original; upon what 'tis founded.</p>
                  <p>It came in with the Gospel, the Law
never intended any such thing, the sinner
was to be cut off by Law, to die without
Mercy, <hi>in the day thou eatest thou shalt die,</hi>
says the Law; <hi>unless ye repent,</hi> says the
Gospel; here is an exception put in (in
case of repentance) against the peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sentence of the Law. I say repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103588:134"/>
comes in with the Gospel, <hi>I will put
enmity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi> Repentance rises
out of this Enmity. This seems to point
particularly at the Conversion of <hi>Eve,</hi> who
by Faith in the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> should
turn against the Serpent. <hi>I will put enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
between thee and the woman;</hi> this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
whom thou hast deceived, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thy Enemy, and bring forth a seed
that shall break thy head, thou shalt bruise
his heel, but his Death shall be thy over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
Repentance is a Gospel Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
purchased by Christ, 'tis an act of
Grace in God to injoyn us Repentance, as
his leaving men in an impenitent harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
frame is an act of his Justice and Wrath.
The Law in its Original Constitution, does
not intend the amendment of the sinner,
but his utter Destruction; the Law can
kill the sinner, but cannot mortifie the
sin; Damnation makes no man better,
but concludes him Eternally under sin and
wrath; the Justice of God is not obliged
to turn a sinner from his sins, but to turn
him into Hell for his sins.</p>
                  <p>That which makes it a just and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing with God to forgive the sins of
Believer, is Christs, Merits and his own
Promise; 'tis Justice in God to make good
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103588:134"/>
his own Promises, <hi>Rom. 3. 25, 26. 2 Thes.
1. 6, 7.</hi> he is a debtor to his own promise,
he cannot deny himself, <hi>2 Tim. 2. 13.</hi> he
owes the performance of his Promise to
his Faithfulness and Truth; 'tis an act of
Justice to himself to keep his Promise:
God offers Mercy to sinners, not because
they do repent, but that they may repent:
Repentance is not the Cause but the Effect
of Pardon, God always intends Pardon
to those whom he effectually calls to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
he gave no such call to the
Angels that fell; there was no Gospel
preached to them. No fallen Angel was
saved, because no Elect Angel fell, but
there are many of Gods Elect among the
fallen Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> to whom promises of
Salvation were made upon their believing
in Christ; this being published to all in
the Gospel, all who hear the Gospel do
put in for their share in this Salvation, and
that they may render the attainment more
easie and feazable to them, they deny ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Election, bring in Universal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
assert the liberty of Mans Will
to believe if he please, and supposing it to
be in their own power to believe, they
conclude they may be saved as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and this is the ground of all that
security that is among common Professors.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103588:135"/>
Having spoken thus much of Evangelical
Repentance as it implies a real hatred of
sin as sin, and a real turning to God as
the chiefest good from an inward change
of nature renewed after the Image of
God, I shall now shew you,</p>
                  <p>1. That such a Repentance can never
be wrought in any by the Law alone, the
Gospel has a principal hand in this.</p>
                  <p>Why not by the Law.</p>
                  <p>Because in the Law there are not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
motives and inducements to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
nothing that encourages to it, that
renders it available to mans Salvation, the
law cannot give life to a sinner upon his
repentance; the Gospel can, but the Law
cannot, could a man under the Law, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
suppose that? What would he get
by it, he must to Hell after all, the Law
as a Covenant of Works does not seek to
bring a sinner to Repentance, but to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
the Law cannot give Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
unto Life, because it cannot give Life
upon our Repentance.</p>
                  <p>You'l say then, is the Law against Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103588:135"/>
I don't say so neither; for
take Repentance as 'tis a just equitable
thing, as a holy disposition of mind; so
the Law is not against it where ever it may
be found, as it is not against any other
act of Moral Righteousness as such that a
man may do, and yet for all this 'twill
condemn a man for his sin, and all his
righteousness shall not be remembred,
though the Law be not against Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
yet it will not accept of repentance
as a satisfaction for past sins, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
provides full satisfaction for the Law,
and promises sufficient and effectual Grace
to the sinner to bring him to repentance;
having rescued him from the Curse of the
Law, enables him to walk worthy of the
blessing of the Gospel, if those who are
justified were not sanctified, they would
live to the scandal of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>The Law cannot contradict it self, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
already pronounced a peremptory
sentence of death upon the sinner, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
the Law should ever gier repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
unto Life, the Law insists upon the
Execution of its own Judgement, and will
not be satisfied till that be done, in this
the Gospel yields to the Law, to have
execution done upon man for sin, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103588:136"/>
provides a man on purpose, <hi>the man
Christ Iesus, who bore our sins in his own
body upon the cross.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. This Evangelical Repentance implies
real Sanctification, but the Law sanctifies
no man, because it can't convey its own
Holiness to another, can't alter the Nature
of a Man, but only shew him what mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
his sin has done him, shews him his
sin in this or that instance, to his great
terror, but if he happen to out-live those
terrors, and not die in the fit as <hi>Iudas,</hi> his
evil heart will encline him as strongly to
sin, as ever it did before his former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
they made him give a present
start backwards, but he will quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
himself, and return to his wretched
course, he cannot cease from sin, though
he know it displeases God yet he likes it
never the worse for that, might he but
escape the punishment, 'tis not the wrath
of God in it self that he fears, but only as
it goes forth in the penal effects of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
himself, else he could suffer God to
be angry, and not be troubled at it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
this goes most to the heart of a Child
of God, that he has incurr'd his displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
<hi>There is no soundness in my flesh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of thine anger, Psal. 38. 3.</hi> The Law
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103588:136"/>
alone never works any real Sanctification
in a sinner; 'tis indeed the rule of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it judges us according to what we
are, but cannot make us better.</p>
                  <p>4. Repentance is a turning unto God,
but the Law gives no encouragement to
a sinner to turn to God, it holds forth the
Wrath of God against him, that makes
him run from the presence of an angry
God and hide himself as <hi>Adam</hi> did, how
can dry stubble stand before a consuming
Fire, but God out of Christ is a consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fire to a sinner, he dares not come
near him.</p>
                  <p>5. The law by it self can't work a sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Conviction 'tis very Instrumental in
conjunction with the Gospel to do this,
but of it self it cannot. Saving Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is of the essence of Evangelical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>Saving Conviction hath these four pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
                  <p>1. It apprehends upon Scripture grounds
a possibility of a sinners Salvation, and
not only so, but a fair probability of it
upon the due use of those means appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103588:137"/>
by God in order thereunto, and leads
out the sinner to seek relief in Christ, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some hope of obtaining it.</p>
                  <p>2. It works a hatred of sin as sin, strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclines and disposes the heart of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to break off from his sins, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
himself to a strict course of Holiness:
God offers Grace to sinners, because he
intends to give Faith and Repentance to
as many as are ordained unto Life, Faith
inclines us to beg Repentance, disposes us
to it, laies open the foulness of sin so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so convincingly that we cannot but
repent of it, under such a saving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
as Faith works in us, I call it a
saving Conviction, because it puts us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the diligent use of all means tending to
Salvation; a man is so convinced that he
cannot rest till he has found out an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
remedy to cure so deadly a disease, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
will satisfie him but Christ, we see
not all that is in sin; till we see an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
necessity of Christ to save us from it:
Here is a deep discovery of sin indeed,
when we know nothing but the Blood of
Christ can take it away; <hi>Behold the Lamb
of God,</hi> &amp;c. a Sacrifice of Gods provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all the Bulls, Goats, Sheep and Lambs
of Mans procuring will never expiate sin,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103588:137"/>
nothing that is among men can do it, but
God has a Lamb, cherished in his own
bosom from Eternity, this Lamb must be
slain to take away the sins of the World,
'tis very astonishing to think what God
parted with from himself to satisfie his own
Justice; his Attributes conspire together
to heighten and advance each other; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Grace lays out it self to satisfie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Justice, and satisfied Justice gives
way to infinite Grace to glorifie it self in
mans free Redemption.</p>
                  <p>3. It convinces us not only of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sins, but of the general Corruption of
our Nature, 'tis by a Divine supernatural
Light that we discern this, we have a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it in our selves, from an inward
Principle of a higher Life raised up in us
by the power of God in our Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which will not suffer us to walk any
more after the flesh, we cry and complain
of that proneness that is in us to evil; <hi>O
wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom. 7.</hi> No
unconverted man is brought in complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Corruption of his Nature, only
<hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and such like, but none
else. When we look upon the old man
with the eyes of the new, we see that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
that never appared to us before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:103588:138"/>
4. It Convinces us not only of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
of the Law, in punishing, but also
of the Holiness of the Law in all its just
and reasonable Commands; <hi>Rom. 7. 12.</hi>
This is a main difference between Legal
and Evangelical Repentance, that Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and Sense that is in a Legal Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of the Holiness of the Law, is very
small, next to none at all, and that which
is, proceeds chiefly from the remainders
of light in all natural Men, left on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in the Conscience, that all reverence
of God and his Law might not be quite
cast off, and something of this may now
and then appear under strong legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
of sin, as in <hi>Iudas,</hi> but all this
never begets any true love to Holiness,
for still they go on in their sins and have
pleasure in them that do so, <hi>Rom. 1. 32.</hi>
which is a great demonstration of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Dominion sin has over fallen man,
in carrying him on not only against the
known Law of God written in the Word,
but against all the natural Notions of the
Law written in his own heart, nothing
can hold him in, he despises God and man
and his own Conscience, he will not be a
Law to himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:103588:138"/>
Legal Convictions come short in all
these properties of saving Conviction.</p>
                  <p>Legal Convictions are either such as are
antecedent to the Commission of Sin, or
such as follow upon it, which are proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called Convictions.</p>
                  <p>Convictions antecedent to sin, are all
one with the knowledge of the Law, by
which we understand what is morally
good or evil in it self; what is sin, and
what is not, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in innocency
were under this Conviction, they knew
what God had forbidden, <hi>viz.</hi> to eat of
the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil,
and that to eat of it in opposition to Gods
express command to the contrary, was a
high act of Disobedience, to be punished
with Death, but by the subtilty of the
Devil they yielded to the Temptation,
and did eat: if their perfect knowledge
of the Law could not keep them in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
from falling, how can we expect
that our imperfect knowledge of the Law
from any Convictions of that kind, which
we may be under should keep us.</p>
                  <p>And for those legal Convictions subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to the commission of sin, by which
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103588:139"/>
we see the obliquity of our own actions,
and know our selves to be Transgressors
of a holy righteous Law, they fall short
in all the forementioned properties of
saving Conviction, they leave us without
hope of Mercy, work no renovation of
nature in us, they may disturb us in the
present act of sin, and terrifie us much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that, laying some present restraint
upon us, but they work no real Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
in us, <hi>Iudas</hi> was in great horror of
Conscience for betraying his Master, was
much troubled that he should have a hand
in shedding innocent blood: and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the light and power of this Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how evil it was to Murder another, he
hangs himself, which was as contrary to
Law, as killing another: I speak this to shew
how legal convictions may hurry a man
from one sin to another, but they never
lead him into a constant setled way of true
Holiness, whence I infer that Convictions
purely legal will never work Repentance
unto Life.</p>
                  <p>How Repentance unto Life is wrought
by the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Because God hath appointed the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to be the means of Repentance, <hi>Luk.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:103588:139"/>
24. 47. Rom. 16. 25, 26.</hi> to the Glory of
his Free Grace, as Justice is glorified in
the Damnation of an impenitent sinner,
so Grace is glorified in his Conversion;
Evangelical Repentance is from a Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Gods Love and Free Grace: <hi>His
goodness leads us to Repentance, Rom. 2. 4.
2 Pet. 3. 9. Psal. 130. 4.</hi> A true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
fears least he should miss of Mercy,
and come short of it, he rejoyces at the
good News of the Gospel, begins to lift up
his head in some expectation of a blessed
Redemption, he serves God chearfully
being perswaded that his Duties and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
will be pleasing to him and accepted
by him for Christ sake, <hi>Psal. 130. 4. Hos.
6. 1, 2.</hi> a sence of love and mercy quicken
up a drooping trembling sinner to return
unto God, the Prodigal remembred what
a kind Father he had, <hi>Luk. 15. 18.</hi> 'twas
<hi>Pauls</hi> Argument, <hi>Rom. 12. 1. 2 Cor. 7. 1.</hi>
'Tis a sad thing that the Grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
which is intended to keep men from
Despair, should be some be made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to presumption, God forbid
we should continue in Sin because Grace
abounds.</p>
                  <p>2. The Grace of the Gospel is not only
an appointed Means, but is in its own
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103588:140"/>
nature a fit means to work repentance,
suited and adapted to that end, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God leads us to repentance, the
Schoolmen tell us that <hi>amor est congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivus,</hi>
and they give this reason for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it does congregate and gather in
our roving scattered thoughts from those
various lesser Objects after which they go,
fixing our Minds upon God, the only soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfying
Object. Love is conciliative,
when God doth through Faith let in any
sense of his intended grace towards sinners,
the heart melts under it, a sinner does not
repent that he may believe, but because
he does believe, something of the Love
of God to sinners in Christ Jesus, some
inkling of this is come to his ear, hath
touched his very heart, before ever he
sets upon repentance, and now he can hold
no longer, the love of Christ constrains
him, great is the power of Love, when it
commends it self to us in some signal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of kindness to our visible advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and benefit.</p>
                  <p>3. Because Christ gives repentance, <hi>Act.
5. 31.</hi> he purchased this and all other
graces for us, by dying for us, he not only
obtained pardon of Sin in our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but all inherent Graces in the Saints
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103588:140"/>
come from Christ, he procured them for
us, he works them in us, his sufferings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not only satisfactory for sin, but meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
of grace to be bestowed upon us,
though the Law can't sanctify a sinner yet
Christ can, and 'tis an act of special grace
towards us when he doth, but he will first
satisfie the Law and Justice of God, that
being brought under grace by our free Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification,
we may answer to the Law of
grace in our sanctification, denying all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness
and Worldly Lusts, living soberly
and righteously here below as the redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lord ought to do; the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
perfect Obedience, but in case of
Failure, the Gospel Promises Faith and
Repentance, <hi>Zach. 12. 10. Acts 11. 18.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Because God hath annexed a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit to the Gospel, to make way
for his Grace, and to give it a prevailing
efficacy in the Hearts of men, they are
drawn by the loving kindness of God,
and cannot resist it, the Spirit opens the
Mystery of the Love of God in Christ,
and so charms the Soul with it, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to withstand the allurements of it.</p>
                  <p>5. Because the ways and means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a sinner to life, are all supernatural;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:103588:141"/>
the Law speaks nothing of this, the Law
never puts us upon any thing that is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural;
I mean that originally was so
to man in his perfect state, for then it had
been quite above the reach and capacity
of Mans Understanding, but God suited
his Law to those inbred Notions and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Truth, that were concreated in
us, the way of salvation through Faith
and Repentance being supernatural; we
must apply our selves to the Gospel to
know this.</p>
                  <p>3. The necessary Connection that is
between Evangelical Repentance and sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith. I prove, it thus.</p>
                  <p>'Tis so in the first production of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and in all the subsequent acts of
Repentance, therefore 'tis alwayes so.</p>
                  <p>In the first production of Repentance
if you consider how this was wrought by
<hi>Iohns</hi> Ministry, <hi>Mat. 3.</hi> and <hi>Luk. 3.</hi> these
two things will evidently appear.</p>
                  <p>First, That Repentance alwayes presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
Faith.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Repentance rises out
of Faith. And how!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:103588:141"/>
I will clear up this by a brief Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase
upon those words, <hi>Repent ye, for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> is brought in inviting sinners to
Repentance; the Argument he uses is
plainly this, God is inclined to Pardon
you, therefore Repent: I come as a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
to prepare the way, that by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you the first newes of Gods intended
grace and favour towards you, I might sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and mollify your hearts and dispose you
to a ready thankful acceptance of Christ,
this offer of Grace is called the Kingdom
of Heaven because it is inclusive of all the
happiness that Heaven can afford: all good
comes along with Pardoning Grace, I see
says <hi>Iohn,</hi> you are all lying under the sad
damning circumstances of your own sins,
in a very woful miserable condition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
about with Hell and Death, with
horror and darkness, all things round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
you, look very black and dismal, I
am come to put you into a better state, to
offer you a Kingdom, which will shortly
appear in all its Glory; 'tis at hand, 'tis
coming toward you, Heaven it self is come
to look after you to lend a helping hand
to lift you out of this horrible Pit, before
it shut its mouth upon you, see that you
refuse not this grace, that you put not from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:103588:142"/>
you the word of the Gospel, least you
judge your selves unworthy of Eternal
Life, as <hi>Acts 13. 46. i. e.</hi> it will as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear to be so, as if it had been so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in open Court, upon a fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of your Cause, if Heaven and Earth
were to sit in Judgment upon you, they
would conclude you most unworthy of
Everlasting Life, and by putting the word
from you, you have in effect passed this
judgement upon your selves, or you have
done that now which your own Consciences
will so interpret at the last day, they will
then tell you you might have had life and
pardon, but would not; you would not
come to Christ that you might have life,
therefore your damnation is just, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly
perish, &amp; may thank your selves for
it, how speechless will sinners be then: as to
remain in impenitency under the outward
Light of the Gospel, does argue the height
of unbelief, so to be brought to Repentance
by the Preaching of the Gospel does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
imply Faith in the Gospel, 'tis
impossible that a Tender of Grace should
work Repentance till 'tis believed, 'tis of
no force, makes no impression upon the
Mind of a Man till then, therefore, Faith
must be presupposed, I make it out thus.</p>
                  <p>That which is brought as a motive for
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103588:142"/>
the doing of a thing, must be first under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
received and believed, before the
thing can be done upon that motive:
there is in the Gospel a general offer of
Mercy to sinners, this proves an effectual
means to beget Faith in all that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
unto life, upon their believing
this general offer of Grace, their hearts
begin to melt under it, and some inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Repentance is wrought in them,
this Faith and this Repentance wrought
in a more general way at first, do form
themselves into more particular and distinct
acts afterwards, thus the principles of the
Doctrine of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance from
dead works and Faith towards God are
first laid, and then there is (in the light
and power of these principles) a going on
unto perfection, <hi>Heb. 6. 1.</hi> Our first Faith
is a more general Faith, and so is our first
Repentance, rather an inclination and
tendency to believe and repent, then
actual Faith, or actual Repentance. Our
first Faith wrought in us upon the general
proposal of Gospel Grace, contains in it
a saving Conviction of Sin, 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to receive grace without it, grace
is nothing to us, of no signification to us,
but as it gives relief against sin, which we
must have some sense of, before we apply
our selves to the grace of God for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:103588:143"/>
we must see something in our selves
that wants a pardon, and which we are
willing to repent of and forsake in Case
of a pardon, Repentance is as true an
effect of Faith, as Pardon and Comfort,
Faith first brings a sinner to Christ under
some hope of Pardon, and then busies it
self in working Repentance, in order to a
comfortable sense of Pardon. The Spirit
lets in some sense of Gospel Grace tendred
unto sinners, and affects the heart with it,
as very desireable, as a very seasonable
offer, by no means to be slighted, the
Soul begins to be taken with it, conceives
some hope from it, and this is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Faith, and with our first Faith
Light comes in giving us some Gospel
Conviction of sin in order to Repentance,
I call it a Gospel Conviction, because it is
wrought by means of the Gospel, all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
acts of Faith and Repentance have
their rise from this first work, which
brings me to the second Point, viz.</p>
                  <p>That Faith is not only joyned with
Repentance in the first production of it,
as has been shewed, but in all the subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
acts of it ever after; which I make
out thus. Faith and Repentance do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
refer to each other in their several
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103588:143"/>
actings, Faith to Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
to Faith; he that believes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
because he believes, and he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,
believes because he repents, <hi>i. e.</hi> as
Faith is the cause of Repentance, so Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is the reason of every particular
act of Faith put forth upon Christ for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
'tis impossible to make up the full sense
of an act of Faith on our part, if you fetch
not the reason of it from Repentance: Why
do we go to the Physitian, is it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we are sick, weary and faint ready
to die of such a Disease: So why does a
weary Soul come to Christ, is it not to
be eased of his Burden? that insupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
burden of sin that is ready to sink
him into Hell.</p>
                  <p>If Faith and Repentance be thus always
joyned together, does it not follow that
we are justified by our Repentance as
well as by Faith? I Answer, No. Though
we are not saved without Repentance, it
does not therefore follow that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by our Repentance; but some to
make good this Assertion have coyned
many subtle distinctions, relating to both.
Before I give a particular reply to this,
let me say something in general. Religion
may be considered, either in its primitive
purity and simplicity, as it was laid down
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:103588:144"/>
in the Fundamental Principles of it, by
Christ and his Apostles.</p>
                  <p>Or as it has since been drawn through
the various Discourses, Reasonings and
Writings of Men for so many Centuries
past, this has so much overcharged Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with so many nice distinctions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate
questions, and endless disputes, that
it seems to be quite another thing then it
was in the Apostles dayes: The best way
is to return to the primitive simplicity of
the Gospel, especially in judging of Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
which are plainly and clearly
laid down there in Terms very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.</p>
                  <p>Though Faith be the Gift of God, and
is given of meer Grace but to a few, yet
all who live under the Light of the Gospel
may know what they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
which will render their unbelief
more inexcusable; did we dwell more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what is plainly revealed as fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
necessary to Salvation, we should
better discern, by the light of those Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
the just consequences of them,
in any deductions from them, which may
not be so particularly and expresly spoken
unto in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:103588:144"/>
But now to answer the query whether
we may not be said to be justified by our
Repentance, as well as by Faith, since
we are not saved without Repentance?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a great deal of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Justification and Salvation,
Salvation includes all qualifications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to that state, Justification lets us
into that state; gives us right to Life from
whence spring all Qualifications becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Life. Besides, Saving Graces are
so called, not that they are the Causes of
Salvation, but because they accompany
it, we cannot be saved without them.
Faith it self as a Grace inherent in us, is
no meritorious Cause of our Justification;
'tis that which carries us out of our selves
to Christ for Righteousness upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of which we are justified in the sight
of God, when we say we are justified by
Faith, we don't mean we are justified by
any thing in our selves, we can't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it so, but the contrary, that we must
be beholding to Christ for all. He that
receives all from another, gives nothing
to himself, he does indeed apply to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
to his own use and benefit, what is
freely given to him by another, but he
cannot in any propriety of Speech be said
to ascribe any thing to himself, or to owe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:103588:145"/>
himself thanks for what he receives from
another: Faith in its justifying act does
not look to it self as our grace, but unto
Christ as our Righteousness, the inherent
grace of Faith is not our justifying Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
though it lead us out to him who
is; Faith is the hand, but Christ is the
gift; nay the hand it self is the gift of
God, as well as that which is put into it:
God gives us not only what we believe,
but he gives us to believe; the habit and
act of faith are both from God, that
he that glories may glory in the Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And if it be so with faith, if that be shut
out from being any part of our justifying
Righteousness, 'twill hold true much more
in all other saving graces that spring from
faith, whether Hope, Love, Fear, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Repentance proves our
Faith to be saving, such a faith as gives
us an Interest in Christ, faith adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the Righteousness of Christ, but
applies it as it is, it only gives us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in it, and makes it ours by vertue
of the Promise tendring it to us, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Promise we have a sure inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in the thing promised, and may ever
after count it our own, and if we are not
justified by our graces themselves, much
less by our good works, which are the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103588:145"/>
fruits and issues of them, we must resolve
all our graces into faith, and faith it self
into Christ and his Righteousness before
we can be clear in the matter of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>4. The real distinction that is between
them notwithstanding this necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection.</p>
                  <p>Faith and Repentance are frequently
joyned together in Scripture, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
each of them singly put for the whole
work of Conversion, and then they do
alwayes include each other, and imply the
whole work of grace in the Soul, as <hi>Luk.
13. 5. Luk. 15. 10. Acts 3. 19. Acts 11.
18.</hi> Though they cannot be separated,
yet they may be distinguished, not only
nominally but really; they are spoken of
(<hi>Act. 20. 21.</hi>) as two distinct things, as
Faith and Hope are inseparable, yet two
distinct Graces, so 'tis with Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
they grow together as different
Branches from the same Root that bears
and feeds them both, they are the two
Vital Constituent parts of a Christian,
which have their distinct Offices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences:
Repentance is the same in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
with Faith, though they receive
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103588:146"/>
different denominations, from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
objects and occasions about which
they act: A principle of Grace is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
Seed, or that Spirit that is born of
the Spirit; the fruits of the Spirit are not
the Spirit it self, but something produced
by him; all Graces are the fruits of the
Spirit and are specified by their different
objects: All Graces are but so many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of that holy Disposition, that
is wrought in us by the Holy Ghost. To
Repent of Sin is as true Holiness as not to
sin at all; a sinner has no other way to
express his Love to Holiness, than by a
declared Hatred of his Sins.</p>
                  <p>They differ in their Objects, faith as
justifying, hath Christs Righteousness for
its Object, Repentance has mans unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
for its Object; as Faith acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christ for an Interest in his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so Repentance acts towards God,
acknowledging our own Unrighteousness
and bewailing it, we cannot rejoyce in
the Righteousness of Christ, till we mourn
for our own sins; Christ reconciles God
to us, by the attonement offer'd, <hi>2 Cor.
5. 20, 21.</hi> and us to God by working Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
in us, who were Enemies to him
in our Minds by wicked works, <hi>Col. 1. 21.</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:103588:146"/>
alienated from the life of God, <hi>Col. 4. 18.</hi>
This Enmity against God and alienation
from him, is removed by Repentance:
Faith works upwards to appease Gods
Wrath, by holding up the Blood of
Christ; Repentance works downwards
upon our selves, changing our Minds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, that we may be conformable
to his Will, and rebel no more against
him. Besides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Graces do not imploy, at least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually,
the same Affections, there is more
joy and hope in Faith, more sorrow and
fear in Repentance; faith lists up and
comforts a guilty sinner upon one account,
Repentance humbles him and lays him
low upon another account, filling him
with godly sorrow for his sins.</p>
                  <p>5. Reasons why the Professors of this
Age who are so much for Faith do mind
Repentance so little, are so seldom found
in the Exercise of it.</p>
                  <p>1. Because they rest in general Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Faith, and of Justification by Grace
through Christ; they say they have faith,
and think this will save them, we may
have right notions of faith in our Heads,
and yet be under no real actings of faith
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:103588:147"/>
in our Hearts; we may be Orthodox in
our Judgements, sound in the Doctrine of
Faith, and yet be strangers to the Grace
of Faith; we may hold the Truth, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
for it, preach it up, maintain it in
our Discourses, as our Opinion, and yet
be rotten at Heart for all this, under the
power of unbelief, if you know these
things happy are ye if ye do them. Faith
must be done as well as talked of, it must
be really acted by us in our own case,
'tis not the doctrine of faith, but your
faith in or according to that doctrine, that
saves you, the just shall live by his own
faith, the doctrine of faith is an external
thing laid down in the letter of the word,
but the grace of faith is an inward living
principle found only in the hearts of real
Saints, this is that I am inquiring after,
and pressing upon you as that that will
certainly produce Repentance, <hi>Zach. 12.
10.</hi> 'Tis one thing to have a Notional
Knowledge of the doctrine of faith as
contained in the letter of the word, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to be under the power of the
grace of faith as it passes thorow the heart
in the lively actings of it: Notions of
things may be separated from those effects
that alwayes attend the things themselves
when they are in being, we may shake
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103588:147"/>
and freeze under our notions of fire, but
we cannot stand before fire it self and not
be warmed by it, were there more real
faith; I mean of the grace of faith, among
professors, there would be more Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
let us not flatter our selves in the
good opinion we have of our faith, and
of our supposed Interest in Christ, 'tis all
false, our faith is vain, and we are yet in
our sins, if Repentance do not accompany
our faith: The visible neglect of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the Professors of this age, has
brought a reproach upon the doctrine of
faith, and caused it to be evil spoken of,
that faith that does not sanctifie, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
justifie, and without Repentance there
can be no Sanctification: not that we
make Repentance any Meritorious Cause
of Pardon, or that it is to be rested in as
any satisfaction for sin, only we affirm that
justifying faith alwayes works Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>2. Because they rest in a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
which they took up at their
first Conversion, and that must serve all
their lives long, 'tis enough they have
once repented, that work is over, they
have done with it now, and care not to
return to it again: but because you have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103588:148"/>
once repented, you must always repent,
you entred into Covenant with God for
your whole lives, to repent of every sin
you should fall into, and shall we begin
in the Spirit and end in the Flesh.</p>
                  <p>3. Because they have long since re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
what was amiss in their Lives, and
refrained from the outward acts of those
sins they lived in heretofore, all this may
be without any true Repentance, you say
you have forsaken your sins that is a gross
mistake, for till you repent of them you
have not forsaken them in Gods account,
but are still looked upon as those who
justifie your selves in those very sins, if not
why don't you repent of them, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
abide under the guilt of that sin
which you have not repented of, the
turning of the heart to God, can never
be without Repentance; till then you
still retain the good opinion you had of
your sins, your heart is set upon them
still, nothing but Repentance turns the
heart another way. There can be no real
Reformation of Life, without a change
of Heart; Men may for a spurt force
themselves to an outward Course of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
but they can never hold it, the heart
will go its own way, and carry the man
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103588:148"/>
after it, nothing but repentance makes a
man a better man than he was before; a
man is the same that ever he was till he
repents, then indeed he is another man,
of another Mind.</p>
                  <p>4. Because they reckon all their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sins among their Infirmities, and
therefore a slight Repentance will serve
the turn, they think they will be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Course to them, without any more
ado.</p>
                  <p>I look upon it as a great Error, to hold
that all sins committed in a state of Grace
are sins of Infirmity; Saints themselves
may be guilty of wilful presumptuous
sins, and when they are, they must not
think to shift them off as common Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.
I grant, those grosser acts of sin,
that a Saint may be surprized into, do
argue an infirm imperfect state, their state
may be good though imperfect, there
may be some good thing in their Hearts
toward God, when they fall foul as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> did; but I am not now
inquiring what is in their hearts, but what
is in those grosser acts of sin, <hi>viz.</hi> Murder,
Adultery, and the like; I say there is
nothing but Evil in them, they are all
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103588:149"/>
over and throughout sinful; now, what
is morally evil and sinful in its own nature
cannot properly be called a sin of Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
because an Infirmity in the true No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, is the deficiency of a good Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'tis not so good as it should be, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
evil in it self it is not, <hi>v. g.</hi> a
Child of God prayes but not so fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as he should, he hears the Word, but
not so attentively as he should; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in Christ, but not so firmly, so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
so stedfastly as he would, this is his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
here the action it self, or the thing
done, is for the substance and matter of it
good in it self, what God has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but when we do that which is mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially
Evil in its own nature, and forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by God, this is more than an Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the whole action is naught; 'tis not
a weak action, but a wicked one. He
that is an infirm man, is a living man; a
dead man is more than infirm, he has no
life at all in him that is capable of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if a Child of God should swear, be
Drunk, or commit Whoredom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I
would not say as some do, Oh the Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
of the Saints, but I would say oh
the Wickedness, the Leudness of the Saints;
you'l think these hard words, hard things
must have hard words, they that do well
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103588:149"/>
shall hear well, and they that do ill must
hear ill: Sin is not the less sinful because a
Godly Man commits it, it falls under
greater Aggravations in him, than in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
there may be some good thing in
his heart, but there is nothing in these
sinful acts but what is morally Evil and
abominably wicked. This should awaken
us to Repentance, are there not sins even
mong us against the Lord our God?</p>
                  <p>6. The Application.</p>
                  <p>Repentance being the plainest and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Evidence of Saving Faith, let us be
much in the exercise of this Grace: We
should repent as often as there is new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for Repentance, I do not say we
should alwayes be grieving and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the same sin; Repentance may
have its perfect work, in reference to
some particular sin, which God has suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
humbled us for. There is a time
to set broken bones, we may rejoyce in
the Cure, in that Ease and Rest that God
gives us, when he speaks peace to us: By
believing we enter into Rest, till some
new sin disturb our rest, and then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is to be renewed: By a new sin
I don't mean common unavoidable Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103588:150"/>
but some grosser wilful Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age:
We ought to be humbled under
our Infirmities, to confess them, and so to
pass on by a present act of Faith, into our
wonted serenity and peace of Conscience
not doubting but God will overlook them
for Christs sake. Faith is not so put to it,
does not labour so much to take in the
pardon of them, as it does and must do
to obtain the pardon of grosser sins, which
put the Soul at a greater distance from
God, then common Infirmities do, which
are pardoned of Course to Believers upon
their humble acknowledgement of them,
but in case of any particular wilful sin, we
must renew our Repentance in a more
solemn manner, and afflict our souls for
it, how long God may keep us mourning,
before he restore to us the joy of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
must be left to him who knowes
when to administer comfort to us, in the
fittest season: When we are about this
work, 'tis good to reflect upon former
sins already pardoned, there sinfulness ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
thorow the Pardon. We may join
our old scores to this new reckoning, and
carry over all to the present Account,
that having the sum Total before us, we
may bewail the late addition we have
made to it: When we see how high it
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103588:150"/>
rises, every new offence receives an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation,
from so many that went before,
'tis some Extenuation of a Fault to say, 'tis
the first time; but frequent relapses into
the same sin do heighten the guilt of it,
and in such Cases there is nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,
or perishing.</p>
                  <p>The more you are in the Exercise of
this Grace of Repentance, the less incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
will you be to any sin: I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
were the Devil sure you would
Repent, he would not be so forward to
Tempt you to any sin, nothing does so
enrage the Devil, as the Repentance of
the Saints, could he keep them always in
that Mind, they are in, in the hour of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Temptation, he might Glory over
them, but when they come to themselves,
and consider better of it, how do they
inveigh against the Tempter, and cry down
the sin as an abominable Practise, and
what does the Devil get by this, he loses
more by their Repentance then ever he
got by their Sin, he is laid open as an
Impostor, as a Deceiver; the Repentance
of the Saints is the greatest Torment to the
Devil before his time that can be; as there
is joy in Heaven at the Conversion of a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103588:151"/>
Sinner, so there is no small sorrow in Hell
upon the same Account.</p>
                  <p>You cannot Honour God more than by
a Daily Repentance, thereby you vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
your holy Profession, from giving
the least countenance to sin; were the
people of God more ashamed of sin, the
wicked of the World would glory less in
it, they would begin to blush with you,
and hang down their heads for doing that
which is so openly decry'd by all good
men, good men are greatly wanting in the
open Profession of their Repentance, if
you did mourn for sin more, others would
rejoyce in it less.</p>
