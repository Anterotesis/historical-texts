            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Sermon beares so strange a title in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, that I durst not (a while) study for a Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage to it, but intended to send it to the broad world, to shift for it selfe, as fearing it would not be own'd: for it taxeth many vices; specially the <hi>Blacke Euell,</hi> secret Theeuery, and the <hi>White Deuill,</hi> slie Hypocrisie; whence it taketh the denomination, now what ambitious <hi>Courtier,</hi> would grace such a <hi>Stranger?</hi> what vicious <hi>Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> would entertaine such a <hi>Page?</hi> what corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Lawyer,</hi> such a <hi>Client?</hi> what couetous <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> such a <hi>Tenant?</hi> what vsurious <hi>Citizen,</hi> such a

I had rather conuert one soule, then haue an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth praise me. Whereof, if I were (so besotted to bee) ambitious, by this I could not hope it: for it puls many tender and tendred sins out of their downy neasts; and who strikes <hi>vice,</hi> and is not stricken with <hi>calumnies?</hi> I must rather thinke, it hath passed from one presse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to a worse, hazarding it selfe to be pressed to death with censures: which yet (though I lowly hope better) I cannot feare; since it speakes no more, nor other, then iustifiable truth. What hath beene obiected already, I must breefly answer. It is excepted, that I am too mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:527:4"/>
in describing some vices. Indeed, such is their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous nature, that their best <hi>conuiction</hi> is <hi>derision;</hi> yet I abominate any pleasantnesse heere, but <hi>Christian;</hi> and would prouoke no smile but of <hi>Disdaine:</hi> wherein the <hi>grauitie</hi> of matter, shall free my forme of words from <hi>lightnesse.</hi> Others say, I am other-where too <hi>Satyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally-bitter.</hi> It is partly confest: I am bitter enough to the <hi>sins,</hi> and therein (I thinke) <hi>better</hi> to the <hi>sinners,</hi> more charitable to the persons. Some wish I would haue spared the <hi>Church-theeues,</hi> because it is not yet gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally granted, that <hi>Impropriations</hi> of Tythes, are <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations</hi> of wrongs; but if there bee a competent maintenance to the <hi>Minister,</hi> and not to him neither, except of worthy gifts, (prouided, that they iudge of his <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>competencie)</hi> it is enough: well, if any such be greeued, let him allow his <hi>Minister</hi> a <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> vnder which he cannot liue, without want to his family, or disgrace to his profession (at least, so taken.) and heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of certified, I will take counsell to draw the bookes, and put his name out of the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Theeues:</hi> But it would be strange if any of these <hi>Ziba's</hi> should yeeld to <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> a diuision of his owne <hi>lands</hi> or goods; when they doe, I will say, <hi>Dauid</hi> is come againe to his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> or rather, the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>Dauid</hi> is come to <hi>Iudgement.</hi> Others would haue <hi>Inclosers</hi> put out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (commonly) great men, but therefore the greater their finnes, and deseruing the greater taxation. Nay some would perswade <hi>Vsury</hi> to steppe in, to trauerse his <hi>Inditement,</hi> and prooue himselfe no <hi>Theefe,</hi> by the verdict of the Countrie; because <hi>Sub Iudice lis est,</hi> it is not yet decided, that <hi>Vsury</hi> is a Sinne. It is <hi>Sub Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> indeed, but the Iudge hath already interposed his

               <hi>Interlocutory,</hi> and will one day giue his <hi>Definitiue Sentence,</hi> that <hi>Vsurie</hi> shall neuer dwell in his <hi>holy Mountaine.</hi> Others blunder in their verdict, that I haue too violently baited the <hi>Bagge</hi> at the stake of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch,</hi> and all because I want it: I will not returne their censure, that they are hence knowen to haue it, that speake against me, for speaking against it: who yet, if they would light the candle of their <hi>Speech,</hi> at the fire of their <hi>Vnderstandings,</hi> would easily see and say, that it is not the <hi>fulnesse</hi> of the <hi>Bagge,</hi> but the <hi>fowlenesse</hi> of the <hi>Bagge-bearer,</hi> that I reprooue: I could allow your purses fuller of <hi>wealthinesse,</hi> so your mindes were emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier of <hi>wickednesse:</hi> but the <hi>Bagges</hi> effects, in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, vsually load vs, either with <hi>parcimony</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digallity;</hi> the lightest of which burdens, saith <hi>Saint Bernard,</hi> is able to sincke a <hi>Shippe.</hi> Others affirme, that I haue made the Gate of <hi>Heauen</hi> too narrow, and they hope to finde it wider; <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are more mercifull. True it is, that Heauen-Gate is in it selfe wide enough; and the narrownesse is in respect of the <hi>Enterer:</hi> and though thy sins cannot make that too little to receiue thee, yet they make thee to grosse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, to get into that: thus the <hi>Straitenesse</hi> ariseth from the deficiency, (not of their <hi>Glory,</hi> but) of our <hi>Grace.</hi> Lastly, some haue the <hi>Title</hi> sticking in their stomacks; as if <hi>Christ</hi> him selfe had not called <hi>Iudas</hi> a <hi>Deuill;</hi> and likened an <hi>Hypocrite</hi> to a <hi>Whited Sepulcher:</hi> as if <hi>Luther</hi> did not giue <hi>Iudas</hi> this very <hi>Attribute;</hi> and other <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> from whom <hi>Luther</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riues it.

            <p>In Iudas censure of <hi>Mary,</hi> many things are obseruable, to his shame, our instruction; and these. 1. some more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. 2. some more speciall and personall; all worthy your attention, if there wanted nothing in the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obserue that Saint Iohn laies this fault on Iudas <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Generally.</hi> Matt. 26. 8. Mark. 14. 4.</note> only: but Saint Mathew and Marke charge the Disciples with it, and finde them guilty of this repining: and that (in both, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) not without <hi>Indignation.</hi> This knot is easily vntied; Iudas was the ring-leader, and his voice was the voice of Iacob, all charitable; but his hands were the hands of Esau, rough and iniurious: Iudas pleades, for the poore, the whole <hi>Synode,</hi> likes the motion well; they second it with their verdits: their words agree; but their spirits differ: Iudas hath a further reach; to distill this ointment thorow the Limbecke of hypocrisie into his owne purse; the Apostles meane plainly: Iudas was malicious against his master; they simply thought the poore had more neede. So sensible and ample a difference doe circumstances put into one and the same action: pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:527:7"/>
or weaknesse, knowledge or ignorance, simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or craft doe much aggrauate or mitigate an offence. The Apostles consent to the circumstance, not to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, setting as it were) their hands to a blancke paper: it was in them pitty, rather then piety, in Iudas neither pitty nor piety, but plaine perfidie, an exorbitant and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent sinne, that would haue brought innocence it selfe into the same condemnation: thus the aggregation of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, is the aggrauation of offences. Consider his couetise, fraud, malice, hypocrisie, and you will say, his sinne was monstrous; <hi>sine modo,</hi> like a Mathematicall line, <hi>(diuisibilis in semper diuisibilia)</hi> infinitely diuisible. The other Apostles receiue the infection, but not into so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted stomackes, therefore it may make them sicke, not kill them: sinne they doe, but not vnto death. It is a true rule euen in good workes: <hi>finibus non officijs, discernendae sunt virtutes a vitijs:</hi> vertues are discerned from vices not by their offices, but by their ends or intents: neither the outward forme, no nor (often) the euent, is a sure rule to measure the action by: the eleuen Tribes went twice by Gods speciall word and warrant against the <hi>Beniamites,</hi> yet in both assaults receaued the ouerthrow. <hi>Cùm Pater</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aug.</note> 
               <hi>filium, Christus corpus, Iudas Dominum, res eadem, non causa, non intentio operantis:</hi> when God gaue his sonne, Christ gaue himselfe, Iudas gaue his Master; here was the same worke, not the same cause nor intention in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: the same rule holds proportion in offences: heere they all sinne, the Apostles in the imprudence of their censure, Iudas in the impudence of his rancour. <note place="margin">Iohn. 8, 7.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I might heer first lead you into the distinction of sinnes, secondly, or trauerse the Inditement with Iudas, whereby he accuseth Mary, iustifying her action conuincing his slander. thirdly, or discouer to you the fowlnesse of rash iudgement, which often sets a rankling tooth into vertues side; often cals chastitie her selfe an harlot, and with a guiltie hand throwes the first stone at Innocence.</p>
            <p>But that which I fasten on, is the power and force of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:527:7"/>
Iudas with a false weight sets all the wheeles of their tongues a going: the steward hath begun a health to the poore, and they begin to pledge him round. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity shewes it selfe in this, to beget a likenesse of maners: <hi>Tutum èst peccare autoribus illis:</hi> It is safe sinning after such authours: if the Steward say the word, the <hi>fiat</hi> of consent goes round. <hi>Imperio maximus, exemplo maior</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">A great man is not powerfull in his praesiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as in his prae cedency.</note>. He that is greatest in his gouernment, is yet greater in his prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. A great mans liuery is countenance enough, to keep drunkennesse from the stockes, whoredome from the post, murder and stealth from the gallowes: such double sinners shall not escape with single iudgements: such le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous and contagious spirits, shall answer to the iustice of God, not only for their own sins, but for all theirs, whom the pattern of their precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy hath induced to the like, to the like, said I? nay, to worse: for if the master drink <hi>(ad ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> to fulnesse, the seruant will <hi>(ad ebrietate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> to mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: the imitation of good comes for the most part short of the patterne, but the imitation of ill exceeds the example: a great mans warrant is like a charm or spel, to keep quick and stirring spirits within the circle of combined mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe: a <hi>Superiors</hi> example is like strong or strange phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, that euer workes the seruile patients to a likenesse of humours, of affections: thus when the mother is an <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 15.</note>

It was a custome for yong gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Athens to play on Recorders: at last Alcibiades seeing his blowne cheekes in a glasse, threw away his pipe, and they all followed him: our gallants in steed of Recorders imbrace scorching lust, staring pride, stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring drunkennes, till their soules are more blowne, than those Athenians cheekes; I would some <hi>Alcibiades</hi> would begin to throw away these vanities, and all the rest would follow him. Thus spreads example, like a stone throwne into a pond, that makes circle to beget circle, till it spread to the bankes. Iudas traine soone tooke fire in the suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctlesse Disciples; and Satans infections shoot through some great starre, the influence of damnation into the aire of the communaltie. Let the experience heereof make vs fearefull of examples.</p>
            <p>Obserue, that no society hath the priuiledge to bee free from a Iudas: no, not Christ colledge it selfe: <hi>I haue chosen you twelue, and behold one of you is a Diuell:</hi> and this no wors man than the Steward, put in trust with the bread of the prophets.

Thus generally.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Obserue: Iudas is bold to reproue a lawfull, lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">Specially.</note> allowable worke: <hi>he said this.</hi> I doe not read him so peremptorie in oportunity, hee could swallow a gudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though he keckes at a slie: hee could obserue, obey, flatter the compounding Pharisies, &amp; thought, he should get more by licking, than by biting; but heere because his mouth waters at the money, his teeth rankle the womans credit: for so I finde malignant reprouers stiled: <hi>corrodunt, non corrigunt; correptores, immo corruptores:</hi> they doe not mend but make worse; they bite, they gnaw: thus was Diogenes sirnamed <hi>Cynicke</hi> for his snarling; <hi>Conuitiorum canis:</hi> the dog of reproches: such forget that <hi>(monendo plus, quàm minando possumus)</hi> mercies are aboue menaces: many of the Iewes, whom the thunders of <hi>Sinai,</hi> terrours of the Law <note n="*" place="margin">Humanas mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura tonitrua mentes.</note> moued not, Iohn Baptist wins with the songs of Sion Iudas could faine and sawne, and fanne the coole winde of flatterie on the burning malice of the consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Scribes: heere he is hoat, sweats and swels without cause: either he must be vnmercifull or ouermercifull; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wholly for the raines, or all vpon the spurre: he hath soft and silken words for his masters enemies, course and rough for his friends: there hee is a dumbe dog and findes

no fault, heere he is a barking curre, and bites a true man in stead of a theefe; he was before an ill mute, and now he is a worse consonant. but (as <hi>Pierius</hi> ambitious daughters <note place="margin">Metam.</note> were turned to meg-pies for correcting the muses, so) God iustly reprooues Iudas, for vniustly reproouing Marie. <hi>Qui mittit in altum lapidem, recidet in caput eius.</hi> A stone <note place="margin">Iero. ad Rust. monath.</note> throwne vp in a rash humour, fals on the throwers head, to teach him more wisdome: hee that could come to the Pharisies (like Martials parrat, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I could heere finde cause to praise reprehension: if it be reasonable, seasonable, well grounded for the reproouer, well conditioned for the reprooued. I would haue no profession more wisely bold than a Ministers; for sinne is bold, yea sawcie and presumptuous: it is miserable for both, when a bold sinner, and a cold Priest shall meet: when he that should lift vp his voice like a trumpet, doth but whisper through a trunke. Many men are dull beasts without a goad, blinde Sodomites without a guide, deafe Adders and Idols without eares, forgetfull like Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs Butler without memories: our conniuence is sinfull, our silence banefull, our allowance damnable. Of sinne neither the fathers, factors, nor fautors are excusable: nay <note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 1. 32.</note> the last may be worst, whiles they may and will not helpe it. Let Rome haue the praise without our enuie or riualrie: <hi>Peccat is Roma patrocinium est.</hi> Sodomie is licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, sinnes to come pardoned, drunkennesse defended, the Stewes maintained, periury commended, treason commanded: as sinfull as they thinke vs, and we know ourselues, we would blush at these. <hi>Nihil interest sceleri</hi>

               <hi>an faue as, an illud facias:</hi> there is little difference betweene permission and commission: betweene the toleration and perpetration of the sinne: he is an abettor of the euill, that may and will not better the euill. <hi>Amici vitia, fi feras, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis tua,</hi> thy vnchristian sufferance adoptes thy brothers
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:527:9"/>
sinnes for thine owne; children of thy fatherhood, of so great a parentage is many a sinne-fauouring Magistrate; he begets moe bastards in an houre, then Hercules did in a night; and except Christ be his friend, Gods Sessions will charge him, with the keeping of them all: no priuate man can plead exemption from this duty: for <hi>amicus</hi> is <hi>animi custos;</hi> he is thy friend, that brings thee to a faire and free end. Doth humane charity binde thee to reduce thy neighbours straying beast, and shall not Christianity double thy care to his erring soule? <hi>cadit afina, &amp; est qui subleuet, perit anima, non est qui recogitet.</hi> The fallen beast is lifted vp, the burdened soule is let sinke vnder her load.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Obserue his deuillish disposition, bent and intended to stifle goodnesse in others, that had vtterly choakt it in himselfe? Is the Apostle Iudas an hinderer of godlinesse? surely man hath not a worse neighbour, nor God a worse seruant, nor the Diuell a better factor, than such a one: an Aesops dogge, that because he can eat no hay himselfe, lies in the manger and will not suffer the horse. he would be an ill porter of heauen gates, that hauing no lust to enter himselfe, will not admit others: as Christ <note n="a" place="margin">Luk. 11. 52.</note> reported and reproued the Lawyers. Heere fruitlesse trees, that <note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 13. 7.</note> cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ground: cockle and darnell that hinder the good cornes growth: malicious deuils, that plot to bring more partners to their owne damnation: as if it were, <hi>(aliquid socios habuisse doloris)</hi> some ease to them, to haue fellowes in their misery.</p>
            <p>Let me paint out a short complaint against this sinne: <hi>dolendum à medico, quod non delendum à medicina:</hi> we may bewaile, where we cannot preuaile. The good old man must weepe, though hee cannot driue away the disease of his childe with teares. Thou that hindrest others from good workes, makest their sinnes thine, which, I thinke thou needest not do, for any scarsity of thine owne: whiles thou temptest to villany, withstandest his piety, thou at once pullest his sinnes, and Gods curses on thee. For the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:527:10"/>
author sinnes more, than the actor, as appeares by Gods Iudgement in <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 3. 14. &amp;c.</note> Paradice; where three punishments were inflicted on the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as the originall plotter; two on the <hi>woman</hi> as the mediate procurer, and but one on <hi>Adam,</hi> as the party seduced. Is it not enough for thee, oh Iudas, to be a villaine thy selfe, but thou must also crosse the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of others? hast thou spoiled thy selfe, and wouldst thou also marre Mary?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Nay obserue; he would hinder the workes of piety thorow colour of the workes of charity: diuerting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries bounty from Christ to the poore; as if respect to man, should take the wall of Gods seruice? thus he striues to set the two tables of the Law, at warre, one against the other; both which looke to Gods obedience as the <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 25. 20.</note> two cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins to the mercie-seat; and the Catholike Christian hath a Catholike care. I preferre not the lawes of God one to the other: <hi>one starre,</hi> heere, <hi>differs not from another starre in glory.</hi> Yet, I know, the best distinguishers caution to the Lawyer: <note n="b" place="margin">Matth. 22. 38.</note> 
               <hi>this is the great Commandement, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is</hi> (but) <hi>like vnto it.</hi> Indeed I would not haue <hi>Sacrifice</hi> turne <hi>Mercy</hi> out of dores, as <hi>Sara</hi> did <hi>Agar;</hi> nor the fire of zeale drinke vp the dew and moisture of charity; as the fire from heauen dried vp the water at <note n="c" place="margin">King. 18. 38.</note> Eliahs sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: neither would I that the precise obseruation of the second table, should guild ouer the monstrous breaches of the first. Yet I haue heard Diuines (reasoning this point) attribute this priuiledge to the first Table aboue the second; that God neuer did (I will not say, neuer could) dispense with these commandements which haue himselfe for their proper and immediate obiect. For then (say they) he should dispense against himselfe, or make himselfe no God, or more: Hee neuer gaue allowance to any, to haue. 1. another God. 2. another forme of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. 3. <hi>the honour of his name hee will not giue to another.</hi> 4. nor suffer the prophaner of his <hi>Holy-day</hi> to escape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished.

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer must be cared for by the compassion of the hart, and charity of the purse: Gods poore must haue good almes; a seasonable releefe according to thy power; or els the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle fearfully and peremptorily concludes against thee: <note n="a" place="margin">1.

               <hi>the loue of God is not in thee.</hi> If thou canst not finde in thy hart to diminish a graine from thy heape, a peny from thy purse, a cut from thy loafe, when <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> stands at thy doore and calles for it, professe what thou wilt, the loue of earth hath thrust the loue of heauen out of thy conscience. euen Iudas himselfe will pretend charitie to these.</p>

For the other poore, who haue pulled necessity on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with the cords of Idlenesse, riot, or such disordered courses, there is another care to bee taken; not to cherish the lazie blood in their vaines by abusiue mercy; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chafe their stonied sinews by correction, relieue them with punishment, and so recouer them to the life of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. <hi>The sluggard lusteth,</hi> and hath an empty stomach: he loues sustenance well, but is loth to set his foot on the cold ground for it.

I haue read of the King of Macedon, deserying two such in his dominions, that <hi>(alterum è Macedonia fugere, alterum fugare fecit.)</hi> hee made one flie out of his kingdome, and the other driue him. I would our Magistrates would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no worse a precedent: indeed our lawes haue taken order for their restraint; wheresoeuer the fault is, they are rather multiplied; as if they had beene sowen at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the statute, and now (as from a haruest) they arise ten for one: surely our lawes make good willes, but they haue bad lucke for executors: their willes are not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; nor their legacies distributed; I meane the legacies of correction to such children of slouth, <hi>Impunitas delicti inuit at homines ad malignandum:</hi> Since chiefe incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the want of punishment: fauour one, harten ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. It is fit therefore, that <hi>(poena ad paucos, met us ad omnes perueniat)</hi> penaltie be inflicted on some, to strike terrour into the rest.</p>
            <p>It was Saint Augustines censure: <hi>Illicit a non prohibere, consensus erroris est,</hi> not to restraine euill, is to maintaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. <note place="margin">Epist 182. ad Bonif.</note> The common wealth is an Instrument, the people are the strings, the magistrate is the musitian: let the musitian

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Of all bodily creatures, man (as he is Gods image) is the best: but basely deiected, degenerated, debauched, the (simply) worst: of all earthly creatures a wicked man is the worst, of all men a wicked Christian, of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans a wicked professour, of all professours a wicked hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, of all hypocrites a wicked, warped, wretched Iudas.

men, and you haue a Iudas: this then is Iudas a man degenerate, a Christian corrupted, a professor putrified, a guilded hypocrite, a white-skind Deuill. I confesse I am sparingly affected to this point, and would faine shift my hands of this monster, and not incounter him: for it is not to fight with the <hi>Unicornes of Assyria,</hi> nor <hi>the Bulles of Samaria,</hi> nor <hi>the Beasts of Ephesus:</hi> neither absolute Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ists, nor dissolute Christians, nor resolute ruffians: the hornes of whose rapine and malice are no lesse manifest, than malignant; but at once imminent in their threats, and eminent in their appearance. But to set vpon a Beast, that hath with the hart of a Leopard, the face of a man, of a good man, of the best man; a starre placed high in the orbe of the Church, though swooped downe with the Dragons taile, because not fixed; a darling in the mothers lappe, blessed with the Churches indulgence, yet a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard: a brother of the fraternity, trusted sometimes with the Churches stocke, yet no brother, but a broker of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, a brocher of falshoods: I would willingly saue this labour, but that the necessity of my Text ouer-rules my disposition.</p>
            <p>I know, these times are so shamelesse and impudent, that many strip of the <hi>white,</hi> and keepe the <hi>Deuill;</hi> wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked they are, and without shew of the contrary: men are so farre from giuing house-roome to the substance of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that they admit not an out-roome for the shew; so backward to put on Christ, that they will not accept of his liuerie; who are short of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> scarce <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 26. 28.</note> 
               <hi>perswaded to seeme Christians,</hi> not at all to be: these will not drinke har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty draughts of the waters of life, nay scarce vouchsafe (like the dogges that runne by <hi>Nilus)</hi> to giue a lappe at <hi>Iacobs well:</hi> vnlesse it be some, as they report, that frequent the signe of it, to bee drunke: they salute not Christ at the Crosse, nor bid him good morrow in the Temple, but go blustring by, as if some serious businesse had put haste in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their feet, and God was not worthy to be staid &amp; spoke withall: if this be a riddle, shew me the day, shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

For these I may say, I would to God, they would seeme holy, and frequent the places, where sanctimony is taught, but the Deuill is a nimble, running, cunning fencer, that strikes on both hands, <hi>duplici ictu,</hi> and would haue men either <hi>(non sanctos, aut non parùm sanctos)</hi> not holy, or not a little holy, in their owne opinion, and outward ostentation: either no fire of deuotion on the harth, or that that is, in the top of the chimney: That subtle <hi>winnower</hi> perswades men, that they are all chaffe, and no wheat, or all wheat and no chaffe; and would keepe the soule either lanke with ignorance, or ranke with insolence: let me therefore woo you, win you to reiect both these extremes, betweene which, your harts lie, as the graine betwixt both the milstones.</p>
            <p>Shall I speake plainly? You are sicke at London of one disease (I speake to you setled Citizens, not extrauagants) and we in the Country of another: a Sermon against hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie in most places of the Country, is like phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to a consumption (the spilling of innocent blood) our sicknesses are cold palseys and shaking agues: yours in the City are hotter diseases, the burning feuers of fierie zeale, the inflammations and impostumes of hypocrisie: we haue the frosts, and you haue the lightnings; most of vs professe too little, and some of you professe too much, vnlesse your courses were more answerable; I would willingly be in none of your bosomes; only I must speake of Iudas.

            <p n="1">1. He might haue beene sound: I make no question but he heard his Master preach, and preached himselfe, that Gods request is the hart: so Christ schooles the <note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane woman; so prescribed the <hi>Scribe.</hi>

thy master, thy friend, thy God denounce many a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, fatall, finall woe against the Pharisies; <hi>(hac appellatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; ob hanc caussam)</hi> vnder this title, and for this cause) hypocrites, and because hypocrites. As if his woes were but words, and his words winde, empty and aiéry mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without intention of hurt, or extention of a reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full arme, behold thou art an hypocrite: thou art therfore the worse, because thou mightest be better.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He seemed sound: <hi>(spem vnltu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem; nay dolum</hi> rather) craft rather than griefe, vnlesse he grieued, that out of his cunning, there was so little comming, small prize or booty: yet like a subtle gamester, he keepes his countenance, though the dice doe not fauour him. And as <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> told <hi>Scipio</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring <note place="margin">Liu. annal. li. 13</note> for <hi>Africa</hi> concerning <hi>Syphax: Fraus fidem in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis sibi perstruit, vt cum operaepretium sit, cum magna merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de fallat.</hi> Iudas creepes into trust by iustice in trifles, that he might more securely cheat for a fit aduantage. Without pretence of fidelity how got he the stewardship? perhaps if need required, he spared not his owne purse in Christs seruice; but he meant to put it to vsurie: hee carried not the purse, but to pay himselfe for his paines: thus <hi>iactura in loco, res quaestuosissima:)</hi> a seasonable dammage is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable vantage: in this then his vilenesse is more execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he seemed good.</p>
            <p>If it were possible, the Diuell was then worse than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, when he came in <hi>Samuels</hi> mantle. <hi>Iesabels</hi> paint made her more vglie: if euer you take a foxe in a lambes skin, hang him vp, for he is the worst of the generation: a <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonite</hi> in his old shooes, a <hi>Seminary</hi> in his hairecloth, a Ruffian in the robes of a <hi>Iacobine,</hi> flie like the plague: these are so much the worse Deuils, as they would bee holie Deuils: true Traitors that would fight against God with his owne weapons; and by being out of crie religious, runne themselues out of breath to doe the Church a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He would seeme thus to his master; yet knew in

               <hi>miraculum inauditum,</hi> a wonder of wonders: and shall Iudas thinke to put out his eye, that gaue them all eyes? oh incredible, insensible, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ignorance!</p>
            <p>You see his hypocrisie: me thinkes euen the sight of it is disswasion forcible enough, and it should be needlesse to giue any other reason than the discouerie. yet whiles ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny censure it in Iudas, they condemne it not in themselues, and either thinke they haue it not, or not in such measure. Surely we may be no Iudasses, yet hypocrites: and who will totally cleare himselfe? let me tell thee, if thou doest, thou art the worst hypocrite, and but for thee, we had not such need to complaine. He that cleares himselfe from all sinne, is the most sinner, and he that sayes, he hath not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hypocrisie, is the rankest hypocrite: but I do admit a distinction. All the sonnes of Adam are infected with this contamination, some more, some lesse, heres the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; all haue hypocrisie, but hypocrisie hath some: <hi>aliud habere peccatum, aliud haberi à peccato.</hi> It is one thing for thee to possesse sinne, another thing for sinne to possesse thee. All haue the same corruption, not the same eruption: in a word, all are not hypocrites, yet who hath not sinned in hypocrisie? Doe not then send your eyes like <hi>Dinahs</hi> gadding abroad, forgetting your owne busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse at home: strain not curtesie with these banquets, and hauing good meat carued thee, lay it liberally vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans trencher, be not sicke of this plague and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, or call it by another name: hypocrisie is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,

whatsoeuer you call it: and as it hath learned to leaue no sins naked, so I hope, it hath not forgot to clothe it selfe: it hath as many names as <hi>Garnet</hi> had, and more <hi>Protean</hi> shapes than the <hi>Seminaries:</hi> the <hi>white Deuill</hi> is in this a true Deuill; <hi>multorum nominum, non boni nominis:</hi> of many names, but neuer a good one.

            <p n="1">1. It is the worst of sinnes, because it keepes all sinnes: they are made sure and secure by hypocrisie.

It is made a stawking horse for couetousnesse, vnder long praiers many a Pharisie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours the poore, houses, goods and all.

It is a sepulchre of rotten impostures, which would stinke like a putrified corps, if hypocrisie were not their couer. It is a maske for treason, whose shop-full of poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, pistols, daggers, gunpowder-traines, would easilie be spied out, had hypocrisie left them bare-faced. Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery vnder this visard thrusts into Court-reuels, nay, Court-councels; and holds the torch to sports, nay the bookes to serious consultations; deuiseth, aduiseth, plots with those that prouide best for the Common-wealth, Thus are all sinnes beholding to hypocrisie: shee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines them at her owne proper costs and charges.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the worst of sinnes, because it counterfets all vertues: he that counterfets the Kings coine, is liable to death, if hypocrisie find not death, and <hi>(mortem sine mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te)</hi> death without death, for counterfeting the king of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens Seale manuall of grace, it speeds better then it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: <hi>vice</hi> is made <hi>vertues</hi> ape in an hypocrites practise. If he see <hi>Chusi</hi> runne, this <hi>Ahimaaz</hi> will outrunne him: he mends his pace, but not his path: the goodman goes slower, but will be at heauen before him: thus thriftinesse

in a Saint, is counterfetted by niggardlinesse in an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite. be thou charitable, behold he is bountifull, but not except thou may behold him: his vaineglorious pride shall emulate thy liberalitie: thou art good to the poore, he wil be better to the rich: he followes the religious man a farre of, as <hi>Peter</hi> did <hi>Christ,</hi> but when he comes to the crosse, hee will deny him. Thus hypocrisie can but put blood into your cheekes, (like the <hi>Aliptae)</hi> and better your colours; but you may be sicke in your consciences, and almost dead at the heart, and <hi>(non est medicamen in hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis)</hi> there is no medicine in this drugsters shop can cure you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. An hypocrite is a kind of honest Atheist: for his owne <hi>Good</hi> is his <hi>God:</hi> his heauen is vpon earth, and that not the <note n="a" place="margin">Philip. 4. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Peace of his conscience,</hi> or <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 14. 17.</note> 
               <hi>that kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which may be in a soule liuing on earth,</hi> but the secure peace of a worldly estate: he stands in awe of no Iudge, but mans eye; that he obserues with as great respect, as <hi>Dauid did the eyes of God;</hi> if man takes notice, hee cares not, yet laughes at him for that notice, and kills his soule by that laughter: so <hi>Pigmalion-</hi>like, he dotes on his owne carued and painted peece: and perhaps dies <hi>Zeuxis</hi> death, who painting an old woman, and looking merrily on her, brake out into a laughter that killed him. if the world doth not praise his doings, he is ready to challenge it, as the Iewes God, <note n="c" place="margin">Esay 58. 3.</note> 
               <hi>wherefore haue we fasted, and thou seest it not?</hi> hee crosseth Christs precept: the <note n="d" place="margin">Matth. 6. 3.</note> left hand must bee priuy to the right hands charitie, he dares not trust God with a pennie, except before a whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of witnesses, lest perhaps, God should denie the receit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An hypocrite (at last) is hated of all, both God and man: the world hates thee, Iudas, because thou retainest to Christ, Christ hates thee more because thou (but) only retainest, and doest no faithfull seruice. The world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide thee, thou hypocrite, because thou professest godlinesse; God can worse abide thee, because thou doest
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:527:20"/>
no more than professe. It had been yet some pollicie, on the losse of the worlds fauour to keepe Gods; or if lost Gods, to haue (yet) kept in with the world: thou art not thy owne friend, to make them both thy enemies: mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, destitute of both refuges, shut out both from Gods and the worlds dores. Neither God nor the Deuill loues thee, thou hast been true to none of them both, and yet most false (of all) to thy selfe. So (this <hi>white Deuill) Iudas,</hi> that for the Pharisies sake betrayed his master, and for the Deuils sake betrayed himselfe, was in the end reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of Pharisies and master; and like a ball, tost by the rackets of <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>shame,</hi> bandyed from the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies to Christ, from Christ to the Pharisies, from wall to wall, till he fell into the Deuils hazard; not resting like a stone, till he came to his center, <gap reason="foreign">

This is the hypocrites miserie; because he weares Gods liuerie, the world will not be his mother; because his heart, habit, seruice is sin-wedded, God will not be his father: he hath lost earth for heauens sake, and heauen for earths sake; and may complaine with <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caes</hi> feare of hir two sonnes; <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 27. 45.</note>

both read and heard of some, that haue with broken hearts, and mourning bowels, sorrowed for themselues, as if they had been reprobates; and not spared so to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime themselues, when yet their estate was good to god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, though they knew it not: perhaps their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and ill life hath been grieuous, but their repentance gratious: I may call these <hi>blacke Saints.</hi> The hypocrite is neat and curious in his religious out-side, but the linings of his conscience are <note n="a" place="margin">Esay 64 6.</note> 
               <hi>filthy and polluted rags:</hi> then I say still, a <hi>blacke Saint</hi> is better than a <hi>white Deuill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5 Hypocrisie is like the Deuill, for he is a perfect hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite: so he begun with our first Parents, to put out his apparant hornes in Paradise: <hi>non moriemini, yee shall not</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>die:</hi> yet he knew this would kill them. An hypocrite then is the child of the Deuill, and (quoth <hi>Time</hi> the midwife) as like the father, as it may possibly looke, he is the <note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> 
               <hi>father of lies;</hi> and there is no lier like the hypocrite, for as <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Ananias,</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>thou hast not lied to men, but to God.</hi> Nay, the hypocrite is his eldest sonne. Now, the priuiledge of primogeniture by the law, was to haue a <note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 21. 17. 2. Chron. 21. 3</note>

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is called a <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 16. 11. &amp; Ephes. 2. 2.</note> Prince, and thus stands his monarchie, or rather Anarchie.

Of all these the hypocrite is his eldest Sonne.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Lastly, an hypocrite is in greatest difficultie to bee cured. Why should the minister administer physicke to him, that is perfectly sound? or why should Christ giue his bloud to the righteous? well may hee be hurt and swell, swell and rankle, rankle and fester, fester and die, <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 12. 13.</note> that will not bewray his disease, least he betray his credit.

with a great deale of the Deuils businesse; yet not more than the Pope. Iudas pretended the poore and robbed them: and doth not the Pope thinke you? Are there no almes-boxes rifled and emptied into the Popes Treasurie? Our Fathers say that the poore gaue Peter-pence to the Pope, but our grandfathers cannot tell vs, that the Pope gaue Caesar-pence to the poore: did not he sat in the holy chaire, (as Augustus Caesar in his imperiall throne) and cause the whole Christian world to be <hi>taxed:</hi> and what? <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 1.</note> did they freely giue it? no, a taxation forced it; what right then had the Pope to it? iust as much as Iudas had to his masters money? was he not then a thiefe? yet, what need a rich man be a thiefe? the Pope is rich, and needs must, for his commings in be great: he hath rent out of heauen, rent out of hell, rent out of purgatory: but more sackes come to his mill out of purgatory, than out of hell and heauen too; and for his toling, let the world iudge: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore saith Bishop Iewel, <hi>he would be content to loose hell and heauen too, to saue his purgatorie.</hi> Some by pardons hee preuents from hell: some by Indulgences hee lifts vp to heauen; and infinit by merits he ransomes from purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: not a iot without money; <hi>cruces, altaria, Christum:</hi> he selles Christs crosse, Christs blood, Christs selfe; all for money. Nay, he hath rent from the very Stewes a hell aboue ground, and swels his coffers by the sinnes of the people: hee suffers a price to bee set on damnation; and maintaines lust to goe to Law for her owne; giues whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a toleration vnder his seale; that <hi>Lust</hi> the sonne of <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> hath free accesse to <hi>Liberty</hi> the daughter of <hi>Pride.</hi>

            <p>Iudas was a great Statesman in the Diuels Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; for he bore fowre maine offices: either hee beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them shamefully, or he bought them bribingly, or else <hi>Beelsebub</hi> saw desert in him, and gaue him them <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> for his good parts; for Iudas was his white boy. hee was 1. an hypocrite. 2. a thiefe. 3. a traitour. 4. a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. Yet the Pope shall vie offices with him, and win
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:527:25"/>
the game too for plurality. The Pope sits in the holy chaire, yet a Deuill: periury, Sodomie, sorcerie, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, parricide, patricide, treason, murder, &amp;c. are many and essentiall things to the Pope. He is not content to bee <hi>Steward,</hi> but he must be <hi>Uicar,</hi> nay indeed, Lord himselfe: for what can Christ doe, and the Pope cannot doe? Iudas was no body to him. He hath stolne <hi>Truths</hi> garment, and put it on <hi>Errors</hi> backe, turning poore <hi>Truth</hi> naked out of doores. he hath altered the primitiue institutions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterated Gods sacred lawes; maintaining <hi>vagas libidines:</hi> he steales the harts of subiects from their Soueraignes, by stealing fidellity from the harts of Subiects: and would steale the crowne from the kings head, and all vnder the shadow of religion. This is a thiefe; a notable, a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous theefe, but let him goe: I hope he is knowne well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough, and euery true man will blesse himselfe out of his way.</p>
            <p>I come to our selues: there are many kindes of priuate Theeues in both the houses of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Aaron: in foro &amp; choro,</hi> in Change and Chancell; Common-wealth and Church. I can tax no mans person; if I could, I would abhorre it, or were worthy to be abhorred: the <hi>Sinnes</hi> of our <hi>Times</hi> are the <hi>Theeues,</hi> I would arraigne, testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, condemned, haue executed, the persons I would haue saued <hi>in the day of the Lord Iesus.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. If there bee any magistrates (into whose mouthes God hath put the determination of doubts; and the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of right into their hands:) that suffer popularity, partiallity, passion to rule, ouer-rule their iudgements, these are priuate theeues: they rob the poore man of his iust cause, and equities reliefe, and no law can touch them for it: thus may causes goe, not according to right, but friendship: as <hi>Themistocles</hi> boy could say, <hi>As I will, the whole Senate will:</hi> for as I will, my mother will; as my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will, my father will; as my father will, the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate will. Thus as a groome of the chamber, a Secretary of the closet, or a porter of the gate will, the cause must

Who can indite this theefe? what law may passe on him? what Iurie can finde him? what Iudge can fine him? none on earth: there is a barre he shall not escape: if there bee any such, (as I trust there is not) they are theeues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If there be any Lawyer, that takes fees on both hands, one to speake, another to hold his peace: as (De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes answered his bragging fellow Lawyer) this is a theefe, though the law doth not call him so: a mercenarie tongue and a money-spel'd conscience, that vndertakes the defence of things knowen to his owne heart to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust, is onely proper to a theefe: a double theefe, he robs both sides: the adverse part in pleading against the truth, his owne client in drawing him on to his further dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.

3. If there be any officer, that walkes with vnwashen hands, I meane, with the fowle fingers of briberie, he is a theefe: be the matter penall or capitall, if a bribe can pick Iustices locke, and plead against the innocent, or for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe being nocent, and preuaile, this is theft. Theft? who is robbed? the giuer? doth not the freedome of his will transfer a right of the gift to the receiuer? no; for it is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie or willing will: but as a man giues his purse to the ouer-mastring theefe, rather than ventures his life; so this his bribe, rather than indanger his cause: shall I say, the theefe hath as much right to the purse, as the officer to the bribe; and they are both, though not equally palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet equally culpable theeues. Is the giuer innocent or nocent? innocent, and shall not innocence haue her right without a bribe? nocent; and shall gold conceale his fault, or cancell his punishment? Dost thou not know whether, and wilt thou blind thy selfe before hand with a bribe? for bribes are like dust throwen in the eies of Iustice, that she cannot without paine looke on the Sun-shine of truth. Though a second to thy selfe receiue them, wife or friend, by thy allowance, they are but stolne goods, coles of fire put in the roofe of thy house: <note n="a" place="margin">Iob 15. 34.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is <hi>theeuerie</hi> too among Tradesmen: and who would thinke it? many (they say) rob vs, but wee rob none: yes, but they thinke that <hi>(verba lactis</hi> will coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance <hi>frandom in factis)</hi> smooth words will smoother rough deeds. This web of theft is many waies wouen in a shop or a warehouse, but three especially.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By a false weight, and no true measure, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or content is not iustifiable by law; or the cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyances in weighing or metting, such as cheat the buyer: <note place="margin">Deut. 25. 13.</note> are not these pretty trickes to picke mens purses? the French word hath well exprest them: they are <hi>Lieger du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines.</hi> Now had I not as good loose my purse on <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie

plaine,</hi> as in <hi>London Exchange?</hi> is my losse the lesse, because violence forbeares and craft pickes my purse? <note place="margin">Prou. 11. 1.</note> The high-way theefe is not greater abomination to God, than the shop-theefe: and for man, the last is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: the other we knowingly flye; but this laughes vs in the face, whiles he robs vs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By insufficient wares, which yet with a darke win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and an impudent tongue, will appeare good to the buyers eye and eare too. Sophistrie is now fled from the schooles into shops: from disputation to merchandising: he is a silly tradesman, that cannot sophisticate his wares, as well as hee hath done his conscience; and weare his tongue with protestations, barer than trees in Autumne, the head of old age, or the liuings of Church-men. Oathes indeed smell too ranke of infidelitie; marry, we are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and protest away our soules: there is no other way to put off bad wares, and put vp good monies: are not these <hi>theeues?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. By playing or rather praying vpon mens necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: they must haue the commoditie, therfore set the dice on them: <hi>vox latronis:</hi> the advantage taken of a mans ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie is a tricke of a worse Deuill than Iudas: Thou shouldest rather be like <hi>Iob, a foot to lame necessitie,</hi> and not take away his crutch: or perhaps God hath put more <note place="margin">Iob 29. 15.</note> wit into thy braines, than his, thou seest further into the bargaine: and therefore takest opportunitie to abuse his plainnesse: thou seruest thy selfe in gaine, not him in loue: thou maiest, and laugh at the law; but there is a law, thou hast transgressed, that without Iesus Christ shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee to hell.</p>
            <p>Goe now, and applaud your selues, yee sons of fraud, that eagle-eyed scrupulositie cannot find you faultie, nor the Lyon-handed law touch you, please your selues in your securitie. You practise belike, behind the hangings, and come not on the publike stage of Iniurie: yet you are not free from spectators: <hi>testante Numine, homine, Daemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne:</hi> God, man, Angels, Deuils shall witnesse against you:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:527:27"/>
               <hi>ex cordibus, ex codicibus:</hi> by your hearts, by your bookes, God shall iudge you. Iniurie is often in the one, periurie in the other: the great Iustice wil not put it vp: they shal be convicted <hi>theeues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. There are theeues crope into the Church too; or rather they incroach on the Church; for Ministers cannot now play the theeues with their liuings, they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to steale: but there are secret Iudasses, can make shift to doe it. <hi>Difficilis magni custodia census.</hi> The Eagles flocke to a carcase, and theeues hanker about rich doores: at the dispersion of church-liuings, they cryed as the <hi>Babylonians, to the spoile, to the spoile.</hi> The Church was once rich, but it was <hi>(diebus illis)</hi> in the golden time: when honesty went in good clothes; and ostentation durst not giue religion the check-mate, now they plead pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, and proue them their owne by long possession. I doe not taxe all those for priuate theeues, that hold in their hands, lands and possessions, that were once the Churches; but those that withhold such as are due to Church-men. Their estates were once taken away by (more than) Gods (meere) sufferance, for a iust punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their idlenesse, Idolatry, lustes: sure there is some <hi>Achanisme</hi> in the campe of the <hi>Leuites,</hi> that makes this plague-sore to runne still: there is some disobedient and fugitiue <hi>Ionasses</hi> that thus totter our <hi>ship.</hi> I complaine not, that <hi>claustra</hi> are turned into <hi>castra;</hi> Abbeyes into Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens houses; places of monition, to places of munition: but that men rob <hi>(aram dominicam)</hi> Gods house, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <hi>(haram domesticam)</hi> their owne house, this is theft, and sacrilegious theft: a succession of theft; for the fingers of the sonnes are now heauyer than the loynes of their fathers: those were <hi>(improbi Papistae)</hi> wicked Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, and these are <hi>(improbirapistae)</hi> vngodly robbers. <note place="margin">B<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This is a monstrous theft, and so exceeding all thefts, as <hi>(non nisi in Deum fieri potest)</hi> it can bee committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst none but God. When <hi>Scipio</hi> robbed the temple of <note place="margin">Aug.</note>

               <hi>house is ioined to house</hi> so fast, Gods house to their owne, that the fire, which begins at the one consumes the other: as the Eagle, that stole a piece of meat from the Altar, carried a cole with it, that set her nest on fire.

In all your knowledge, think but on a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robbers heire, that euer thriued to the third generation: yet alas! horrour to my bones, and shame to my speech! there are not wanting among our selues, that giue encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to these theeues: and without question, many a man, so well otherwise disposed, would haue beene reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from this sinne, but for their distinctions of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencies: I appeale to their owne consciences, there is not an humorist liuing, that in hart thinkes so, or would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare their reproofe, were he not well prouided for.

            <p n="6">6. There is more store of theeues yet: couetous Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, that stretch their rents on the tenter-hookes of an euill conscience, and swell their coffers by vndoing their poore tenants: these sit close, and stare the law in the face, yet by their leaue they are theeues: I doe not denie the improoument of old rents, so it be done with old mindes, I meane, our forefathers charity: but with the Deuill, to set right vpon the pinacles, and pitch so high a price of

our lands, that it straines the Tenants hart-blood to reach it, is theft, and killing theft. What all their immoderate toile, broken sleepes, sore labours can get, with a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diet to themselues, not being able to spare a morsell of bread to others, is a pray to the Landlords rapine: this is to robbe their estates, grinde their faces, suck their bloods. These are theeues.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Ingrossers; that hoord vp commodities, and by stopping their propagation raise the price; these are theeues. Many Blocke-houses in the city, monopolies in the court, garners in the countrey, can testifie, there are now such theeues abroad: we complaine of a dearth; sure the heauens are too mercifull to vs, that are so vnmercifull one to another: scarsity comes without Gods sending: who brings it then? euen the Deuill and his brokers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grossing misers.

I confesse, this is a sinne, which the Law takes notice of, but not in the full nature, as theft. The picke-purse (in my opinion) doth not so much hurt, as this generall robber; for they robbe millions. These doe not with Ioseph, buie vp the superfluity of plenty, to preuent a dearth; but hoord vp the store of plenty, to procure a dearth. rebels to God, trespassers to nature, theeues to the Common-wealth: if these were apprehended and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, neither City nor Countrey should complaine as they doe, Meane time, the peoples curse is vpon them, and I doubt not but Gods plague will follow it; if repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">Prou. 11. 26.</note> turne it not away: till when, they are priuate theeues.</p>

Inclosers; that pretend a distinction of possessions, a preseruation of woods, indeed to make better and broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their owne territories, and to steale from the poore commons; these are horrible theeues. The poore mans beast is his maintenance, his sustenance, his life, to take food from his beast, is to take the beasts food from his
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:527:28"/>
bellie: so hee that incloseth Commons is a monstrous theefe, for he steales away the poore mans liuing and life; hence many a Cottager, nay perhaps Farmer, is faine (as the Indians doe to Deuils) to sacrifice to the lord of the soile, a yeerely bribe for a <hi>nenoceat.</hi> For though the law forbids such inclosures: yet <hi>(quod fieri non debet, factum valet)</hi> when they are once ditcht in, say the law what it will, I see no throwing out: force beares out, what fraud hath borne in: let them neuer open their mouths to plead the Common-wealths benefit: they intend it as much as Iudas did, when hee spake for the poore: no, they are theeues, the bane of the common good, the surfet of the land, the scourge of the poore: good only to themselues; and that in opinion only: for they doe it, <note n="a" place="margin">Esai. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>to dwell alone,</hi> and they dwell alone indeed: for neither God nor good Angell keeps them company: and for a good conscience, it cannot get thorow their quick-sets.

The dissolute wretch sits there securely, and buies his owne sicknesse, with great expence: which would preserue the health of his poore wife and children at home: that lamentably mone for bread, whiles he lauisheth all in drinke.

Drunkennesse makes so quicke riddance of the ale, that this raiseth the price of mault: and the good sale of mault, raiseth the price of barley: thus is the land distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the poores bread is dissolued into the drunkards cup. the markets are hoysed vp, if the poore cannot reach the price, the maultmaster wil, he can vtter it to the rap-house: and the tap-house is sure of her old friend drunkennesse. Thus theft sits close in a drinking roome, and robs all that saile into that coast. I confesse, they are (most of them) bound to suffer no drunkennesse in their houses, yet they secretly acknowledge, that if it were not for drunkennes, they might shut vp their doores, as vtterly vnable to pay their rents.

Be his maintainers courses neuer so fowle, either he furthers them, or he smothers them: sin hath not a more impudent bawd, nor his master a more impious theefe, nor the common-wealth a more sucking horseleach.

Indeed man had a poore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; we are the sonnes of <hi>Adam, Adam</hi> of dust, dust of deformity, deformity of nothing; yet made by God: but these are bred like monsters of the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and wicked maners; and carry the Deuils cognisance. for Breakers, such as necessity compels to it, I censure not: if they desire with all their harts to satisfie the vttermost farthing and cannot; God will then accept votall restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for totall restitution; that which is affected, for that which is effected: <hi>the will for the deed:</hi> and in those debt is not (as the vulgar speech is) deadly sinne: a sore it may be, no sinne. But they that with a purpose of deceit, get goods into their hands in trust, &amp; then without need hide their heads, are theeues: for the intent to steale in their mindes directed their iniurious hands. The Law arraigns them not, the Iudgement seat of God shall not acquite them. These steale more quickly and with security, than a high-way robbes all his life time and that in perpetuall danger: It is but passing their words, allowing a good price, conuaying home the wares, and on a sudden diue vnder the waters: a close concealement shall saue them fiue hundred pounds in a thousand. They liue vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sweat, fare richly vpon others meat, and the debter is often made a gentleman, when the creditour is made a beggar.</p>
            <p>Such false Gibeonites inrich Scriueners: their vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, hath banished all trust and fidellity. Time was, that <hi>Nouerint vniuersi</hi> was vnborne, the Lawyer himselfe knew not what an obligation meant. Security stood on no other legges, but promises, and those were so sound, that they neuer failed their burden: but <hi>Time</hi> adulterating with the <hi>Harlot Fraud,</hi> begot a brood of <hi>Nouerints:</hi> and but for these shackles, debt would often shew credit a light
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:527:30"/>
paire of heeles. Therefore now <hi>(plus creditur annulis, quàm animie)</hi> there is more faith giuen to mens seales, than to <note place="margin">Sen.</note> their soules. <hi>Owe nothing but loue;</hi> saith the Apostle: all <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 8.</note> owe this, but few pay it; or if they doe, it is in crackt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, not currant in Gods Exchequer: for our loue is dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, and our charity is (not cold, but) dead. But these bankrouts of both wealth and honesty, owe all things but loue, and more than euer they meane to pay, though you giue them time till Doomes-day. These are Theeues.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The twelfth and last sort of theeues (to make vp the iust dozen) are the vsurers. This is a priuat thiefe like Iudas, and for the bagge like Iudas, which he steales from Christ like Iudas, or rather from Christians, that haue more need, and therefore worse than Iudas. This is a man made out of waxe: his <hi>Pater-noster</hi> is a <hi>Pawne:</hi> his Creed is, The condition of this obligation: his religion is all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; a binding of others to himselfe; of himselfe to the Deuill: for looke how farre any of the former theeues haue ventured to hell, the vsurer goes a foot further by the standard. The Poet exclaimes against this sin:
<q>
                  <l>Hinc vsura vorax, auidum<expan>
                        <am>

                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> in tempore foenus &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Describing in that one line, the names and nature of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surie. <hi>Foenus, quasi foetus:</hi> It is a teeming thing, euer with child, pregnant, and multiplying: money is an vnfruitfull thing by nature made only for commutation: it is a <hi>praeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall</hi> thing, it should engender money: this is <hi>monstro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus partus,</hi> a prodigious birth. <hi>Usura, quasi propter vsum rei.</hi> The nature of it is wholly deuouring: their money to necessity is like cold water to a hot ague, that for a time refresheth, but prolongs the disease. The vsurer is like the worme we call the timber-worme; which is wonderfull <note place="margin">Teredo.</note> soft to touch, but hath teeth so hard, that it eats timber: but the vsurer eats timber and stones too. The Prophet hedgeth it in, betweene <hi>Bribery</hi> and <hi>Extortion:</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Ezek. 22. 12.</note> 
               <hi>In thee haue they taken gifts to shed blood: thou hast taken vsury and increase: and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:527:30"/>
extortion; and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord. Therefore I haue smitten my hands at thy dishonest gaine, &amp;c.</hi> You <note place="margin">vers. 13.</note> heare Gods opinion of it. Beware this dishonest gaine: take heed lest this casting your money into a <hi>Banke,</hi> cast not vp a <hi>Banke</hi> against you: when you haue found out the fairest praetexts for it, Gods iustice shall strike of all: <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>let no man deceiue you with vaine words: for, for such things Gods wrath will fall on the children of disobedience.</hi> Infinite colors, mitigations, euasions, distinctions are inuented, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on earth, heauen-exploded vsurie: God shall then frustrate all, when hee powres his wrath on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked conscience. God saith, <hi>Thou shalt not take vsurie:</hi> goe now, study paintings, excuses, apologies, dispute the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with God: hell fire shall decide the question. I haue no other trade to liue on, but vsurie: only the Deuill first made vsury a trade. But can this plea in the thiefe <hi>(I haue no other trade to liue on but stealing)</hi> protect and secure him from the gallowes?</p>
            <p>The vsurer then is a thiefe: nay a double thiefe, as the old Roman law censured them; that charged the thiefe with restitution double, the vsurer with foure-fold: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding him a double thiefe. Theeues steale sometimes, vsurers alwaies. Theeues steale for necessity, vsurers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out need. The vsurer wounds deeper with a peece of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, than the robber with a sword. many a yong gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, newly broke out of the cage of wardship, or blessed with the first Sun-shine of his one and twenty, goes from the vigilancy of a restraining Gouernour, into the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hands of a mercilesse vsurer, as if hee came out of Gods blessing into the warme Sunne. Many a man, that comes to his lands, ere he comes to his wits, or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their villany, is so let blood in his estate by vsury, that he neuer prooues his owne man againe.</p>
            <p>Either prodigallity or penury or dissembled riches bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row on vsurie: to racke the poore with ouer-plus, all (but Deuils) hold monstrous: to lend the Prodigall, is wicked enough, for it feeds his issue with ill humours, and puts
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:527:31"/>
               <hi>Stibium</hi> into his broth, who was earst sicke of the vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting disease, and could not digest his (Fathers ill-gotten) Patrimony. For the rich, that dissemble pouerty, to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row on vsurie, <hi>(for there is that maketh himselfe poore and hath great riches)</hi> they doe it, either to defeat creditours, <note place="margin">Prou. 13. 7.</note> or to auoid taxations and subsidies, or some such sinister respects. The gentleman that borroweth on vsurie, by racking his rents makes his Tenants pay his vsury. The Farmer so borrowing, by inhauncing his corne, makes the poore pay his vsury. The Trades-man, raiseth his wares, that the buier must pay his vsury. I wil not tax euerie bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower: it is lawfull to suffer iniury, though not to offer it: &amp; it is no sin for the true man to giue his purse to the thief, when he cannot chuse. To redeem his lands, liberty, life, he may (as I suppose) giue interest; but not for meer gain only which he may get by that wicked money; lest he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the vsurer; for a receiuer vpholds a thiefe. This is the priuy-pocket, whose death is the more grieuous because hee is repriued till the last Sessions: a Gibbet is built in hell for him, and all the gold in the world cannot purchase a pardon. I know there is mercy in Christs blood to any repentant and beleeuing sinner, but (excepted Zacheus) shew me the vsurer, that repents: for as <hi>humility</hi> is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>abstinence</hi> the repentance of <hi>surfet,</hi> so is <hi>restitution</hi> the repentance of <hi>vsurse:</hi> hee that restores not, repents not his vsurie: and then <hi>(non remittitur pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aug.</note> 
               <hi>nisi restituatur ablatum)</hi> the sinne is retained, till the gaines of vsurie be restored. This is <hi>(durus sermo, sed verus sermo)</hi> a hard saying, but true: then we may giue all; doe, if they be so gotten: <hi>Dabit Deus meliora, maiora, plura:</hi> God will giue better things, God will giue greater things, God will giue more things; as the Prophet to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masiah: The Lord is able to giue thee more than this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus I haue discouered by occasion of Iudas some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy <note place="margin">2. Chro. 25. 9.</note> theeues; if without thankes, yet not without consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; if without profite, yet not without purpose of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. Indeed these are the sinnes, which I vowed with my
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:527:31"/>
selfe to reproue; not that others haue not done it, or not done it better then I from this place: I acknowledge both freely; yet could I not passe this secret thiefe Iudas, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out discouering his companions, or (as it were) breaking open the knot of Theeues, which vnder allowed preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are arrant cut-purses to the Common-wealth. How to punish, how to restraine, I meddle not: it is enough to discharge my conscience, that I haue endeuoured to make the sinnes hateful to the trespassers, to the trespassed: <hi>Deus tam faciat commodum, quam fecit accommodum:</hi> God make it as preualent, as (I am sure) it is pertinent.</p>
            <p>Giue me leaue, yet ere I leaue, to speake a word of the <note place="margin">His meanes, &amp; his maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> Bagge, first his meanes, and secondly his maintenance. I will ioyne them together, a fit and a fat booty makes a <note place="margin">1. The bag gaue him meanes.</note> theefe. Iudas hath got the bagge, and the bagge hath got Iudas: hee could not carry it, but he must make it light <note place="margin">2. and that you might not think it was empty, that which was put therein, gaue him main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</note> enough for his carriage: he empties it into his owne cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; as many Stewards rise by their good Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters fall. Iudas meanes to be a theefe, and Sathan meanes to fit him with a booty: for after hee had once wrought iourney-worke with the Deuill, he shall not want worke, and a subiect to worke on. I will limit my remayning speech to these three heads. First the difficulty, to beare the bagge, and not to be couetous. Secondly the vsuall incidency of the bagge to the worst men. Thirdly, the progresse of sinne; only faint not in this last act.</p>
            <p n="1">1 It is hard to beare the bagge, and not to be coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous: Iudas is Burser, and he shuts himselfe into his pouch: the more he hath the more he couets: the Apostles, that wanted money, are not so hauing: Iudas hath the bagge, and yet he must haue more, or he will filch it. So impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible is it, that these outward things should satisfie the heart of man. <hi>Soli habent omnia, qui habent habentem omnia.</hi> They alone possesse all things, that possesse the possessour of all things. The nature of true content, is to fill all the chinkes of our desires, as the wax doth the seale: None can doe this but God, for (as it is well obserued) the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:527:32"/>
               <hi>World</hi> is round; mans <hi>Heart</hi> three cornered: a globe can neuer fill a triangle; but one part will be still empty: only the blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> can fill these three corners of mans heart. I confesse, the <hi>Bagge</hi> is a thing much reckoned of, and makes men much reckoned of, for, <hi>Pecunia obediunt omnia:</hi> all things make obeasance to money: <hi>Et qui ex di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitijs tam magnifiant, non miror, sihi diuitias tam magnifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant:</hi> they may admire money, whom money makes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired. Such is the plague and dropsie, the bagge brings to the minde, that the more couetousnesse drinkes downe, the thirstier it is: This is a true drunkard: <hi>dum absorbet vinum, absorbetur à vino,</hi> he drinkes downe his wealth, <note place="margin">Ambr.</note> and his wealth drinkes downe him. <hi>Qui tenet marsupium, tenetur à marsupio,</hi> he holds his purse fast, but not so fast as his purse holdes him: the strings of his <hi>Bagge</hi> tie his heart faster then he ties the strings of his <hi>Bagge.</hi> He is a Iaylour to his Iaylour, a prisoner to his prisoner, he iayles vp his gold in the prison of his Coffer, his gold iayles vp him in the prison of couetousnesse, thus <hi>dum vult esse praedo, fit praeda:</hi> whiles he would come to a pray, he becoms a pray. <note place="margin">Aug.</note> The Deuill gets his heart, as the Crab the Oyster: the Oyster lies gaping for aire on the sandes, the Crab chops in hir claw, and so deuoureth it; whiles the couetous ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes for money, the Deuill thrusts in his (hairy and clouen foote, I meane his) baites of temptation, and chokes the conscience.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Bagge</hi> neuer comes alone, but it brings with it <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 13. 22</note> 
               <hi>cares,</hi> saith Christ; <note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 6. 9..</note> 
               <hi>snares,</hi> saith Paul. It is better to be without riches, then like Iudas, coniured into the circle of his bagge: his heauen is among his bagges; in the sight of them, he applaudes himself against all censures, reuilings, curses. It had profited some, to haue wanted the bagge; and this the wicked (waked) consciences confesse dying; wishing to be without riches, so they were without sinnes; yea euen those, their riches haue procured. It is none of Gods least fauours, that wealth comes not trolling in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs: for many of vs if our estates were better to the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:527:32"/>
world, would be worse to God. The poore labourer hath not time to luxuriate; he trusts to God, to blesse his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours, and so rests content: but the bagge commonly makes a man either <hi>(prodigum</hi> or <hi>auarum)</hi> a prodigall man, or a prodigious man; for <hi>(auarus, monstrum)</hi> the couetous man is a monster: how many wretches hath this bagge drowned, as they swome ouer the sea of this world, and kept them from the shore of blisle? be proud then of your <hi>Bagge,</hi> yee Iudasses when Gods Bailiffe death shall come with a <hi>babeas corpus,</hi> what shall become of your bagge? or rather of your selues for your bagge? your bagge will be found, but your selues lost. It will be one day said of you, as great as the bagge hath made you, as the Poet sung of <hi>Achilles.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Bagge</hi> is most vsually giuen to the worst men: of all the Apostles, he that was to betray Christ, is made his Steward. Goods are in themselues good: <hi>Ne putentur</hi>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:527:33"/>
are proud in spirit: and it is not the <hi>Bagge,</hi> but the <hi>Minde,</hi> which condemnes a man; for <hi>the bagge is more easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, then the minde conquered.</hi> Therfore foolish Crates, <note place="margin">Aug.</note> to throw away his money into the Sea: <hi>ego mergamte, ne mergar a te:</hi> I will drowne thee, lest thou drowne mee: since wealth well imploied, comforts our selues, relieues others; and brings vs (as it were) the speedier way to heauen, and perhaps, to a greater portion of glory: but for the most part, the rich are enemies to goodnesse, and the poore friends: Lazarus the poore man was in Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams bosome, and it was <hi>Diues,</hi> that went to hell; the rich and not the poore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Search the scriptures,</hi> consult all authours, and who are they, that haue sailed through the world in the tallest ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels; and you shall meete loden with the bagge <hi>Caines, Nimrods, Chams, Ismaels, Esaues, Sauls, Ahabs, Labans, Nabals, Demasses, Iudasses,</hi> Deuils; the slime of nature, the worst of men, and as bad as the best of Deuils. What doe men cast to swine and dogges, but draffe and carions? what else are the riches that God giues to wicked men? himselfe is pleased to call them by these names. If they were excellent things, they should neuer be cast on those God hates <hi>(I haue hated Esau)</hi> and meanes to condemne. There is no priuiledge then, in the bagge to keepe thee from being a Iudas: nay therefore thou art most likely, and thereby made most likely to be a Iudas. Who hath so much <hi>beauty</hi> as <hi>Absolon?</hi> who so much <hi>honour</hi> as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar?</hi> Who so much <hi>wealth</hi> as <hi>Naball?</hi> Who the <hi>bagge</hi> but <hi>Iudas?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely God is wise in all his waies; he knowes what he does: Iudas shall hence bagge vp for himselfe the greater damnation. It is then no argument of Gods fauour to be his Purse-bearer, no more, then it was a signe, that Christ loued Iudas aboue the other Apostles, because he made him his Steward: hee gaue the rest <hi>Grace;</hi> and him the <hi>Bagge:</hi> which sped best? These outward things are the scatterings of his mercies, like the gleaning after the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:527:33"/>
the full crop goes to his children. <hi>Ismael</hi> shall haue wealth, but <hi>Ishac</hi> the inheritance: <hi>Esau</hi> his pleasures, but <hi>Iacob</hi> goes away with the blessing. God bestowes fauours vpon some, but they are angry fauours: they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, <hi>bona,</hi> goods; and from God, <hi>dona,</hi> giftes; (for he is not onely a <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note>

            <p>I would haue no man make his riches an argument of Gods disfauour, and his owne dereliction; no, but rather of comfort, if he can finde his affections ready to part with them at Christs calling. I neuer was in your bosomes; how many of you lay vp this resolution in your Closset among your bagges? how many (resolue said I, nay) performe this? you cannot want opportunity in these daies. I would wish you to trie your heartes, that you may secure your consciences of freedome from this Iudasme: oh, how few <hi>Good-riches</hi> there be in these daies? but one Apostle <note place="margin">Not many by name, or by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> goes to hell, and he is the richest. Make then your riches a meanes to helpe you to heauen; whither you can haue no direct and ready way, till you haue gotten the <note n="c" place="margin">Reu. 12. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Moone</hi> beneath your feete, I meane, the world. Lay vp your bag in the bosome of charity, and your treasure in the lap of Christ, and then the <hi>Bagge</hi> shall not hinder, but further your flight to heauen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obserue, how Iudas runs through sinne, from one wickednesse to another without stay: from couetousnesse to hypocrisie, from hypocrisie to theft, from theft to trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, from treason to murder; for since hee could not get the <hi>Oyntment</hi> bestowed on Christ, he meanes to get Christ <note place="margin">Math. 26. 14. 15.</note> himselfe: and to this purpose goes instantly to the Elders and Priests, with a <hi>quid dabitis &amp;c.</hi> Hee values the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at 300. pence, and Christ at (but) 30. as if he was worth no more, then the interest-money, ten in the hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth: and herein he makes his owne price, for they gaue
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:527:34"/>
him his asking: hee betraies Iesus Christ a man, Iesus Christ his master; Iesus Christ is maker; as if he would destroy his Sauiour, and marre his maker.</p>
            <p>Thus he runnes from sinne to sinne, and needs he must, for he, that the Deuill driues, feeles no lead at his heeles. Godlinesse creepes to heauen, but wickednesse runnes to hell: Many Parliament Protestants goe but a Statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, yet looke to come to heauen; but without more hast, when the Pharisies come out of hell.

The <hi>Gallant</hi> gallops in ryot. The <hi>Epicure</hi> reeles a drunken pace. The <hi>Lust-full</hi> scornes to be behind; he runnes from the fire of lust, to the fire of hell; as the fondly impatient fish leapes out of the boyling panne, into the burning flame. The <hi>Swearer</hi> is there, eare hee be aware, for hee goes by his tongue. The <hi>Couetous</hi> rides post, for he is carried on the backe of <hi>Mammon:</hi> The Vsurer sirs still in his chaire or the Chimney-corner, lame of the gout, and can but halt; yet hee will be at hell, as soone as the best runner of them all.</p>
            <p>Vsury is a Coach, and the Diuell is driuer: needes must he goe, whom the Diuell driues. He is drawne to hell in pompe, by two Coach-horses, wilde spirits, with wings, on their heeles, (swifter then <hi>Pegasus,</hi> or <hi>Mercury) Couetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Infidellity:</hi> what makes him put money to vse, but couetousnesse? what makes him so wretchedly couetous, but want of faith? Thus he is hurried to hell in case, state, triumph: If any be worthy to beare the Vsurer company, let it be the Rioter though of contrary disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:527:34"/>
yet in this iourney sitly and accordantly met: for the Vsurer commonly hath money, but no Coach, and the Prodigall Gallant hath a Coach, but no money: if they want company yet, let them take in the Cheater; for he waites vpon both these, and may perhaps faile of the like opportunity.</p>
            <p>Thus because the waies to hell are full of green, smooth, soft, and tempting pleasures, infinite run apace with Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, till they come to <hi>their owne place.</hi> But <hi>Heauens</hi> way is harsh and ascending, and the <hi>gate narrow.</hi> Indeed the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of glory is capacious and roomthy: <hi rend="sup">a</hi>

            <p>Low. Pride is so stiffe, that many a Gallant cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: you haue few women with the top-gallant head-tires get in heere; they cannot stoop low enough; few proud in and of their offices, that haue eaten a stake, and cannot stoope: few sonnes of pride, so starched and laced vp, that they cannot without paine salute a friend: a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full scarsity of ouer-precise, (ouer-dissolute) factious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morists; for they are so high in their owne conceits, that they cannot stoop to this low gate. The insolent, hauty, well-opinioned of themselues cannot bee admitted: for, <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 44. 10.</note> 
               <hi>not humbled to this day.</hi> This low gate, and an high state do not accord Wretched fools, that rather refuse the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry within, then stoop for entrance: as if a Souldior should refuse the honour of Knighthood, because he must kneele to receiue it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Strait, or narrow;</hi> they must stoope that enter this low gate, so they must strip, that enter this strait gate. No make-bates get in, they are too full of tales and lies: God by word of mouth excludes them. <note n="c" place="margin">Reu. 21. 27.</note>

Not an <hi>Incloser:</hi> hee hath too much of the poores commons in his bellie. The <hi>vsurer</hi> hath no hope, for besides his bagges, hee hath too much wax and paper about him. The <hi>Citizen</hi> hopes well, but a false mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure stickes so crosse in his mouth, that he cannot thrust in his head. The <hi>Gentleman</hi> makes no question, and there is great possibility, if two things doe not crosse him, a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of racked rents, or a kennell of lusts and sports. The <hi>plaine-man</hi> is likely, if his ignorance can but finde the gate. <hi>Husband-men</hi> were in great possibility, but for the hoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of corne, and hoising of markets. <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> if they would not sweare good credit into their bad wares, might be admitted. <hi>Ministers</hi> may enter without doubt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, if they be as poore in their spirits, as they are in their purses. But <hi>Impropriators</hi> haue such huge barnes full of Church-graines in their bellies, that they are too great.
