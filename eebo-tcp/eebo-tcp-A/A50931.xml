            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy.</head>
                  <p>TRagedy, as it was antiently compos'd, hath been ever held the gravest, moralest, and most profitable of all other Poems: therefore said by <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be of power by raising pity and fear, or terror, to purge the mind of those and such like passions, that is to temper and reduce them to just measure with a kind of delight, stirr'd up by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or seeing those passions well imitated. Nor is Nature wanting in her own effects to make good his assertion: for so in Physic things of melancholic hue and quality are us'd against melancholy, sowr against sowr, salt to remove salt humours. Hence Philosophers and other gravest Writers, as <hi>Cicero, Plutarch</hi> and others, frequently cite out of Tragic Poets, both to adorn and illustrate thir discourse. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> himself thought it not unworthy to insert a verse of <hi>Euripides</hi> into the Text of Holy Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33. and <hi>Parsus</hi> commenting on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> divides the whole Book as a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, into Acts distinguisht each by a Chorus of Heavenly Harpings and Song between. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55659:60"/>
Men in highest dignity have labour'd not a little to be thought able to compose a Tragedy. Of that honour <hi>Dionysius</hi> the elder was no less am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, then before of his attaining to the Tyranny. <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> also had begun his <hi>Ajax,</hi> but unable to please his own judgment with what he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, left it unfinisht. <hi>Seneca</hi> the Philosopher is by some thought the Author of those Tragedies (at lest the best of them) that go under that name. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> a Father of the Church, thought it not unbeseeming the sanctity of his person to write a Tragedy, which he entitl'd, <hi>Christ suffering.</hi> This is mention'd to vindicate Tragedy from the small esteem, or rather infamy, which in the account of many it undergoes at this day with other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interludes; hap'ning through the Poets error of intermixing Comic stuff with Tragic sadness and gravity; or introducing trivial and vulgar persons, which by all judicious hath bin counted absurd; and brought in without discretion, corruptly to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the people. And though antient Tragedy use no Prologue, yet using sometimes, in case of self defence, or explanation, that which <hi>Martial</hi> calls an Epistle; in behalf of this Tragedy coming forth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the antient manner, much different from what among us passes for best, thus much before-hand may be Epistl'd; that <hi>Chorus</hi> is here introduc'd after the Greek manner, not antient only but modern, and still in use among the <hi>Italians.</hi> In the modelling therefore of this Poem, with good reason, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients and <hi>Italians</hi> are rather follow'd, as of much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55659:60"/>
more authority and fame. The measure of Verse us'd in the Chorus is of all sorts, call'd by the Greeks <hi>Monostrophic,</hi> or rather <hi>Apolelymenon,</hi> without regard had to <hi>Strophe, Antistrophe</hi> or <hi>Epod,</hi> which were a kind of Stanza's fram'd only for the Music, then us'd with the Chorus that sung; not essential to the Poem, and therefore not material; or being divided into Stanza's or Pauses, they may be call'd <hi>Allaeostropha.</hi> Division into Act and Scene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring chiefly to the Stage (to which this work never was intended) is here omitted.</p>
                  <p>It suffices if the whole Drama be found not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't beyond the fift Act, of the style and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and that commonly call'd the Plot, whether intricate or explicit, which is nothing indeed but such oeconomy, or disposition of the fable as may stand best with verisimilitude and decorum; they only will best judge who are not unacquainted with <hi>Aeschulus, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> the three Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic Poets unequall'd yet by any, and the best rule to all who endeavour to write Tragedy. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription of time wherein the whole Drama be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends, is according to antient rule, and best example, within the space of 24 hours.</p>

                     <hi>SAmson</hi> made Captive, Blind, and now in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at <hi>Gaza,</hi> there to labour as in a common work-house, on a Festival day, in the general ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from labour, comes forth into the open Air, to a place nigh, somewhat retir'd there to sit a while and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan his condition. Where he happens at length to be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited by certain friends and equals of his tribe, which make the Chorus, who seek to comfort him what they can; then by his old Father <hi>Manoa,</hi> who endeavours the like, and withal tells him his purpose to procure his liberty by ransom; lastly, that this Feast was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd by the <hi>Philistins</hi> as a day of Thanksgiving for thir deliverance from the hands of <hi>Samson,</hi> which yet more troubles him. <hi>Manoa</hi> then departs to prosecute his endeavour with the <hi>Philistian</hi> Lords for <hi>Samson</hi>'s redemption; who in the mean while is visited by other persons; and lastly by a publick Officer to require his coming to the Feast before the Lords and People, to play or shew his strength in thir presence; he at first refuses, dismissing the publick Officer with absolute denyal to come; at length perswaded inwardly that this was from God, he yields to go along with him, who came now the second time with great threatnings to fetch him; the Chorus yet remaining on the place, <hi>Manoa</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns full of joyful hope, to procure e're long his Sons deliverance: in the midst of which discourse an Ebrew comes in haste confusedly at first; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more distinctly relating the Catastrophe, what <hi>Samson</hi> had done to the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and by accident to himself; wherewith the Tragedy ends.</p>

                     <l>I sorrow'd at his captive state, but minded</l>
                     <l>Not to be absent at that spectacle.</l>
                     <l>The building was a spacious Theatre</l>
                     <l>Half round on two main Pillars vaulted high,</l>
                     <l>With seats where all the Lords and each degree</l>
                     <l>Of sort, might sit in order to behold,</l>
                     <l n="610">The other side was op'n, where the throng</l>
                     <l>On banks and scaffolds under Skie might stand;</l>
                     <l>I among these aloof obscurely stood.</l>
                     <l>The Feast and noon grew high, and Sacrifice</l>
                     <l>Had fill'd thir hearts with mirth, high chear, &amp; wine,</l>
                     <l>When to thir sports they turn'd. Immediately</l>
                     <l>Was <hi>Samson</hi> as a public servant brought,</l>
                     <l>In thir state Livery clad; before him Pipes</l>
                     <l>And Timbre's, on each side went armed guards,</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55659:105"/>
Both horse and foot before him and behind</l>
                     <l n="620">Archers, and Slingers, Cataphracts and Spears.</l>
                     <l>At sight of him the people with a shout</l>
                     <l>Rifted the Air clamouring thir god with praise,</l>
                     <l>Who had made thir dreadful enemy thir thrall.</l>
                     <l>He patient but undaunted where they led him,</l>
                     <l>Came to the place, and what was set before him</l>
                     <l>Which without help of eye, might be assay'd,</l>
                     <l>To heave, pull, draw, or break, he still perform'd</l>
                     <l>All with incredible, stupendious force,</l>
                     <l>None daring to appear Antagonist.</l>
                     <l n="630">At length for intermission sake they led him</l>
                     <l>Between the pillars; he his guide requested</l>
                     <l>(For so from such as nearer stood we heard)</l>
                     <l>As over-tir'd to let him lean a while</l>
                     <l>With both his arms on those two massie Pillars</l>
                     <l>That to the arched roof gave main support.</l>
                     <l>He unsuspitious led him; which when <hi>Samson</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Felt in his arms, with head a while enclin'd,</l>

                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:55659:105"/>
And eyes fast fixt he stood, as one who pray'd,</l>
                     <l>Or some great matter in his mind revolv'd.</l>
                     <l n="640">At last with head erect thus cryed aloud,</l>

                     <l>I have perform'd, as reason was, obeying,</l>
                     <l>Not without wonder or delight beheld.</l>
                     <l>Now of my own accord such other tryal</l>
                     <l>I mean to shew you of my strength, yet greater;</l>
                     <l>As with amaze shall strike all who behold.</l>
                     <l>This utter'd, straining all his nerves he bow'd,</l>
                     <l>As with the force of winds and waters pent,</l>
                     <l>When Mountains tremble, those two massie Pillars</l>
                     <l n="650">With horrible convulsion to and fro,</l>
                     <l>He tugg'd, he shook, till down they came and drew</l>
                     <l>The whole roof after them, with burst of thunder</l>
                     <l>Upon the heads of all who sate beneath,</l>
                     <l>Lords, Ladies, Captains, Councellors, or Priests,</l>
