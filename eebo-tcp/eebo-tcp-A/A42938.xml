            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>GODS LOVE TO LONDON: OR, Londons Comforter.</head>
            <l>Beloved City, though mine Arrows flie</l>
            <l>So thick about thee, thouſands weekly die,</l>
            <l>And Death walks daily in thy open ſtreets,</l>
            <l>Would be deſtroying every one he meets,</l>
            <l>And with his Club doth march thy-ſtreets around,</l>
            <l>And all he can he fells unto the ground;</l>
            <l>Yet ſtill to ſeek my face thy mind is bent,</l>
            <l>To truſt in me thou wholly art intent;</l>
            <l>Thy <hi>Lamentation</hi> clearly lets me ſee</l>
            <l>Thou doeſt return with loyal heart to me.</l>
            <l>Proceed, O <hi>London</hi>! but a little while,</l>
            <l>Upon my word, thou ſhalt perceive my ſmile.</l>
            <l>That domineering Giant I will fell,</l>
            <l>And with one ſtroke I'l ſtrike him down to Hell.</l>
            <l>Then fear nor, <hi>London</hi>! I'm thy Rock and Aid,</l>
            <l>I will not fail thee, be not thou afraid:</l>
            <l>My love to thee is more then thou doeſt know;</l>
            <l>A little while, and thou ſhalt find it ſo.</l>
            <l>I ſee how earneſtly thou doeſt repent,</l>
            <l>And how thy love moſt cordially is bent</l>
            <l>To ſeek my glory: Now it doth appear.</l>
            <l>Cheer up thy heart, thou art to me moſt dear.</l>
            <l>Then droop not in deſpair, be not diſmaid;</l>
            <l>I am thy Saviour, be not thou afraid.</l>
            <l>Thy <hi>Lamentation</hi> and thy good deſire,</l>
            <l>Hath ſet my <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> all on fire.</l>
            <l>As I am God, I never will thee fail,</l>
            <l>But will conſume thy foes, as with a Flail,</l>
            <l>And make them flee as chaff before the wind;</l>
            <l>For in thy ſorrows they were moſt unkind.</l>
            <l>Yet I'l not fail, I will not thee for ſake;</l>
            <l>Thou of rich ſhowrs of Mercies ſhalt partake,</l>
            <l>And ſeel my love, my favour, and my ſmile,</l>
            <l>Though at this time I ſrown on thee a while,</l>
            <l>I do obſerve thy ſorrow and thy tears,</l>
            <l>How thy ſad looks a mournful Livery wears;</l>
            <l>I ſee thy countenance, and how thou'rt bent</l>
            <l>To ſtick unto me with a full intent.</l>
            <l>I a truth I love thee; then eſteem it ſo:</l>
            <l>I will thee eaſe before I from thee go:</l>
            <l>I will not fail thee, as I am thy God,</l>
            <l>Nor will I long chaſtiſe thee with my Rod;</l>
            <l>For thou, and all the world, ſhall ever ſee,</l>
            <l>I will not fail them that do truſt in me.</l>
            <l>Therefore take comfort in thy greateſt trouble;</l>
            <l>For, for thy ſorrows I thy joys will double.</l>
            <l>I'm glad to ſee thy love, and thy good will,</l>
            <l>And how that thou and thine my Houſe doth fill,</l>
            <l>And do frequent it every Day of mine,</l>
            <l>Both thou, and all the family that's thine;</l>
            <l>And with ſubjection doeſt thy ſelf ſubmit</l>
            <l>Unto my will, and rev'rently doeſt fit</l>
            <l>To hear my ſacred Word, and there doeſt ſtay</l>
            <l>To have a Bleſſing e're thou go'ft away.</l>
            <l>I do take notice how dead Corps's flie</l>
            <l>About thy ſtreets, and how many do die</l>
            <l>In ev'ry day; I ſee how they abound,</l>
            <l>And take account how many go to th'ground:</l>
            <l>I daily ſee how Father, and the Mother,</l>
            <l>The Son, the Daughter, Siſter, and the Brother,</l>
            <l>Do wring their hands, their hearts are ſo perplext</l>
            <l>For their dead Friends, and fear they may be next:</l>
            <l>Thy Tears into my Bottle I do put;</l>
            <l>I hear thy Cries, my ears ſhall not be ſhut.</l>
            <l>As many days as thou haſt puniſhment,</l>
            <l>So many years thou ſhalt have hearts-content.</l>
            <l>And if thou wilt ſubmit thy ſelf to me,</l>
            <l>Such joy and comfort thou e're long ſhalt ſee,</l>
            <l>As will thee raviſh, make thee leap for joy:</l>
            <l>For thy grand Enemy I will deſtroy;</l>
            <l>Nay, thou thy ſelf ſhalt fell him at thy foot,</l>
            <l>And I'l ſtand by, and help thee for to do't.</l>
            <l>Three ſmooth white Stones go fetch, and to me bring</l>
            <l>Without delay, put them into a Sling;</l>
            <l>Be not afraid, for I'l ſtand by thy ſide,</l>
            <l>And when thou throweſt, I the Stone will guide:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Faith, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> theſe three will</l>
            <l>Fly with ſuch force, thy Enemy they'l kill:</l>
            <l>Theſe Stones will kill him ſooner then a Dart,</l>
            <l>If they be thrown out of an <hi>humble Heart</hi>;</l>
            <l>That great <hi>Goliah</hi> at thy feet ſhall fall,</l>
            <l>Though he be ne'r ſo ſtrong, or ne'r ſo tall:</l>
            <l>Thou ſhalt his Neck break, and cut off his Head,</l>
            <l>And trample on him when he lieth dead.</l>
