            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Poets</hi> were made? I'd tell you, if I durst,</l>
            <l>That 'twas in Contradiction to Heaven's Word,</l>
            <l>That when its Spirit o're the Waters stir'd,</l>
            <l>When it saw All, and said That All was good,</l>
            <l>The Creature <hi>Poet</hi> was not understood.</l>
            <l>For, were it worth the Pains of six long Days,</l>
            <l>To mould Retailers of dull Third-Day-Plays,</l>
            <l>That starve out threescore Years in hopes of Bays.</l>
            <l>'Tis plain they ne're were of the first Creation,</l>
            <l>But came by meer Equiv'cal Generation.</l>
            <l>Like Rats in Ships, without Coition bred;</l>
            <l>As hated too as they are, and unfed.</l>
            <l>Nature their Species sure must needs disown,</l>
            <l>Scarce knowing <hi>Poets,</hi> less by <hi>Poets</hi> known.</l>
            <l>Yet this poor Thing, so scorn'd, and set at nought,</l>
            <l>Ye all pretend to, and would fain be thought.</l>
            <l>Disabl'd wasting <hi>Whore-Masters</hi> are not</l>
            <l>Prouder to own the Brats they never got,</l>
            <l>Than Fumbling, Itching Rhimers of the Town,</l>
            <l>T' adopt some base-born Song that's not their own.</l>
            <l>Spite of his State, <hi>My Lord</hi> sometimes descends,</l>
            <l>To please the Importunity of Friends.</l>
            <l>The dullest he thought most for Business fit,</l>
            <l>'Twill venture his bought Place, to aim at Wit.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:100540:4"/>
And though he sinks with his Imploys of State,</l>
            <l>Till Common Sense forsake him, he'll Translate.</l>
            <l>The <hi>Poet</hi> and the <hi>Whore</hi> alike complains,</l>
            <l>Of trading Quality, that spoils their Gains;</l>
            <l>The Lords will Write, and Ladies will have Swains.</l>
            <l>Therefore, all you who have Male Issue born,</l>
            <l>Under the Starving Sign of <hi>Capricorn;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Prevent the Malice of their Stars in time,</l>
            <l>And warn them early from the Sin of Rhime:</l>
            <l>Tell 'em how <hi>Spencer</hi> starv'd, how <hi>Cowley</hi> mourn'd,</l>
            <l>How <hi>Butler</hi>'s Faith and Service was return'd;</l>
            <l>And if such Warning they refuse to take,</l>
            <l>This last Experiment, O Parents, make!</l>
            <l>With Hands behind them see the Offender ty'd,</l>
            <l>The Parish Whip, and Beadle by his side.</l>
            <l>Then lead him to some Stall that does expose</l>
            <l>The Authors he loves most, there rub his Nose;</l>
            <l>Till like a Spaniel lash'd, to know Command,</l>
            <l>He by the due Correction understand,</l>
            <l>To keep his Brains clean, and not foul the Land.</l>
            <l>Till he against his Nature learn to strive,</l>
            <l>And get the Knack of Dullness how to thrive.</l>

            <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
            <stage>Spoken by <hi>Mrs. COOK.</hi>
            </stage>
            <l>OUr <hi>Hero</hi>'s happy in the Plays Conclusion,</l>
            <l>The holy Rogue at last has met Confusion:</l>
            <l>Though <hi>Arius</hi> all along appear'd a Saint,</l>
            <l>The last Act shew'd him a true Protestant.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Eusebius,</hi> (for you know I read Greek Authors)</l>
            <l>Reports, that after all these Plots and Slaughters,</l>
            <l>The Court of <hi>Constantine</hi> was full of Glory,</l>
            <l>And every <hi>Trimmer</hi> turn'd Addressing <hi>Tory;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They follow'd him in Herds as they were mad:</l>
            <l>When <hi>Clause</hi> was King, then all the World was glad.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Whiggs</hi> kept the Places they possest before,</l>
            <l>And most were in a way of getting more;</l>
            <l>Which was as much as saying, Gentlemen,</l>
            <l>Here's Power and Money to be Rogues again.</l>
            <l>Indeed there were a sort of peaking Tools,</l>
            <l>Some call them Modest, but I call 'em Fools,</l>
            <l>Men much more Loyal, tho not half so loud;</l>
            <l>But these poor Devils were cast behind the Croud.</l>
            <l>For bold Knaves thrive without one Grain of Sense,</l>
            <l>But good Men starve for want of Impudence.</l>
            <l>Besides all these, there were a sort of Wights,</l>
            <l>(I think my Author calls them <hi>Teckelites;)</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Such hearty Rogues against the King and Laws,</l>
            <l>They favour'd even a Foreign Rebel's Cause.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:100540:5"/>
When their own damn'd Design was quash'd and aw'd,</l>
            <l>At least they gave it their good Word abroad.</l>
            <l>As many a Man, who, for a quiet Life,</l>
            <l>Breeds out his Bastard, not to nose his Wife.</l>
            <l>Thus o're their Darling Plot these <hi>Trimmers</hi> cry;</l>
            <l>And though they cannot keep it in their Eye,</l>
            <l>They bind it Prentice to <hi>Count Teckely.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>They believe not the last Plot, may I be curst,</l>
            <l>If I believe they e're believ'd the first.</l>
            <l>No wonder their own Plot, no Plot they think;</l>
            <l>The Man that makes it, never smells the Stink.</l>
            <l>And, now it comes into my Head, I'll tell</l>
            <l>Why these damn'd <hi>Trimmers</hi> lov'd the <hi>Turks</hi> so well.</l>
            <l>The Original <hi>Trimmer,</hi> though a Friend to no Man,</l>
            <l>Yet in his Heart ador'd a pretty Woman:</l>
            <l>He knew that <hi>Mahomet</hi> laid up for ever,</l>
            <l>Kind Black-ey'd Rogues, for every true Believer:</l>
            <l>And, which was more than mortal Man e're tasted,</l>
            <l>One Pleasure that for threescore Twelve-months lasted:</l>
            <l>To turn for this, may surely be forgiven:</l>
            <l>Who'd not be circumcis'd for such a Heav'n!</l>
