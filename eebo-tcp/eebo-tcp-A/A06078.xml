         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And to be playne, I do not a little <hi>Eudoxus</hi> diſagrée, from thys

in that, that a man withdrawing himſelfe from company, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
rather to liue in the voide and deſolate places of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> earth,
and there, playing the Philoſopher in the open wilderneſſe,
doth ſéeme alone to contente hymſelfe: or that you déeme, the
ſubſtance thereof to remayne in the common ſocietie of man,
notwithſtanding, to be conuerſaunt but with few: I truely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéeme
it, no way to pertayne to the duetie of a wiſe man, to
whome it chiefly belongeth in all his actions, to haue ſpeciall
regarde to his end. For, it is not to be thoughte that the hygh
and ſoueraigne God, dyd firſte create man to the ende to lyue
wholly to himſelfe, neyther was he borne for hymſelfe onely,
but that of his birth, parte his Countrey as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, and
part his friendes are to challenge. Beſydes, if ſo it were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
for man to liue alone, then were it but néedeleſſe for hym
to haue a wife, but otherwiſe it appeareth, that God knowing
better our neceſſitie than we our ſelues, thought marriage a
thing very néedefull to be prouided. Wherefore, aſſure youre
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1714:7"/>
ſelfe you ſhall commonly fynde, eyther fewe or none of thoſe
that are accompted wiſe, that wil rather ſéeme, to preferre <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſſe</hi>
before ſocietie. But of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide many, that haue
vtterly condemned that vnciuile kind of life, which ignoraunt
people in the beginning of the world did brutiſhly leade, much
after the manner of vnreaſonable beaſtes. Among whome,
there was neyther ſocietie nor friendſhip maynteyned, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
liuing in the boundes of lawfull matrimony, no man certaine
of his owne children, nor any law to diſtinguiſh the good from
the euill mainteyned among them. What ſhoulde I ſay? eache
man then did careleſly raunge, and wander abrode in the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Wilderneſſe, hauing neyther dwelling nor place of abode.
But when reaſon had after taughte them to aſſociate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
togyther, and that <hi>Moyſes</hi> that mightie Captayne of the
Iewes was alſo borne, by whome the eternall God gaue firſt
the lawe to the line of his inheritance: from thence I ſay, the
law makers and Philoſophers, firſt taking their inſtruction,
beganne to ſette downe both manners and inſtitutions of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing:
And after, as Townes and Cities were dayly erected, ſo
the people began to eſtéeme of <hi>Humanitie</hi> and to reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
whereby in ſhort ſpace it came after to paſſe, that diuers
addicted themſelues to the fauor of <hi>Faith,</hi> and to the exerciſe of
<hi>Iuſtice,</hi> and dyuers other to ſubmit themſelues to the yoke of
obedience: ſo as by this time, each man did eſtéeme it a thyng
belonging to his duetie, not onely to employ the beſt of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
but alſo to aduenture the loſſe of hys life, for the better
maintenance of the common Wealth. From thence likewiſe
both <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> tooke firſte their lighte, from whyche
foundation of theyrs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> renowmed <hi>Graecians</hi> became ſo famous,
for the due eſtabliſhmente of their equal lawes. From whome,
the Romaynes alſo did after deriue, their penal conſtitutions
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teyned in their tables, by the which, they brought the people
in all their actions, from thenceforth to become both profitable
and honeſt: who though at firſt by the ſtraungeneſſe thereof,
they beganne to murmure and repine at ſuche bondage, yet
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1714:8"/>
after, being better contented with reaſon to heare &amp; vnderſtand
the ſame, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wilde &amp; vntamed creatures they brought them at

<hi>Vertue</hi> is a thing, that may neither be giuen nor taken away by
any man, as before we haue declared: But <hi>Wiſedome</hi> we finde,

of no man, but that we haue rightly termed <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is to ſay
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> to be no Vertue. For if <hi>Knowledge</hi> were a Vertue,

poſſible, then woulde there bée founde both teachers and

ſince all theſe thinges (<hi>Wiſedome taken awaie</hi>) are not onely

For <hi>Juſtice</hi> without the gouernemente of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> what

elſe, than vnconſiderate raſhneſſe? <hi>Modeſtie</hi> what elſe, than ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and diſſolute negligence? By this it therefore appeareth
that <hi>Wiſedome,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Knowledge of good and euil,</hi> is
one thing, and <hi>Vertue</hi> another: For there maye be <hi>Knowledge</hi>
wythout <hi>Vertue,</hi> as plainely it appeared by dyuers of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi>
who in déede did onlye vſurpe the name of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
when in effecte, what the ſame did rightly import, they

that no kinde of goodneſſe, that the <hi>Peripatetickes</hi> did

it ſelfe is an other thing in déede than they dyd thynke off,

eyther little or no griefe at all: By the ſame reaſon (I ſaye) he
was fully confuted, and did thereby confeſſe, that in God our

there is alſo a life to come, in which euil men for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences

For if true it were that there remayned in God no <hi>Proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
diuine,</hi> how ſhoulde the worlde be ſo duely diſpoſed? howe
ſhoulde the raine fall, fruite ſpring, or trées waxe leaued? But,
it is (as I take it) no maruel at al, though for his part he were
ſo infected with that leude opinion, who was toward god a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vile and vnrighteous creature himſelf, and the firſt perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and procurer of filthy pleaſure, for the fruition whereof he
thought man to be chiefly borne; notwithſtanding, it is in troth
ſo farre differing (my friendes) from all good doctrine, to thinke
pleaſure to be good, that <hi>Plato</hi> himſelf that <hi>Philoſopher</hi> profound,
affirmeth the ſame to be the bayte of all euill, bycauſe that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
are therewithall dayly taken as fiſhe with a hooke. For <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
firſt, with the ſingular ſwéeteneſſe &amp; deſire of honor (which
is likened to the inticing ſong of Mermaydes) draweth them
headlong one waye vnto hir. <hi>Couetouſneſſe</hi> an other way, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them as faſt with the gain of money: and <hi>Wantonneſſe</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh
them, with enticements of luſt: ſo as, there is nothing
more true than the ſaying of <hi>Seneca, That no euil remaineth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
pretence of warrantie, and that al vice doth ſolicite vs with hope
of rewarde.</hi> The which that great and excellent man <hi>Architas</hi>
of <hi>Tarente</hi> very wiſely conſidering, ſayde, that there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
nor more pernicious a peſtilence giuen to man by nature,
than the pleaſure of the bodie, of which our fleſh being maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
gréedie, we are furthwith pricked on with deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it. From hence the betraying of countries, from hence the
ouerthrow of common Weales, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence the ſecret confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1714:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with forren enemies, is ſaide to procéede. Beſides, there is alſo
no miſchiefe nor no foule offence pretended, that thys deſire
of diſpleaſure doeth not enforce to be committed: All whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and adulteries, and all offences whatſoeuer, are chiefly
procured by no other occaſion that onely bey pleaſure. And
whereas nothing is giuen vnto man, either by God or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more excellente than the minde: There is none ſo greate
an enimie to this diuine gift of his, as this filthy pleaſure. For
where <hi>Luſt</hi> doth raigne, <hi>Temperance</hi> hath there no place, nor
within the dominion of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> maye <hi>Vertue</hi> endure to abide.
The which to the ende it might the better be perceiued, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
a man to ſuppoſe in his minde, himſelf to be prouoked with
as greate deſire of bodilye pleaſure as maye poſſibly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued:
thinking thereby, that no man woulde then ſtande in
doubt, but that ſo long as he were ther withal delighted, he could
nothing profitte in minde, nothing in reaſon, nor any thing in
thought. Wherefore he fully concludeth, that there is nothing
more deteſtable, nothing more noyſome nor piſtiferous vnto
mankinde, than this deſire of pleaſure: The which, how muche
the more it doth increaſe and waxe bigge, ſo much the more it
darkneth and conſumeth the light of the minde. Sée therefore
then I pray you, how miſerable the ſeruice of <hi>Vertue</hi> ſhould be
made, being appointed as <hi>Epicurus</hi> would haue hir, a ſeruaunt
vnto <hi>Pleſure.</hi> For, it is not poſſible y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Vertue may be obtained by
pleaſure, but rather diminiſhed &amp; loſt by the ſame: ſince al theſe
things are contrarie to the one, that are thought neceſſarie for
the obtaining of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, that is to ſay, <hi>Inceſſant labor, hardineſſe,
and reſiſtance againſt euil,</hi> whereof this life is very full. For, by
what meanes elſe are men made <hi>Modeſt, Gentle, chaſt, godlie, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi>
&amp; louers of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> but only, by fearefulneſſr of pouertie,
dread of ſhame, and the bitter ſharpneſſe of continuall griefe?
It is therefore to be thought, that by the prouidence of God it
was ordeyned from the firſt, that <hi>Vertue</hi> ſhoulde labour here in
the trouble and vexation of the world: wherby it happeneth that
al thoſe, whom either wilfulneſſe or pleaſure hath headlong o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1714:16"/>
are ſtil diſdaineful of ſuch as are followers of the
ſame, impatiently taking it, that anye other ſhoulde inioy that,
which they want themſelues. So that good men, bycauſe they
daily treade this difficult and painefull paſſage vnto Vertue,
are had in contempt of all thoſe, which pleaſauntlye walke in
the plaine and apparant waye to vice, waxing fooliſhly fonde of
eache flouriſhing floure and delectable fruite that they happen
to ſée, onely ſéeking to obtaine that, chiefly with all their ſtudie
and care, which among the mortal creatures of this worlde is
accounted good, that is to ſay, <hi>Honor, Riches, Quietneſſe, Pleaſure,</hi>
and all other ſuch enticements as wholly tende to the eaſe and

as when <hi>Reaſon, Honor,</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> ſhall require it, he may
boldly aduenture the puniſhment both of fier, and of all other

we read, that <hi>Marcus Regulus</hi> did honorably performe, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuored

as hée ſpake them. Thus therefore, in the

ſaye: Synce well to liue and to bée happie are accounted
as one, then whether doe wee alſo allowe the ſame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

their liues without impedimente, according to the lawe in
whiche they were created, what then ſhoulde lette them
alſo to liue well, that is to ſaye, happyly? For whether
wée accompte this liuing well to conſiſte, in the well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauing
of youre ſelues, or in the due performing of oure
naturall duetie, wée muſte alſo be contented, to imparte
the ſame vnto beaſtes: To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is both as poſſible to behaue
themſelues wel, and alſo to performe that ſpeciall worke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as it is vnto vs. For example, let vs firſte conſider of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall
birdes: Wherein it cannot I thinke be denyed, but that
they among the reſt do behaue themſelues well, for as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
they are taught, ſo duely they ſing, and thereby it ſéemeth
they maye rightly be ſayde, to followe a wiſhed and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued
kinde of life. But if farther it be ſayed, that there is
alſo required a happie ende to be made, which ought to conſiſt
in the laſt cloſing vp and concluſion of nature: By the ſame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
waye, we muſt likewiſe confeſſe they may be counted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.
For when, by courſe of kynde they drawe to theyr ende,
the ordinarye motion of <hi>Nature</hi> doth ceaſſe in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhe endeth that harmeleſſe life of theirs, whiche from the
firſte beginning to the departure of the ſame, ſhée throughlye
performed. And therefore, if eyther in the naturall endyng
of theyr lyues, or in the due performaunce of the duetie wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they were created, there remaine anye happineſſe: The<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doubtleſſe may beaſtes be ſayde, to be both happye and bleſſed.
All whiche, if it be true <hi>Liſippus,</hi> according as <hi>Plotinus</hi> hath
ſette downe the ſame, what then ſhoulde hinder man, who

hath all his affections, ſubiecte vnto reaſon, and hath choſen
hir to guide him in his actions, that he alſo, ſhoulde not here

               <p>I thinke it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither,
inconueniente for mée, to anſwere at this time
to the ſaying of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> ſynce the matter he helde is in
effecte ſo abſurde, that there is ſcarſe anye one to be founde,
that will togyther aſſente with hym in the lyke. For
verilye for my owne part, I am yet to learne, in what cauſes
he woulde haue well behauiour to be placed: But let vs ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that beaſtes for the purpoſe, doe behaue them ſelues well
according to his ſaying, yet howe maye they by this reaſon be
accounted happie, who do not only not know, the goodneſſe of
theyr felicytie, but alſo are ignoraunt of their owne eſtate:
Or if they doe vnderſtande it, yet do they (as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme)
but groſely, vnperfectly, and obſcurely vnderſtande the
ſame. For although, it be common to them togither with vs,
to loue, to hate, to deſire, to feare, to ſorrow, and other ſuch like:
yet to foreſée (which nature hath only giuen vnto man) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
to finde out, or to remember any thing they poſſibly can
not: Onely that whiche ſoone paſſeth ouer, hath nature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
them, that is to ſaye, the imagination of thyngs
preſente: But for things that are paſte, ſhée hath giuen
them a memorye altogither confuſed, whiche neuer cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
any thing agayne to remembraunce, except by the viewe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1714:19"/>
of things y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> are preſent: So alſo for things that are to come, ſhe
hath likewiſe allowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no knowledge at al. By what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
then (if I may aſke) may they be counted happie, whoſe caſe
is ſuch that they knowe not their owne eſtate, neyther yet are
able to make any difference betwéene good and euil? But nowe
on the other ſide, as touching the ſtate and condition of man,
who liueth (I pray you) ſo orderly, that at no time féeleth anye
trouble of minde? what man ſo perfect that neuer yéeldeth to his
paſſion? who ſo ſingular, but if he auoyde pride, couetouſneſſe
poſſeſſeth his hart? If he ſhunne couetouſneſſe, anger diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his patience? if he ſuppreſſe anger, gluttony delighteth his
taſt? if he eſchewe gluttony, enuie conſumeth his carcas? if he
repulſe enuie, ſlouthfulnes ouerwhelmeth both ſoule and body.
Whereby it commeth ſtil to paſſe, that no man may be vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found deuoide of fault, for as the <hi>Poet</hi> ſayth:

               <p>Which ſince it is ſo, I ſée not my friendes, how any man

then come to paſſe, that ſuch as haue moſt learnedly diſcourſed

it had bene better for them, to haue neuer learned the name of

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1714:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
others made ſubiect to their owne luſte, ſo as, their liuing and
teaching are commonlye contrarie, whiche thing in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is moſt vntollerable. For as he that profeſſeth himſelfe
a <hi>Gramarian,</hi> if he ſpeake barberouſly, or he, that challengeth the
name of a <hi>Muſitian,</hi> if he ſing vntunably, is the more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued,
bycauſe he offendeth in that very thing, wherin he wold
ſeeme moſt ſkilfull vnto others: So likewiſe the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the order of his life, is the more to be condemned, bicauſe
he erreth in that parte of duetie, wherein his knowledge doth
principally conſiſt, and is faultie himſelfe in that, in whiche he
vndertaketh to be a teacher of others. For, when true it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the
ſubſtaunce of <hi>Philoſophie</hi> doth conſiſt, not in termes but in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is a great ſhame for a man of knowledge, to haue it obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> not in workes but in wordes.
And therefore, it commeth verely to paſſe, that ſuch men are not
in déed, the true inſtructers of Vertue, bicauſe they are therof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute
themſelues. For if <hi>Philoſophie</hi> be the ſtudie of Wiſdome,
as the learned haue defined, and that Wiſedome be nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be put in practiſe, thereby to ſhewe foorth hir operation:
It followeth then, that the doctrine of ſuche teachers, is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
barren and fruiteleſſe, bicauſe it worketh not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
it is wont to do in the moſt part of thoſe, of whom it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.
For <hi>Cicero</hi> nameth <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> the manuring of the witte,
which pulleth vp all vice by the roote, and maketh apt the minde
to receiue, the fruiteful ſéed of Vertue, and as we may terme it,
planteth in vs ſuch pleaſaunt fruite, as yéeldeth in time a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
increaſe. Wherefore, by this it appeareth that the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> is rather to make hir louers to liue wel in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
conuerſation, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſpeake &amp; teach wel in priuate ſchooles:
Whiche thing, when by experience it frameth not accordingly,
it therby declareth ſuch ſuperficial <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> to haue rather

thought farre vnfitte for his calling, to haue honeſtie placed not
in his hart, but in his lippes, which contrariewiſe ought rather
to conſiſt, not in ſpeach and tongue but in life and manners. For,
if true it were that the Vertue of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> did at al conſiſt in
the ſubſtaunce of words: who might them (I pray you) haue bene
accounted more happie, than the man himſelfe of whome wée

doth plainly witneſſe, where wholy directing his talke

life, the ſearcher out of Vertue and the expeller of vice, what were
we, or what were the life of man, without thy aide and aſsiſtance? Thou</hi>
(I ſay) <hi>were the firſt inuenter of all good lawes, the only teacher of

we could put in practiſe all that we cal honeſtie, ſo eaſyly
as we may talke &amp; diſcourſe of the ſame, ſhould not then (I pray
you) both we our ſelues, and al other that haue vſurped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name

procéedeth, that many men haue béene contented with the onely

therof, they were altogither ignorant. Notwithſtanding, in the
true iudgement of al men, he only is to be taken and accompted
for wiſe, who in worde and déede, both when thou ſéeſt hym, &amp;
when thou heareſt him, is alwayes one and the ſame without

a little before we reaſoned (friende <hi>Liſippus</hi>) of the propertie of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1714:21"/>
                  <hi>Vertue,</hi> and of that happineſſe which ſhe beſtoweth vpon thoſe,
that guyding themſelues by hir warie order, liue an honeſt and
vertuous life: we were not (I remember) ſo farre foorth gone,
as to affirme, that anye man coulde liue deuoyde of faulte (for
this we knowe was the onlie and peculiar priuiledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi>
our ſauiour) neither went we about to proue, that all men em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<hi>Vertue:</hi> But this onely we ſaid, that if beaſtes, when they
performed their naturall operations, might be accompted hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,
according to the former opinion of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> muche more
ought we then to iudge the ſame of man, eſpecially, if <hi>Reaſon</hi>
haue that preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in him as it ought, and that al his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be ſubiect ſtil to hir gouernement. But, if to that which is
ſpoken I may be lawfully ſuffered, vppon better aduiſemente
to adde one thing more, then thus I procéede. Albeit at ſome

in vs, yet ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as they preuaile not, nor get the vpper ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
a man is not therefore to be eſtéemed either euil or vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie:
<hi>For without faultes no man liueth, and he is beſt that is troubled
with feweſt.</hi> If this rule may but thus be graunted, as in trouth
it is euident, then without queſtion, we ſhalbe able to finde out
diuers notable good men: For in al ages there haue flouriſhed
many, who by their holy and iuſt liuing, by their manifolde and
notable vertues (for diuerſe are the giftes whiche the Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
God powreth downe vppon his people) haue deſerued
great honor and eſtimation in the world. Of whiche number it
ſhall not, I thinke be amiſſe, if I repete in this place ſome few.
And firſte, what ſay we of <hi>Socrates?</hi> who ſo manly demeaned
himſelfe in al his actions, that at no time, either in aduerſitie or
proſperitie, his countenaunce was founde to be altered: Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>was
it at all in him to be maruelled, ſince ſo lightly he eſtéemed
the verie terrour of death, that when oportunitie was conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
offered him to haue eſcaped the ſame, he vtterlie refuſed
the aduauntage thereof: knowing right well, that death was
onely dreadfull vnto thoſe, with whoſe mortal life all glory, all
honor, and all eſtimation did vtterly periſh, and not vnto thoſe,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1714:22"/>
whoſe Vertue and renowne was alwayes laſting and coulde
neuer decay: for he, according vnto <hi>Reaſon</hi> applied his doctrine
to the bettering of his life, accompting the ſubſtaunce of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie</hi>
to conſiſt, in the equal choyce betwéene good and euill: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
in this one pointe be ſhewed himſelfe more wiſe than the
reſte, in that, he withdrewe the courſe of his diſputation, from
the ſearching out of celeſtiall and ſupernatural cauſes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
many haue heretofore ſpent, both their witte and their time
to no purpoſe at all. What of <hi>Pithagoras?</hi> who ſhewed himſelfe
as a ſpectacle to the worlde, both of learnyng and Vertue, and
who among other hys manyfolde giftes was of modeſtye
ſo great, that being demaunded by what ſurname of honor he
woulde be called, refuſed the title which others his inferiours
had taken vpon them, and that, whiche in thoſe dayes was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to al ſuch as were learned, chooſing rather to be called, not
<hi>Sophos</hi> but <hi>Philoſophos,</hi> not wiſe, but a ſearcher and louer of
Wiſedome. What of <hi>Plato?</hi> who though he were accompted
of al the wiſeſt, and alſo attained to ſo wonderfull perfection of
learning and eloquence, as if <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe woulde haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
from the heauens, he coulde neuer haue vſed a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
ſtyle: yet notwithſtanding, he refuſed the title of his own
glorie wherevnto he had right, and aſcribed the honour of all
hys workes vnto <hi>Socrates</hi> hys Maiſter, ſhewing thereby him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
no leſſe commendable for demeanour, than honourable
for his knowledge. What of <hi>Cato</hi> the elder? who in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all men was accompted, the verye image of Vertue,
the honor of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the ſtaye of the whole Empire: he
I meane, whoſe name and Vertue was after ſupported by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
the yonger, that noble and princely ſonne of his. What of
<hi>Seneca?</hi> who was of ſtomacke ſo ſtoute, that with patience he
maſtered the very terrour of death, when by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of <hi>Nero</hi> the tirant, he was therunto enforced. What of <hi>Fabricius</hi>
the <hi>Roman?</hi> a man ſo ſincere and vpright of minde, that not with
the vehement temptation of golde it ſelfe, he was able to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted:
who firſt (as the ſtorie affirmeth) refuſed the large and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1714:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mightie proffers of <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> eſtéeming it more worthy and more
worth than a kingdome, to neglect and contemne the brybes of
a King: And after, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the proffer was made him for the ſecret
diſpatche of that <hi>Romaine</hi> enimy, he woulde not only not ſuffer
the ſame to be done, but gaue him warning himſelf of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
pretended, adding thereunto theſe wordes that followe.
<hi>Enioye thy longer life, by this my meanes (O Pirrhus) and be nowe
glad of that whiche thou haſte heretofore lamented, that is, that
Fabricius thy enemye woulde not be corrupted.</hi> To conclude,
manye other there haue bene, who albeit they haue crred
in ſome pointes like menne, yet wholye in their mindes they
ſtyll embraced <hi>Vertue,</hi> by whoſe meanes theyr liues were
both <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>Happie:</hi> at all times ſo behauing themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
that of theyr ſayings and doyngs, there ſtyll remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the worlde, a perpetuall remembraunce. So then
on the other ſyde, though manye there haue béene beſydes,
who haue not ſo ſufficiently bene able, to performe the ſame
in action, whereof, they haue ſo gloriouſlye talked: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythſtandyng,
it can not therefore I thinke be denyed,
but that theſe men did alſo greate good in the worlde, whyle
diſputing of <hi>Vertue,</hi> they opened the waye by theyr holeſome
precepts, howe other mighte more eaſily attaine to the ſame.
For, if the lyfe of learned men were aunſwerable in all
pointes to the manner of their doctrine, who were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted
ſo happie as they? but, we muſt remember, that they
entreate of <hi>Vertue</hi> and not of themſelues: they reaſon not howe
they dee liue, but how they and all other ought generallye
to liue, ſetting alſo the marke before our eyes whereat we

man, what is beſt to be done, and what to be auoyded, ſéeking
further, and that with al their might, how to performe the ſame
in their owne behauiour, and according to their powers to liue
well themſelues. <hi>LISIP.</hi> You diſpute <hi>Eudoxus</hi> verie earneſtly,
ſéeking to withdrawe me from myne opinion, by manye good
and pithie reaſons, wherein, although you haue diligently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,
you haue not yet brought me to be of your iudgemente.
For this is to me an aſſured grounde, that nothing in thys
worlde may make a man <hi>Happie,</hi> conſidering, that the ordinarie
courſe of our life is but ſhort, and that we are al made thral vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
miſerie: Where on the other ſide, <hi>Hppineſſe</hi> it ſelfe is who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
made perfect, hauing nothing that may trouble or diminiſhe
the ſame. So as, not any thing in my opinion may be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Happie,</hi> that is not voide of <hi>Corruption,</hi> and there is nothing
<hi>Vncorruptible</hi> that is not <hi>Immortall,</hi> wherby I conclude, that no
mortall creature may here attaine to this bliſfulneſſe of life, as
you would haue it, but rather, ſo long as he abideth on the earth,
I thinke him moſt miſerable: neither, do I onely not take him
to be <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> but that he cannot be accompted ſo much as <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie,</hi>
chiefly, ſo long as he remaineth within this troubleſome bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
the which, to the ende it may be diſſolued, it is neceſſarie firſt
that it be corrupted: but then onely ſhall he inioye this <hi>Felicitie,</hi>
when his ſoule being frée from the trouble of the fleſh, ſhal liue
wholy in <hi>Spirite.</hi> Yet this I deny not, but that <hi>God,</hi> who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penceth
our wel doing with an incomparable rewarde, hath ſo
ordayned, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they which here in the dayly miſeries &amp; aduerſities
of this world behaue themſelues well, and eſchewing the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
baytes of pleaſure, giue themſelues wholy with al theyr
endeuour to the exerciſe of <hi>Vertue,</hi> paynefully wading through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the daungers and troubles of aduerſitie to attayne to the
ſame: that they I ſay, euen here in this life ſhall receiue at hys
handes, a certaine pledge of their bliſfulneſſe to come, whereby
theyr trauailes may ſéeme vnto them leſſe gréeuous and heauy.
Which pledge I meane, to be the confidence and hope that in
them remayneth, ioyfully to attaine to that eternal glory which
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1714:23"/>
by his word he hath promiſed: wherof euil men on the otherſide,
by occaſion of their naughtineſſe, ſée themſelues to be depriued,
ſo as, by the terror of their wickendneſſe which they haue wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye
committed, they liue alwayes in feare, whiche feare of
theirs, ſo troubleth and diſquieteth theyr guiltie mindes, that
they alwayes ſtande in dread of the vengeance of God: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
it followeth, that they ſuſpecte euery thing, they ſtande in
feare of euery thing, and that <hi>Death</hi> is to them ſo hateful an eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
that if it were poſſible, they would neuer ſo much as thinke
of the ſame: the remembraunce whereof, if by chaunce or occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it fal into their mindes, forthwith they tremble and become
ſo feareful, that they are therewithall bereaued of al their quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:

               <p>By this reaſon it
ſéemeth then, that we may lawfully confute y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of thoſe,
who ſay that <hi>Vertue</hi> is the greateſt <hi>Good,</hi> or <hi>Felicitie</hi> it ſelfe. For
<hi>Vertue</hi> as I take it, is not in déede that ſole and ſoueraigne
<hi>Good,</hi> but rather a worker and procurer of the ſame, foraſmuch
as thereto we cannot attaine, without the helpe and aſſiſtaunce
of <hi>Vertue.</hi> For, as <hi>Vice</hi> it ſelfe although it be <hi>euil,</hi> yet is not that
extreme &amp; moſt peſtiferous <hi>Euil,</hi> ſo <hi>Vertue,</hi> although it be <hi>Good,</hi>
yet is it not that ſole and <hi>Selfe good</hi> whiche we call <hi>Felicitie,</hi>
ſince <hi>Selfe good</hi> is that, whiche néedeth not the aſſiſtaunce of
any other ſuperiour <hi>Good:</hi> but <hi>Vertue</hi> we finde, that it craueth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
helpe of a further <hi>Good,</hi> and therfore it may not (as I haue ſaid)
be termed <hi>Felicitie:</hi> but rather a ſtep or degrée, wherby we aſcend
vnto the maieſtie of <hi>God,</hi> who is in déed, that vndoubted, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſt

of <hi>Vertue</hi> (as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> terme it) we are gloriouſly aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
Therefore to conclude, that inferiour <hi>Good</hi> whiche we call

Wherfore, if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neglecting y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtudy of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> wherby

generally for the whole eſtate. Wherefore, the <hi>Minde</hi> of man

For, if the <hi>Minde</hi> be well and in good plight, our talke, our

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of things natural: For, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> goodneſſe of the <hi>Mind</hi> which

that all men by a ſpeciall inſtinct of <hi>Nature</hi> are deſirouſly giuen

                  <hi>Vertue,</hi> that
we reduce our talke againe vnto that, whiche was the onely oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of all our controuerſie. And to be ſhorte, I wyll firſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
vnto you my opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what I thinke of the matter: touching
whiche though manye things I confeſſe maye on both ſides
be ſpoken, yet for my owne parte I am fully perſwaded, that
more may be alleaged, in the commendation of <hi>Solitarineſſe,</hi> than
of <hi>Societie.</hi> In playner proofe and declaration whereof, you
doubt not I am ſure, but that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of <hi>Solitarineſſe</hi> is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deriued, from this worde <hi>Sole,</hi> or alone: whiche manner of ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
ſéemeth not of it ſelfe ſo much to be praiſed, as in reſpect of
the fréeneſſe and libertie of our minde, which is more when we
liue alone than with company. And yet my meaning is not to
haue ittaught, that by <hi>Nature</hi> we ar made ſo rude, as wholy with
out cauſe to auoyde <hi>Societie:</hi> for by this occaſion, both the bonde
of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the commaundement of <hi>God,</hi> which bindeth vs in
friendſhip to loue one an other, may ſéeme to be loſed. But when
indifferently I wey with my ſelfe, the common condition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
Societie, I ſée among men, that generally to be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for <hi>Honeſt,</hi> which is falſely ſuppoſed to be <hi>Profitable,</hi> and that
all men for the moſt part, by ſeparating <hi>Profite</hi> from <hi>Honeſtie,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour
thereby to ouerthrowe the platforme and ground work
of <hi>Nature,</hi> than whiche there is nothing that maye be compted
more hurtful. For with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> vaine eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and loue of riches, are
the maners of men maruellouſly corrupted, that nothing maye
be founde ſo vile but they dare to aduenture, if therby they may
hope to attaine vnto that, which ſo earneſtly they deſire. By oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
whereof, theſe miſerable creatures driuen on in this ſorte
by the force of euill cuſtome, hauing willingly vnloſed the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> are plunged at the laſte in the depth of all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
whoſe vnſhamefaſtneſſe is ſuch, that boldly and impude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they dayly commit great offence againſt God, againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1714:30"/>
and againſt their neighbours: ſo as, it is vnpoſſible for
any man, (although in eloquence he were comparable to <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſthenes</hi>)
to diſcribe al their vices and madneſſe. All which, if god
ſhoulde dayly puniſh according to deſert, what chaynes, what
priſons, what whippes, or what tormentes woulde be able to
ſuffiſe for the ſame. Beſides, another thing ther is, but whether
it rather deſerue to be laughed at or lamented I knowe not, I
meane, that ſmall and petite robberies are ſeuerally puniſhed,
when great and horrible offences are prayſed and commended:
which was very well noted by a notable pirate, who falling to
the handes of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, made aunſwere to him in his
own defence, that the greater rouer &amp; pirate of them both was
<hi>Alexander</hi> himſelfe, for that where the one did offend for trifles,
the other daylye robbed and ſpoyled whole countries. Theſe
worldlings being therefore caried diuerſely away, ſome wyth
gréedineſſe of <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> ſome with loue of <hi>Riches,</hi> and ſome with
deſire of <hi>Honor,</hi> hauing baniſhed from their harts, al theſe hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome

ſéeme moſt I ſaye to eſtéeme of thoſe things, which are wont
among fooles to be accompted for good. So as to al thoſe of this

to commaunde againe to deſcende vnto the earth: where thinke
you then would ſhe chooſe hir abiding, but in ſome <hi>Solitarie</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe?
For there, liuing in continual meditation, ſhe mighte

alſo teache vs, that <hi>Vice</hi> for the lothſomneſſe thereof were to be

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1714:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
created the worlde for none other intent, but onely that thereby
he might make vs pertakers, of his glorious <hi>Felicitie.</hi> For proofe
wherof, (leauing in this place to meddle with <hi>Diuinitie</hi>) we wyll
only conſider, what the auntient <hi>Philoſophers</hi> haue ſayde of the
ſame, and firſt of <hi>Seneca.</hi> Do you demaunde (ſaith he) what was
the cauſe why God made the worlde? I anſwere, his goodneſſe:
which thing he farther auoucheth, from the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi>
where thus he diſputeth. What cauſed god to make the world?
he is good, he maketh good things, and enuieth not good men, to
haue part of that good wherewith he is ſtored. Furthermore,
whereas he chargeth vs, to exerciſe pittie towards our parents,
our friends, our countrey, and generally vnto al men, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
he willeth vs, to deale no worſe with others, than we would

that is a dealer in the world, ſo ſoon as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day beginneth to apere,

home, to walk abrode, or at libertie to go wherſoeuer he luſteth.
That man goeth foorth to the place of pleading, with a ſad and
louring countenance, ful of complaints, ful of buſineſſe, yea full
of trouble, and ſo beginneth the day with ſtrife &amp; debate. This
man goeth out with a chéerefull heart, directing his courſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

him, ſo the feare of his follie likewiſe interrupteth him, wherby

the priuate penurie of his <hi>contemplatiue libertie,</hi> than the publike

where ſhuttyng him vp into ſome priuate corner, he ſhroudeth
ſecretely from the ſight of all his clientes. The other agayne,
as a man without trouble or care of the worlde, fynding out
ſome Gréene and <hi>Solitarie</hi> banke, amidde ſome calme and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant

the which (as ſayth the <hi>Satyrical Poet,</hi>) maye ſafely be required
without danger of offence, that is, <hi>A holſome minde in a helthfull
body.</hi> This doone, knowing after that the ſtudie of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi>
bringeth with it great knowledge and excellencie, he diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
applieth his minde to the ſame, and laboureth chiefly to make

and that it were wholy in vaine, to repoſe his truſt in anye

perfection, that certainly knoweth wherein he ought chiefly
to take pleaſure and delight, and whoſe <hi>Felicitie</hi> conſiſteth not

(I ſay) the queſtion: Whether it were more conuenient for this

in the affaires of the worlde. Wherein, if I ſhall ſaye my

a contrarie opinion to that which is ſpoken, eſpecially, ſince the
fruite of our <hi>Wit,</hi> our <hi>Vertue,</hi> our <hi>Learning,</hi> and euery other good
qualitie of ours, is then ſayde to be chiefly commended, when it
is employed to the benefite of our neighbous: And that <hi>God</hi> him

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1714:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as one verie bodie, to the only ende, that one man might ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 
                  <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> by a fable of <hi>Eſope,</hi> did cunningly reconcile

in mynd of the common prouerb, <hi>That one man liueth by the

created ſo general, that he coulde throughly ſupplye the wante
of the thing, that was requiſite and néedefull for himſelfe: the
which as we may gather, was ſo fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt, prouided of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that one man in this ſorte néeding helpe of another, with
charitie therefore might cheriſh &amp; loue one another the rather.
And for this occaſion wée may likewiſe ſay, that euery Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey

the people. By theſe and lyke reaſons, it therefore appeareth
that the dutie of a wiſe man, is to ſéeke to profit euery man as

himſelfe to be ſent into the world, that therby (folowing

Citie, and there to endeuour as well as hée maye to doe that
which is good: neither ought there any peril to be ſo great, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
he, in the mayntenance of <hi>Truth</hi> ought not boldly to aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſaying, with <hi>Attalus</hi> the Stoike:
<q>
                     <l>I rather had in warlike tentes,

               </p>
               <p>And in this point alſo, he ought to followe the iudgemente
of <hi>Cicero:</hi> It is (ſaieth he) more agréeble vnto <hi>Nature,</hi> and
more for the ſafegarde and aide of al nations, to bring vp their
people in continuall trauaile and hardneſſe of labour, folowing
therin the ſteppes of <hi>Hercules,</hi> whom popular report, mindefull

wherewith we are infected, happen by chaunce to lighte
vppon one that is couetous of <hi>Money,</hi> he maye well perſwade
him, that there is nothyng more commendable in hym that is
<hi>poore,</hi> than to contemne <hi>riches,</hi> nor in him that is <hi>riche,</hi> than to
be <hi>liberall</hi> of his wealth, and that if he liue to contente <hi>Nature,</hi>
he ſhall neuer be <hi>poore,</hi> if to content his <hi>fantaſie,</hi> hée ſhall neuer
be <hi>riche.</hi> For in this poynt oughte the meaſure of our riches to
conſiſt, <hi>Firſt to haue that whiche is neceſſarye, and lastly no more than
is needfull.</hi> All whiche maye bée had without any trouble, ſince
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1714:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that which is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may be alwais at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: wherby it apereth
that our greateſt labor, is alwais beſtowed in <hi>ſuperfluities.</hi> But
the true deſire of <hi>riches,</hi> is always to be meaſured by a mynde
well diſpoſed, according as <hi>Cicero</hi> in ſome ſorte preſcribeth: If
a man (ſaith hée) haue a daughter, hée hathe néede of money to
marry hir, if ſo he haue two, hée hath néede of the more, if far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he haue thrée or foure daughters, his neceſſitie ſtill encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
but if he haue fiftie, as the reporte is of <hi>Danaus,</hi> ſo manye
daughters, require a greate maſſe to their dowrie: ſo as, to the
néedefulneſſe of eche man, is the meaſure of his <hi>riches</hi> to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.
Wherin, our Poet <hi>Horace</hi> ſéemeth likewiſe, to haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well ſpoken, ſaying:
<q>
                     <l>Who ſo that muche, deſireth to obtaine:</l>

                     <l>He well whom God, in mony, rent, or land:</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>For wante of due conſideration whereof, it commeth ſo
to paſſe, that the <hi>couetous man</hi> ſtandeth ſtill in néede, as well of
that which he hath, as of that whiche he wanteth, <hi>and he always
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth leaſt, that coueteth leaſt. <hi>Epicurus</hi>
                  </hi> therefore writing to <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meneus,</hi>
is reported to perſuade him, that if he woulde enriche
his friende <hi>Pitoclea,</hi> hée ſhoulde not adde to his <hi>wealth,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
abate, from hys <hi>ambitious deſire.</hi> But nowe on the other
ſyde, if ſo he happen to light vppon ſome other, that thirſteth
after <hi>honour,</hi> hée maye lykewiſe alledge, that the deſyre of <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerment,</hi>
althoughe it appeare more honeſte than of <hi>mony,</hi> yet
is it in déede, a verye hard, a tickle, and diſdainefull miſtreſſe:
<hi>for hope of ſoueraintie, refuſeth no condition, of what ſeruice ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</hi>
Yet hée whome <hi>Fortune,</hi> will néedes enforce to become a
<hi>gouernour,</hi> ſhall then moſte rightly deſerue the honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation
of his name, when firſt in himſelfe (as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith)
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1714:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hée ſhall bridle <hi>luſte,</hi> contemne <hi>pleaſure,</hi> ſuppreſſe <hi>anger,</hi> auoyde

of the <hi>minde:</hi> ſince he onely knoweth beſte, how to rule

hymſelfe. For thys is certaine, that neither <hi>meate</hi> nor <hi>drink,</hi>
nor <hi>watche,</hi> nor <hi>ſleepe,</hi> all whyche are neceſſarye for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
are at all times holſome, except they be vſed with <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
and <hi>diſcretion.</hi> So likewiſe, the giftes and caſualties of
<hi>Fortune,</hi> are then accompted bothe profytable and pleaſaunte,
when wée temper and vſe them wyth ſuche aduiſed modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that they rather depend vpon vs, than we vpon them. The
nature whereof is ſuche, that if we couet them without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
we ſhall no more be able to ſatiſfy, that vnſatiable deſire
of the <hi>mynde,</hi> than his droughte maye be quenched, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to drinke procéedeth not of thirſte, but rather of ſome bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
inflamation of hys entrayles, for that is properly no <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi>
thirſte, but an <hi>vnnaturall</hi> diſeaſe. To conclude, if this <hi>wiſe
man</hi> (I ſaye) by theſe and lyke reaſons, can heale in this ſorte
the affections of the multitude, and bring them in the ende to
that temperate <hi>meane,</hi> wherein <hi>Vertue,</hi> is ſayde to abyde: So
that moderatly they may learne, to deſire <hi>riches</hi> without <hi>coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
Honour</hi> wythoute <hi>ambition, Pleaſure</hi> wythoute <hi>Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi>
(if ſo it bée lawfull ſuche, thynges maye bée deſired)
ſuche one I confeſſe, is to be reuerenced of all men, as an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente
member for a Commonwealth. But, to come to that,
whiche I haue hitherto pretended, who is he (I pray you) that
can thus bryng to paſſe theſe notable effectes, ſince for the
moſte parte wée are all ſo nouſled in <hi>lewdneſſe,</hi> and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of our bodies ſo compounded of <hi>iniquitie,</hi> that the one
may not poſſibly be ſeparated from the other: For no ſooner are
we borne and brought into the <hi>worlde,</hi> but wée are foorthewith
infected with all kinde of <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> ſo as wée may ſéeme to
haue ſucked this <hi>errour,</hi> with the milke of our nurſes. Nowe,
when herevnto is annexed alſo, the euill example of oure El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and the licentious diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the multitude, a great and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1714:36"/>
forcible inſtructer of <hi>lewdneſſe,</hi> and that the whole worlde, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
made ſubiect vnto vice: From hence I ſay it procedeth,
that our <hi>myndes</hi> are ſo peruerted with ſuch varietie of <hi>opinions,</hi>
and ſo farre remoued from the goodneſſe of <hi>nature,</hi> that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we ſéeme to enuie in our ſelues hir good inclination, and are
therewithall ſo blinded that fondly we eſtéeme, nothyng more
worthy, nothing more commendable, nor nothing more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be ſought for on the earth, than <hi>wealth,</hi> than <hi>honour,</hi> yea
than the <hi>vayn</hi> commendation of the <hi>people.</hi> And therfore, though
ſome perchance do liſten to the <hi>truth,</hi> and ſéeme to conſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a while
to the ſame, yet afterwards, perceyuing the multitude to be of
an other opinion, than they are of themſelues, forthwith theyr
<hi>reaſon</hi> is caried away with <hi>affection,</hi> as with a violent ſtreame,
and ſo they chooſe rather with many to erre, than wyth fewe to
iudge aright. Thus by this meanes wée are daylye rooted and
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> confirmed in our euill, and the rather by thrée occaſions. The
firſte, through the faulte of ſuch ignorant <hi>gouernours,</hi> as beſtow
their offices and titles of <hi>honour,</hi> not vpon the <hi>vertuous</hi> and wel
diſpoſed, as of right they ought, but rather vpon flatterers, and
ſuche as are contente, to humble and ſubmit themſelues vnto
their flauery: to the manifeſt hindra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and decay of ſuch other,
as are rarely endued with moſt towardly wits, who with <hi>honor</hi>
might be noriſhed, and with <hi>glorie</hi> enflamed, to the delighte of
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſome good and profitable ſtudy. The ſecond, through the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
diſſimulation of thoſe, who bearing openly a face of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,
as pretending, as thoughe they were frée fro the faultes
of others, yet priuily bluſhe not by right or by wrong, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
vnto themſelues, eyther <hi>honour, riches,</hi> or what elſe ſoeuer,
they ſéeme vnto the worlde moſt of all to neglect: yea and that,
whiche not long before they condemned in others, to the ende
that therby, they might ſéeme leſſe carefull therof themſelues.
But foraſmuche as all fained and counterfaite things, do ſoone
fade away, the <hi>Truth,</hi> which theſe men go about by cunning to
oppreſſe, could not ſo long haue bin concealed from them, if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
they woulde haue beſtowed anye tyme at all, to haue
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1714:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſought for the ſame. Who ſo long, as they may be held vp with
a little <hi>Proſperitie,</hi> the credite of their eſtimation doth ſhadowe
for a while, all their euil demeanour. But if any miſaduenture,
which thereby diſcouereth &amp; detecteth their <hi>hipocreſie,</hi> doe chance
to betyde them, foorthwith it then appereth, howe great deceyte
there laye ſecretly hid, vnder that their pretended ſhew of <hi>hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie.</hi>
For <hi>true glorie</hi> taketh déepe roote, and ſpreadeth hirſelf very
mightily abroade: where things that are <hi>counterfeyt</hi> can take
no continuance, bycauſe they are daily ſubiecte to decay. And
therfore <hi>Socrates</hi> very notably declared, that he that is deſirous
to finde out the néereſt and gaineſt way to <hi>glorie,</hi> ought firſt to
endeuour to be the ſame in déede, that he woulde be accounted.
But, through ignorance of the <hi>Truth,</hi> and default of thoſe that
ſéeke after <hi>Vertue</hi> without diſcretion, wée are I ſaye ſo harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in oure naughtineſſe, that by the rude and vnciuile behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of ſuch counterfeat teachers, we are brought in contempt
of that which is good: Which thing, is far contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who counſelleth a <hi>wiſeman,</hi> that hée trouble not
himſelfe with varietie of faſhions, nor ſéek, to make the people
to wonder, at his ſtrange kinde of liuing: but rather, to behaue
himſelfe ſo, that all men may learne to follow him in his <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
or at the leaſt wyſe, that he auoide the company of ſuche,
who though they know nothing, yet thinke they know all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and had rather ſéeme to be teachers of others, though raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they perfourme it, than to be learners themſelues, though
greatly they néede it: Which kinde of people, while arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
they ſtriue to bée accompted moſte wyſe, they proue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thereby moſte ignorant fooles. For in this behalfe, wée
reade that <hi>Socrates</hi> by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was adiudged
the wyſeſt, bycauſe, hée acknowledged himſelfe to bée ſure of
this on thing, that he ſurely knewe nothing. But to procéede,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the third occaſion therfore to confirm vs in our euil, is the wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kedneſſe
of thoſe that flatter vs in our naughtineſſe, for to this
inticement the eares of moſte men be open, the glory wherof
in ſo graffed in our heartes, that we all deſyre to be praiſed, yea
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1714:37"/>
and then moſt of al, when leaſt we deſerue it. In which kind of
madneſſe wée are ſo far euergrowen, that we account him for
enuious that flattereth but a little: Whereby it hapneth, that
there is nothyng ſo ſtrong, that flatterye may not vtterly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte
and ouerthrowe. From hence the multitude of prating
<hi>Paraſites,</hi> that daily abuſe the pliant wittes, and gentle natures
of well diſpoſed perſons, doe take their beginning: by whyche
name we call them al, that ſpeake and do eche thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation
of thoſe, by whom they do liue, reprouing them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
for the loue of their belly chere, from whence their name
out of <hi>Greke</hi> is deriued. From hence alſo, that ſaying of <hi>Terence</hi>
may well bée taken, <hi>That Flatterie gaineth friends, where plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
reapes reproche.</hi> For <hi>Truth</hi> is gréeuous, bycauſe, thereof ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<hi>hatred,</hi> whiche is the poyſon of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> but <hi>Flattery</hi> of the
twaine, ought rather to be more gréeuous, which giuing liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
vnto <hi>vice,</hi> ſuffereth a friende to runne headlong into <hi>Follie.</hi>
Wherin, the greateſt faulte vndoubtedly procéedeth, from the
party himſelfe, who deſpiſing the <hi>Truth,</hi> will ſuffer his eares to
be abuſed by <hi>Flattery.</hi> And herevppon I remember, the ſaying
of <hi>Demetrius</hi> to a verye riche <hi>libertine,</hi> that the ende of hys <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi>
was the beginning of his <hi>wealth,</hi> meaning, that when hée
fell into <hi>Flattery,</hi> hée began to waxe <hi>riche.</hi> Yet <hi>Cicero</hi> ſéemeth to
be of opinion, that <hi>Flatterie</hi> is not daungerous, althoughe it bée
hatefull, bycauſe it can procure, the hurte of no man but of him,
that is conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſéeme delighted therwith: which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to none but to fooles, for that they of al others are ſooneſt
ouertaken, with the immoderat affection, &amp; loue of themſelues.
Whervpon, being blinded with <hi>ignorance,</hi> they neither knowe
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they offend, nor take any care to amend their offences, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

What liuing for them that lacke? and finally what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

finde, that ſhe hath framed eche peculiar perſon, to liue to the

made of his <hi>Vertue.</hi> For this is much like as if a bragging <hi>ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour,</hi>

<hi>Demetrius</hi> therefore was wont to ſay, that he thought
no man more vnperfect, than he that in his life time, had neuer
taſted of aduerſitie: For that the man, to whom al things hath
happened to his owne deſire, coulde neuer haue cauſe to make
triall of himſelfe. The which alſo that it is true, I haue expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
on my ſide to approue the ſame: For howe coulde the

you are ouer farre in loue: for this is certaine, that <hi>nature</hi>
hath not onely allotted the ſame as peculiar vnto beaſtes, but
on the contrarie, hath delighted mankinde with the building
of Cities for their abode vpon the earth, that thereby the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in all kinde of matters as well <hi>Ciuile</hi> as <hi>Diuine,</hi> might bée
brought by degrées to a perfect vnanimitie and agréement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

ſtill more ſafe and conuenient, both for auoyding the infection
of the multitude, and for better contentment of our vnconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1714:39"/>
example of our workes, to benefite (if not all) yet as many as
we may. And remember withall, that <hi>Attalus</hi> the <hi>Stoicke</hi> was

it be ſpent in ſtudie or prayer, it induceth vs directly to the

ſayth, that naughtie counſels are there intended, wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
kindled, boldneſſe ſet forwarde, luſt prouoked, and wrath
inflamed, and therefore as a pernicious euill, it ought with
all our power to be vtterly eſchewed, and our bodies to be kept
in exerciſe of labour, that thereby we may ſo driue awaye the

the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> eſpecially aboue the reſt, brought vp their
youth in continuall trauayle, as in hunting, running, hunger,
thirſt, colde, and heate: to the which they alſo enioyned their
women, that where in other Cities they kept them at home, in
their coſtly apparell, both out of the heate and daunger of the
Sunne, in this noble Citie it was nothing ſo, but while they
were yong, they were accuſtomed to labour, to runne, and to
be conuerſant in warre, without reſpect, eyther of heate or of
duſt to hinder their beauties, rather than to liue ſo deliciouſly
at home, as was the maner and guiſe of other laborous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
By this occaſion, the race of the <hi>Amazones</hi> became ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous:
To this intent, the <hi>Romanes</hi> alſo brought vp their
people in the vſuall exerciſe of warfare, learning, and huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie:
For nothing is there more certaine, than that the faults
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1714:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of this ydle <hi>ſolitarineſſe,</hi> are to be auoyded by labour. Wherin,
if I were diſpoſed to vtter, the diuers examples of manye no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
men, what a number might I recite, of thoſe that haue
rather made choyce to liue, not in the wildernes, but in moſte

of theſe you will not yet ſéeme to yéelde, conſider then I beſech
you, in what places, the bodie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> our ſauiour was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

And weigh with your ſelfe, whether his holye Apoſtles
gaue vs any example to lurke in ſuch <hi>ſolitarie</hi> corners, thoſe I
ſay, that being inſpired with the <hi>holy ghoſt,</hi> and filled with <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>

himſelfe to be curſed before the face of God. And forget
not I pray you, where the manifolde numbers of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and
<hi>Biſhop</hi> that are alredy deade, did ſpende their dayes, thoſe that
cared for nothing but to conuert the people to the <hi>holy faith,</hi>

am yet ſubdued: foraſmuch, as the contrary proofes that make
for <hi>Solitarineſſe</hi> are both the ſtronger, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtore of examples

                  <hi>aucthoritie</hi> of moſt approued
perſons a matter ſo apparant, as otherwiſe of it ſelfe is cléere
ynough. And therefore to procéede, where firſt you alledge the
<hi>Solitarie life,</hi> to be bothe odious and contrarye vnto <hi>nature,</hi> for
this occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> chiefly, that it ſéemeth vtterly to aboliſh al <hi>friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
which you ſay, is principally to be preferred, before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
earthly commodities: my meanyng is to make you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that your <hi>opinion</hi> in this behalfe doth greatly deceiue
you. For, if throughly you conſider wheron conſiſteth, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
life and nature of <hi>friendſhip,</hi> you ſhall then perceiue, that as
all things elſe, ſo alſo this holy knot of ours, is by <hi>Solitarineſſe</hi>
augmented rather than decreaſed. For if <hi>vertue,</hi> according to
the true diſpoſition of <hi>loue,</hi> be a thyng that procureth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of all men, and draweth their affections to ioyne friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with him in whome ſhée abideth: How then may it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
happen, that he that ſhunneth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>courſe of the <hi>people,</hi>
to the ende he may auoide all occaſion of <hi>vice,</hi> and thereby the
rather followe <hi>Vertue</hi> more earneſtly, ſhoulde not friendely
loue and fauour thoſe, that beare like affection vnto <hi>vertue</hi> as
himſelfe. And the rather when he knoweth, that the true foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of <hi>loue</hi> and <hi>friendſhip,</hi> is <hi>Honeſty,</hi> whervppon alſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things depende, and is not ignorant, that if the vniting of
good wil were taken from the world, neyther men, nor houſes,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1714:42"/>
nor Cities woulde endure, but that tillage, and all thing elſe,
woulde ſhortly run to ruine and decay: ſince there is no houſe
ſo well eſtabliſhed, nor Citie ſo well fortified, but that by <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
and <hi>diſcorde</hi> it may ſoone be deſtroyed. So that a <hi>wiſeman,</hi>
oughte by no meanes to banyſhe thys comfortable <hi>friendſhippe</hi>
from his <hi>Solitarie</hi> dwelling, neither may he if he woulde, for
<hi>friendſhip</hi> créepeth I know not by what meane, into the ſecrete
dealings of all kinde of people, and ſuffereth no trade of liuing
to be voide of hir comfort: for, though ſome man may be found
of nature ſo ſauage, that he abhorreth all company, as at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
one <hi>Timon</hi> was ſo reported, yet can he not endure to be
ſtill alone, but that, either one or another he muſt néedly haue,
to whome he may vtter the crookedneſſe of his nature. A <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
therefore be he neuer ſo <hi>Solitarie,</hi> wil for his recreation (I
ſay finde out) ſome ſuch honeſt and faithfull friende, as both in
manners and nature maye reſemble hymſelfe, ſuche one, as is
pleaſaunt, learned, faithfull, eloquent, not tedious, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning,
not grudging, not enuious, nor crafty, and ſuch one
as he maye loue and maye loue him agayne, not for <hi>profit,</hi> but
for <hi>vertue,</hi> which onely bréedeth and continueth true <hi>friendſhip.</hi>
For ſuch friendes as are choſen but for <hi>profit</hi> only, do no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
content vs than they are <hi>profitable</hi> vnto vs: which as <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
reporteth is the cauſe, why thoſe that are founde to be very
wealthy, are vſually haunted for the moſt part with company,
and why ſuch as are néedy, are lefte to liue pining in their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
alone. And thoughe it maye peraduenture be ſaide, that a
<hi>wiſeman</hi> hath no néede of acquaintaunce, for that he may ſéeme
ſufficiently contented with his owne company, yet of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
he muſte ſéeke to procure himſelfe friendes, althoughe for
no other occaſion, than that thereby hée maye haue ſome one,
vppon whome he may practiſe his <hi>friendſhip,</hi> leaſt otherwiſe ſo
rare and excellent a <hi>vertue,</hi> ſhoulde wholy lye hidde in him, and
his hap ſo harde, that he ſhoulde not haue one ſo ſpecially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
as for whome at the leaſte hée myght be willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the loſſe of his libertie, for whom to ſuffer baniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1714:42"/>
for the ſafegarde of whoſe life, he might readily aduenture the
loſſe of his own life. For the mutual loue of theſe and ſuch like,
this <hi>wiſeman</hi> therefore without cauſe of offence, maye vſe the
pleaſure of moderat feaſting, allowing in this behalfe the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Epicurus, that to eate without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, is to liue like a wolfe.</hi>
Wherin, though many times it may happen, that by the vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
occaſion of his peculiar affaires, he may not ſtil be abiding in
the preſence of his friend, yet this in his abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce he ſhal not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<hi>that a friend is rather to be poſſeſſed in mind, than in body:</hi> in whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
degrée he may alſo at his pleaſure, either viſite him, confer
with him, helpe him, &amp; togyther enioy ſuche other pleaſures as
from friendſhip may procede. For preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t familiaritie may wel
be ſaid to eſtabliſhe true <hi>friendſhip,</hi> but not to begin or to creat
the ſame, for that is onely to be procured by <hi>vertue,</hi> as before
we haue declared. In proofe wherof we may find a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, who
though they haue liued a long time togither, yet therby growe
not at all into <hi>friendſhip,</hi> bicauſe, of the diuerſity of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and the greate varietie of their repugnant natures: other
ſome again, who almoſt ſo ſoone as one beholdeth the other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
preſently friendes, bicauſe, nothing is more amiable tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <hi>Vertue,</hi> nor nothyng, that ſooner prouoketh a man to <hi>beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</hi>
Therefore then ſynce of all <hi>Societies,</hi> there is none ſo
good, nor none ſo firme, as when good men of lyke condicion
are truely lynked, in honeſt loue and acquaintance togyther:
From hence I ſay it procedeth, that a <hi>Wiſeman</hi> wherſoeuer he
abideth, wil always ſéeke to ioyne frendſhip with ſuche, as are
likeſt to hymſelf, ſuch as with whom he may as boldly confer
as with himſelf, and ſuch as for like loue, mutual zeale, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned
good wyll, are but one and the ſame togither with him
ſelfe: for ſo is the precept of <hi>Pythagoras, that in friendſhip there
ſhould be made but one of many.</hi> But to procéede, ſince of <hi>common
wealthes</hi> there are two ſorts, wherof the one greate, and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſally
Common, that is to ſaye the <hi>world,</hi> the other more
peculiar, wherevnto by <hi>birth</hi> we are priuately allotted: this
man of whome wée talke, ſhall alwayes thyncke it more
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1714:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
commendable to preferre, the benefite of the greater before
the leſſe: for, if ſo it be weldone to helpe one or two, it is reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
muche better to helpe a whole multitude. But the ſame
this <hi>wiſeman</hi> may not well performe, ſo long, as he is conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt
abroade in any publike aſſembly, bycauſe in ſuch places
he can neuer be at quiet, but ſhall ſtill be tormented and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with trouble, as a rocke, with the tempeſtuous waues of
the Sea. For when the people ſhall ſée him, to be any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
vnto them in their manners, foorthwith they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
againſte him, and wyth the ſting of their malice neuer
leaue to torment him, vntill they perceiue him, to conſent with
them in their <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> or to yéelde vnto them in their <hi>follie.</hi>
To the ende therefore that a <hi>wiſeman</hi> may performe, this his
chiefe and principall <hi>duety,</hi> it is neceſſary firſt that he remoue
himſelfe, from the daily throng of the people, and that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
his delight, from the troubleſom concourſe of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
retiring hymſelfe, into ſome ſuche priuate and <hi>ſolitarie</hi>
place, as may be thought apteſt for his owne ſecuritie, and for
the furtherance of hys knowledge in <hi>philoſophie:</hi> that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynyng
among hys comfortable bookes of dyuers ſortes, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them as his friendly companions, ready to goe out wyth
him when he pleaſeth, and to retourne into hys cloſet agayne
when he willeth, yea ready at all times, either to ſpeake, or to
be ſilent, to kepe home, or to impart their ſecretes abroade in
the woddes: he may at his pleaſure, either walke and take the
ayre, or exerciſe tillage, or vſe ſome other honeſt and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
paſtime, as to conferre, to exhorte, to comforte, to warne,
to reproue, to counſell, or to teach the hidden ſtories of things
that are paſte: Where alſo to be ſhorte, he may by his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure,
preſcribe vnto the worlde ſuche a methode of life, as
may perſwade the people, to haue <hi>death</hi> in contempt, to vſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
in <hi>proſperitie,</hi> ſtoutneſſe in <hi>aduerſitie,</hi> and to kepe a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
contentation of <hi>minde</hi> in all their actions. You ſée therefore,
how I admit into this <hi>ſolitarineſſe</hi> of ours, not onely this <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
alone, but alſo wyth hym hys like addicted friendes, and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1714:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
therwithall beſides a general care to benefit the whole world:
For no man doubteth, but that thoſe who in their <hi>ſolitarineſſe</hi>
are altogither ydle, ſlouthfull, and full of dumpiſhneſſe, are of
all men moſt miſerable. My meaning therfore is not, that this
<hi>Solitarineſſe</hi> ſhuld be without company, nor that this <hi>quietneſſe,</hi>
ſhould become either ſluggiſh, or fruitleſſe, but ſuch, as like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Solitarineſſe</hi> of <hi>Scipio Africanus,</hi> maye benefite manye: in
which I woulde haue handled no trifling matters, tending to
vnprofitable toyes, but cauſes, of ſuch importance and weight,
as may not yéelde in the ende, either vnprofitable labour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
gaine, or any fowle or ſhamefull reproch, all whiche I
exclude from this manner of doctrine: but on the contrary, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of <hi>honeſty,</hi> reputation of <hi>vertue,</hi> and rewarde of eternall
<hi>glory.</hi> Furthermore, for that as reſt vnto lande, ſo recreation
vnto wit is ſometyme neceſſarye: I thinke it not amiſſe, if for
the maintenaunce of his health, which nothing as the <hi>Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
alledge, doth more preſerue than moderate exerciſe, thys
<hi>wiſeman</hi> therefore acquainte himſelfe in the trade of <hi>huſbandry:</hi>
for of all things, whereof any gaine may be made, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng
better, nothyng more profytable, nor anye thyng more
conuenient for the reputation of a man. Which was the cauſe
why the <hi>Senators</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> didde in olde time dwell vpon their
farms themſelues, as witneſſeth <hi>Cicero,</hi> who ſaith: that newes
was brought to <hi>L. Quintus Cincinatus</hi> being then at the <hi>ploughe,</hi>
that he was choſen <hi>Dictator</hi> of the <hi>Empire:</hi> and further repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
that bothe <hi>Curius,</hi> and dyuers others were called from
their Countrey houſes, to the office of <hi>Senators.</hi> For <hi>huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie</hi>
among our Elders was had in ſuche price, that if they
called a man by the name of a good <hi>huſbandman,</hi> they didde
hym (as they thought) very greatee <hi>honour.</hi> But ſée alſo,
howe farre foorthe <hi>Horace</hi> commendeth this manner of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
ſaying.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1714:44"/>

                  <l>Whoſe quiet mind from worldly care is free:</l>
                  <l>And frames himſelfe, as erſt it hath bin taught,</l>
                  <l>To weld the plough, ne owes the vſer aught.</l>
               </q>
               <p>What thinke you nowe my friende, ſeing that <hi>Solitarineſſe</hi>
is thus with ſuche a number, both of pleaſant and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
cares accompanyed, will you therfore ſéeme to flée and to
condemne the ſame? eſpecially, when alſo you ſhall ſée that it
hath alwayes bene adorned, with the preſence of moſt nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
perſons: of whome, thoughe the number bée infinite, yet
I hope withoute tediouſneſſe I maye repeate a fewe. As for
example, what ſaye we firſt of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Poets?</hi> did
not they, for the moſte parte ſhunne to dwell in <hi>Cities,</hi> and
wholy ſought, to withdrawe them ſelues vnto their <hi>Solitarye</hi>
manſions? If of <hi>Plotinus,</hi> a ſecond prince of Philoſophers vnto
<hi>Plato,</hi> this queſtion wer aſked, he wold doubtleſſe anſwer, that
this kind of <hi>quietneſſe</hi> wold rather content him, than the whole
world beſides. If of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> the ſame were demaunded, he
would not onely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend this trade of lyfe, but would further
declare, himſelf that he trauailed throughout diuers waſt and
<hi>ſolitarie</hi> places, and that alſo he ſtayed long tyme in the <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi>
therby the rather, to acquaynt himſelfe with <hi>truth:</hi> by
the example of whome, all his ſort of followers named <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi>
ſéeking to auoyde the dayly ſtormes that happen by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
are ſayd, to haue alwayes dwelt in places <hi>Solitarie.</hi> And
that <hi>Democritus,</hi> no leſſe for his part perfourmed the lyke, we
alſo vnderſtand. As concerning the which, if of <hi>Parmenides</hi> and
<hi>Atlas</hi> we further enquire, we ſhal likewiſe finde, that the <hi>hilles</hi>
are yet called by their names, vpon which they dwelled. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if the truth were known, would <hi>Prometheus</hi> himſelf deny,
but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> from he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was miniſtred y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that myſtical tale,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1714:44"/>
that he on mount <hi>Caucaſus</hi> was ſtretched abrode to be deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of a <hi>vulture,</hi> meaning that there, he employed himſelf with
ſuch earneſt attention, to the ſerching out of diuers ſecret mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
that therby his fleſhe was greatly abated, whiche no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
empaireth ſo muche as ſtudy. What maye we leſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture,
either of <hi>Socrates, Plato,</hi> or <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but that they all
delighted in <hi>Solitarineſſe,</hi> though happely at ſome time, eyther
the care and regarde of their ſchollers, or the neceſſitie of the
common wealth, or elſe ſome other like vrgent occaſion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode
their priuate deſires. Further, what ſay we of <hi>Anaxago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi>

that all theſe, purpoſely ſhunning the ſocietie of the worlde,
picked them out ſuch places as ſéemed, moſte conuenient and

he chiefly deſired, to the end therby to accompliſh that rare and

excellent worke, whiche alreadie he had then begon. What of

deſcribed he the <hi>dueties of lyfe?</hi> where painted he out the formes
and natures of the <hi>Goddes?</hi> Where refelled he the opinion of
<hi>Soothſayers,</hi> the roote of all errour? where ſet he downe the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes

of <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> but in his <hi>Solitarie</hi> places of reſt? Wherin,
to the ende his tyme might not vainely be ſpente, he applyed
both his wit and induſtrie (as himſelfe reporteth) to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of writing. Farther, marke alſo what <hi>Quintilian</hi> reporteth
of <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> the greateſt <hi>Orator</hi> among the <hi>Grecians:</hi> That
feruente louer of <hi>Solitarineſſe,</hi> vſed to walke (ſayeth he) along
the coaſt of the ſea, that ſo he might acquainte his eares with
the roaring of the water, to the ende therby to embolden him
ſelfe, the better to endure the daily noyſe and murmure of hys
<hi>auditorie:</hi> this alſo (ſaith he) is that <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> well knowen
to the world to haue painefully lerned, and that in the deſerts,
that excellent arte of <hi>oratorie,</hi> which after elſe where he practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
abroade in diuers notable Cities. If theſe may not ſuffiſe,

becomming after a Citizen and famous ſenator of <hi>Rome,</hi>
wyth no ſmall ioye of minde, remembreth notwithſtanding
his <hi>Solitarie</hi> liuing in <hi>Corſica,</hi> and preferreth the baſe eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that his quiet exile, before this the courtlike eſtate of
his troubleſome glory: for albeit, in another place he ſéeme to
ſpeake againſt <hi>Solitarineſſe,</hi> where he ſaith, that euill counſells
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1714:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are there deuiſed, and ſo foorth as you haue before repeated,
yet if you marke well his words, you ſhall plainely find that
he ſpeaketh the ſame of none but of fooles, and of ſuche, as are
ouer muche ruled by their owne affections: for ſo, we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
wont (ſaith he) to directe the fearefull and dumpiſhe
perſon in his <hi>Solitarie</hi> liuing, that thereby vnaduiſedly he hurt
not himſelfe: whereby it appeareth that he permitteth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this life vnto others, but farther perſwadeth his friend <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius</hi>
to eſtéeme of the ſame, to whom he ſaieth: flée my friend
from the multitude, flée from a ſmall number, yea flée from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one, for I know him not in whoſe company I wold haue
thée to remaine: ſée therfore how well I iudge of thée, that I
dare aduenture to commit thée to thy ſelfe, and to the ſway of
thine owne direction. What of <hi>Scipio,</hi> he that firſt by his noble
actes and approued valor, deſerued the ſurname of <hi>Africanus?</hi>
was not he I praye you ſo greate a fauourer of this kinde of
life, that of himſelfe he was wont to ſay, <hi>that he was neuer more
leyſurleſſe than when he was full of leyſure, nor neuer leſſe alone than
when he was all alone?</hi> for, when thus he was alone, his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
did not reſte and languiſh in ydleneſſe, but was rather ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
wyth moſte commendable cares: And thoſe twoo
things, that is to ſay <hi>Reſte</hi> and want of <hi>Company,</hi> whiche vnto
others were occaſion of ſlouthfulneſſe, to this man were helps
to prouoke him vnto <hi>goodneſſe.</hi> What of <hi>Scipio</hi> hys nephew,
called alſo by the name of <hi>Affricanus,</hi> was not he likewiſe ſo
deſirous of reſt, that ofte times with <hi>Lelius</hi> he would play the
huſbandman, ofte times conferre with him abroade, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times wander himſelfe alone along the ſea coaſte of <hi>Italy,</hi>
where to kepe him from ydleneſſe, he would not ſticke to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
that victorious hand of his, which earſt ouerthrew bothe
<hi>Carthage</hi> and <hi>Numantia,</hi> to the gathering vp of cockle ſhells and
ſtones. What of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> with whome the whole glorye
of the <hi>Thebans</hi> was borne, and wyth whome alſo it dyed: did
not hée (who ſang very well to his inſtrument) commende and
ſette forth his <hi>Solitarie</hi> leyſure, with muſicall harmony? What
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1714:46"/>
of <hi>Achilles?</hi> who thoughte the interchaungeable refreſhyng
of <hi>quietneſſe,</hi> a thing very neceſſary to eaſe hym ſometyme, from
daungerous toyle of his labourſome warfare. What of <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
who in the middeſt of a deſert is ſayd to haue taken (as it
is reported in <hi>Tullie</hi>) that holeſome counſell for the direction of
his lyfe, when by fortune being brought vnto a place deuided
into two ſeuerall wayes, the one of <hi>pleaſure</hi> the other of <hi>vertue,</hi>
at length after much deliberation, deſpiſing that of <hi>pleaſure,</hi> hée
entred the way that ledde vnto <hi>vertue,</hi> whiche brought hym in
the end not onely to the toppe of humaine <hi>glory,</hi> but alſo to the
number and felowſhip of the <hi>Gods.</hi> What of <hi>Numa Pompilius?</hi>
who from a ſtraunger being called (beyond all expectation) to
the regiment of the <hi>Romaine Empire,</hi> when he bent hymſelfe to
the making of any lawes, for the better ſtay and gouernment
of his people, he woulde vſually then departe from all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and wythdrawe hym for a tyme vnto a deſert woode, that
was fiftéene miles diſtant or thereabouts from the Citie.
What of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who alwayes wiſhed to attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this <hi>reſt?</hi> for whatſoeuer hée thoughte of, or whatſoeuer hée
ſpake of, it was alwayes directed to this onely end: this was
the eaſe of his preſent turmoyle, this was the rewarde of hys
labours forepaſſed, and this only was his comfort in time for
to come. Yea what of <hi>Solon</hi> himſelfe, who though of hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealth, he were the firſt law maker, gouernor and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
yet in his latter age he gaue himſelfe (as we reade in <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
his dialogue called <hi>Timeus</hi>) to a contrary ſtudy, and is alſo,
to be reckned among the number of our <hi>Solitarie</hi> perſons. But
I make I perceiue too muche haſte, I muſte therefore tourne
backe a little, for that I haue ouerſlipped the <hi>Quintians,</hi> the
<hi>Curians,</hi> the <hi>Fabricians,</hi> and many other beſides, that haue ſpente
the greateſt parte of their liues in the Countrey. If now to the
example of thoſe you wil not ſéeme to giue credite, call then to
your remembraunce our olde father <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt of al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
and you ſhall finde, that ſo long as he liued <hi>alone,</hi> no
creature was euer more <hi>happie,</hi> and when he was <hi>decompanied,</hi>
no man was after more <hi>vnfortunate</hi> and <hi>miſerable:</hi> for alone he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1714:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtoode ſtedfaſt, and with company he fell headlong to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
After whome, conſider I pray you the generall ſtate, of all
the <hi>Prophetes</hi> and <hi>Patriarches,</hi> and by them it wyll appeare,
that they neyther dwelled in <hi>Citie</hi> nor <hi>Pallace,</hi> but ſhrowded
themſelues in their homely cabines, amid the wide and open
fieldes: in whiche places, they were thought moſte worthy to
talke with <hi>God,</hi> and to receiue from him thoſe promiſes, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
ſince we haue ſéene fulfilled. And forget not withall, howe
ofte the <hi>ſauiour</hi> of mankinde himſelfe, went both to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
and to the <hi>Solitarie</hi> deſertes, yea at the very tyme of hys
<hi>paſſion,</hi> when he prayed for vs ſo earneſtly to his father: by the
manner wherof he lefte vnto vs, a perfect rule and example of
life, expreſſing thereby the way that leadeth to eternall <hi>bliſſe.</hi>
Neither let this be vnknowen vnto you, that his greate fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner
(Iohn) he I meane that with his finger pointed, at the
diuine perſon of <hi>Christe</hi> our ſauiour, made alſo his abode in the
<hi>Wilderneſſe.</hi> Laſte of all, it ſhall not be amiſſe if I put you in
minde, howe the <hi>Solitarie</hi> wooddes of <hi>Aegipt,</hi> at the imitation
of <hi>Anthonius, Hilarion,</hi> and <hi>Macarius,</hi> were after repleniſhed
with the daily reſort of moſt reuerent fathers, ſuch as thought
nothing more carefully to be ſhunned, than the troubleſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, to the end, that with more ſecurity they might
beſtow their time, in the only worſhip and ſeruice of <hi>God:</hi> which
maner of liuing, though many men after with great zeale pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
yet among the reſt, we reade the ſame to haue eſpecially
bin performed, by that wel diſpoſed father <hi>Benedictus,</hi> he whom

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
he was a louer of <hi>vertue,</hi> &amp; an open contemner &amp; enimy vnto
<hi>vice:</hi> wherby, although he had already wel entred (as it may be
thought) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right way to <hi>heauen,</hi> yet to the end, he might thereto
more ſafely attaine, he hath forſooke <hi>Rome</hi> &amp; <hi>Nurſia,</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which,
in the one he was brought vp, in the other borne, ſo y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> by by <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi>

followed his ſteps, and haue bene earneſtly perſwaded, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>example,</hi> partely by <hi>nature,</hi> and partly by <hi>diuine inſpiration,</hi>
to withdrawe themſelues from the daily troubles and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the worlde. Nowe therefore, as touching the farther
commendation of <hi>Solitarineſſe,</hi> which hathe already bene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed,
firſt by argumentes and after by examples, I haue
my friendes no more to ſaye, but onely that it ſéemeth a verye
<hi>heauenly</hi> matter, and therefore, not without greate cauſe, may
it well be named a <hi>ſingular life:</hi> the whiche, that it is in truthe
the very ſole and onely lyfe vnto all other liues, the wordes of
<hi>Cicero</hi> may very well teſtifye. This our <hi>life</hi> (ſayth he) whiche
is called <hi>life,</hi> is indéede <hi>death,</hi> but that other is the only <hi>life</hi> that
is apte for all <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> a <hi>life</hi> that amendeth our <hi>manners,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dueth
our <hi>affections,</hi> purgeth our <hi>offences,</hi> abateth oure <hi>vices,</hi>
and encreaſeth oure <hi>Vertues:</hi> A <hi>life</hi> that is the mother of

the onely mainteiner of all <hi>deuotion</hi> and <hi>holineſſe:</hi> And a <hi>life</hi> to

we haue all one certaine and preſcribed ende of oure

ſame very trade of liuing. In the choice whereof, eche man
ought firſt to be well aduiſed, both howe <hi>nature</hi> hathe framed
him, and how after he hath diſpoſed himſelfe: For ſome there
are to whom the <hi>Solitarie</hi> life is more painfull than <hi>death,</hi> and

with themſelues, nor conferre wyth their bookes, but as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

Neyther is it at all any maruayle, for <hi>Solitarineſſe</hi> wythoute
<hi>learning</hi> is a very baniſhment, or rather a priſon: but, if ſo thou
haue <hi>learning,</hi> then will it ſéeme as pleaſaunt vnto thée as thy

This is the <hi>reſt</hi> that by the ſentence of <hi>Cicero</hi> is ſo plainly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
