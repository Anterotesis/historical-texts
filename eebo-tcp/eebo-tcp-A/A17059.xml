            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Duringe thys tyme that all thynges thus prospered and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed theyr desyres, there happened an horrible daunger, the whyche in one moment had almoste tourned all thynges vppe syde downe. There was one Presidius a citizen of Rome who beynge wont to dwell at Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, in the begynnyng of thys warre stale awaye from thence, and came to Rome.

takynge the dyspleasure in yll parte, had made complaint thereof to Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius wyth request to haue hys good restored again. And Belisarius had ge uen commaundement that it shoulde be so. But by meanes of the warre and of the syege whyche afterwarde ensewed, the souldyers beynge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwyse occupyed and the Captayne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> aboute weightier matters, the thynge was delayed. At the length in thys tyme (as I sayde) whyles all thynges were in ioyfull estate, as Belisarius rodde through the towne. Presidius caughte hys Horse by the brydle, and wyth a lowd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnynge voyce, in the audyence of a greate number, asked hym yf it were meete that a Cytyzen of Rome (who abandonynge all that euer he had to the enemy had fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way naked) shuld also be robbed by his souldiers of that little y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had caryed away w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, and be thus wrongfully

He sayd he had oftentymes putte vp hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playnt vnto him of the wrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that had bene offered, and coulde haue no redresse, and yet they that had robbed hym, had hys good wythin the Cyty, and dyd weare it daylye before hys face. These wordes dyd styrre the pacience of Belisarius verye sore.</p>
               <p>And therfore assoone as he came home he caused Constantine to be called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym (for they were his souldiers that had taken awaye the sworde) and gaue hym a great rebuke for neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of his commaundement so often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes in delyuerynge of the sworde. Marry (ꝙ Constantine) I wyll rather throwe it into the Tyber, then I wyll restore it to that Uarlet. This was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lewdly and presumptuously answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Then sayde Belisarius vnto him, art not thou vnder me?

whyles I lyue. When Belisarius hard hym saye so, he was more angrye with hym then before, and called for the Serieauntes. Constantine kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that it should be to his coste that the Serieauntes were sent for, drewe out his Dagger that hung at his thigh and lyke a Bedlem runnyng at Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarius, and dabbed hym in a lytle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the stomacke. Out of dout yf such as stood by, had not spedely stept vnto him, and wronge the Dagger out of hys hande, and delyuered hym to the officers, Belisarius had surely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, and hys death had drawen all things with it to vtter ruine, &amp; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes had the same day bene made lords of all. But God of hys infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes woulde not suffer so great a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunce to happen. And after at the commaundement of Belisarius, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine was put to death. Within a whyle after, the Gothes attempted to<note place="margin">Treason twise detected.</note> haue taken Rome by stealth, first by a way that they founde out in one of the

And at the field of Mars their treason was detected, &amp; so their attempt was made frustrat. The treason was deuised in this wise.

For had he once set any con uenient number of hys souldiers, ouer on thother side of the ryuer, he thought it would be an easie matter, after the landing of the first, to conuey ouer still mo and mo in the same vesselles. He douted nothing so muche as that the watchmen that warded on that side should escrie hym and bewray his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise.

because that as long as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gothes held that citie, he thought nothing shuld be in rest through Hetruria. Herevpon he deuided his army into thre parts, of the which he toke one with him to besiege Auximum, another he sent by Iustine &amp; Cyprian against Fesules, &amp; the third he betoke to Martine &amp; Iohn Uitalian, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding them to encampe abouts the riuer Po, &amp; to deteyne Uraias with his hoste as long as they could in those borders, to thentent thei shoulde not come to raise any of the siges among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Thuskans &amp; Picents.

yet not withstandyng they brought theyr campe as nere as they could, &amp; be sieged it from a higher ground, where the way lay more plaine to the towne. Belisarius himself with the puyssan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test<note place="margin">Belis. besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Auximu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> company of all, beset Auximum.

Coniecturing that which was most true, namely that Belisarius would neuer procede to the besieging of Rauenna, onles he had first subdued Auximum. When Beli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farius had well viewed the situation &amp; nature of the place, he was past all hope of winning Auximum by force. For the citie standeth vpon somwhat a high grounde, &amp; besides that there were within to defende it, apuyssant band of chosen men of warre, able to geue battell euen in thopen field. So he had none other hope, but only to tame them by famin, for asmuch as there was a great number enclosed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

But lyke as that large compasse of his campe was good to prohibit the portage of things in, so was it vnprofitable against so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain inuasions of the enemie.

And the souldyes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisarius lay so farre one from another, that they coulde not readily helpe at need. By this meanes it came to passe that the enemye continually infested the campe, and diuers skyrmysshes were therevppon fought.

entered into Rauenna and declared their commission, the which things both Uitigis and the noble men of the Gothes were glad to here, and consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto with all their hartes.

And therefore anone after when the commissioners retourned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested him to subscribe the articles he would not put to his hand. The which thing brought the Gothes in a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous maze, fearing to be deceyued vnder a counterfet pretense of peace. In so muche that they beganne to saye openly, they woulde doe nothyng as concernyng the peace, without the consent of Belisarius.
