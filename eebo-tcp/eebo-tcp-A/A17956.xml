            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>HErod</hi> the sonne of <hi>Antipater</hi> (an <hi>Idumean,</hi>) hauing crept by the fauor of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> into the Iewish Monarchie, married <hi>Mariam</hi> the daugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er of <hi>Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus,</hi> the rightfull <hi>King and Priest,</hi> and for her (besides her high blood, being of singular beautie) hee reputia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Doris,</hi> his former Wife, by whome hee had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Mariam</hi> had a Brother called <hi>Aristobolus,</hi> and next him and <hi>Hircanus</hi> his Graund-father, <hi>Herod</hi> in his Wiues right had the best <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>le. Therefore to remooue them, he charged the first with treason: and put him to death; and drowned the second vnder colour of sport. <hi>Alexandra,</hi> Daughter to the one, and Mother to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, accused him for their deaths before <hi>Anthony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when hee was forc'te to goe answere this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation at <hi>Rome,</hi> he left the custodie of his wife to <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phus</hi> his Vncle, that had married his Sister <hi>Sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me,</hi> and cut of a violent affection (vnwilling any should enioy her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him) hee gaue strict and priuate commaundement, that if hee were slaine, shee should be put to death. But he returned with much honour, yet found his Wife ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely discontented, to whom <hi>Ios<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phus</hi> had (meaning it for the best, to proue <hi>Herod</hi> loued her) reuealed his charge.</p>
            <p>So by <hi>Salomes</hi> accusation hee put <hi>Iosephus</hi> to death, but was reconciled to <hi>Mariam,</hi> who still bare the death of her Friends exceeding hardly.</p>
            <p>In this meane time <hi>Herod</hi> was againe necessarily to reuisite <hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Caesar</hi> hauing ouerthrowne <hi>Anthony</hi> his

great friend, was likely to make an alteration of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
            <p>In his absence, newes came to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that <hi>Caesar</hi> had put him to death, their willingnes it should be so, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the likelyhood, gaue this Rumor so good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Sohemus</hi> that had suceeded <hi>Iosephus</hi> charge, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him likewise in reuealing it. So at <hi>Herods</hi> returne which was speedy and vnexpected, he found <hi>Mariam</hi> so farre from ioye, that she shewed apparant signes of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Hee still desiring to winne her to a better humour, she being very vnable to conceale her passion, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ell to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding him with her Brothers death. As they were thus debating, came in a fellow with a Cuppe of Wine, who hired by <hi>Salome,</hi> saide first, it was a Loue potion, which <hi>Mariam</hi> desired to deliuer to the King: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he affirmed that it was a poyson, and that <hi>Sohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> had tolde her somewhat, which procured the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hate in her.</p>
            <p>The King hearing this, more moued with Iealousie of <hi>Sohemus,</hi> then with this intent of poyson, sent her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and presently after by the instigation of <hi>Salome,</hi> she was beheaded.

                  <l>The sweet fac'd <hi>Mariam</hi> as free from guilt</l>

                  <l>Her purest blood had bene vniustly spilt.</l>
                  <l>And <hi>Salome</hi> it was would worke her wracke.</l>
                  <l>Though all <hi>Iudea</hi> yeeld her innocent,</l>
