         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Brief NOTES upon a late SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON,
Titl'd, The Fear of God
and the King, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Affirmd in the Preface of a late dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
Entitl'd, <hi>The ready way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
a free Commonwealth, and the
dangers of readmitting Kingship in this
Nation,</hi> that <hi>the humor of returning to
our old bondage, was instilld of late by
some deceivers;</hi> and to make good, that what I then
affirmd, was not without just ground, one of those
deceivers I present here to the people: and if I
prove him not such, refuse not to be so accounted in
his stead.</p>
            <p>He begins in his Epistle to the General; and moves
cunningly for a licence to be admitted Physitian both
to Church and State; then sets out his practice in
Physical terms, <hi>an wholsom Electuary to be taken eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
morning next our hearts:</hi> tells of the opposition
which he met with from the Colledge of State-Physitians,
then laies before you his drugs and ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients;
<hi>Strong purgatives in the Pulpit, contemperd
of the myrrhe of mortification, the aloes of confession and
contrition, the rubarb of restitution and satisfaction;</hi>
a pretty fantastic dos of Divinity from a Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Mountibanck,
not unlike the Fox, that turning Ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53541:3"/>
opend his pack of ware before the Kid; though
he now would seem <hi>to personate the good Samaritan,</hi>
undertaking to <hi>describe the rise and progress of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
malady, and to prescribe the onely remedy:</hi>
which how he performs, we shall quickly see.</p>
            <p>First, he would suborn Saint <hi>Luke</hi> as his spokesman
to the General, presuming, it seems, to <hi>have had as
perfect understanding of things from the very first,</hi> as
the Evangelist had of his Gospel; that the General who
hath so eminently born his part in the whole action,
<hi>might know the certainty of those things</hi> better from
him a partial Sequesterd enemy: for so he presently
appears, though covertly and like the tempter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing
his address with an impudent calumnie
and affront to his Excellence, that he would
be pleasd <hi>to carry on what he had so happily begun in the
name and cause</hi> not of God onely, which we doubt
not, but <hi>of his anointed,</hi> meaning the late Kings son:
which is to charge him most audaciously and falsly
with the renouncing of his own public promises
and declarations both to the Parlament and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and we trust his actions ere long will deterr such
insinuating slanderers from thus approaching him
for the future. But the General may well excuse
him; for the <hi>Comforter</hi> himself scapes not his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
avouchd as falsly, to have <hi>impowrd</hi> to
those designs <hi>him and him only,</hi> who hath solemnly
declar'd the contrary. What <hi>Phanatique</hi> against
whom he so often inveighs, could more presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
affirm whom the Comforter hath impowrd,
then this Antifanatic, as he would be thought?</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53541:3"/>
            <p>The Text.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prov. 24. 21.</hi> My son, fear God and the King, and
meddle not with them that be seditious, or desirous of
change, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Letting pass matters not in controversie, I come
to the main drift of your Sermon, <hi>the King;</hi> which
word here is either to signifie any supreme Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
or else your latter object of fear is not univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,
belongs not at all to many parts of Christendom,
that have no King; and in particular, not to us.
That we have no King since the putting down of
Kingship in this Commonwealth, is manifest by this
last Parlament, who to the time of thir dissolving
not onely made no address at all to any King, but
summond this next to come by the Writ formerly
appointed of a free Commonwealth, without resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
or the least mention of any Kingly right or
power; which could not be, if there were at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
any King of <hi>England.</hi> The main part therefore
of your Sermon, if it mean a King in the usual sense,
is either impertinent and absurd, exhorting your au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory
to fear that which is not, or if King here be, as
it is, understood for any supreme Magistrate, by your
own exhortation they are in the first place not to
<hi>meddle</hi> with you, as being your self most of all the
<hi>seditious</hi> meant here, and the <hi>desirous of change,</hi> in
stirring them up to <hi>fear</hi> a <hi>King,</hi> whom the present
Government takes no notice of.</p>
            <p>You begin with a vain vision, <hi>God and the King at
the first blush</hi> (which will not be your last blush) <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to stand in</hi> your <hi>text like those two Cherubims on the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53541:4"/>
mercy-seat, looking on each other.</hi> By this similitude,
your conceited Sanctuary, worse then the Altar of
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> patternd from <hi>Damascus,</hi> degrades God to a
Cherub, and raises your King to be his collateral in
place, notwithstanding the other differences you put:
which well agrees with the Court-letters, lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishd
from this Lord to tother Lord, that cry him
up for no less then Angelical and Celestial.</p>
            <p>Your first observation, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. is. <hi>That God and the
King are coupl'd in the text, aud what the Holy
Ghost hath thus firmely combin'd, we may not, we must
not dare to put asunder;</hi> and your self is the first man
who puts them asunder by the first proof of your
doctrine immediately following, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 7. 20. which
<hi>couples the sword of the Lord and Gideon,</hi> a man who
not only was no King, but refus'd to be a King or
Monarch, when it was offered him, in the very next
chapter, <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>I will not rule over you, neither
shall my son rule over you; the Lord shall rule over you.</hi>
Here we see that this worthy heroic deliverer of his
Country thought it best governd, if the Lord go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernd
it in that form of a free Commonwealth,
which they then enjoid without a single person.
And this is your first Scripture, abus'd and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently
cited, nay against your self, to prove that
<hi>Kings at thir Coronation have a sword given them,</hi>
which you interpret <hi>the Militia, the power of life and
death put into thir hands,</hi> against the declar'd judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Parlaments, nay of all our Laws,
which reserve to themselves only the power of
life and death, and render you in thir just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53541:4"/>
of this boldness, another Doctor <hi>Manwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your next proof is as false and frivolous, <hi>The King,</hi>
say you, <hi>is Gods sword-bearer;</hi> true, but not the King
only, for <hi>Gideon</hi> by whom you seek to prove this,
neither was, nor would be a King; and as you your
self confess, <hi>pag. 40. there he divers forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
He bears not the sword in vain,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. this
also is as true of any lawful rulers, especially su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
so that <hi>rulers, vers.</hi> 3. and therefor this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
government, without whose authority you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
the people to a King, bear the sword as well as
Kings, and as little in vain. <hi>They fight against God,
who resist his Ordinance, and go about to wrest the sword
out of the hands of his Anointed?</hi> This is likewise gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
but who is <hi>his Anointed?</hi> not every King, but
they only who were anointed or made Kings by his
special command; as <hi>Saul, David,</hi> and his race,
which ended in the Messiah, (from whom no Kings
at this day can derive thir title) <hi>Iehu, Cyrus,</hi> and if
any other were by name appointed by him to some
particular service: as for the rest of Kings, all other
supreme Magistrates are as much the Lords anointed
as they; and our obedience commanded equally to
them all; <hi>For there is no power but of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1.
and we are exhorted in the Gospell to obey Kings,
as other Magistrates, not that they are call'd any
where the Lord's anointed, but as they are <hi>the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of man, 1. Pet.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 13. You therefor and other
such false Doctors, preaching Kings to your auditory,
as the Lord's only anointed, to withdraw people
from the present Government, by your own text are
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53541:5"/>
self condemnd, and not to be followd, not to be
<hi>medl'd with,</hi> but to be noted, as most of all others
the <hi>seditious and desirous of change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your third proof is no less against your self. <hi>Psal.</hi>
105. 15. <hi>touch not mine anointed.</hi> For this is not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in behalf of Kings, but spoken to reprove Kings,
that they should not touch his anointed Saints and
Servants, the seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the verie next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
might have taught you: <hi>he reproved Kings for
their sakes; saying, touch not mine anointed, and do my
prophets no harm;</hi> according to that 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 21. He
who hath anointed us, is God.</hi> But how well you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
one wrested Scripture with another; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 7.
<hi>They have not rejected thee, but me:</hi> grosly misapply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
these words, which were not spoken to any who
had <hi>resisted orrejected</hi> a King, but to them who much
against the will of God had sought a King, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
a Commonwealth, wherin they might have
livd happily under the Raign of God only, thir King.
Let the words interpret themselves: <hi>v. 6. 7. But the
thing displeased Samuel, when they said, give us a King
to judge us: and Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the
Lord said unto Samuel, hearken unto the voice of the
people in all that they say unto thee; for they have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
reign over them.</hi> Hence you conclude, <hi>so in dissoluble
is the Conjunction of God and the King.</hi> O notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
abuse of Scripture! whenas you should have
concluded, So unwilling was God to give them a
King, So wide was the disjunction of God from a
King. Is this the doctrin you boast of to be <hi>so
clear in it self, and like a Mathematical principle, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:53541:5"/>
needs no farther demonstration.</hi> Bad Logic, bad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics
(for principles can have no demonstration
at all) but wors Divinitie. O people of an implicit
faith no better then <hi>Romish,</hi> if these be thy prime
teachers, who to thir credulous audience dare thus
jugle with Scripture, to alleage those places for the
proof of thir doctrin, which are the plane refutation:
and this is all the Scripture which he brings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his point.</p>
            <p>The rest of his preachment is meer groundless chat,
save heer and there a few granes of corn scatterd to
intice the silly fowl into his net, interlac't heer and
there with som human reading; though slight, and
notwithout Geographical and Historical mistakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as

them a Crane</hi> (a <hi>Stork</hi> saith the fable) <hi>which straight
fell to pecking them up.</hi> This you apply to the reproof
of them who desire change: wheras indeed the true
moral shews rather the folly of those, who being free
seek a King; which for the most part either as a log
lies heavie on his Subjects, without doing aught wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of his dignitie and the charge to maintain him,
or as a Stork is ever pecking them up and devouring
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But by our fundamental Laws, the King is the highest
power,</hi> page 40. If we must hear mooting and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectures
from the Pulpit, what shame is it for a Dr. of
Divinitie, not first to consider, that no law can be
<hi>fundamental,</hi> but that which is grounded on the light
of nature or right reason, commonly call'd <hi>moral law:</hi>
which no form of Government was ever counted; but
arbitrarie, and at all times in the choice of every free
people, or thir representers. This choice of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is so essential to thir freedom, that longer then
they have it, they are not free. In this land not only
the late King and his posteritie, but kingship it self
hath bin abrogated by a law; which involves with as
good reason the posteritie of a King forfeited to the
people, as that Law heretofore of Treason against the
King, attainted the children with the father. This
Law against both King and Kingship they who most
question, do no less question all enacted without the
King and his Antiparlament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> though call'd
Mungrell by himself. If no Law must be held good,
<pb facs="tcp:53541:6"/>
but what passes in full Parlament, then surely in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness
of legalitie, no member must be missing: for
look how many are missing, so many Counties or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that sent them, want thir representers. But if
being once chosen, they serve for the whole Nation,
then any number which is sufficient, is full, and most
of all in times of discord, necessitie and danger. The
King himself was bound by the old Mode of Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
not to be absent, but in case of sickness; or som
extraordinary occasion, and then to leave his substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;
much less might any member be allowd to
absent himself. If the King then and many of the
members with him, without leaving any in his stead,
forsook the Parlament upon a meer panic fear, as was
at that time judg'd by most men, and to leavie Warr
against them that sat, should they who were left sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
break up, or not dare enact aught of neerest and
presentest concernment to public safety, for the
punctilio wanting of a full number, which no Law
book in such extraordinary cases hath determind?
Certainly if it were lawfull for them to fly from thir
charge upon pretence of privat safety, it was much
more lawfull for these to sit and act in thir trust what
was necessary for public. By a Law therefor of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lament,
and of a Parlament that conquerd both <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> &amp; all thir enemies in <hi>England,</hi> defended
thir friends, were generally acknowledgd for a Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both at home &amp; abroad, kingship was abolishd:
this Law now of late hath bin negatively repeald; yet
Kingship not positively restor'd; and I suppose never
was establishd by any certain Law in this Land, nor
possibly could be: for how could our forefathers binde
<pb facs="tcp:53541:7"/>
us to any certain form of Government, more then we
can binde our posteritie? If a people be put to warre
with thir King for his misgovernment, and overcome
him, the power is then undoubtedly in thir own
hands how they will be governd. The warr was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>just</hi> by the King himself at the beginning of his
last treatie; and still maintaind to be so by this last
Parlament, as appears by the qualification prescrib'd
to the members of this next ensuing, That none shall
be elected, who have born arms against the Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
since 1641. If the warr were <hi>just,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
was also just by the Law of Nations. And he
who was the chief enemie, in all right ceasd to be the
King, especially after captivitie, by the deciding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of warr; and royaltie with all her Laws and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
yet remains in the victors power, together
with the choice of our future Government. Free
Commonwealths have bin ever counted firtest and
properest for civil, vertuous and industrious Nations,
abounding with prudent men worthie to govern:
monarchie fittest to curb degenerate, corrupt, idle,
proud, luxurious people. If we desire to be of the
former, nothing better for us, nothing nobler
then a free Commonwealth: if we will needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
our selves to be of the latter, desparing of our
own vertue, industrie and the number of our able
men, we may then, conscious of our own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness
to be governd better, sadly betake us to our
befitting thraldom: yet chusing out of our own num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
one who hath best aided the people, and best me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
against tyrannie, the space of a raign or two we
may chance to live happily anough, or tolerably. But
<pb facs="tcp:53541:7"/>
that a victorious people should give up themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the vanquishd, was never yet heard of; seems
rather void of all reason and good policie, and will in
all probabilitie subject the subduers to the subdu'd,
will expose to revenge, to beggarie, to ruin and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
bondage the victors under the vanquishd: then
which what can be more unworthie?</p>
            <p>From misinterpreting our Law, you return to do
again the same with Scripture; and would prove the
supremacy of <hi>English</hi> Kings from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. as if that
were the Apostles work: wherin if he saith that <hi>the
king is supreme,</hi> he speaks so of him but as an <hi>ordinance
of man,</hi> and in respect of those <hi>Governours that are sent
by him,</hi> not in respect of Parlaments, which by the Law
of this Land are his bridle; in vain his bridle, if not
also his rider: and therefor hath not only <hi>coordination</hi>
with him, which you falsly call <hi>seditious,</hi> but hath su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie
above him, and that neither <hi>against religion,</hi>
nor <hi>right reason:</hi> no nor against Common Law; for
our Kings reignd only by Law: but the Parlament
is above all positive Law, whether civil or common,
makes or unmakes them both, &amp; still the latter Parla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
above the former, above all the former Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
then certainly above all precedent Laws, entaild
the Crown on whom it pleasd; and, as a great Lawyer
saith, <hi>is so transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be
consin'd either for causes or persons, within any bounds.</hi>
But your cry is, no Parlament without a King. If
this be so, we have never had lawfull Kings, who
have all bin created Kings either by such Parlaments,
or by conquest: if by such Parlaments, they are in
your allowance none: if by conquest, that conquest
<pb facs="tcp:53541:8"/>
We have now conquerd. So that as well by your own
assertion as by ours, there can at present be no King.
And how could that person be absolutely supreme,
who reignd, not under Law only, but under oath of his
good demeanour given to the people at his coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ere the people gave him his Crown? and his
principal oath was to maintain those Laws which
the people should chuse? If then the Law it self,
much more he who was but the keeper and minister
of Law, was in thir choice; and both he subordinat
to the performance of his duty sworn, and our sworn
allegiance in order only to his performance.</p>
            <p>You fall next on the <hi>Consistorian Schismatics;</hi> for
so you call Presbyterians, page 40; and judge them
to have <hi>enervated the Kings Supremacie by thir opinions
and practice, differing in many things only in terms from
Poperie;</hi> though some of those principles which you
there cite concerning Kingship, are to be read in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotles</hi>
Politics, long ere Popery was thought on.
The Presbyterians therefor it concerns to be well
forewarnd of you betimes; and to them I leave you.</p>
            <p>As for your examples of seditious men, page 54,
&amp;c. <hi>Cora, Absalom, Zimri, Sheba,</hi> to these you might
with much more reason have added your own
name, who <hi>blow the Trumpet of sedition</hi> from your
Pulpit against the present Government: in reward
wherof they have sent you by this time, as I hear,
<hi>to</hi> your <hi>own place,</hi> for preching open sedition, while
you would seem to preach against it.</p>
            <p>As for your appendix annext of the <hi>Samaritan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd,</hi>
finding it so foul a libell against all the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
of this land, since the very time of <hi>Ship-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53541:8"/>
against the whole Parlament, both Lords and
Commons, except those that fled to <hi>Oxford,</hi> against
the whole reformed Church, not only in <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Scotland,</hi> but all over <hi>Europ</hi> (in comparison
wherof you and your Prelatical partie are more
truly schismatics and sectarians, nay more properly
<hi>fanatics</hi> in your <hi>fanes</hi> and guilded temples, then those
whom you revile by those names) and meeting with
no more Scripture or solid reason in your <hi>Samaritane
wine and oyle,</hi> then hath already bin found sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and adulterate, I leave your malignant narrative,
as needing no other confutation, then the just censure
already pass'd upon you by the Councel of State.</p>
