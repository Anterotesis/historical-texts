            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am an ill Oratour; and in truth, vse to indite more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly then eloquently, for t'is my custome to speake as I think, and write as I speake.</p>
            <p>In plainenesse therefore vnderstand, that in some things I have willingly er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as in supposing a Duke of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and in taking names different from that Citties families: for which some may wittily accuse me, but my defence shall bee as honest, as many reproofes vnto mee have been most malicious. Since (I heartily protest) t'was my care to write so farre from reasonable offence, that even strangers, in whose State I layd my Scene, should not from thence draw any disgrace to any, dead or living. Yet in despight of my indevors, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, some have bin most vnadvisedly over-cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in mis-interpreting me, &amp; with subtilty (as deep as hell) have maliciously spread ill rumors, which springing from themselves, might to themselves have heavily returned. Surely I desire to satisfie eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firme spirit, who in all his actions, proposeth to himselfe no more ends then God and vertue doe, whose intentions are alwayes simple: to such I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
<pb facs="tcp:12578:3"/>
that with my free vnderstanding, I have not glanced at disgrace of any, but of those, whose vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet studies labor innovation, contempt of holy policie, reverent comely superiority, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed vnity: for the rest of my supposed tartnesse, I feare not, but vnto every worthy mind t'wil be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved so generall and honest, as may modestly passe with the freedome of a Satyre. I would faine leave the paper; onely one thing afflicts mee, to thinke that Scenes invented, meerely to be spoken, should be inforcively published to be read, &amp; that the least hurt I can receive, is to do my selfe the wrong. But since others otherwise would doe me more, the least inconvenience is to be accepted. I have my selfe therefore set forth this Comedy; but so, that my inforced absence must much relye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Printers discretion: but I shal intreat, slight errors in orthography may bee as slightly or'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed; and that the vnhandsome shape which this trifle in reading presents, may bee pardoned, for the pleasure it once afforded you, when it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented with the soule of lively action.</p>

                     <l>My Ladies shame is mine, O God, tis mine.</l>
                     <l>Therefore I do coniure all secresie,</l>

                     <l>But not before her browes: O Gentlemen</l>
                     <l>God knowes I loue her, nothing els, but this</l>
                     <l>I am not well; if griefe that sucks veines drye,</l>

                     <l>Chance to remooue me to an other world,</l>
                     <l>As sure I once must dye: let him succeed:</l>
                     <l>I haue no childe, all that my youth begot,</l>
                     <l>Hath bin your loues, which shall inherit me,</l>
