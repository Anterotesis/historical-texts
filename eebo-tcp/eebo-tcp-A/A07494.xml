            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Hauing thus briefly deſcribed the manner of his Highneſſe Creation, with the honourable Seruice ſhewne to the Solemnitie, both by the Lords and Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, I ſhould haue ſet a Period, but that the Knights of the Bath, being a principall part and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ſacred Triumph, I can not paſſe them ouer without ſome remembrance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus much out of the Note of Directions, from ſome of the principall Officers of Armos, and ſome obſeruation of credite, concerning the Order and Ceremonies of the Knighthood.</p>
               <p>The Lords and other that were to receiue the Honourable Order of the Bath, repayred on Satterday the ſecond of Nouember to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament houſe at Weſtminſter, and there in the afternoone heard Euening Prayer, obſeruing no other Ceremonie at that time, but onely the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds going before them in their ordinarie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites from thence to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſeauenths Chappell at Weſtminſter, there to beginne their warrefare, as if they would employ their ſeruice for God eſpecially; from whence, after
<pb facs="tcp:12994:10"/>
Seruice ended, they returned into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they were to ſuppe in: their ſupper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all at one Table, and all ſate vpon one ſide of the ſame, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hauing an Eſcutcheon of his Armes placed ouer his head, and certaine of the Kings Officers being appoynted to attend them. In this manner hauing taken their repaſt, ſeuerall beds were made ready for their lodging in another rowme hard by, after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all on one ſide; their beddes were Pallats, with Couerings, Teſters, or Canopies of Red Say, but they vſed no Curtaines.</p>
               <p>The Knights in the meane while were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne into the Bathing Chamber, which was the next rowme to that which they ſupped in; where, for each of them was prouided a ſeuerall bathing Tubbe, which was lined both within and without, with white Linnen, and couered with Red Say: wherein, after they haue ſaid their prayers, and commended themſelues to God, they bathe themſelues, that thereby they might be put in minde, to be pure in bodie and ſoule from thenceforth; and after the Bath, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelues to their reſt.</p>
               <p>Earely the next morning they were awakened with Muſicke, and at their vpriſing, inueſted in their Hermites habites, which was a Gowne of Gray Cloth girded cloſe, and a Hoode of the ſame, and a linnen Coife vnderneath, and an Hankercher hanging at his girdle, cloth Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings ſoaled with Leather, but no Shooes; and
<pb facs="tcp:12994:10"/>
thus apparelled, their Eſquiers Gouernors, with the Heralds wearing the Coates of Armes, and ſundry ſorts of winde-Inſtruments before them, they proceede from their lodging, the meaneſt in order formoſt, as the nighr before, vntill they came to the Chappell, where after Seruice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their Oath was miniſtred vnto them by the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> Lord Marſhall, and the Earle of <hi>Penbroke</hi> Lord Chamberlaine, in a ſolemne and ceremonious manner, all of them ſtanding foorth before their ſtalles, and at their coming out making low reuerence towards the Altar, by which the Commiſſioners ſate, then were they brought vp by the Heralds by two at once, the chiefeſt firſt, and ſo the reſt, till all ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuely had receiued their Oath, which in effect was this; That aboue all things they ſhould ſeek the honour of God, and maintenance of true Religion, loue their Soueraigne, ſerue their Countrie, helpe Maydens, Widdowes, and Orphans, and (to the vtmoſt of their power) cauſe Equity and Iuſtice to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>This day, whileſt they were yet in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, wine and ſweet meates were brought them, and they departed to their Chamber to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed of their Hermites weedes, and were reueſted in Roabes of Crimſon Taffata, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying they ſhould be Martiall men, the Robes lined with white Sarcenet, in token of Sincerity, hauing white Hattes on their heads, with white Feathers, white Bootes on their legges, and
<pb facs="tcp:12994:11"/>
white Gloues tied vnto the ſtrings of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: all which performed, they mount on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, the Saddle of blacke leather, the Arſon white, Stirrop leathers blacke, gilt, the pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of blacke leather, with a croſſe Paty of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thereon, and without a Crupper, the Bridle likewiſe blacke, with a croſſe Paty on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or Frontlet: each Knight betweene his two Eſquiers well apparrelled, his Footeman at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, and his Page riding before him, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword with the hiltes vpward, in a white leather Belt without Buckles or Studdes, and his Spurres hanging thereon.</p>
               <p>In this order ranked, euery man according to his degree, the beſt or chiefeſt firſt, they rode faire and ſoftly towards the Court, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounding, and the Heralds all the way ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before them being come to the Kings hall, the Marſhall meetes them, who is to haue their horſes, or elſe 100. s. in money for his Fee: then conducted by the Heralds, and others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted for that purpoſe, his Maieſtie ſitting vnder his Cloth of Eſtate, gaue to them their Knighthood in this manner:</p>
               <p>Firſt, the principall Lord that is to receiue the Order, comes, led by his two Eſquiers, and his Page before him, bearing his Sword and Spurs, and kneeleth downe before his Maieſtie, the Lord Chamberlain takes the Sword of the page, and deliuers it to the King, who puts the Belt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the necke of the Knight, aſlope his breaſt,
<pb facs="tcp:12994:11"/>
placing the Sword vnder his left Arme: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Nobleman of the chiefe about the King, puts on his Spurres, the right Spurre firſt; and ſo is the ceremony performed. In this ſort Lord <hi>Maltreuers</hi> ſonne and heire to the Erle of Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, Lord Marſhall, which was the principall of this number, being firſt created, the reſt were all conſequently knighted alike: And when the ſolemnitie thereof was fully finiſhed, they all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in order as they came, ſauing ſome ſmall difference, in that the yongeſt or meaneſt knight went now formoſt, &amp; their Pages behinde them.</p>
               <p>Coming backe to the Parliament houſe, their dinner was ready prepared in the ſame rowme, and after the faſhion as their ſupper was the night before; but being ſet, they were notto taſte of any thing that ſtood before them, but with a modeſt carriage, and gracefull abſtinence, to refraine: diuers kindes of ſweet Muſicke ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the while; and after a conuenient time of ſitting, to ariſe, and withdraw themſelues, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Table ſo furniſhed to their Eſquiers and Pages.</p>
               <p>About fiue of the clocke in the afternoone, they rode againe to Court, to heare Seruice in the Kings Chappell, keeping the ſame order they did at their returne from thence in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, euery Knight riding betweene his two Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers, and his Page following him.</p>
               <p>At their entrance into the Chappell, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds conducting them, they make a ſolemne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence,
<pb facs="tcp:12994:12"/>
the yongeſt Knight beginning, the reſt orderly enſuing, and ſo one after another take their ſtanding before their Stalls, where all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed, the eldeſt Knight maketh a ſecond Reuerence, which is followed to the yongeſt, and then all aſcend into their Stalls, and take their accuſtomed places.</p>
