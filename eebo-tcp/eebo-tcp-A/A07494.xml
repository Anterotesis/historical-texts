            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Hauing thus briefly de≈øcribed the manner of his Highne≈ø≈øe Creation, with the honourable Seruice ≈øhewne to the Solemnitie, both by the Lords and Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, I ≈øhould haue ≈øet a Period, but that the Knights of the Bath, being a principall part and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this ≈øacred Triumph, I can not pa≈ø≈øe them ouer without ≈øome remembrance: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus much out of the Note of Directions, from ≈øome of the principall Officers of Armos, and ≈øome ob≈øeruation of credite, concerning the Order and Ceremonies of the Knighthood.</p>
               <p>The Lords and other that were to receiue the Honourable Order of the Bath, repayred on Satterday the ≈øecond of Nouember to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament hou≈øe at We≈øtmin≈øter, and there in the afternoone heard Euening Prayer, ob≈øeruing no other Ceremonie at that time, but onely the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds going before them in their ordinarie ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites from thence to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the ≈øeauenths Chappell at We≈øtmin≈øter, there to beginne their warrefare, as if they would employ their ≈øeruice for God e≈øpecially; from whence, after
<pb facs="tcp:12994:10"/>
Seruice ended, they returned into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber they were to ≈øuppe in: their ≈øupper was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all at one Table, and all ≈øate vpon one ≈øide of the ≈øame, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> hauing an E≈øcutcheon of his Armes placed ouer his head, and certaine of the Kings Officers being appoynted to attend them. In this manner hauing taken their repa≈øt, ≈øeuerall beds were made ready for their lodging in another rowme hard by, after the ≈øame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, all on one ≈øide; their beddes were Pallats, with Couerings, Te≈øters, or Canopies of Red Say, but they v≈øed no Curtaines.</p>
               <p>The Knights in the meane while were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne into the Bathing Chamber, which was the next rowme to that which they ≈øupped in; where, for each of them was prouided a ≈øeuerall bathing Tubbe, which was lined both within and without, with white Linnen, and couered with Red Say: wherein, after they haue ≈øaid their prayers, and commended them≈øelues to God, they bathe them≈øelues, that thereby they might be put in minde, to be pure in bodie and ≈øoule from thenceforth; and after the Bath, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them≈øelues to their re≈øt.</p>
               <p>Earely the next morning they were awakened with Mu≈øicke, and at their vpri≈øing, inue≈øted in their Hermites habites, which was a Gowne of Gray Cloth girded clo≈øe, and a Hoode of the ≈øame, and a linnen Coife vnderneath, and an Hankercher hanging at his girdle, cloth Stoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings ≈øoaled with Leather, but no Shooes; and
<pb facs="tcp:12994:10"/>
thus apparelled, their E≈øquiers Gouernors, with the Heralds wearing the Coates of Armes, and ≈øundry ≈øorts of winde-In≈øtruments before them, they proceede from their lodging, the meane≈øt in order formo≈øt, as the nighr before, vntill they came to the Chappell, where after Seruice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, their Oath was mini≈øtred vnto them by the Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> Lord Mar≈øhall, and the Earle of <hi>Penbroke</hi> Lord Chamberlaine, in a ≈øolemne and ceremonious manner, all of them ≈øtanding foorth before their ≈øtalles, and at their coming out making low reuerence towards the Altar, by which the Commi≈ø≈øioners ≈øate, then were they brought vp by the Heralds by two at once, the chiefe≈øt fir≈øt, and ≈øo the re≈øt, till all ≈øucce≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiuely had receiued their Oath, which in effect was this; That aboue all things they ≈øhould ≈øeek the honour of God, and maintenance of true Religion, loue their Soueraigne, ≈øerue their Countrie, helpe Maydens, Widdowes, and Orphans, and (to the vtmo≈øt of their power) cau≈øe Equity and Iu≈øtice to be ob≈øerued.</p>
               <p>This day, while≈øt they were yet in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, wine and ≈øweet meates were brought them, and they departed to their Chamber to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robed of their Hermites weedes, and were reue≈øted in Roabes of Crim≈øon Taffata, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying they ≈øhould be Martiall men, the Robes lined with white Sarcenet, in token of Sincerity, hauing white Hattes on their heads, with white Feathers, white Bootes on their legges, and

white Gloues tied vnto the ≈øtrings of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: all which performed, they mount on hor≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, the Saddle of blacke leather, the Ar≈øon white, Stirrop leathers blacke, gilt, the pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of blacke leather, with a cro≈ø≈øe Paty of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thereon, and without a Crupper, the Bridle likewi≈øe blacke, with a cro≈ø≈øe Paty on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or Frontlet: each Knight betweene his two E≈øquiers well apparrelled, his Footeman at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, and his Page riding before him, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Sword with the hiltes vpward, in a white leather Belt without Buckles or Studdes, and his Spurres hanging thereon.</p>
