            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHereas three yeeres ago, dearely beloued, I did write of this matter of Election &amp; Reprobation, which is called Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in a certayn Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie vpon the Prophet Malachie, by the occaſion of this texte:
<q>
                  <l>I haue loued Iacob, and I haue hated Eſau.</l>
               </q>
The which Treatiſe by the rage of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, partly periſhed, and parte dyd come of late to my hands: accompting this doctrine ſo neceſſarie, that vpon all occaſions it ought with reuerence to be vttred to the glory of God, which ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully appeareth in this his riche mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie towards vs, whom he chooſeth from the filthe of ſinne, to ſerue him in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and to the beating down of our corrupt nature, which without this, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth by pride, vnto preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
<pb facs="tcp:3304:3"/>
or falleth by infidelitie to deſperation. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that without ſome taſte of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine prouidence in Predeſtination, there can be no fayth, but eyther a doubtfull wauering, leading to diſpayre, which we haue felte in the Papiſtrie, whyles we looked to our owne weakneſſe and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, not able to endure one houre in the way of righteouſneſſe: or elſe a vayne preſumption of fayned holyneſſe, whyles we beholde our owne beléefe and good works, or the perfection that we doo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine in our owne ſelues, as doo the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtes. Therefore I thought it good according to my ſimple Talent, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie this truthe agayne vnto the worlde, at the Printing of this worthy Table of the great lerned man, <hi>Maſter Beza,</hi> which is ſet foorth in French, Latin, and Italian, and now into Engliſhe, tranſlated by our brother <hi>VV. VVhittingham:</hi> wherein is moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ſet foorth before our eyes the chiefe ground of this doctrine, and the principall poyntes thereof are ſo déepely opened, that there ſéemed to wante no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was poſſible in ſo few lines to
<pb facs="tcp:3304:3"/>
be vttered, yet for the ſhortneſſe therein all things can not be conteyned, but that ſome brief leſſons for the vnlearned (who hath not their ſences fully exerciſed with ſuche déepe ſentences) may well be adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as euery man hereafter ſhall héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto be moued by the ſpirit of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their hearts (that many bearing witneſſe to the truthe of this moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable doctrine nowe reuealed) the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God in chooſing his chyldren may more and more, day by day be diſcloſed: and by the witneſſe of diuers conſenting togither in one, God the father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt may be glorified. For héerein chiefly ſtandeth his prayſe, honor, and glory, that theſe his wonderfull mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towarde his Electe may be prayſed. Nowe there is no meane more apte, nor doctrine more conuenient to eſtabliſh the fayth of the Saincts, than to certifie by the Scriptures, that God hathe choſen them before the beginning of the worlde to be holy to him ſelfe, and ſo written their names in the booke of lyfe in the heauens, that all their ſaluation reſteth
<pb facs="tcp:3304:4"/>
wholly vpon his hands and holy counſell that can by no meanes be altred or chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſo that neyther death, diuell, nor hell, dare nowe accuſe them that are by adoption grafted in Chriſt, who are called of the eternall purpoſe: bicauſe it is God that iuſtifieth, and who dare condemne them? It is Chriſt that is giuen for them, and howe ſhall not all things be giuen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to them? For them that he knewe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, them he ordeyned before, that they ſhould be like faſhioned to the image of his ſonne, and whome he appoynted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe alſo he called, and whome he called, thoſe alſo he iuſtified, and whom he iuſtified, thoſe alſo he glorified, that this eternall purpoſe and counſell of God, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once reuealed to his Saincts, by the effectuall vocation and calling, whiche is the iuſtification of fayth wrought in their heartes by the holy ſpirite, they can no longer doubt neyther of Election, Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, ſaluation, or glorification. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any thing more beate downe mans nature, and the pride of his vayne heart, than to behold the maieſtie of God,
<pb facs="tcp:3304:4"/>
making them by grace ſo farre vnlyke one to the other, who were both one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither by nature the children of wrath, of vengeance, &amp; damnation: as the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull example of Iacob and Eſau, of whom the Lorde pronounceth that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the one, and hateth the other, before they were borne, and the terrible ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce agaynſt Pharao, whome the Scripture affyrmeth that God rayſed vp to ſhewe vpon him his power, and hardened hys hart, to make his name knowne, &amp; ſuche like, which euerywhere are ſet before our eyes to cauſe man fall downe before God, and to feare his iudgements, doth declare. But our Aduerſaries obiect agaynſt vs, that this doctrine is an offence to many, and that ſome abuſe it to carnall libertie. I doo anſwere, that Chriſte is a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone to many, and all the doctrine of the Goſpell is likewiſe ſlaundered by the euill conuerſation of others: yet may we not prohibite the ſwéete floures from the Bées, bicauſe Spiders ſucke thence their poyſon, no more than wée maye ſtoppe the ſunne to ſhyne, bycauſe it
<pb facs="tcp:3304:5"/>
hurteth ſore eyes. But that it may be the glad tydings of ſaluation to the aſſurance of the faith of the one, and a cleare teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation of the other, to the beating downe of the pride of man, thys glorious cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of the mightie God, ought vnto all in this cleare reuelation of the Goſpel, to be offered, opened, and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
            <p>Wherefore by the good wyll of God, we entende to ſpeake of this greate matter, none other wayes, neyther in any other ſorte, then the open Scriptures ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue our ſayings. Therfore we ſay with the holy Apoſtle Sayncte Paule: Bleſſed be God the Father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, whiche hath bleſſed vs with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heauenly things vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſte, lyke as he hath elected and choſen vs in hym before the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the worlde were layde, that we ſhould be holy and blameleſſe before him by loue, who hath predeſtinate vs, that hée mighte fréely chooſe vs to bée hys chyldren by Ieſus Chriſte. Ephe. j. And thoughe there come ſome wicked men
<pb facs="tcp:3304:5"/>
whiche were long before appoynted to this iudgement, whiche doo turne the grace of oure God to laſciuiouſneſſe and wantonneſſe, as holy Iude ſaythe: yet knowe we that we are choſen by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, that the glory of his grace, hys fauoure and mercy towardes vs mighte be prayſed. For wée are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecte and choſen kynred, and hys people by purchaſe, that wée ſhoulde ſhewe the vertue of hym whyche hathe called vs foorth of darkneſſe into this maruellous lighte.</p>
            <p>This people ordeyned to ſaluation onely beléeueth. Act. 13. For thys Electe people onely was Chryſte ſent into this worlde. To them onely is the worde of ſaluation ſente, as Peter ſayth: To the Elect by the foreknowledge of God the father. 1. Pet. 1. Then to know what this Election of God is, and what in the Scriptures it dothe ſignifye. Wée deſcribe and defyne Election to bée the frée choyce of the good wyll of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myghtie GOD appoynting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrybyng in the Booke of lyfe before
<pb facs="tcp:3304:6"/>
the beginning of the world, whom he will haue to be ſaued and compted amongeſt the iuſt. Whom he will haue holy and without faulte before hym to bée his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, by adoption to ſet foorth his glory. This choyſe, this chooſing, this afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoynted purpoſe and ordinaunce of God, is aboundauntlye ſet foorthe in the firſte chapter to the Epheſians. That this commeth of the frée wyll of God and hys onely grace, freely without our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing (contrary to the vayne opinion of the Papiſts and Anabaptiſts) the ſame chapter and the nexte chapter folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dothe plainely teſtifie. Epe. 1. 2. And moſt euidently, the Lord in his maieſtie, ſpeaking to his ſeruant Moyſes. Exod. 33. declared all this to ſtande of his mercy, ſaying: I will haue mercie vpon whom it liketh me, and I will ſhew mercie where it ſhall be my pleaſure, for ſo is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe wordes, I will haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vpon whom I will haue mercy. Paul alſo declaring in this place the woorke of God béetwixte theſe two children Iacob and Eſau. Romaynes. 9. ſaythe thus of
<pb facs="tcp:3304:6"/>
this frée Election, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Rebecca was with child with one and the ſame father Iſaac, before the children were borne, when they had neyther done good nor bad, that the purpoſe of God whiche is by Election mighte ſtande, it was ſayde to her, not for the cauſe of workes, but by the grace of the caller, the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall ſerue the younger. As it is written, ſaythe hée: Iacob I loued, but Eſau I hated. Of the booke of life, Moyſes ſpeaketh, Exod. 32. And Chriſt himſelfe, Luk. 10. Saying to his Apoſtles: Ioy you and be glad, for your names are written in the boke of life in the heauens. And in the 69. Pſalme it is ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked. Let them not be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten amongſt the Iuſt, and put them foorth of the booke of life. And agaynſt the falſe Prophet. Ezechiel. 13. He ſhall not be in the counſaile of my people, nor written in the booke of the houſe of Iſraell. There be two finall cauſes alſo of this eternal purpoſe of the election, the which Paule rehearſeth in the firſt chapter to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians, the one toucheth God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:3304:7"/>
perteineth to man. He hath Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs béefore the foundations of the worlde (ſayth the Apoſtle) that wée mighte be holy and without blame. And thys anſwereth the wicked, which would abuſe the mercies of God to their luſt. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it followeth, He hath Predeſtinate vs, that he might chooſe vs to be hys chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that hys name may bée prayſed. And this ſtoppeth the mouthes of al our Aduerſaries that ſay, that thys doctrine is not to the prayſe of God: ſo that they muſt ceaſe to ſlaunder this doctrine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they wil hinder the glory of God, and denie the open Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Nowe it is to be noted and marked dyligently, that thys woorde Election is taken after two ſortes in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome tymes as it ſignifieth abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the frée choyſe, will, and appointment of God, without the reſpecte of the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the woorde and meſſage of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatyon. And thus ſpeaketh the holy Apoſtle Saincte Paule of Election, ſaying of the carnal Iacob: They were enimies concernyng the Goſpel for your cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:3304:7"/>
but concernyng the Election, they are beloued for their parents. For the gyftes of God, and hys callyng are ſuche, that hée can not repente. Euen as you once were myſbeléeuers from God, but nowe haue attayned mercie, by theyr myſbeléefe, that they ſhould attayne mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie alſo.</p>

And in the late blyndneſſe of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſhe church, wherein we togither wyth our fathers were altogether Idolatrous, all Hypocrites and counterfaite Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, thys abſolute Election whereby the mercyfull Lorde God did reſerue and kéepe hys choſen vnto him in all places, all ages, all countreys, without reſpect of perſons dyd moſt euidently appeare.

The which Election beſides the dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of our conſciences may bée approued by the teſtimonies of theſe Scriptures compared togither. Eſay. 59. Rom. 8. Ephe. 1. Coloſſ. 3. and a very briefe and perfecte deſcription of thys Election. 2. Theſſ. 2. in theſe wordes. We ought to thanke God that he hath choſen you from the beginning by the ſanctifying of the ſpirite and the beléefe of the truth, to the which he hath called you by our Goſpell, to attayne the glory of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. By this gratious election was Iacob dearely beloued in his mothers wombe, and Ieremy knowne vnto God before he was faſhioned in his mothers wombe. Ieremie. 1. And to be ſhort, all other the eleect of God are thus choſen,
<pb facs="tcp:3304:9"/>
ſanctified and beloued from the beginning from before the foundations of the world, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euerlaſting to euerlaſting. For there is no change of tyme with God, ſéeyng that all thinges are preſent in his ſighte. For vnto him a thouſande yeares are but one day, but the courſe &amp; change of times are in vs, our déedes, our knowledge, in mans chaungeable wiſedome.</p>
            <p>This Election muſt of neceſitie driue downe the pryde we haue of our owne ſtrength, our owne power, our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, our owne frée wil, our owne merits, our owne iuſtification of our owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, and bryng vs to the féelyng of the mighty power of God, whiche worketh all in all things, to the reſtoring of all things in our Chriſt, both in Heauen and Earth, by whome we are called into this ſtate, long before appoynted accordyng to his purpoſed pleaſure, by whoſe power all things are wrought, that we may boldly ſay with the Apoſtle, who dare lay any thing to the charge of the Elect of God? It is God that inſtifieth, who is he that can condemne? Who can ſeperate vs (which
<pb facs="tcp:3304:9"/>
are thys choſen Iacob) from the loue of God.</p>
            <p>Can affliction? Can anguiſh? Can perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution? Can hunger? Can nakednes? Can peryll? Can the ſword? For I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſayth he, that neyther death nor life, nor Angell, nor power, nor thyngs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, nether things to come, nether height nor depth, neyther any creature can ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue of God in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu our Lord. Lo this is the loue wher with the Lorde loueth his Iacob, wherby we ſay: O heauenly father, Lord of heauen and earth, it hath pleaſed thée that thou mighte ſhew thy greate goodneſſe moſte liberally &amp; fréely towards vs, before that we were, and therefore before we had done eyther good or euil, without any our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites or deſeruings onely thorough thy frée mercy to elect and chooſe, ordayne and appoynte vs Heyres of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, and thereby to make all thinges perteining to our ſaluation ſo fyrme and ſure, that they can not ſtagger, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, nor fayle. Where contrarywiſe if they dydde hang of our worthineſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:3304:10"/>
we ſhould euer be doubtefull, bicauſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man is a lyer, and all our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is like a ſpotted clothe, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but counterfeyte hypocriſie, wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the balance of thy ſeuere iuſtice.

Wherefore we doo laude &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie thy name worlde withoute ende. So be it.</p>
            <p>Nowe after thys doctrine of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and loue of God towarde Iacob, the hating and Reprobation of Eſau muſt lykewiſe be declared, &amp; though the aduerſaries of thys doctrine do ſéeme to denye that there is anye ſuche Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the wicked, yet the wordes are ſo playne in Malachie and Romaines. 9. that nothyng can be more euidente. For what can be more playnely ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for thys purpoſe, then that God ſhoulde ſay before the children were borne, that he hated Eſau.

            <p>Thus was Pharao the manifeſt ſcurge and rodde of God, to correct, to chaſtice, &amp; to exerciſe the Iſraelites, and to ſpread the power of God through all the world.

            <p>Agayne the Lorde ſayth, Nowe ſhall I ſtretche my hande to ſtryke thée, and thy people with a plague, and thou ſhalt periſhe from the earth, for therefore haue I cauſed thée to ſtande (for ſo is the Hebrue woorde) that I may ſhewe in thée my ſtrength, and that my name may be renowmed through al the earth.

Doo thou what ſhall pleaſe thée, to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vs thy ſeruaunts &amp; children, depending of thy hands, ſo muche of the lyght of thy countenance, and at ſuch tymes as ſhall ſéeme good to thy wiſdome and fatherly mercie. In the meane tyme thus reſtyng wholy vpon thée, neither can we diſpaire, neither will we be too muche careful, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we can not attayn to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of many of thy works, neither to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandyng of many places of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but we wil confeſſe vnto thee the weakneſſe of our faith, wayting alwayes for further reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy glorious light to be vttered vnto vs, when thou ſhalt thinke of thy Fatherly beneuolence and goodneſſe méete and conuenient, knowing moſte ſurely that thou wilt pitie our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhe infanſy, and cauſe the ſame to ſerue
<pb facs="tcp:3304:18"/>
for thy glory and oure great commoditie, ſéeing that we do erre and are childiſh, as ſonnes before ſuche a Father whiche can not put off hys Fatherly pitie, but rather as thou haſte broughte vs vnto thee, to be the heyres of thy kingdome by the bloode of thy naturall ſonne, ſo we be moſte ſure that thou wilte lighten vs in the ende, with the full fruition of the brighte lighte of thy contenaunce, that we may ſee thée and knowe thée as thys thy ſonne oure Redéemer know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, yea, ſee thee oure Father, face to face, and knowe as we be knowen. Thus reſte we onely of thy hande to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creace oure knowledge at thy good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, O mighty Lorde and moſte mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull father. So be it.</p>
            <p>If you can thus ſubmitte your ſelues, good brethren, too the wiſedome of God, working in vs weakelinges what him lyketh. All the ſtomblyng ſtockes whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che myghte offende you, may eaſelie be remoued. There bée two thynges eſpecially whyche doo ſéeme too ſtande agaynſte thys doctrine of Election and
<pb facs="tcp:3304:18"/>
Reprobation, or of God hys gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and prouidence, for all is one in effect, the one toucheth God, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man. The fyrſte and principall is, leaſte that the wicked do make God the aucthor of ſynne in the Reprobate, the which doubt, we may remone foure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by the authoritie of ſcriptures. Secondly, by the teſtimonie of their owne conſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces which be the Reprobate. Thirdly, by the nature of ſinne. Fourthly, by the maieſtie of God, whiche is bounde to none of his creatures, to make hym this or that veſſell. For the firſte, Sainct Iames ſaith: Let no man ſay when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God, for God, as he can not be tempted with euill, ſo neither dothe hée tempte anie man. But euerie manne is tempted, drawen awaye, and entyſed of his owne luſte and concupiſcence. Then the luſte when it hath conceyued, bryngeth foorth ſynne. Iames. 1. And euen thus it appeared in the fyrſte fall of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. Firſt, though the Lorde oure
<pb facs="tcp:3304:19"/>
God had warned and commaunded the contrarie, oure olde enimie ſtyrreth the concupiſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and luſt of the woman, with the goodnes, pleaſantneſſe and beautie of the apple, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hir luſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiuing this, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth ſinne, entiſing alſo hir huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande to the breaking of God hys com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundementes. Gene. 3. But contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, ſayth Iames in the ſame place. Ia. 1. leaſt you ſhould erre and conceiue any euill opinion of God, euery good gyfte and euerie perſite gyfte is from aboue, diſcending from the Father of light, with whom is no vareableneſſe, nether change into darkenſſe, that hée ſhoulde gyue nowe good things, nowe euill, nowe light, nowe darkeneſſe. No, ſaithe the Apoſtle Paule, let God be true, and al men lyars. Can God be vniuſte? How ſhall he then iudge the worlde? Rom. 3. Agayne, God ſaith by hys prophet Ezechiell: I will not the death of a ſinner, but I wil rather that the ſinner conuert, repente and liue. And vnto wycked Ieruſalem ſayth our ſauiour Chriſt: O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, which ſlayeſt the Phrophets, and ſtoneſt
<pb facs="tcp:3304:19"/>
them that are ſente vnto thée: Howe oft would I haue gathered togither thy children, as the Hen gathereth hir chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens vnder hir winges, and thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not. Lo, thy houſe therefore is left de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate. Math. 23. Lo, héere appeareth the goodneſſe of the liuing Lord, ſo diligently calling the wicked to hym by his woord, by his Prophets, by his meſſengers, and at the length by his owne ſonne, that hée cannot in any caſe be accompted the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their euill, nor cauſe of their fall. But contrariwiſe, their owne wilfull and wicked ſtobberneſſe is the cauſe of their euill, and the onely occaſion of theire fall, as it is written: Thy perdici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſtruction is of thine owne ſelfe, but onely of me is thy ſaluation. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſcriptures to the ſame purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayning. That wée may ſay wyth Daniel: vnto thée O Lorde, belongeth ryghteouſneſſe, and to vs the ſhame and coueryng of our faces. Daniel. 9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly. The teſtimony of the conſciences of the wycked, whiche ſhall accuſe or excuſe them at the greate day, which
<pb facs="tcp:3304:20"/>
is alwayes of the force and valure of a thouſande witneſſes, which is the worme that ſhal neuer dye, but gnawe the wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for euer. Eſa. 46. This conſcience, I ſay, of theyrs ſhall condemne the wicked, and what ſhall God then doo? Or wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is his dreadfull maieſtie to bée char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? Cayne by hys owne conſcience, is compelled to confeſſe: greater is my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes then can be remitted. Thou caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt me from the face of the earth, ſayth he, and I muſt hyde me from thy face. Loo, the iuſte iudgmente of God and his worthy condemnation, openly confeſſed. Who dare then blame God? Cayn dare in no wiſe do it. Neither yet proud Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rao, who condemned in hys owne harte and conſcience, accuſeth him ſelf and his people, and iuſtifieth God, deliuering all men from this wicked blaſphemy, ſaying openly: I haue ſynned nowe, the Lord is iuſte, and I and my people are wycked. Exodus. 9. What doth Iudas? Dothe he not cry likewiſe, I haue ſynned, betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thys innocent bloude. Mathew. 27. And to vtter in déede that thing he felts
<pb facs="tcp:3304:20"/>
within hys breſte, hée is compelled to take aduengance, and execute a iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſte terrible agaynſt hym ſelfe, vttering to all the world hym ſelfe moſte wicked, and that the iuſtice of God puniſhyng ſuch wycked traytours and murtherers, oughte moſte worthily to be feared, magnified, and reuerenced, throughout the whole world. Lyke as all the other wycked and deſparate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whiche for anguiſhe of heart, and terrour of conſcience, do murther them ſelues, doth euidently and continually wytneſſe vnto the worldes ende, that there is a iuſt Lord, the God of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, whom they doe feare, and before whoſe face they dare not appeare to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe hym of any ſynne, but rather ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng the crime, blame, ſhame, and puniſhmente, vnto them ſelues, who worthyly by their owne conſcience, haue deſerued it, dothe thus tormente them ſelues, and with violente handes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the ſynne they haue <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ommyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theyr owne ſynnefull ſoules and bodyes. Thus muſte God alwayes be
<pb facs="tcp:3304:21"/>
found iuſt, and ouercome when he is iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by the teſtimonie of our own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whiche ſhall accuſe or excuſe vs at the great day. Roma. 2. Wherefore let no man be ſo foolyſhe to ſay, that God is the author of euill, vnleſſe he will be accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worſe than Cayn, more proude than Pharao, more wicked than Iudas, or any other the Reprobate from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the nature of ſinne being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyned by the authoritie of ſcriptures, to be a thought, worde, or déed, contrary to the wil of God. For ſuch things onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyle the man, as Chriſt our maſter ſayth, Mathew. 15. and therfore are onely to be accompted ſinne. No ſuch thought can be attrybuted or aſcrybed vnto God, as can be againſt his will, therfore no ſinne can be hys woorke. Neyther canne he bée the aucthor of euill, whiche there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called God, bycauſe hée is the aucthor and gyuer of al good, and ſo farre from euill, that hée turneth all oure euill too ſome good, oure ſynne to the
<pb facs="tcp:3304:21"/>
vttering of his grace, our lyes to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his truthe. No, this is the perfect worke maſter whiche worketh all things without faulte or treſpaſſe, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doo fayle, faulte, and treſpaſſe, and ſinne in all their works, that he may be iuſtified in al his dooings, and al creatures fall downe before his face and preſence. Who though he do worke al in al things, yet doth he worke the ſame to ſuche godly ende and purpoſe, knowen onely to hys maieſtie, that though we be compelled to ſay, God is the author of the fact, yet muſt we anſwere: but not of the crime. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the maſter of the houſe, and Lorde ouer the familie, and therefore may do any thing without the blame of his ſeruants.</p>
            <p>And like as that whiche is no fault in the maſter of the houſe, is a great faulte many times in any of his ſeruantes, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the breaking of their maſters commaundement: Euen ſo doubtleſſe the ſelfe ſame worke is ſinne in God his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and creatures, which to God is no ſinne, but an ordinary worke appoynted
<pb facs="tcp:3304:22"/>
for ſome ſpeciall purpoſe, eyther for the manifeſtation of his power, as was the hardening of Pharao, or for the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his mercy, as was the fall of Dauid, of Peter, of Marie Magdalen, and all other repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant ſinners. And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I pray you, may not this Lord thus vſe his owne ſeruauntes, without any blame of ſinne, ſéeing that he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made them all onely to ſerue hys glorie, hys iuſtice, and hys mercie. Or howe can he be vniuſte, or the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of anye ſynne, by whome all the worlde muſte be iudged and broughte to the balance of iuſtice and equitie. When the firſt worlde ſhall be condemned for their ſinne and iniquitie, and we nowe liuing ſhall be iudged for oure ſinnes: ſpecially all thoſe whiche not onely doe euyll themſelues, but are authors and faultors to wycked doers. Romanes. 1. Fourthly, The maieſtie of God can be ſubiect to no ſinne, bicauſe it can be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no lawe. And that onely is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely called ſinne which is done agaynſt a Lawe, therefore no worke that God
<pb facs="tcp:3304:22"/>
dothe oughte to be accompted euill, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he is the occaſion of any euyll, whiche onely is the minde, ſence, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, and power of the Lawe, wythout whom no lawe of it ſelfe is good. For eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good lawe is the minde, will, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, and what ſo euer lawe is not the mynde, wyll, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God (as was the lawes of the Scribes and Phariſeys, and of the curſed Papiſts) the ſame be wicked: who of neceſſitie were ſet vp the body of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, to vtter their vnrighteouſneſſe, that Chriſte the ſonne of righteouſneſſe, the head of his body, in his manyfolde mercies, more playnely might appeare, and ſhine with more glory. Agayne to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ſinne to be the affection, motion, or operation of any reaſonable creature, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the law of God: his maieſtie muſt néedes be ſecluded and excuſed, who is the lawe maker, the creator, no creature, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no euill motion, nor ledde with any affection, which might make his worke euill. Like as the creature is for the moſt part blame worthy, bicauſe euen when it
<pb facs="tcp:3304:23"/>
doth the beſt of all. It is ſubiect to ſome affection, eyther ſelfeloue, or hatred of ſome other, yea the Lorde God may vſe any of his creatures in any worke, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the blame of any euill, as well as the Smith may make his coles to flame, or to quenche them, eyther the ſame péece of yron, ſometimes his hammer, ſometime his tongs or ſtithy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore though very much might be ſayde in this parte, that as the potter may make of one péece of clay what him liketh, the Smith may make of his yron diuers inſtrumentes, yet following the godly wiſdome of S. Paule, I thinke it more méete to beate downe mans ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with the contemplation of the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of the mightie God, pronouncing boldly that ſuche as ſay (if my lyes and ſinne ſet foorth his glory, why am I then iudged as a ſinner, let vs doo euill that good may come, and ſo in their wycked words dare make God the author of euil) hath their worthy damnation alreadie, as Paule ſayth. Rom. 3. For of neceſſitie, whiche their eyes can not ſée, ſuche diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb facs="tcp:3304:23"/>
of ſinne and grace, of righteouſneſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe, of the contrarietie and change of things, muſt be in this wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull creation of heauen and earth, by the high maieſtie of God appoynted and ordeyned. For what néeded the goodly creature of lighte? If there had bin no darkneſſe, or howe ſhoulde this benefite haue bin felte or perceyued? what matter or cauſe of vttering iuſtice mighte haue bin founde without ſinne and vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe? howe ſhoulde grace haue bin ſhewed, if no wrath had bin deſerued? No the mightie God thereby moſt euidently vttereth his maieſtie, in that he ſheweth how the heauens fal into darkneſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him, the earth into duſt, the Angels into diuels, the men into ſinne, and ſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally without him all things to come to nought, that he might be magnified crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all things, his ſonne our ſauiour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed, who hath redéemed vs all, hys holy ſpirite exalted, who hath renewed all vs that be his elect and choſen. Nowe to what creature is the maieſtie of God bounde and founde debter of his ſpirite.
<pb facs="tcp:3304:24"/>
If he withholde it from any, his dreadfull maieſtie may rightly withhold it, for who hath giuen him firſt, to aſke any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne of debt or dutie? If his maieſtie do giue his ſpirite, it is of his frée mercy and grace. If the earth fal into duſt, if man fal into ſinne, that all things may be knowne to be nothing without God: what blame deſerueth God, or who dare accuſe him? No, let all fleſh fall downe before his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie and confeſſe: All things doth onely reſt vpon thée, O Lorde, thou haſt created all things of nothing, ſo that without thée they all do fall to their originall, to ſhewe themſelues vayne and nothing worthe, weake, wretched, &amp; miſerable, wherfore if we haue any good thing, it commeth of thy mercy, if we haue any weakneſſe, ſinne, or infirmitie, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of our owne concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, luſts, &amp; vanitie, our perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of our ſelues, our ſinne is of our ſelues, only of thee is our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thou made vs clay, potts &amp; veſſels to thine vſe. Do thou with vs as thou ſhalt think good in thine eyes, and the ſhame ſhall fall vpon our own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The ſeconde cauſe which concerneth
<pb facs="tcp:3304:24"/>
man (wherby many miſtake this doctrine) is that God exhorteth man always in his Scriptures to good, and forbiddeth euill with many terrible threatnings, whiche things ſeemeth not to be néedful (ſay they) ſeeing the Elect ſhall be ſaued, &amp; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, by decree &amp; ſentence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon them before they be borne. To this we do anſwer, that theſe exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munications are very neceſſarie to both twaine, bicauſe God leadeth vs men alwayes like reaſonable creatures, not like inſenſible ſtocks or ſtones. And to the Elect they are moſt neceſſarie pricks and ſpurres, to ſtirre the dull fleſh toward his dutie, as all good men feeleth &amp; can beare witneſſe. To the Reprobate they are te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of the good will of the almighty God to them opened and vttered, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly reſiſted, refuſed, and reiected, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of oure Sauioure Chriſt: If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had had no ſinne, but nowe they haue no pretence or excuſe for their ſinne. Peraduenture you will anſwere me: They can not obey vnto it. What
<pb facs="tcp:3304:25"/>
is the cauſe thereof I pray you? bicauſe they lacke the ſpirite of Chriſte to leade them, you will ſay: I dare eaſily graunt you, but will they graunt this? will they (thinke you) ſubmit them ſelues vnder poore Chriſte, and the fooliſhneſſe of the croſſe, and not rather boaſt and brag their wiſedome, their knowledge, and their vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right dealing, and righteouſneſſe. Are not theſe the men that dare thus boaſt? We knowe as well as the Preacher can tell vs. Is the ſpirite of God departed from vs to ſpeake with him? As was ſayde to Micha. 2. of the Kings, 22. chapter. Or as the Phariſies did anſwere vnto Chriſte: are we blinde? To whome our Sauiour ſayth agayne: If you were blinde you had no ſinne, but nowe you ſay you ſée, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſinne remayneth. Iohn. 9. Thus doubtleſſe they are ſo farre from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion &amp; ſubiection to poore Chriſt, that contrariwiſe they doo willingly and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally followe their father Lucifer, who did lift him ſelfe arrogantly aboue Chriſt the ſonne of righteouſneſſe, and euermore fighteth agaynſt Chriſt, though y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mightie
<pb facs="tcp:3304:25"/>
power and high wiſdome of God turneth his euill will and all theyrs to his glory and good purpoſes. None other wayes than bodily and naturall darkneſſe, which by the wonderfull wiſdome of God, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetteth foorth the bright ſunneſhine, and yet laboureth by continuall courſe to ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow the ſunne, and to couer the whole earth. Wherfore the Lorde God to dryue away this naturall darkneſſe from man, exhorteth to iuſtice and equitie, which is hys nature, and the Image whiche man ought to counterfeit. And alwayes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth thyngs therevnto agreable. And forbiddeth that he is not, that is to ſay, iniquitie, and dehorteth therefrom by his Prophets and Preachers, publy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing his wyll and pleaſure, which is the light and lawe moſt perfect to man his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature, whom he hath made for his honour and glory, whom he hath appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to beare hys Image vppon earth, of iuſtice, righteouſneſſe and innocency. But bicauſe thys Image could by no creature perfectlie bée expreſſed, vnleſſe the ſame were fully repleniſhed with the ſelf ſame
<pb facs="tcp:3304:26"/>
Godhead, bicauſe that all things beſideſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorth had ſome imperfection, bewraying their originall the darkneſſe, as Iohn cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, the <hi>Tohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> as Moyſes dothe it name. The vayne vanitie and wilde deformitie, whence they were by creation altered, recouered, and broughte into lighte and life, as appeared in Adam falling from truthe to lyes ſtreight at the beginning: nowe of neceſſitie the ſonne of God (who onely is good of nature) becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth man, and taketh this office to beare the Image of God inuiſible. Coloſ. 1. And to be the head of that ſpirituall perfection whiche was to be wrought in mankinde, by his aforeappoynted purpoſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the firſt begotten of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for by him were all things created both in heauen and earth, viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible, maieſtie, Lordeſhip, rule, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, by whom, and in whom al things are created, and he is before all creatures, and in him all things haue their béeing. And he is the head of the body, he is the beginning and firſt begotten of the head, that in all things he might haue prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence.
<pb facs="tcp:3304:26"/>
For it pleaſed the father that in him ſhould dwell all fulneſſe, and by him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile all things to him ſelfe. And to ſet at peace by him through the bloud of hys croſſe both things in heauen and things in earth: for euen you, ſayth Paule, whiche in times paſt were ſtraungers, bicauſe your mindes were ſet in euill works, hath he nowe reconciled in the body of his fleſh throughe deathe, to make you holy and blameleſſe, and without fault in his ſight. Séeing then that this can not be denied to be the courſe of God his holy working, to driue away this darkneſſe, and to bring man to his light, to take away ſinne, and to bring man to a life blameleſſe, the ſtate of innocencie, and his owne likeneſſe: ſhal it not be moſte ueceſſarie to haue Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and teachers, to tel vs this ſame, and to admoniſhe vs wherevnto we be called, ſéeing of our ſelues and our owne reaſons no ſuche thing can be perceyued? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue we preachings and exhortations as Paule ſayth: for when the worlde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough wiſdome knew not God in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, it pleaſed God throughe
<pb facs="tcp:3304:27"/>
the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſaue them that beleeued. 1. Corin. 1. And as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaythe of hym ſelfe in another place: We do preach this rycheſſe in Chriſte the hope of your glory, warning all men, and teaching all men in all wiſdome, to make all men perfect in Chriſt Ieſu.</p>
            <p>Thus ſerueth then exhortations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, comminations, and publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the lawes and wyll of our Lorde God: that he may be knowen the Lorde and gouernour ouer all the thynges hée hath created, and the onely lawe maker amongſt hys creatures, publiſhyng vnto all that perfect equitie and Iuſtice which ought in no caſe to be reſiſted. Whervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to if they can not attayne, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and knowledge theyr own infirmitie and weakneſſe, and ſubmit them ſelues vnder the mighty hande of God, and ſo doyng they ſhall be receyued as children of the moſt louing and moſt mercifull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in ſuche degrees of perfection as he hath appoynted to the beautifying of the body of his ſonne our head. So that the Lorde God dothe teache all, and lighten
<pb facs="tcp:3304:27"/>
all men that come into the worlde bothe choſen and Reprobate, with ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as doth the good Prince, which vnto all his Subiects proclaymeth his ſtatutes, and publiſheth his lawes: but like a good and tender father, he leadeth his children, regenerate and borne a newe, neyther of fleſh nor bloud, nor the will of man', and guideth them with his fatherly ſpirite in the pathes of the ſame lawes, writing in their hearts what is his good will and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In the which courſe of God his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full worke, the wicked hathe no cauſe to complayne, for as their father whom they doo followe is named the Prince of thys worlde, ſo they haue the world at will, and are riche royſters and welthy worldlings, trampling vnder their féete poore Abell, and the deſpiſed Chriſtians: neyther will they change their eſtate with any ſuch, no when they are called from darkneſſe to be partakers of light, of life, and the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daynties, layde vp in poore Chriſt, they deſpiſe that eſtate, excuſing their purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, their marchaundiſe, and their earthly
<pb facs="tcp:3304:28"/>
luſtes and delightes. Luke. 14. Wherfore in the other worlde they that héere are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſhall haue comforte, and the other torment.</p>
            <p>Suche is the order then of God his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that by the contrarietie of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and Reprobate, of Iacob and Eſau, of Pharao and Iſraell, and the wiſedome of God, and the wiſedome of the worlde, he wyll ſet foorth his maieſtie, his power, his diuinitie, his Godhead, ſo muche as may be knowen vnto man (that is to ſay) in his wiſedome, iuſtice, mercy, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightineſſe. For comparing his wyſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to any other wiſedome, nowe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the contrarie, that it is very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe, euen darkneſſe compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light, death vnto lyfe, lyes vnto truth, as Paule ſayth: When they accompted them ſelues wiſe, they were made very fooles, and chaunged the truthe wyth lyes: the glory of the immortall God, to mortall and corruptible creatures. They following their owne righteouſneſſe could not come to the righteouſneſſe of God in Ieſu Chriſte.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3304:28"/>
Wherefore of neceſſitie God dyd ſhut all vnder ſinne, that his mercy myghte flow ouer all. And that hys mighty power might appeare, he hath created the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens and earth, wherein we do ſée lighte and darkneſſe, death and life, ſhame and glory, weakneſſe and ſtrength, lyes and truthe, righteouſneſſe and vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to ſerue to the ſetting foorth of hys glory, that man maye be driuen to ſaye with Paule: O the depthe of the riches of the wiſdome and knowledge of God. How incomprehenſible are his wayes? Howe vnſearchable are his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts? For who hath knowen the minde of the Lorde? or who hath bin his counſeller. Or who hath giuen him ought aforehand, that he might be repayed? For by him, and throughe him, and in him, are all things, to him be prayſe for euer. Amen.</p>
            <p>And as this holy Apoſtle Paule dothe ſubmitte him ſelfe to the great depthe of the wiſedome of God, and his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Regimente and Prouidence, and would beate and driue downe all fleſh by the conſideration of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. So alſo al our

Fathers from the beginning hath layde this the onely foundation of their faythe: Wherefore Moyſes beginneth to ſtabliſh the faith of man at the hiſtorie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; ſo foorth by the order of God hys preſent gouernaunce about the things made and created. And Dauid for a confeſſion of his faithe pronounceth of this prouidence. Pſa. 95. I do know that thou art a great Lorde and a Lorde aboue all Gods. All thinges whatſouer the Lordes pleaſure was, he hath made in the heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the earth, the ſeas, &amp; the botomleſſe waters. Againe, by the worde of God al thinges were ſet in their places, &amp; by the ſpirit of his mouth all the powers that be in them. And Paul conſidering moſt déepely, and prououn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing moſte playnely thys diuine gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of the creatures, and Godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of the creator, in all things for his Elect and choſen, ſayth thus. Roma. 8. We knowe that all thinges woorke for the beſte vnto them that loue God, who alſo are called of purpoſe: for thoſe which he knewe before, he alſo predeſtinate, that they ſhoulde be like faſhoned to the ſhape
<pb facs="tcp:3304:29"/>
of hys Sonne. Moreouer, whome he hath predeſtinate, thoſe hath he called, &amp; whom he called, them he alſo hath iuſtified, whoo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath iuſtifyed, thoſe alſo hath he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed.</p>
            <p>So that thys appeareth to be no new learning or vaine doctrine of Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Election. But the only ground of faith and certaynty of concience in all conflictes agaynſt the worlde, the fleſhe and the deuil, agaynſt Sinne, Death, and Hell, as the Apoſtle vſeth it in the latter ende of the ſame chapter, and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from the beginning hath felt it. For how coulde Adam by any other worke or creature, eyther by comfort of any other doctrine, ſtay hys conſcience? But in tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Why? Should Abraham haue left hys countrey and hys owne fathers

As by his hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie appereth a fatherly care of our God, for all his people, both for bodies &amp; ſoules for wife and childe, and all togither.

Rom. 14. vnto whom and his ſaythful ſeede, this frée promiſe &amp; fatherly Election and Predeſtination (or what elſe you will call it) was againe reuealed and

And the liuely ſence and feeling of this Election and fatherly care of God for hym, did then eſpecially ſhine in his hart, when the Lord ſayd vnto him: Go not into Egipte, tarie here, I will be with thee, and wil bleſſe thee, and thorow thy ſéed ſhal al the natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

            <p>Ieremie alſo choſen in his mothers wombe, as appeareth in the firſt chapter of his Prophecie, where it is ſayd from the mouth of God: before I faſhioned thée in thy mothers wombe I did know thée, and or euer thou waſt borne I did ſanctifie thée and ordeyned thée to be a Prophet vnto this people, then felte the moſte liuely ſignes and tokens of his Election, when his fleſhe repined, grudged, and feared to take in hande the execution of this great and daungerous embaſſage, &amp; the power of God his ſpirite dothe touche his heart, and openeth his mouthe to the planting

and rooting vp of all people and kingdoms to breake, deſtroy, and make waſte, and rayſed hym as a fenſed towne, a braſen wall, an yron pyller agaynſte the kyngs, prieſtes, and people of the lande.

            <p>And to be ſhort, all the electe of God are thus choſen and called, guyded, and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from their mothers wombe, according to the ſaying of the pryncely Prophete: Thou arte hée that takeſt me from my mothers wombe, thou waſt my hope, yet when I hanged vppon my mothers breſtes.

Election, when temptations and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities doth aſſaile and aſſault them, in the which conflcts of the fleſh, and the ſpirite, of ſynne and grace, of lighte and darknes, they are compelled to crye and cal, to ſigh and ſobbe before theyr heauenly father for the deliueraunce of this mortall and ſinful body ſubdued to vanitie: and though they do moſt euidently perceyue how they are called from darkneſſe to lighte, from loue of iniquitie, to the hatred of the ſame, from obedience ſomtime giuen to Sathan and to the luſtes of the fleſh, to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſpirit, which ſighteth agaynſt the fleſh, and though, I ſay, they percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this, be not able to quench theſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging luſtes, yet do they mourne and dayly lament, calling for the grace of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, which lamentations, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſorowyngs for theyr ſinnes, bée the ſenſible féelings and lyuely ſygnes and tokens of Gods infallible and ſure Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

wiſhing alwaies to be of more perfection, let them with all thankes géeuing vnto God reioyce, knowing that this procedeth not from fleſh nor bloud, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſpirite of our head Ieſus Chriſt, who maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for his afflicted members (who are hys Saincts) with vnſpeakeable gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

So be it.</p>
            <p>Heretofore haue we anſwered gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to them that woulde make God the autour of euill, and to them which do ſay, that thys doctriue taketh away exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and threatnings, and the preaching of the worde. Now by the grace of God, we will more briefly anſwere to ſome ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments whiche they bryng foorth of the ſcriptures, ſettyng aparte all ſuch cauyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as mans reaſon (whiche in Gods

            <p>The good works which are ſo in déed, that is to ſay, which procéede of the ſpirite of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, &amp; the feeling of Gods mercies in electing, calling &amp; iuſtifying, firſt of al haue this vſe, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they declare the power of God to be in vs, and the ſpirite of Chriſt, which doth conforme vs to his Image: and this is the ende whereunto we are Elected and predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of hys ſonne. Rom. 8. Elected before the
<pb facs="tcp:3304:34"/>
foundation of the worlde to be holy and blameleſſe Ephe. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

Theſe haue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as Paule ſaith, not only of this life, but of the world to come. Therfore ſayth our ſauiour Chriſte. Math. 25. Come ye bleſſed of my father, poſſeſſe the kingdome prepared for you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the worlde. I was hungry, and yée gaue me meate: I was thirſty, and ye gaue me drinke. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Of thys excellent commendation and rewarde of good workes, we do learne the dignitie of the ſame, not of the worthineſſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which are neuer able to ſtand in Gods iugdementes: for our very righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes are, as Eſay ſayth, as clothes filthily pulluted, but of the dignitie of the grace of the promiſe of God, who worketh them in vs. For it is God, ſaith Paul, that worketh in vs both the will and alſo the worke, euen of his purpoſe. Phil. 2. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all is of grace, not of works, leaſt any ſhould glory. Epheſ. 2. For if there were any power in our ſelues, or dignity in the
<pb facs="tcp:3304:34"/>
works, then had we ſome thing to glory, but now that all is confeſſed to be of Gods free mercies, and nothing of our ſelues, we conclude that God crowneth and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his owne works in vs, that who ſo glorieth ſhould glory in the Lorde. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And where ſome allege this place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mat. 26. ſo to commende workes that they ſhould be the cauſe of the Election and the fauour of God, they do not conſider the fyrſte wordes: Come you bleſſed of my father, inherite the kyngdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherin we may note, that they béeing the bleſſed and beloued of the father, are called to the inheritance of the heauenly kingdome, not wonne by works, but prepared by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father for hys children before they did any works at all: Like as the wicked haue their place of eternall torment there named for them before prepared and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted. And in both twayne the workes doth only declare what the trees are wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out they ſpring, &amp; teſtifie what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fountaine is whence they flow: according as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſayth: the trée is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

This dothe Iames byd vs, to ſhewe our faith of our workes, and ſaith, that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham did thus vtter his faith by his works, and Rahab by her works, and were iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Where we are compelled with all the Godly learned to expound the worde iuſtified, declared to bée Iuſte, or elſe we do make Iames contrary to himſelf, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Moyſes, whoſe ſentence he in the ſame place alledgeth, contrary to Paule, and the whole courſe of Scriptures. And thus muſte all the generall ſentence of workes bee vnderſtoode, that by theſe workes wherein God wyll haue vs to walke, we are knowen to haue his ſpirit to bée good trées, &amp; ſo iudged by our fruits: as is the good apple trée by the apples, not that the apples make hym good, but teſtifie that hee is good, and that it hath within it ſelfe a kindly power of good iuice and noriſhment. So we feeling the power of the ſpirite woorkyng in oure hartes Godly motions, and ſo bringyng foorth
<pb facs="tcp:3304:35"/>
good fruites of faith and good workes, doo confirme our Election &amp; vocation, as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpeaketh, to our ſelues and others.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde vſe of workes is, that God in vs by them may be glorified. Whereof our ſauiour Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 5. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they ſeeing your good workes may glorifie your father which is in heauen. And this is the chéefe vſe of good workes, the laude and glorie of God whereunto we were fyrſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the earthy Adam, &amp; now are anew reſtored by the heauenly Adam Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu, to walke in good works, and to be holy, blameleſſe, &amp; without faulte. And to thys ende that God in them might be glorified, doth ſcripture co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend vnto vs good works and ſetteth foorth the crowne of glory to them that therein are exerciſed, So runne that ye may obtayne, ſaith the Apoſtle, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor for the crown incorruptible. 1. Cor. 9.</p>
            <p>Now bicauſe theſe latter dayes are the tymes wherein our Sauiour Chriſte dyd ſay, that faith ſhould fayle, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ſhould waxe coulde, we that haue ſo cleare reuelation of Gods great mercyes
<pb facs="tcp:3304:36"/>
in Ieſus Chriſte may gyue no occaſion to the ſlouthfull fleſhe, eyther in our ſelues or others: but after the example of the Scriptures we muſt alwayes exhorte to good workes, and ſo tame our bodies and bring them into ſubiection (as Paul ſaith) leaſt whiles we preach to others, we our ſelues bée founde Reprobates. 1. Corin. 9. the which ſentence is euill alledged of the aduerſaries of Election, as though Paule might haue become a reprobate, or as if y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had not béen certaine of his ſaluation, but that it ſhoulde hang of his well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For he ſayth firſt in the ſame ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, I do ſo runne, not as at an vncertain thing, and ſo fight, not as one that beateth the ayre: but as he ſaith to the Romanes. chap. 8. I am ſure that neyther death nor life, neither Angels, nor rule, neither po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, neither things preſent, nether things to come, neither high, neither low, neither any other creature, ſhall be able to depart vs from the loue of God in Chriſte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu oure Lorde. Likewiſe they alledge foorth of the ſeconde chapter to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, that Paule willeth vs to worke
<pb facs="tcp:3304:36"/>
oure owne ſaluation: but they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he ſtreight wayes addeth, that it is God which worketh bothe the wyll and the worke. And in the chapter before, he ſaith, that it is God which hath begon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good worke, and will finiſh it. So that ſuch Scriptures may neuer bée alledged for workes, agaynſt grace, for to ſet vp our ſaluation of our ſelues, which onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of mercy in the frée Election, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we were choſen in Chriſte Ieſu, and created a newe in him, by his onely ſpirite to bring foorth good workes. Therefore doo we conclude with Paul. Romanes. 11. that we are ſaued and iuſtified fréelie by Grace, not by woorkes, for ſo grace were no grace, and that all are ſhutte vp vnder ſynne, that mercie may be vppon all, vppon whome it pleaſeth hym too ſhewe mercie. And for the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe greate myſteries of Election and Reprobation, we crye with Paule: O the depth of the ryches of the wiſdome of God. How vnſearcheable are his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? &amp; how inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſible his wayes?
<pb facs="tcp:3304:37"/>
For who hath giuen him firſt, and he ſhall be recompenſed? For of hym, and through him, and for hym are al things. To him therefore be glorie, for euer and euer. So be it.</p>
