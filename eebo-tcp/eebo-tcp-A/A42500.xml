            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE laſt time I had the Honour to pay my Duty to your Lordſhip, you were pleaſed to give your Opinion concerning the <hi>True Relation of what has been tranſacted in behalf of thoſe of the Reformed Religion, during the Treaty of Peace at</hi> Reſwick, <hi>with an account of the preſent Perſecution in France, </hi>lately publiſh'd. Your Lordſhip approved the Deſign of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in the Firſt Letter, <hi>viz.</hi> to relate with what Warmth and Vigour the <hi>Proteſtant Plenipotentiaries</hi> had laboured to procure ſome Eaſe to the <hi>Diſtreſſed Reformed;</hi> it being abſolutely neceſſary <hi>This Nation</hi> ſhould have a right Information in that Matter, ſince the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general had been in the dark till now, and were apt to ſuſpect that They had been wanting in their Endeavours to obtain any Benefit for them by that <hi>Peace,</hi> which was deſigned for the Repoſe of all <hi>Europe:</hi> But that by the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of <hi>this Relation,</hi> it would appear that their Sollicitations would not have proved ineffectual, could the <hi>French Court</hi> have been prevail'd upon, or <hi>Bigoted Popery</hi> perſuaded to a Compliance with the <hi>Dictates</hi> either of <hi>Humanity</hi> or <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his Second Letter, which contains a <hi>Tragical Deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Perſecution Raging in</hi> France ſince the <hi>Peace,</hi> your Lordſhip, who knows the Truth of the ſeveral Particulars there mentioned, as well as the Impudence of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who make it their Buſineſs every-where to give out, That there is no ſuch thing as a <hi>Perſecution,</hi> did very well apply the way of the <hi>Spiritual Babylon,</hi> to that of the <hi>Adulterous Woman</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Prov. 30. 20. She eateth, and wipeth her Mouth, and faith, I have done no Wickedneſs.</hi> The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> vents her Fury, by inflicting the moſt exquiſite <hi>Torments</hi> upon the <hi>True Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in <hi>France;</hi> and yet in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. ſaith, <hi>I have done no ſuch thing.</hi> To which your Lordſhip added, That it might be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Publick, to ſee a <hi>Collection</hi> of all the <hi>Declarations, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>French Court,</hi> iſſued out againſt the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> together with ſome <hi>Particulars</hi> concerning the ſevere Execution of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29835:3"/>
them; but ſuch as ſhould be certain, as to Matter of Fact, that is related either by Eye-witneſſes, or by Perſons of undoubted Credit, and publiſh'd without any Diſcourſe or Reflection upon it; and that ſuch a Book would contribute very much to give the World a true <hi>Idea</hi> of the miſerable Condition of the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and to encreaſe that Fellow-feeling all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould have to one another, and to the ſhaming (if poſſible) the <hi>Papiſts</hi> out of their uſual Trick of <hi>Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Hanging, Breaking upon the Wheel</hi> in one Place, and ſtoutly denying it in another.</p>
            <p>Your Deſire, my Lord, is to me a Command, and I heartily wiſh, for the ſake of our diſtreſſed Brethren, I could not ſatisfie your Lordſhip in this particular ſo much as I can. There is no difficulty in performing the Task; and therefore I ſhall in the firſt place give an Account at large of all the <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Decrees</hi> lately iſſued out againſt Them; and in the next, bring in ſome unqueſtionable Inſtances with what Eagerneſs and Severity they have been Executed, as well as thoſe which have been already ſeen but at different times, as alſo ſuch as never appeared till now to the Publick View; that by the full Proſpect of them all together, any Judicious or indifferent Perſon may be convinced of the <hi>Cruel Perſecution</hi> now in <hi>France,</hi> and pity the ſad Caſe of the <hi>Reformed</hi> there, as well as abhor the Barbarity of the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>

            <head>The King's Declaration, Prohibiting his Subjects to ſettle in <hi>Orange,</hi> or to Exerciſe the Pretended Reformed Religion.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>LEWIS</hi> by the Grace of GOD, King of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Navar,</hi> to all to whom theſe Preſents ſhall come, Greet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: The Zeal which we have always had for the Only and True Religion, having excited in us a deſire to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh Hereſie, which had ſpread it ſelf all over our Kingdom; We ſtill believed, That all the Authority which God has put into our hands, ought at all times to be made uſe of moſt effectually and ſucceſsfully, to ſuccour and defend his Cauſe. For this Reaſon, after we had demoliſhed the Churches of the Pretended Reformed Religion, and forbidden all the Exerciſes of it, by thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it. We omitted nothing that we thought moſt effectual to bring them back into the Boſom of the Church: We took care to have their Children bred up in the Sentiments of true Chriſtians; and prohibited, under ſevere Penalties, all thoſe who out of a blind Obſtinacy-rather choſe to abandon their Eſtates, their Families, and their Country, than renounce their Errors, to depart our Kingdom. And in regard that all our Care had no other aim, then the Glory of God, and the ſupport of his Church, he has been pleaſed to aſſiſt us hitherto with all the ſucceſs we could deſire; and we have with delight beheld, that the greateſt part of thoſe whoſe Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeem'd to be the moſt ſuſpected, have at length ſincerely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and embraced the true Religion. But ſeeing there are ſome remaining ſtill, who ſtaggering in their Faith, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into their former Errors, if the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd within our Dominions, might ſerve them for a Place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, to ſettle there, and perform the Exerciſes of the Pretended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:29835:4"/>
Reformed Religion, or of any other forbidden Acts. We thought it our Duty, preciſely to explain our Intention upon that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Point. For theſe Reaſons, by theſe Preſents, ſign'd with our Hand, we have made, and do make, moſt expreſs Prohibitions, and Inhibitions, forbidding all our Subjects, of what Quality or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſoever, to go and ſettle themſelves in the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> under any Pretence whatever. We alſo enjoyn all thoſe who ſhall be found to have ſettled their Abodes there, to return within Six Months, to Commence from the Publication of theſe Preſents, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Penalties ſet forth by our Declaration bearing date <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 1669. We likewiſe forbid all our Subjects to Perform any Exerciſe of the Pretended Reformed Religion, to Contract any Marriage within the ſaid Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> or to ſend their Children thither to be Baptized by the Miniſters there, or to be by them inſtructed in the Exerciſes of the ſaid Religion, or in any other Studies; and generally, not to do or ſuffer to be done, by their Children, or others of whom they ſhall have the Tutelage or Education, any Exerciſes or Acts which are not permitted and uſed in our Kingdom; and all this under the Penalty of Death, upon the Infringer of theſe Injunctions. Nevertheleſs, it is not our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, by theſe Preſents, to hinder our Subjects from going into the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> nor from ſtaying there ſo long as the Neceſſity of their Affairs, or their Trade ſhall require. Thus we give Command to our Beloved and Faithful Counſellors holding our Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> that they order theſe Preſents to be Read, Publiſh'd, Regiſtred, and put in due Execution, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Form and Tenor; for is this our Will and Pleaſure. In Teſtimony whereof, we have cauſed our Seal to be affixed to theſe Preſents. </p>

For theſe Cauſes, conformable to our ſaid Declaration of the 23d of <hi>November</hi> laſt, we have, and do permit by theſe Preſents, ſign'd with our Hand, all our ancient Catholick Subjects to Traffick and Trade in all manner of Goods and Merchandiſe in the Principality of <hi>Orange,</hi> upon Condition however, that before they ſet out for that Principality, they ask leave of our Governors, Commanders, or Intendants of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, where they ſhall have their Abodes; to whom they ſhall declare the Nature and Condition of their Trade, which being done, leave ſhall be granted them without any ſcruple; and when they ſhall arrive in the Province the neareſt to that Principality, they ſhall ſhew their Licenſe to the Governor, Commander, or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, under the following Penalties to be inflicted upon thoſe who ſhall preſume to go into the ſaid Principality without Licenſes; <hi>viz.</hi> the Men to be Condemn'd to the Galleys for their Lives; the Women to be five Years Impriſon'd, and to pay a Forfeiture of

And by our Declaration in <hi>May,</hi> 1686. we forbad all thoſe who had embraced the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Religion to depart the Kingdom, under the ſame Penalties; but in regard a great number of thoſe who had the Misfortune to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves into Foreign Countries, contrary to thoſe Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have deſired to return again, and there to Profeſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apostolick Religion,</hi> and for as much as our Goodneſs to our Subjects has enclin'd us to give them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Permiſſion ſo to do; It is our Pleaſure alſo, to grant a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral one to the ſame end, for all the reſt who have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and hereby to ſecure them all from the Penalties which they have incurr'd by their Diſobedience to our Orders. For theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29835:5"/>
with the Advice of our Council, and out of our eſpecial Grace and Favour, full Power, and Royal Authority, we have by theſe Preſents, Sign'd with our Hand, Permitted and Granted, as we do hereby permit, and grant to all our Subjects, as well Men as Women, who left our Kingdom, contrary to our Edicts of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1685. and our Declaration of <hi>May,</hi> 1686. to return back with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſix Months, upon Condition, that they Profeſs and Exerciſe the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Religion, and freely there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, behaving themſelves therein like the reſt of our Subjects. And it is our farther Will and Pleaſure, that they make their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it to the reſpective Governor or Commander, in the firſt place under our Obedience, through which they ſhall paſs in their Return into our Kingdom, of which they ſhall take a Certificate; Which ſame Declaration we order them alſo to reiterate, three Days after their arrival, before the Principal Officer of the Royal Bailliage, where they intend to reſide, and within Eight days next following, to make their Abjuration before the Archbiſhop, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Place, or before the Curate, or other Eccleſiaſtick, having power to receive it, or to ſhew them their Certificate, if they have done it in any other Place, after their Return into our Kingdom, to the end it may be allowed by them, if they ſee cauſe ſo to do: Which done we diſcharge them from the Corporal Puniſhments mentioned in our Edict and Declaration; impoſing, as to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, perpetual Silence upon our Proctors General, and their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, ſo that they ſhall not preſume to proſecute them for the future for the ſame Matter, upon any pretence whatſoever. To this end, we give in charge to our Beloved and Faithful Counſellors, holding our Court of Parliament at <hi>Paris,</hi> that they cauſe theſe Preſents to be Read, Publiſh'd and Regiſtred, and the Contents thereof to be put in Execution, according to their Form and Tenor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Theſe Declarations have been both preceded and followed by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular orders to the Intendants of all the Provinces of the Kingdom againſt the Reformed, empowering them to give Sentence without Appeal againſt the New Converts, who have been taken in ſome Aſſemblies, and to ſeize upon all the Children, who were of years to receive Inſtruction; at the ſame time Inhibitions were ſet forth, prohibiting all the newly Reunited to Exerciſe any Employment or Trade, unleſs they perform all the Duties of Good Catholicks. This we were informed of in <hi>November</hi> laſt, and received advice in <hi>January</hi> following, that by the King's Command to the Intendant of the Province of <hi>Languedoe,</hi> all the New Converts who have Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Age to go to School, are oblig'd to ſend them thither, as alſo to publick Inſtructions and Catechiſms, upon pain of being conſtrained by pecuniary Mulcts, and other ways of Severity; and if they perſevere in Diſobedience, they are to have Soldiers quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd upon them, to whom they are to pay ſo much a day till they comply, and alſo to be further proſecuted, and puniſh'd as the King ſhall ordain: School-Maſters, and Miſtreſſes, Curates and Vicars, are to take a Liſt at the beginning of every Year of the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts Children, and if they fail to come to School, they are to give Notice of it to the Kings Intendant; and the School-Maſters and Miſtreſſes are obliged to go every day to Maſs, with the Children committed to their care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

To which purpoſe, Commiſſioners are appointed in every Quarter, who have order to look after this Affair. They have alſo Regiſtred the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of all the new Converts that are in this City, and have ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to their Fathers and Mothers, that 'tis the King's Pleaſure, that they themſelves ſhould carry them regularly to Maſs, under the Forfeiture of Twenty Five Livres, and to have Dragoons quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered upon them every time they miſs: Which hath been put in Execution in <hi>Sevennes,</hi> and in other Quarters at <hi>Somizes,</hi> a Town near <hi>Montpellier,</hi> they have raiſed above 2000 Livres by Forfeitures of this Nature. Our Intendant continues his Rigour in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of theſe Severities with an indefatigable and furious Zeal. Within this little while he Condemn'd to Death three Miniſters, who were hang'd within a few Days after they were taken. He has alſo Condemn'd two Men to the Galleys, for having been at <hi>Orange</hi> without leave: And ſending for ſome of our moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Merchants, he told 'em, That the King was reſolved to have but one Religion in <hi>France;</hi> and that if the New Converts did not go to Maſs, and Conform as good Catholicks ought to do, they would be ruin'd and ſack'd by the Soldiers. We expect here Monſieur <hi>De Broglio,</hi> with two Regiments of Dragoons, who are to be quartered upon thoſe that refuſe to do, as they are ordered.</p>

They allow but three or four Hours time to thoſe whom they take out of their Houſes, and do not enquire, whether they have either wherewithal to bear their Charges; or any Carti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for their Journey. To morrow is appointed for the Women to make their Perſonal appearance. They are ready to go, thoſe at leaſt who have any love for their Religion, and the Number of them is very great. Good God! why ſhould we not all perſiſt in the Faith, both Men and Women, for even Children of Ten years old hold out, and there is not one among them willing to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29835:8"/>
yield. This is a Miracle, which God Almighty ſets before our Eyes, and which we muſt make a good uſe of. This Roaring Lion, the Count <hi>Broglio,</hi> went the day before yeſterday to <hi>Roque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courbe,</hi> but all the Inhabitants of it, having forſaken their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Houſes, he met no body there, and threatned to raze their Town to the very Ground, in caſe they refuſe to return home.

In ſhort, our Miſeries are very great, and we cannot ſay, when God Almighty will be pleaſed to come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us. Can it be poſſible that the Proteſtant Princes ſhould quite forſake us? Alas! We beg nothing elſe of them, but their interceſſion to our Great King, in order to obtain the Liberty of going out of his Dominions; This favour perhaps would be granted to their Requeſt. In ſhort, our Enemies excuſe their hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs with this pretence, ſaying, <hi>That their ill uſage againſt us, is only by way of Repriſal, ſince the</hi> Iriſh Catholicks <hi>are more ſeverely dealt with by the</hi> Engliſh Proteſtants.

Our Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſo great, that no body can expreſs them. The Count <hi>Broglio</hi> went from hence on <hi>Monday</hi> laſt, after having either baniſhed or Impriſoned part of the Inhabitants. There is no need of giving you their Names. And at his departure he left Orders to carry Bills to their reſpective Houſes, whereby they were all admoniſhed to go to Maſs; and in caſe they do not appear there, by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made for that purpoſe, the Goods and Eſtates of the Rebels (for ſo they call us) are to be seized, and their Houſes demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. The Bills were delivered, but they anſwered, <hi>The King is Maſter of both our Goods and Lives, and we are ready to give them up for his Service, but our Souls belong to God only.</hi> This Anſwer hath been ſet down in writing, (not perhaps at length,) but at laſt they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29835:9"/>
entred us in the Regiſter-Book, not as good Subjects, but as Rebels to our Great King. We ſhall in all probability ſhortly ſee the Iſſue of this Decree; for the execution hath conſtantly attended their Threatnings. The poor Inhabitants of <hi>Roquecourbe</hi> have for ſaken their Houſes. The Papiſts thought they would come back again; but they were miſtaken; for they have not been ſeen ſince, although they have ſent a hundred Men to prevail upon them to return home by the fear of their total Ruin. 'Tis not known whither they did retire, as well as the Inhabitants of <hi>la Crouſette,</hi> and other neighbouring places. Queſtionleſs they live in Holes and Dens like the Primitive Chriſtians. They write from <hi>Montauban,</hi> That 800 Families there have deſerted their Houſes, and are ready to bear the Aſſault they are preparing againſt them. They have ſeized on the Eſtate of Mr. <hi>de Leſpineſſe,</hi> becauſe he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up a Son of <hi>Mr. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

They have alſo given a Judgment in Court againſt, and ſeized on the Eſtate of Mr. <hi>Peliſſter le Gres,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he abſconds with Four of his Children. In fine, one cannot enumerate all the Particulars as it ſhould be. The Hope we had, and which they gave us from all Places, of an approaching Eaſe and Delivery, has been the cauſe of our Ruine. Many who were very Rich, are not now worth a Farthing. Good God! who would have believed that ſo many Potent Princes, who are our Brethren in Chriſt, would have abandoned us! But you will ſay, They could not ſue for the Reſtitution of our Edicts, becauſe 'twas too much. But they could at leaſt have asked that we might have had leave to depart this Kingdom without any diſturbance, or that they would put us to death all at once: The thing was very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſince it hath been already done. But they think of us no more than if we were not in the World. Sure we muſt have great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offended God, ſeeing he permits Princes, and our Brethren in Chriſt to forſake us. However, we muſt hope, that God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will come to us in due time: He is a God to help in Extremity; alas! he muſt then come a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>TWo Gentlemen called <hi>Trouilla</hi> and <hi>Laborde</hi> lately come from <hi>France,</hi> Certifie under their Hands, That in <hi>May</hi> laſt, the Sieur <hi>Darhets,</hi> Surrogate of Mr. <hi>Pinon</hi> Intendant of <hi>Bearn,</hi> came to <hi>Orthes,</hi> and being attended with four Guards or Sergeants went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a School, and ordered the Schoolmaſter to bid his Scholars repeat their Popiſh Catechiſm by heart before him; which thing a Boy Ten years old, and Son to Mr. <hi>Cafaudonec,</hi> Merchant, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to do, he was by order of the ſaid Surrogate immediately ſhut up in the School by his Guards, and whip'd by the School Maſter to the very bloud, inſomuch as he had died by the blows, had not a Doctor ordered ſome Remedies to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Gentlemen do further Certifie, that the ſame day, the ſaid Surrogate ſent a Gentlewoman Fourteen or Fifteen years old into the Nunnery of St. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula,</hi> with order to let no body ſee and ſpeak with her. She was dragg'd every day to Maſs; but they could never prevail upon her to turn her Face, and kneel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Altar; inſomuch as the Abbeſs with the help of ſome Nuns, having bound her Hands behind her back with Ropes, tied her faſt to a Pew, and let her continue a whole Day in that Poſture. This Gentlewoman by ſtriving to be rid of her pains, made the Rope ſlip as far as her Neck, but then ſhe was almoſt ſtrangled,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29835:10"/>
and called for help, but the mercileſs Nuns did not cae for her Cries, till one of them came into the Church, and ſaw her almoſt dead: Thereupon ſhe went immediately and acquainted the Abbeſs with it, who being an Eye-witneſs of the danger ſhe was in, did untie her, and confined her to a Dark Chamber, where ſhe was expoſed to bad Weather, ſeen by no body, and no light allowed her for a Fortnight, till ſhe was taken ſo ill, that they began to fear her Life, and therefore the Nuns let her go out of the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, by the ſpecial leave of Mr. <hi>Darbes,</hi> who had before ſeen the Declaration of a Surgeon about the dangerous Condition of the ſaid Gentlewoman.</p>
            <p>The Perſecution doth not rage on the Land only, but alſo on the Sea; for enquiring of one Mr. <hi>Anthony Capion</hi> who came lately from <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where he was a great ſufferer, about the lamentable Condition of thoſe Proteſtants who have been ſent to the Galleys upon account of Religion, he delivered into my hands a Liſt of the Names, Country, Number, and the date of the Condemnation of every one of them. It would be too long to relate all theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; we ſhall have ſhortly the opportunity to do it, only we will ſay for the preſent, That the Number of them amounts to 277. Some Popiſh Slaves who have been converted by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Patience, and good Behaviour of the Proteſtants in Chains, being included: And that the ſaid Gentleman certified under his Hand <hi>Auguſt</hi> 2. 1698. That the Marquis of <hi>Mommort,</hi> Intendant of the Galleys there, being informed that Mr. <hi>Lanſonieres,</hi> formerly a Counſellor in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and Ten years ſince Slave there, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion, did as well as one Mr. <hi>Serres</hi> formerly Student in Divinity, diſtribute ſome Alms which was given them, to the other Confeſſors, ordered ſome Men to conſtrain them by a ſevere Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinado, to declare from whence they had received the ſaid Money, which thing they refuſing to do, he ſent them into a dark and ſtinking Dungeon, wherein they as well as many others have been for theſe Two years ſhut up cloſe Priſoners. That in the Caſtle called <hi>Caſteldy,</hi> there are two other Confeſſors, named <hi>Paul Raga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and <hi>John Monier,</hi> of <hi>Sainte Croix</hi> in <hi>Cevennes,</hi> detained two years and an half, in a Dungeon where they never ſee the Light; and in the Fort called <hi>Saint John,</hi> there is one Mr. <hi>Lefevure</hi> of <hi>Champagne,</hi> who has been Priſoner Ten years. The they will not give leave to any of them to write to their Friends in order to be relieved by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29835:10"/>
them. That two Sergeants of the Garriſons that are at the For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s <hi>St. Nicolas</hi> and <hi>St. John,</hi> in that City, having given ſome of them Paper and Ink to write a Letter, and being taken in the Fact, were immediately Condemn'd, and Hang'd on the Rampire, thô Mr. <hi>Serres, Junior,</hi> being brought before the Council of War, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two Sergeants, begg'd on his Knees the favour of dying in the Room of the Sergeant who had furniſh'd him with the means of writing but a Conſolatory Letter, but to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Gentleman declares further, That there was a Young Gentlewoman of 18 Years of Age, who when ſhe was a dying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to perform the Duty uſual to Papiſts on ſuch Occaſions, but after her death her Corps was drawn Naked throughout all the Streets of <hi>Marſeilles</hi> by the Hangman, and buried under the Stones the Rabble threw at it. And that another Confeſſor being very Sick, deſired to be blouded, but the Commander came to him, with his Piſtol cocked in his Hand, and pointing at his Head, told him, <hi>He had nothing elſe for him, but Piſtols to break his Pate.</hi>

            <p>I Came yeſterday from <hi>Montpellier,</hi> where I had been about our Brother-in-Law—Buſineſs, where I heard that a Fair was to be held at <hi>Orange,</hi> and was really ſo, the 25th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, in order to facilitate the Commerce, and to ſhew (as it was given out by the Papiſts) that they had no mind to hinder any body from going to Trade in that Principality. Accordingly our Intendant ordered, That all the Guards who were ſet at <hi>Roquimaure, Ardoiſe,</hi> and all other poſts on the <hi>Rhone</hi> ſhould be taken off. All thoſe who went, or pretended to go to the ſaid fair did aſſiſt there at the publick Exerciſes of the Proteſtant Religion, and at their return to their reſpective homes, declared publickly, that they had ſeen no Guard on the Road, and that all the Paſſes were free and open. This good News was ſo great an Encouragement, that the Firſt <hi>Sunday</hi> in <hi>September</hi> laſt being appointed for adminiſtring the Holy Sacrament, Two or three thouſand of our Proteſtants of both Sexes throng'd thither. But our Intendant having been informed of it, ſet Soldiers on all the Avenues, who ſeized about One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them at their return, and binding them, two and two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, brought them in that Poſture to <hi>Monipellier,</hi> where they were no ſooner come, but they were immediately ſentenced, and ſent to the Gallies, and 38 Women and Maidens condemned to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29835:11"/>
Priſon for Six years: And our poor Brother-in-Law is one of the Number. Think, I pray, what condition our poor Siſter and her Daughter are in. God grant all theſe Confeſſors ſtrength to ſuffer patiently their Affliction, and to carry chearfully their Chains without repining, ſeeing they ſuffer for no other reaſon, but for Worſhipping and Praying to God in his Church. Among them, there are Mr. <hi>Bourelly,</hi> one of the Brothers of Mr. <hi>Fabre,</hi> Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, the very ſame who ſerved His Majeſty of <hi>Great Britain</hi> Ten or Twelve Years in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was after married at <hi>Courtezon,</hi> a Town belonging to the Principality of <hi>Orange:</hi> The Brother-in-Law of another <hi>Fabre,</hi> Apothecary at <hi>Bagnots.</hi> Mr. <hi>Ribes</hi> and <hi>Jonquent,</hi> Merchants of <hi>Nimes.</hi> A Merchant of <hi>Alez</hi> in <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennes;</hi> another living about <hi>Roubiac,</hi> Nephew to Mr. <hi>Chriſtol</hi> of <hi>Servieres;</hi> a Son and Daughter of Mr. <hi>Lafons,</hi> Attorney of <hi>Servay;</hi> a Brother of Mr. <hi>Carrieres,</hi> who lives now in <hi>London;</hi> there will be now two Brothers together, for one of them has been theſe Twelve Years in the Gallies, reſolutely perſiſting in the Reformed Religon; I ſaw his Father at <hi>Montpellier</hi> ſolliciting for him, but to no purpoſe.

            <p>HEre lately happened a thing which will ſtrike you with Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and oblige you to join your Prayers with ours to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore Gods Mercy.

               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have heard long ſince of Mr. <hi>Claude Brouſſon,</hi> and of his unwearied Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion. He was born at <hi>Niſmes</hi> of Noble Parents on his Mother's ſide, and bred up an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate or Counſellor: And pleaded at the Bar with ſuch Force and Eloquence, that he was admired in the <hi>Preſidial</hi> of <hi>Niſmes,</hi> the <hi>Chamber</hi> of <hi>Caſtres,</hi> and in the High-Court of <hi>Tholouſe;</hi> but after the Ruine of the Proteſtant Churches he retired into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> where he publiſh'd many Books concerning the preſent Perſecution, and came ſeveral times into this Kingdom, in order to Inſtruct and Comfort his diſtreſſed Brethren. The Papiſts who diſcovered his wonderful Progreſs, did what they could to Catch him, but by God's Providence he avoided their Snares; ſo that after having been four Years undiſcovered in <hi>France;</hi> he went into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was ordained Miniſter, and there publiſhed a Book of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, wherein he gives Account of ſeveral particulars concerning the Sufferings and Martyrdom of many Miniſters and Proteſtants, and of his wonderful Preſervation: But becauſe this Book will be undoubtedly Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I'll content my ſelf with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating, theſe two Particulars only, <hi>viz.</hi> That a great number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants having met together on the Hills of <hi>Vivares,</hi> the Dragoons, by the Order of the Intendant <hi>Baville</hi> (who was in that Country) ſurprized them, and killed upon the ſpot Three hundred and fifty of them; one of theſe Dragoons, a Faithful Apoſtle of the <hi>Red Dragon</hi> ſpoken of, <hi>Revel</hi> 12. diſcovered among the ſlain, a Woman lying dead on the Ground, and holding ſtill her Child in her Arms. When the Babe ſaw the Dragoon drawing near him, he ſmiled at him; but this Barbarous Executioner was ſo far from being moved with the Smiles of this Innocent Creature, that he thruſt his Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his Boſom, and lifting him up, called to his Comrade, and ſaid, <hi>Hey, doſt thou not ſee this Frog.</hi> This Diabolical action was related to the Intendant, but he took no Notice of it.</p>
            <p>The other Particular concerns Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> himſelf, who ſaith, That the Intendant <hi>Baville</hi> was ſo enraged he could not catch him, that he ſet a Prize, firſt of Five hundred, and after of Ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29835:13"/>
Livres on him, as a Reward to whomſoever ſhould take him: That the Papiſts had drawn and diſperſed many Pictures of his, to diſcover him thereby; and that when they ſuſpected him to be lurcking in any Wood or Den, they ſent Dragoons, and let looſe Hounds to find him by the Track and Scent. Being once driven out of the Wood by the Violence of the Rain, he diſcovered them coming upon him; and having the conveniency of a Buſh near at hand, he there abſconded till he ſaw Four Troops paſs by him; and by that means he eſcaped out of their hands by a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Providence, who had no doubt blinded them: This and ſome other Reaſons oblig'd him to depart out of <hi>France,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he ſtaid a while; but a little after, he grew ſo uneaſie, that he could neither Eat nor Sleep; and when his Friends asked him the Reaſon of it, he reply'd, That he felt an inward Motion, prompting him to go and Comfort his Diſtreſſed Brethren: So he came back again into this Kingdom, where he for a long time Preached, Inſtructed, Comforted the True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fomed, and reclaimed many Apoſtates for their Apoſtacy; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny profligate Sinners from their ill Lives. But at length he was diſcovered and ſeized, on the 19th of <hi>September</hi> laſt at <hi>Orleou,</hi> a Town in the Province of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and from thence brought to <hi>Leſcar,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Pinon,</hi> Intendant of that Province was; who firſt askt the Priſoner his Name, who readily own'd it to be <hi>Brouſſon;</hi> and next, the Reaſon, Why he was come into the Kingdom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To which he Anſwered, That he came to Exhort his Brethron to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. To what Repentance, ſaid the Intendant to him? To the Repentance of their Sins, replyed Mr. <hi>Brouſſon.</hi> At laſt they askt him, if he had not known the danger of his Deſign? To which he ſaid, That he had undertaken the thing out of Zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, and upon mature Deliberation. The Examination being over, the Intendant committed him to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Pau,</hi> till further order from the Court, and ordered the Jailor to allow him a Bed, be Civil to him, and Guard him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight. At laſt Orders came from the Court, and the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>Baville,</hi> (the mortal Enemy of the Proteſtant Religion, and of Mr. <hi>Brouſſon)</hi> ſent three Expreſſes to Challenge him as his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner. And ſo the 20th of <hi>October</hi> he ſet forward in a Calaſh to <hi>Montpellier;</hi> but before his departure, he deſired to ſpeak with Mr. <hi>Pinon,</hi> and his requeſt being granted, he ſaid to him, <hi>That ſeeing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:29835:13"/>
he had but a ſhort time to Live, he would ſpend part of it, in praying for him,</hi> and returned him thanks for his Civility. The Intendant was ſo moved at his Diſcourſe, that he gave his Guards freſh Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be Civil to him upon the Road. When Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> came into this Province of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> he was delivered into the hands of the Captain of the Life-Guards of the Count <hi>Broglio,</hi> attended by one hundred Granadiers, and brought to the Citadel of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellier</hi> in the Flying Chariot of the Intendant <hi>Baville,</hi> where he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived <hi>October</hi> the 30th: He never was bound, but conſtantly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within ſight of the Soldiers. The Day after his arrival, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant went to the Citadel to hear him; the firſt Queſtion he put to him was, If he did not know the King's Edicts and Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby the Miniſters were forbidden, under pain of Death, ever to come into <hi>France:</hi> To which Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> anſwered, That after the Apoſtles Example, he thought himſelf bound by the Duty of his Miniſtry to venture all, to come and Comfort his Brethren. He did not deny, but he had at ſeveral Times and Places given the Communion, but would by no means name either the Places or the Perſons to whom. And anſwered the other Queſtions put upon him with a great deal of Conduct and Wiſdom. During the time of his Confinement, our Intendant, as well as the Abbot <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marignam,</hi> Son to the late Preſident <hi>Crouſet,</hi> had many ſecret Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with him, but we do not as yet hear of any Particular of them; it is ſaid only, That the Intendant allowed him no other Meat and Drink but that which was carried to him from his own Table, which Mr. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ouſſon</hi> would not touch, but betook himſelf to Prayers and Faſting, and eat and drank only Bread and Water. The 24th of this Inſtant, he was in the Morning brought to his Trial before the Intendant <hi>Baville,</hi> and ſome Counſellors of the <hi>Preſidial.</hi> They charged him with two things, one True, and the other Falſe; the True one was, That he had Preached in <hi>France</hi> againſt the King's Prohibition; and the other Falſe was, That he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to bring (during the late War) the Enemy into the Kingdom, and ſtirr up a Rebellion. Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> confeſſed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but denied peremptorily and abſolutely the ſecond Article. And every one knows, that 'tis the Cuſtom of Papiſts to charge the Proteſtants with Crimes againſt the State, in order, to Extenuate their own Barbarity, and Eclipſe the Glory of the Sufferings and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms of the Reformed. But the Truth is, the thing was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29835:14"/>
before. hand, Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> was to die: And therefore he was condemned to be put to the Rack, and Tortured both Ordinary and Extraordinary, and next to be broken alive upon the Wheel: When they came to read the Sentence to him, he ſhewed an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Courage, and a great Reſignation to God's Will. The Reading of his Sentence being over, he was brought and preſented to the Torture, and being ſtretched Naked on the Bench, he ſaid to the Commiſſary, That he had told the Truth of what they had asked him concerning himſelf; That if they had forgot any thing elſe, he was ready to give a Faithful anſwer to it; but as to his Brethren, it was to no purpoſe to urge him to declare them, for he had rather be torn in pieces, than to betray his Miniſtry. As ſoon as he had declared this, he was taken off the Bench, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed the Rack, upon which he ſaid, <hi>I will magnifie the Lord as long as I live,</hi> &amp;c. The Courage, Mildneſs, and Innocence, the Intendant diſcovered in the ſecret Conferences he had with his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, prevailed (I think) upon him, to abate ſomething of his Cruelty.</p>
            <p>When theſe things were thus practiſed within the Citadel, they were Erecting without, in a Place called <hi>L'Eſplonade</hi> a Scaffold, whither Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> was brought in his ordinary Habit, about Four of the Clock the ſame Afternoon, without having his Hands or Feet tied, and attended by the Abbot <hi>Camarignam.</hi> I ſaw him going to Execution, earneſtly Praying, and looking ſtedfaſtly up to Heaven. One cannot expreſs the Mildneſs and Courage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he went and aſcended the Scaffold. One might eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Calmneſs of his Soul, by his chearful Countenance in his way to the Place of Execution, and all the while hear the Sighings and Groans of the People, who bewailed the hard Fate of a Man of ſo great Merit and Piety. Having aſcended the Scaffold, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to deliver his Dying Speech, which was no doubt as Pious and Comfortable as his Life had before been; but we were hinder'd from hearing much of it, becauſe on ſuch Occaſions the Papiſts beat Drums, to prevent by their Noiſe, the good Effect of the pious Exhortations and Prayers of the Reformed Martyrs. This was the Reaſon why Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> put off his own Cloths, and yielded both his Hands and Feet to be faſtned on the Croſs, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That he eſteemed himſelf very happy, in that his Death had ſome likeneſs with that of his Saviour.</hi> 'Twas only at that time they read
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29835:14"/>
to him that Clauſe of his Sentence, whereby he was to be Strangled before he was broken upon the Wheel. The Executioner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having faſtned him, went down under the Scaffold, and having half-ſtrangled him, the Billet broke; which accident made Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> come to himſelf again; and the Abbot <hi>Camarignam</hi> hearing him pray to God, came near him, to whom Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Sir, I pray God Almighty reward your Charity towards me, and grant us the favour to ſee one another in his Paradiſe.</hi> Theſe were the laſt Words of his; for he was immediately Strangled and Broken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Wheel. This great Man hath been lamented by all, the Papiſts themſelves have been amazed at this ſight of Courage and Reſolution, and the Proteſtants though ſorry for his loſs, were yet Comforted, for ſo great an Example of Reſignation to God, and Zeal and Conſtancy for the Defence of his Goſpel; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is an illuſtrious and extraordinary Inſtance in the Age we live in, wherein we ſee ſo little Zeal for the True Religion, and and ſo very great (though Blind) Zeal for propagating the Falſe one by Perſecution and ſhedding of Bloud. Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi>'s Death was a Sermon more Moving and Eloquent, than all thoſe he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in his Life time, I do not make any queſtion, but the Intendant <hi>Baville</hi> might ſay of Mr. <hi>Brouſſon</hi> (with as much reaſon as he did concerning another Miniſter he had ſome years before put to Death) <hi>If the</hi> Hugonots <hi>ſerve the ſame God we do, there will be a ſad reckoning for him and other Papiſts.</hi> And one enquiring of the Executioner about Mr. <hi>Brouſſon,</hi> a little after the Execution; He anſwered, That if he durſt ſpeak, he could ſay much, but could not forbear ſaying, That he died like a Saint.</p>
            <p>I thought, My Lord, to have brought here my Task to an End, but am prevented, by a New Declaration againſt the French Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, whereby the French King will have them to know what Uſage they are for the future to Expect, in caſe they do not turn good <hi>Catholicks,</hi> the Abſtract whereof, I now give your Lordſhip. The Declaration was given at <hi>Verſailles,</hi> the 13th of <hi>December,</hi> 1698. and Regiſtred in Parliament. Wherein his Majeſty enjoyns the Execution of this Edict in <hi>October</hi> 1685. repealing the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> and of others made in purſuance thereof. Forbids all his Subjects to Exerciſe the Pretended Reformed Religion, to meet together in any Place on this account in any Number, or on any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:29835:15"/>
whatſover: And to harbour any Miniſters, and directly or indirectly to hold any Correſpondence with them. He admoniſhes and enjoins all Archbiſhops and Biſhops to employ their utmoſt Zeal in the Inſtruction of the New Converts, and to order their Curates, at leaſt on <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holidays,</hi> to read Inſtructions and Catechiſms to them. He recommends eſpecially to the Lords of Mannors, and the ſaid New Converts, to aſſiſt exactly at Divine Service, and Commands them, that they always behave themſelves therein with Reverence, eſpecially during the time of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Holy-Maſs, and adore on their Knees the moſt Holy Sacrament on the Altar, and obſerve Abſtinency from Fleſh. He Commandeth all the New Converts to cauſe their Children to be Baptized in their Pariſh-Churches within 24 Hours after their Birth; and all the Midwives to give the Curate of the Place Notice of the Birth of ſuch Children; He enjoyns the eſtabliſhment in all Pariſhes, as much as is poſſible, Maſters and Miſtreſſes, in order to Inſtruct particularly the Children born of Parents formerly Proteſtants; all Guardians to ſend them to the Schools and Catechiſms; and bring them before the Archbiſhop or Biſhop, when they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, in the Courſe of their Viſitations: He commandeth all Phyſicians, Apothecaries and Chirurgeons, who ſhall be called to viſit Sick Perſons to give notice thereof to the Curates of their Pariſhes, that the Patient may from time to time receive the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Sacraments. And in fine, That no Perſon ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into any publick Place, Office, and Employment whatſoever, but under Atteſtation from the Curate of their Pariſhes, Certifying their good Life, and their Exerciſing the Catholick Apoſtolick and Roman Religion.</p>
            <p>After the reading of ſuch a Declaration, one may wonder that every Article of it was not backed with ſevere Penalties, as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Gallies, and Gallows (as it was given out and expected) but with general and ambiguous Threatnings, only ſuch as are, <hi>We command on pain of exemplary Puniſhment to ſuch as ſhall fail therein:</hi> Or theſe, <hi>To puniſh the Offenders by Fine, or even by greater Penalties, as the nature of the Cauſe ſhall require.</hi> But the wonder will not be long, and the Cunning of the New Declaration will be ſoon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, if one takes the care to ſcrape the Sweetneſs and Gold off the out ſide of the Pill, by comparing it with the Edict of <hi>October,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:29835:15"/>
1685. and others made in purſuance thereof; for he will imme<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diately diſcover the Bitterneſs of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Penalties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Edicts and Declarations already made on this account (to which this New Declaration referreth the Reader) are nothing elſe but Priſons, Dungeons, Gallows, and wheels. Thus they have heretofore exactly executed the <hi>French</hi> King's Declaration againſt the True Proteſtants; and thus hereafter they will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly explain this New one.</p>
            <p>For it was no ſooner out, but the Biſhop of <hi>Mans,</hi> to ſhew his Zeal, publiſhed an hectoring Letter and Mandate, wherein after having ſaid that the King having forced the Proteſtant Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Allies to accept of the Peace his Majeſty offered them, had now a mind to <hi>Compel</hi> the timerous to a ſincere Reſolution to embrace the Catholick Faith.</p>
            <p>He adds, That purſuant to his Majeſty's pious Intentions, he requires all Deans, Prieſts, Curates of his Dioceſs, to ſend in forthwith an exact Liſt of thoſe Families and Perſons of both Sexes in their reſpective Pariſhes, who are ſuſpected of Hereſie, and ſhew no Marks of the Catholick Faith, which they had ſeigned to have embraced.</p>
            <p>If the zealous Biſhop was ſpeaking of forcing the Proteſtants, we could not deny his Aſſertion, becauſe we know it by a very ſad Experience; but no body will grant to his Zeal, That the <hi>French</hi> King hath conſtrained the Proteſtant Princes to receive, in ſpight of their Teeth, the Peace from his hands; the <hi>French</hi> Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries themſelves will convince his Lordſhip of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>I have, My Lord, ſeveral other Inſtances at hand of the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this New Perſecution: But theſe which I have mentioned though few in number, and in compariſon to thoſe we already know, and what we have not as yet heard of, becauſe c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>mitted in Dungeons, are ſufficient to convince any reaſonable M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, much more a Chriſtian, of the Reality and Fierceneſs of the New Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: Nay, we wiſh with all our Hearts that there were fewer Inſtances than thoſe I have already related; becauſe then our ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Brethren would be leſs perſecuted by the Papiſts, and the Papiſts leſs guilty before God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:29835:16"/>
However<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in theſe few Particulars, one many eaſily diſcover all the Characters of a barbarous Perſecution, and the ſad caſe the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants lie now under: For let any judicious Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to himſelf on one hand, a <hi>Potent Prince,</hi> who is reſolved at any rate to compleat the Deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> in his Kingdom, and his Magiſtrates, Officers, and Soldiers, ſtriving who ſhall be the moſt diligent in promoting his Deſign, that is, breathing out Threatnings and Slaughter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord; And taking Commiſſion from their Superiours, That if they ſhould find any of this Faith, whether they were Men or Women, to bring them bound to ſome Priſon or other, and add to the horrour of dark and ſtinking Dungeons the moſt cruel Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>And all this practiſed not only in ſome, but in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of a vaſt Kingdom; and not upon a few, but upon all perſons, of what Rank, Quality, Condition, Sex, or Age what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, for the ſpace of above Fifteen Years. The Conſtancy they find every where, and which deſerves the Admiration and pity of the moſt barbarous Executioners, increaſeth rather than diminiſheth their Fury and Cruelty.</p>
            <p>And on the other hand, after he has taken a View of the general Calamity that rages in all the <hi>Provinces,</hi> and in all the <hi>Proteſtant Houſes,</hi> let him go into the Gallies, he will find them full of Confeſſors; upon the Roads, he will meet with many others bound with Fetters. Let him repreſent to himſelf the dark and ſtinking Dungeons full of Men and Women, Maidens and Little Children, and ſee the Tears and hear the Cries of both Parents and Children, when ſnatched from their Boſoms: Let him look on the Dragoons, committing the greateſt Outrages in a thouſand and thouſand Houſes; and in other places ſhooting, killing, and ſcattering great numbers of thoſe who were gathered together to ſerve God: And ſee Fathers and Mothers ſeized and dragg'd to priſon in this Town, becauſe they have ſent their Children out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and in other places many apprehended, becauſe they had a mind to depart, and all in a general Motion either to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to make their Eſcapes, even over high Mountains that had been till now inacceſſible. Let him repreſent to himſelf great numbers of Apoſtates lying under the Laſhes and Torments of their Conſcience, for having forſaken the Truth, and committing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29835:16"/>
to their own Knowledge Idolatry; and, on the contrary, many Proteſtants and Miniſters put to the Rack within the Walls of the Priſon, going on chearfully, ſome to be hanged on the Gibbet, and others to be broken upon the Wheel, and he will have a glimpſe, but not a full ſight of the <hi>New Perſecution;</hi> and conclude, That <hi>France</hi> breeds now Monſters more horrid and cruel than <hi>Africa</hi> doth; That the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſtrive to imitate and out do the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> that roaring Lion and great Murtherer, in damning Souls, and to perform an impoſſible and contradictory thing, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to believe <hi>Popery</hi> to be true, which they are fully convinced in their own Conſciences to be falſe.</p>
            <p>But ſince the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will hearken neither to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,</hi> nor to the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> we have nothing elſe to do but to pray to God Almighty, That he will be pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, and grant the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> the Gift of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy</hi> in their Suffering.</p>
            <p>God is Witneſs, my Lord, to the many fervent <hi>Prayers</hi> your <hi>Piety</hi> hath heretofore put up in behalf of the afflicted <hi>French Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and many of them who came into this Kingdom are Witneſſes to the Comforts your Charity hath ſo liberally afforded them: So that I do not make any queſtion but your Lordſhip will practiſe them both for the future, and hope you will be pleaſed to receive kindly this doleful Diſcourſe you have put me upon, and which I could have enlarged, but have contracted, humbly offering it as a Token of my ready Obeiſance to your Commands, being, with all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect poſſible,</p>
