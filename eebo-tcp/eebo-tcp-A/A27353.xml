            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For informer Ages, thought was comparatively dark, &amp; the Sun but rising in our Horizon: But in this Age, the light of the Moon (compared with former Generations) is like the light of the Sun, &amp; the light of the Sun sevenfold, as the light of seven dayes. But alas! our not

How many e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Christians were there in former ages, who had not so much all their dayes of the riches of free Grace discovered, and of the mysteries of the Gospel unfolded, as some in this Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have had in a very little time, who have far surpassed us in this Generation for eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Faith, Love, Holy Zeal, Prayer, and Wrestling with God, Patience, Meckness, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in duty, and a Gospel adorning conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation?

lights: not in their old age, and gray Hairs, but even in the flower of their age, and in the prime and flowrishing of their Graces and Gifts. One of which was the Reverend (now Triumphant and Glorified) Author of these following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises. who was eminent for Piety and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as his Writtings do manifest. His <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Antiquities, which he published before his death, cannot but command his Learning to all knowing persons, and his Piety was so eminent to all that knew him, that he needs none of our Commendation: And these his Works (which are a specimen of his great Knowledge, Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, piety and solid Judgement) will praise him in the gate, where he draws a <hi>Vive Picture</hi> and <hi>Patern</hi> for all, but especially for Rulers and Magistrates to look on, and walk after, Which I am hopeful will be very acceptable to all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and Godly. He I say was taken away in the flower of his Age &amp; flowrishing of his Gifts: God not accounting the World worthy of him. And having left amongst his Papers these two Treatises (one of which was for me established by a privat Person, but without the knowledge and advice of the Authors Friends) some of his Friends, lovers of the publick Good, judged it
<pb facs="tcp:59412:6"/>
expedient to review and correct these Treatises that they might be published for the good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification of the Church, that he by them (though dead) might speak. Which we hope shall through Gods blessing, be very edifying, for over throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Atheism,</hi> discovering of the Souls happiness in Union and Communion with God, directing great Persons in their duty, and holding forth the excellency of the Scripture, and pointing out to these who are walking in this Wilderness the way to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> with many other edifying purposes; which that the Great God may bless, is the earnest Prayer of.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59412:20"/>
reproach and affliction of his brethren? <q>he sat down and weept and mourned certain dayes, and fasted and Prayed before the God of Heaven.</q> He cannot digest their grief <hi>Chap:</hi> 8. 9, 10. When the People Weept, he said, <q>Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions to them for whom nothing is prepared, for this day is holy, neither be ye sad for the joy of the Lord is your strength.</q> For <hi>Instruction,</hi> he causeth the Priests read to them the book of the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> 
                     <q>So they read in the book, in the Law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to understand the reading</q> ibid. 8, ver. Nor is he wanting in <hi>correction chap.</hi> 5, 7.<q> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Nobles and the Rulers;</q> and <hi>chap.</hi> 13, 25.<q> I contended with them, and cursed them, and smot certain of them, and pluckt off their hair:</q>  and in the 11, v. <hi>ibid.</hi> 
                     <q>I contended with the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;</q> and in the 17. v, again, <q>I contended with the Nobles of Judah; and 21, v. then I testified against them, and saied unto them, why lodge ye about the wall? If ye do so again I will lay hands on you.</q> And in the matter of <hi>Provision,</hi> he was of the mind of the Apostle, <q>That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought not to lay up for their Parents, but the Parents for the Children; he will not be chargeable to the People, nor take the bread of the Governour, nor buy Land; but keeps a large Table for a hundred and fifty of the Jews and Rulers, beside strangers.</q> And that no man may think this was a frolick, or an ambitious, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, popular humour, v, 15. he asserteth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59412:21"/>
                     <q>that this he did, because of the fear of God; and resolveth it into this reason; that he would not be chargeable to the People:</q> And thus I take the account of the matter, That to be chargeable to a poor exhausted People consisteth not with the fear of God, nor with the fatherly heart of a good Ruler. In fine, the Ruler should remember, that Subjection first founded in a Son is ultimatly refounded in the Commandment, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4 The good Ruler is a person well informed and throughly acquainted with the condition of his People. Such was <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> And first, Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things fall under his own eye and observation: such as the prophanation of the Sabbath, and the marriages with strangers, in this same <hi>Chap. I saw</hi> (sayes he) &amp;c. A Ruler can be nought the less a Judge that he is a Witness. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 65. What further need have we of Witnesses? behold now <hi>ye have heard,</hi> was proof sufficient, if the endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been relevant. It were good in the first place, that Rulers would suppress the enormities whereof themselves are Witnesses. Histories tell us of many famous Persons, who would go through their dominions <hi>incognito</hi> or in diguise, to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Our <hi>James</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> is known to have been much of this humour; and a pitty it is, that his methods and prattiques of information were not committed to more clear and faithful records than dark and slippery tradition. <hi>Chap;</hi> 2, 12. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> goeth out by night to view thè wall. The ancient Hieroglyphicks, which painted Rulers
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59412:21"/>
blind, may here come under correction; for he that hath not eyes and ears of his own can neither see nor hear with another mans, as is commonly said to be the case of Rulers. Other things the <hi>Tirshatha</hi> understands by information of others: And here the good Ruler will seek information <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. ver. And this proceeds from his foresaid affection; or otherways he rejects not informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that either by complaint, as in the case of the morgage 5 <hi>chap.</hi> Or simple historical relation, as the condition of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the people <hi>Chap.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and the fault of <hi>Eltashib</hi> in giving <hi>Tobiah</hi> a chamber in the house of the Lord <hi>chap,</hi> 13. 7. And the withholding of the Priests portion ver. 10. It is the part of all good Subjects, in their several Stations, to give, and the part of the good Ruler to seek and take information of evils and disorders in the Peoples condition or manners. Princes should have long ears. <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Princes said, <hi>knowest thou not that Egyptis destroyed?</hi> If he knew not, they could tell him it. But sometimes <hi>know not</hi> is one with <hi>care not,</hi> and then comes the question of the disciples, <q>master carest thou not that we perish?</q> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 12. would be remembred: <q>if thou sayest, behold, we knew it not: doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy Soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?</q> Foreign intelligence is necessary of the counsels and motions of enemies: and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is not wanting in that either; yet take it apart from homeward information and acquaintance with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59412:22"/>
our own condition, it is but <hi>foris sapere,</hi> and none of the greatest wisdom: for what is the difference betwixt a man out of his wits, and him whose wits are without him? What can a Judge say to a cause, or a Physician to a disease without infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation? And what can a Ruler do for a People, unless he be throughly acquainted with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The good Ruler is a homely, condescending, conversible, and accessible person. This necessarly maketh way for the former in practise, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from it in reason. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Hanani</hi> and and the men of <hi>Judah</hi> got access to and audience of <hi>Nehemtah. chap.</hi> 4, 22. he talketh with the People; yea he hears the complaints of the People and their wives that were oppressed <hi>chap.</hi> 5. 1. to 6.

Yea v. 15, he condescends to be a personal reprover of those of the people whom he saw profaneing the Sabbath; and likwise of the merchants v 21. and of these v. 25. who had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed by strange marriages. Nor is all this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity, but real duty, which obligeth Rulers by many commands in Scripture, to hearken the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paint and hearthe cause of the poor and needy. Hence <hi>Isayes</hi> complaint 59, 14.<q> that Judgement is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away backward, and justice standeth afar off;

that truth is fallen in the street, and equity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter;</q> it can have no access to, nor hearing of the Ruler. An unaccessible Ruler is a Luminary ecclipsed: The intercepting of the soveraign's beams from shedding their benigne influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subjects and precluding the Subject from access to receive them, are by so far more fatal than the most dismal ecclipses; these but conjecturally and contingently portend, these necessarly and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally produce and unavoidably infer the fall of a Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler; and really undo the Prince whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the person, and leave him, like a defeated <hi>Trojan</hi> with his royal blood to shift for a Kingdom, beside the wrong done to the People. If any should invert the decree <hi>Dan.</hi> 6, 7. and establish it with this alteration, that any man may freely ask pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions of any God or man, save of the King, it would be large as unpolitick as the other is ungodly. In such case <hi>Esthers</hi> resolution must carry it: <q>Behold <hi>I</hi> goe in to the King, which is not according to Law, and if <hi>I</hi> perish <hi>I</hi> perish.</q> A recluse Prince is so absurd and inconsistent, that <hi>Charles the fifth</hi> disponed his Crowns before he took himself to the Cloister: Nor should ought but despair make a Monk of a Ruler. <hi>I</hi> understand not the mystery of <hi>Gyges,</hi> how a man can see unseen; nor what but a miserable vanity can move some great Princes of the East to shut themselves up in Canopyes; but all the World knows what all the World thinks of <hi>Achilles</hi> with his distaff, and <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> in his Gynaeceum and <hi>Tiberius</hi> in his retreat at <hi>Caprea.</hi>

The Gallantry of the Ruler is evidenced in a resolute and inflexible observance of all God Holy Commandments, maugre all opposition of his own lust and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a City;</hi> Or of the example and insinuations of others, or the scorn, and threats, and plots of enemies, or the eminent degree of transgressors.

But the courage of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth particularly. 1. In his address to the King in behalf of his City that was desolate, and his People that were in reproach and affliction.

                  <p n="10">10. The good Ruler is a vigilant, active, and diligent person. We find <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in continual motion, acting himself, and exciting others in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59412:28"/>
their respective orders, like a great Superior Orb winding the Inferior in their subordinate courses. For it is the inseparable, undenyable right of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, to take inspection of all, and put every one to his proper duty. And as the Superior Orb moves not symmetrically in the place of the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, but moves in its place concentrically: Just so is the case of the Ruler. The slothful and soft Ruler is one upon the matter; and if there be any odds, a waking living Dog is better than a sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead Lyon. It was <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Honour, that neither the People, nor his own servants, nor the Princes and Rulers could be evil without a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as they were not good without an example. Whence.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The good Ruler is a person of an examplary conversation: <hi>alios quod monet ipse facit:</hi> he practis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the same, that he commandeth: by a leading example he goeth out and in before the People: <hi>he walketh with a perfect heart within his house.</hi> The World is Ruled by example. A good life is as necessar as good Laws in a Ruler; and an evil example more hurtfull than evil Laws: for that a pernicious Law may quickly be repealed; but bad example is not easily reformed. Laws govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by righteousness, and a life ordered by Law maketh the perfect Ruler. Thus we see <hi>Nehemiah</hi> examplary in Religion, in refraining and restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppression, in wisdom, courage, vigilancy, and all the forementioned vertues: and this he hath left as a pattern to Rulers.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The good Ruler is a constant person, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59412:29"/>
and abounding in well doing: he is <hi>fled fast, unmoveable, abounding alwayés in the work of the Lord knowing that his labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> Thus we see <hi>Nehemiah</hi> beginning with good designs and intentions, going on with gallant interprises and good actions, and ending conformably with a good conscience, and Glorious expectation in the last act of his appearance: <hi>Remember me O my God for good.</hi> He remembreth that <hi>better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof; and that he who indureth to the end shall be saved; and that he is crowned who striveth lawfully,</hi> and therefore <hi>so runneth that he may obtain.</hi> He knoweth <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 24. <hi>When the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth unquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, he shall not live: all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned, in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin, that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.</hi> He knows the <hi>quinquenmum Neroms,</hi> and the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving pretences and appearances of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and others: and he is better acquaint with Scripture than to be ignorant of the Apostacy, ingratitude, and fate of <hi>Joash</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. Whereby is manifest that this observation is large as useful as true concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ruler. <hi>But the path of the Iust is as the shining light which groweth brighter and brighter unto the noon-ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now from this illustrat Character shine forth in so many bright beams 1. The Original, 2, Dignity, 3, Duty, 4. Necessity, 5. Usefulness, and 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of the good Ruler. All which (so rich a piece is Scripture) may be easily deduced from one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>Psal</hi> 82 6. <hi>I have said, ye are Gods, and all of you are Children of the most high.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>I</hi> know that both is evil manners, <hi>to come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>athly into, and go hastily from the presence of a Ruler: I</hi> shall for a salutation shut up my view with this seasonable exhortation: That in this Atheistical age, the Ruler would do his Author the Honour, himself the pleasure, and a discontented, unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing World the favour, to shew forth so much of God in his person and administrations, that those who will not believe may see, and those who will not see may feel, <hi>That there is a God, that God judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the earth,</hi> and that by his vicegerent; that he be unquestionably good himself, <hi>an incourager of those that do well,</hi> and <hi>a terror of evil doers:</hi> that by the shaddow of Divinity in the Ruler, the World (if possible) may be convinced of the body and substance; and by the sight of the beautiful por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait may be enamoured of the original. And you O Christian People consider, Christ is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, nor contrary to himself. He is by nature and eternal Generation Lord of the World, and God of policy and order, as well as of the Church by pact and dispensation; and it is more than probable that Rulers hold not Christ as Mediator. Christianity received into the policy is not so unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or unpleasant a Guest as to disturb its own quarter: and Religion but getteth the medlers blow when it sendeth a sword or occasioneth divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: for of it's own nature it is a harmless peace-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suer;

and they were sworn enemies and slanderers of our Saviour who said <hi>he was an enemie to Casar;</hi> for he taught his followers <hi>to give unto Casar the things that are Casars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</hi> Learn then of him to pay what we owe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ruler. How much are we indebted to so rare and excellent a creature as is the good Ruler? We owe the Ruler 1. Honour in heart and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. 2, Subjection, in lawful obedience or in humble submission. 3. Information and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in our respective stations. 4. Tribute, and the bread of the Governour, 5. And with all our owing we owe Prayer 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 13. <hi>As saith the Proverb of the ancients, wickedness pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the wicked:</hi> But God forbid that the hand of any that fear God should be upon the Lords anointed A tender conscience so far exercised to Godliness as to flee from all appearance of evil, cannot digest the least approach to, or appearance of wrong to the Ruler: Say <hi>I</hi> this as a man, or sayeth not the Scripture the same also? <hi>ibid.</hi> 5, v. <hi>Davias heart smot him, because he had cut off Sauls skirt.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>5th</hi> view of this useful piece presents to us the <hi>Exit</hi> and retreat of the Ruler. Rulers, like men upon a Stage, walk much in a disguise, or like <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas,</hi> in a cloud; but here we have the Ruler going off with open face, and with an eye to God, to himself, and to his reward. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me O my God for good.</hi> His eye is upon God. 1. As a <hi>Witness:</hi> for remembrance is of things known, and Gods knowledge is by sight and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59412:30"/>
Intuition. He that can say with <hi>David Psal.</hi> 119 168. <hi>All my wayes are before thee,</hi> may save the travel and shun the <hi>woe</hi> of those <q>that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark, and they say, who seeth us? and who knoweth it?</q> 
                     <hi>Isay</hi> 29. 15.<q> And their turning of things upside down is as the potters clay: they attempt more than they are able, and presume where they have no power. </q> A proud Ruler may say to the Lords Messengers, <hi>who made thee of the Kings Counsel?</hi> But they would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet could tell the King of <hi>Israel</hi> the words which the Syrian King spoke in his bed-chamber: and who told him but God that heard them? Let Rulers learn in their time to put God upon their counsels, and make him a witness of their practises; left when they must goe off, they find with <hi>Jacob,</hi> that God was there, though they knew it not, nor called him to the Council. 2. As a <hi>Friend: O my God.</hi> Happy he, Ruler or other, who can say with his Saviour, <hi>I go to my Father and my God.</hi> He may, in the Apostles words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a bold defiance to all adversity: <hi>If God be with us who shall be against us?</hi> He may meditat ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with the greatest security <hi>Isay</hi> 33, 18. Though the World should be shaken and suffer sack, he may say with the Philosopher, but upon better reason, that he is sure to be no loser: yea though Hell were poured upon him, and heaven should seem to have forsaken him, <hi>My God, My God</hi> even then shall support him, <hi>Every one seeks the Rulers favour;</hi> and the Ruler would study to have a friend of his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59412:31"/>
Superior. They who court alliance and interest, would be perswaded that this is the highest. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>war of that friend that makes God an enemy, and of that gain where God is losed. <hi>Luther</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces him a Divine, who can well distinguish the Law and Gospel: and he is no less a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Ruler or other, who can reconcile them in, <hi>my God.</hi> Wouldst thou either get or know an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in God, take the short and sure method of the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> who also himself was a great Ruler, in that golden <hi>Ps.</hi> 16, 2. <hi>O my soul thou hast said un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, thou art my Lord.</hi> 3. As a <hi>rewarder:</hi> for his, <hi>remember,</hi> being a figure that putteth the antecedent for the consequent, in proper speaking is, reward me. And <hi>shall not he render to every man according to his works? Prov.</hi> 24, 12. <hi>Ps.</hi> 62, 12 <hi>And verily there is a reward for the righteous. Fear not Abraham, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> I fear the bad reward of some, hath tempted others to do well to themselves in their own time; but with greater reason I fear that those who are thus tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have but a faint respect to the recompense of reward. But God who is not unfaithful, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the service and labour of any, will sure be mindful of a good Ruler. If <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> be reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his faults remembred, and wrath threatned; yet his good deeds are not forgotten: <hi>Nevertheless there are good things found in thee</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 2. 3. Most frequently throught the Scripture the saints petition for reward is presented in the Word, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> whereby they referr particulars to him<q> who is able to do abundantly above all that they

In his retreat he goes off with an eye to himself; <hi>Remember me</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>I</hi> beseech thee O Lord remember now, how <hi>I</hi> have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight?</q> Or with <hi>Samuel</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12 3. <q>I have walked before you from my Child-hood to this day: behold here <hi>I</hi> am, witness against me before the Lord, and before his anointed: whose ox have <hi>I</hi> taken? or whose ass have <hi>I</hi> taken? or whom have <hi>I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded?
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59412:32"/>
whom have <hi>I</hi> oppressed? or of whose hand have <hi>I</hi> received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith? and <hi>I</hi> will restore it you.</q> Or if in any thing, as a man, he hath erred, for that he must say to God with <hi>Nehemiah chap.</hi> 13, 22. <q>Remember me O my God and spare me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greatness of thy mercy.</q> A good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is a strong comforter: but Gods sweet and tender mercies are the sinners last refuge and sure salvation: and it is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own Conclusion. <hi>Tutius tamen est adherere Christs Justitiae.</hi> And if so, why should unhappy men so voluminously dispute against their own mercy? <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 77. <q>Let thy tender mercys come unto me that <hi>I</hi> may live,</q> was the suit of the man according to Gods heart, the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Rulers. And truely this Generation would be advised to amend their manners before they change their Religion, lest under the gilded large net of <hi>Popery,</hi> by the Doctrine of merits, they be involved and held in the inextricable grin of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration: Or if indulgence and pardon in end must do it, what ails them at Gods, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly better than the <hi>Popes,</hi> and incompareably surer, beside that it is manifestly cheaper? But for the Conscience of a Ruler, who can say with <hi>Titus</hi> that darling of mankind? <hi>Non extare ullum suum factum Paeniteneum, excepto duntaxat uno.</hi> 2. <hi>His soul:</hi> The Soul and Conscience are of such affinity that he who destroyes the one cannot save the other: <q>And what doth it profit a man though he should gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Or what is the hope of the Hypocrite, though he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59412:32"/>
hath gained,when God taketh away his soul?</q>  The soul is the man, and he hath got his prize who gets that for a Prey. <q>The end of our faith is the salvation of our souls</q> 
                     <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 175. <q>Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee,</q> was the rare and suit of that excellent Ruler.

For whether slow footed Time, which changeth not his pace for fair weather or foul, for Summer or Winter, advance at the ordinary rate of Journey; or whether death take post, or changes take wing, and calamity come suddenly; or whether all these hold the ordinary road with a warning, or take the by-way with a suprisal, It is time for the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to think of his removal. It is gravely observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pedro Mexia,</hi> that there is no death incident to men which hath not happened to Emperours: Discontent and Grief is so ordinar to their rank, that almost it seems to be proper: and how few of them escape a misfortune, even Children are taught from <hi>Iuvenal.</hi>

To the Dead, it is life: to the living, it is health: to the weary, it is refreshment: to the weak, it is strength: to Babes, it is milk: to strong men, it is meat: to the hungry, it is bread: to the thirsty, it is waters: To the drooping soul and sorrowful heart, it is wine: to the faint, it is apples and Pomegranats, cinnamon, safron, spiknard, Calamus and all spices of the merchant. To such who love dainties, it is marrow and fatness, honey of the rock and droping from the honey-comb: to the wounded, it is the balme of Gilead: to the blind and weak sighted, it is eye salve and oyntment to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the eyes. To such neat souls as love to be all Glorious within, and to keep clean Garments, it is a Crown, chains of the neck, braceless, ear-rings, pendents and Ornaments of all sorts: and if they like to be in fashion and to go fyne in the court of a Heavenly Conversation and communion with God, it presents them a bright large glass whereat they may dayly adorn themselves to purpose.

But 3 The saddest of all is, that they find the word not only silent for them, but to speak directly and aloud against them, as they think, smiting, hewing and hammering them, with sad and heavy threatnings and intimations of determined wrath rejection and ruine to come upon them from the Lord. In all these they err, not knowing the Scriptures, But that yet for all this there is hope, and that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are not to be casten out with as unkind and uncomfortable Companions in such cases, Let these things be considered for vindication of the Scriptures to Souls thus exercised.</p>

And 1. Be it granted as the truth is, that a Souls case may be such for Circumstances, that the Scriptures mention none Parallel with it in all points to have been cured (the same is all along to be understood respectivly of Churches and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as of particular persons) yet I am confidently perswaded, that there is no case now incident to any whether Nation, Church, or Person, but the Scripture holdeth forth some either, as evil or worse, whether for sin or suffering that have been helped. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you</hi> (sayes the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 13) <hi>but such as is common to man.</hi> Is thy case sinful? behold the Scripture tells us, that he obtained mercy who once a day thought himself <hi>the chief of sinners.</hi> 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 1, 15. And that as an exquisite and rare piece of mercy is set forth in the Gospel, for a pattern to all those who should afterwards believe in Christ to life everlasting. Christ loves to have sinners change and for that he puteth forth his pattern, as Merchants do their samplers of Rich Wares: and sure he hath since that time put off many such pieces, and yet the pattern stands forth shewing that their is more, abundance to serve all that have need. To say nothing of <hi>Paul</hi>'s sin which sure was great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor of many who since his time may have thought themselves the chief of sinners as well as he did (where I think I see a kind of strife among mercies Clients who shall be most beholding to free Mercy and free Grace) This pattern makes it fully certain that there is mercy for the chief of sinners be who he will, and that he, whosoever he

Yea I find an excellent, rare, comfortable Dispensation of God to his People, that he will sometimes scourge them with the Golden Rod of Martyrdom, and correct their faults in an Honourable way, and chastile them soundly, and yet never let the World know, what is betwixt him and them. The Lord loves not to proclaim and blaze the bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faults of his People, nor to make them Odious to the World which hath a bad enough Opinion of them alwayes: But if I must correct my Child saith he, I will stay till the World and he fall out in some point of Conscience, in Faith or manners, wherefore he must suffer, and then in my Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Wisdom, I will shew a rare Conjunction or meeting of these three Planets in one house. 1. The correction of my Child. 2. His Glory, and 3. His acceptable Duty; and I will let him earn a reward of thanks and Glory in that very suffering wherein I shall visit his iniquities, and he shall give Testimony for me. God can go many Earauds at once, and sold up many Projects in one piece of Providence: <hi>the Lord will finish the whole work and cut it short in Righteousness, because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.

Here it is fit to remember <hi>Luther</hi>'s seasonable warning, that when <hi>David</hi> in his Prayers speaketh of his Righteousness, we would refer it to its true correlative, to wit, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men his enemies he was Righteous; but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God that is his Language, <hi>Be merciful to me O God, be merciful to me, in the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquities Psal.</hi> 51. The accuser of Gods Children will be ready to carry ill reports betwixt him and them, and to keep up an ill understanding betwixt them, if he can, and in times of suffering for their Duty he will not be idle: he will tell them a thousand Stories of their own sins, to weaken their hands and cause them believe, that God will never accept service of them, but that they shall come foul off with all their fair Essayes. Ye have heard of Gods Gracious Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and now these are the Devil's malicious wyles; but a Syllogism or Argument framed of one premise of Gods, and another of the Devil's, will never infer a Conclusion of Faith, and that can claime <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

First when he suffereth for his Religion and for his cause. <hi>2dly</hi> when a man suffereth any thing that God layeth on him quietly and for Christs will and commands sake. This Latter is more general than the former, and the former must be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in this Latter: els the former suffering for Christs cause, if it be not in love and obedience for Christs sake, out of Conscience to fulfil his will is nothing: whereas he that endureth patiently endures Affliction for Christ, though he never be put to it to suffer for profession of Christ: and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> such an one were put to it, he would readily suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for Christs cause: and such Afflictions as these thus patiently endured, work also this excellent weight of Glory as well as the other. By these and the like reasonings of faith, you may world your Souls to patience as <hi>David</hi> and others have done by <hi>casting Anchor on God</hi> and on his word fixing their stay and hope in God. Let the issue of your reasoning be this, I will wait on God, and yet for all matter of disquietment will praise him who is the health of my countenance and my God.</q> Thus Mr. <hi>Scudder,</hi> and truely none could have spoken more, nor to better purpose in so few words.</p>
                  <p>And thus have <hi>I</hi> spoken to Scripture examples of cases Parralleling the weightiest of cases, incident to any man now living. Only be it remembered that cases are as faces, many agree in some things some in many things, none in all things. There is in every mans case something peculiar, aggravating it beyond
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59412:44"/>
that of another man, and (as the Heart knows its own grief) every man knows best the plague of his own Heart; but he knows not, at least feels not his Neighbours sores: Hence every one judgeth his own case worst of all, it may be the best is bad enough, and yet the worstis not so bad but it may be better.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, for Vindication of the Scriptures from the foresaid disheartning prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I shall lay down this very self-ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the querulous Soul doth walk, though with a halting foot. <hi>That those Cases are hopeful and cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that are paralleled and practicable in Scripture,</hi> that is to say, That such whereof the Scripture gives account, have been either hopeful and curable, or actually have been cured and helped. And thus I reason, <hi>è converso,</hi> or by exchange. That case is hopeful and curable which is paralleled and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: But such is thy case, it hath a match in Scripture, and therefore curable. That is Paralleled and hath a match in Scripture I prove thus: A case concluded hopeless hath a match in Scripture: But such is thy case, thou concludes it hopeless: And therefore it hath a match in Scripture. That a case concluded hopeless hath a match in Scripture, it is clear, in that the Lord finds fault with those in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> that said their was no hope, and assures them there is hope; if they will return and repent. It is clear likewise from the Churches case in <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who said her judgment was passed over of the Lord, and for that is taxed, that she spoke unreasonably. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise from <hi>David</hi>'s case in the <hi>Psalms,</hi> that said, <hi>He was cut off from God's presence,</hi> and yet he
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59412:45"/>
found heart to look again to God, and to cry to him and was heard, notwithstanding his former peremptoriness: Likewise from the case of the Church, or <hi>Ieremiah</hi> for the Church in the <hi>Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> who with one breath said, <hi>My hope and my strength is perished from the Lord,</hi> and at the next breath could say, <hi>This I call to mind, therefore have I hope.</hi> And thereupon hath left a general expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental instruction to all others, <hi>That it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the Lord, Lament.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
                  <p>But in the third place, The Soul affected is to be advertised and put in mind, that it is an error and weakness to think that matchless and unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled cases, are therefore hopless and uncureable: For it is to be considered, that Scripture instances and examples of parallel matching cases, are neither the only, nor compleat, nor principal ground of curing and resolving cases: For some cases were the first of their kind, and so could have no precedent, nor yet practicable example: And yet in that case, according to this crazie principle, <hi>That no unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralleled Case is curable,</hi> the very fixed examples and choice copies of curable cases should themselves have remained uncurable, as having no precedent nor example: but the only square and compleat ground of curing all cases, is the whole Scripture, whereof examples are but a small part, and that too, but as the illuminating colours, and not the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial lineaments thereof: For <hi>exempla illustrant,</hi> examples do but enlighten things, and all that an example can do, is to show that such a case is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59412:45"/>
practicable, and potentially curable: But it doth not, it cannot actually cure it. Wherefore the principal, yea proper ground of resolving and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all cases, are the universal fundamental truths of the Gospel, the knowledge of God and Christ, and of God in Christ according to the Gospel, whereof the Covenant of Grace is the sum and text; and this <hi>David</hi> knew right well 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. This Covenant will mend all the holes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers house, and compleatly fit every case he can be in: <hi>Till the foundations be destroyed</hi> it is never time to ask, <hi>what can the Righteous do? Psal.</hi> 11. 3. But so long as there is a God in Heaven that doth wonders, so long as Christ is all, and in all, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o long as Gods Covenant with his Saints endures, which shall be while Sun and Moon endure, and longer too, For his Covenant shall live to lay its hands upon those two shining Eyes of this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible World that is passing and posting off daily, and which now (like the first Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 13.) decaying and waxing old, is ready to evanish and die; So long (I say) as these foundations stand sure, the righteous, in every case may still know what to do: <hi>For upon these shall Mercy be built, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness established in the very Heavens, Psal.</hi> 89. 2. <hi>I</hi> shall illustrate this consideration with the case of Relapses, a case right perplexing to exercised Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and wherein they find the Scripture sparing of examples, at least of frequent relapses into the same fault, which, makes them apprehend there is no hope. These <hi>I</hi> write, not that any should sin (and sure for that very cause, the Spirit of God in Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59412:46"/>
hath beeen more sparing of such examples) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> if any man have sinned and relapsed often into sin, Let him remember. 1. Christ's <hi>Seventy times Seven times, Matth</hi> 18, 22. And withall, that as far as Heaven is above the earth, so far are his wayes above our wayes, and his thoughts above ours. <hi>Isai.</hi> 55. 9. Let him remember. 2, The indefinit promises <hi>Ezek</hi> 18. 27. and the like, That when and what time soever a sinner shall repent, he shall find mercy, 3. Let him remember chiefly, <hi>the blood of Christ that cleanseth us from all sin.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1; 7. And <hi>4thly</hi> if he must have examples, Let him read the History of <hi>Israel</hi>'s relapses in the book of <hi>Iudges,</hi> Notwithstanding which, the Lord as often as he heard their penitent cryes, returned, and Repented, and sent them Saviours. And let him read a notable place <hi>Psalm</hi> 78. 38. 40. In the 38 <hi>verse,</hi> many a time he delivered them, and forgave them: but how many times did he that in the 40. <hi>verse,</hi> how many a time did they provoke him? Even as often as they provoked him, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> often he forgave them: And when any man shall tell me precisely how often they provoked him, I shall then tell him peremptorly how often he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave them. A simple Soul may possibly think to prevail with God at a time, by pleading thus after the manner of men: Help me O Lord this once, and pardon my sin, and <hi>I</hi> shall never trouble thy Majesty again. <hi>I</hi> apprehend such are sometimes the thoughts of some. But when Heaven and earth shall be measured in one line, when God shall be as man or as the son of man, when his ways shall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59412:46"/>
be as our ways, and his thoughts as our thoughts; when I shall see the man that shall not be behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mercy, Or the day wherein we ought not to Pray, <hi>forgive us our debts,</hi> or the time when it shall be lawful to limit <hi>the Holy one of Israel,</hi> then shall <hi>I</hi> think that a convenient Argument: But if <hi>I</hi> understand the Gospel, it might be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeming God and his Grace in the Gospel, to plead after this manner; O Lord be gracious to me and forgive me this once; And if ever <hi>I</hi> need, <hi>I</hi> shall come to thee again. Providing always that the Grace of God be not turned into wantonness, nor this our liberty used for an occasion to sin.</p>
                  <p>Now for confirmation of what hath been said in this consideration, I shall apply my self briefly to two places of Scripture. The first is <hi>Psal</hi> 22, 7. where I observe these things from the whole tenor of the <hi>Psalm.</hi> 1. A saint's case may be right odd, and in many things without a match, <hi>but I am a worme and no man, a reproach of men</hi> &amp;c. 2. I see in afflicted Saints a strong inclination to aggrege their own case, and to reason themselves out of case, with a sort of pleasure, <hi>verse</hi> 4. <hi>Our Fathers trusted in thee, and thou deliveredst them;</hi> but I am not like other men, <hi>I am a worme and no man,</hi> the very language of dejected Spirits to this day. 3. I see, that when they have reasoned themselves never so far out of account, beyond all example or match of case Parrallel, there is yet some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ground, for the faith of the desolate Soul to travel upon, in its search for discoveries of light and comfort, for we see how he goes on complaining,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59412:47"/>
searching, believeing, and Praying till he arrives at Praise, which ever lyes at the far end of the darkest Wilderness that a Saint can go thorow: for when a Saint is in the thickest darkness and under the greatest damps, there is still <hi>aliquid ultra,</hi> something before them; and that is, <q>light for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart.</q> 4. <hi>I</hi> see that a humble well tamed Soul will stoop right low to lift up such grounds of hope and incouragement, as to a Soul that is lifted up might seem but slender and mean: <hi>thou tookest me from my mothers belly, and caused me to hope upon the breasts.</hi> A humble faith will winn its meat amongst other folks feet, and when all examples fail such, they will find an example in themselves furnishing them with matter of hope. 5. <hi>I</hi> see there may be extant signal and manifest evidences of Gods kindness to his People in former times, and in cases as pressing as the present, the Memory whereof, for a long time may be darkned with the prevailing sense of incumbent pressures. <hi>verse</hi> 21. <hi>save me from the Lyons mouth, for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</hi> 6. Though all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels and matching examples of other mens cases fail a Saint; yet to him it is sufficient ground of Faith and matter of Praise, that his own case hath been helped, when once it hath been as ill as now it is, <hi>thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns;</hi> and therefore <hi>I will declare thy name amongst my brethren, in the midst of the Congregation will I praise thee.</hi> 7. If there, must be examples of leading cases, if so <hi>I</hi> may call them, then some must be the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59412:47"/>
example by being first in that case? And thus often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, he that finds no Parallel before him, leaves one behind him: And indeed we should be as well content, if so the will of God be, to be examples to others of suffering affliction and enduring ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as to have examples of others, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sayes he, verse 27. <hi>All the ends of the World shall remember this,</hi> and in the last verse, <hi>They shall declare to the people that shall be to come, that he hath done this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>2d</hi> place of Scripture <hi>I</hi> direct my thoughts to is <hi>Iob.</hi> 5. 8, 9. <hi>Iob</hi>'s case was clearly unparallel'd and absolutly matchless: And sayes <hi>Eliphaz</hi> the <hi>Temanite, I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause.</hi> And that he might do that upon good ground, he shewes in the 9 <hi>verse,</hi> for (sayes he) <hi>God doth great things.</hi> Why, sayes the Soul, mine is a great case, then he doth great things; Why, <hi>I</hi> know what he doth: No, neither thou nor all the World knows that, nor can find it out for <hi>he doth unsearchable things.</hi> Whether that he is a God that cannot be known, be a greater mercy. or that he is an unknown God be to us a greater misery, is that which <hi>I</hi> know not: but this <hi>I</hi> know well, that more of the knowledge of God, and larger thoughts of him would loose many a knot, and answer many a perplexing case, to his People. Yea, but sayes the Soul, it shall be a wonder, a very miracle if ever my case mend; Why, then sayes <hi>Eliphaz, he doth marvelous things.</hi> Yea but God's wonders are not his every-dayes work; but they are a few rare pieces of his kindness shewed to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59412:48"/>
eminent Saints, and great favourities, And we are not obliged to expect wonders: Yet, <hi>I</hi> hope you are obliged to believe Gods word, that he doth such things, and those too <hi>without number;</hi> and you are obliged to obey Gods voice, to seek unto him, and unto him to commit your cause, and you are obliged to give God his own latitude, and as well not to limit him if he will do wonders, as not to tempt him to wait for wonders: And <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 10. <hi>wilt thou shew wonders to the dead?</hi> makes it clear, that God will turn the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upside down, and make the World Reel as we see <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. at length, And will do wonders to purpose, that even the dead shall be witnesses of, before that his beloved be not delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Now to descend into the particular grounds of the cures of Saints cases, were to go through all the Attributes of God, all the offices of Christ, all the promises of the Gospel, and Articles of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which are the substantial Linca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that well contrived piece the Word of God, which is so well illumnated with the lively colours of examples sufficient, and those so well mixed and so justly distinguished, one having what another wants, and the other having what it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and wanting what it had, that it speaks the finger of God to have done it, and leaves a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to nature and Art once to come near it.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth place <hi>I</hi> offer this to be considered by the Soul distempered, that is like to fall unkind with the Word of God, thorow an apprehension. That all the threatnings of the Word are directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

Which general asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it will be fit to clear in these particular Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions. 1. God will never cast off the universal Church, nor leave himself destitute of a People upon the Earth, who may owne him and his Truth, and may hold forth the Word of Life, shining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Universal,</hi> which sometimes is cloathed in Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, and sometime again is set upon the Dunghill: Sometimes is courted of the multitude in the City, and sometimes is persecuted and driven to the Wilderness: Sometimes is more visible and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the incorporat Societies of National Churches, sometimes more latent and obscure in some few single persons scattered up and down in the World; who, it may be, in their time, are as little obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the World, as the seven thousand true Worshipers were by <hi>Elias</hi> in his time. There is a time, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 12. when <hi>a man is hidden:</hi> And the Lord in the worst of times hath <hi>his hidden ones,</hi> Psal. 83. 3. And when <hi>judgement returns unto righteousness, all the upright in Heart will follow after it,</hi> Psal. 94. 15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God may utterly reject and totally cast off the visible Body of a particular Church: Witness the Church of the Jews at this day, and the seven famous Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. God may sententially reject his People by Threatnings, when he doth it not, nor minds to do it eventually and effectually in his Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

In a word, God may cast out with his people, and not cast them off for all that: He may Censure them within doors, when he minds not to put them to the door: The Lord may say; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not owne a Whore, and yet he is Married to her: and he threatens to cast off a Whore, that so he may keep still an honest Woman.</p>

is <hi>Hosea</hi>'s in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Children of a Whore</hi> and the <hi>Children of her Whoredoms.</hi> This Whorish Church had lawfully begotten Children <hi>Ammi</hi> and <hi>Ruchamah,</hi> to whom the Prophet, who likwise himself was one, and a brother of those Children, is commanded to apply himself, and of these there were few in that time of publick Apostacy. But then in the <hi>4th verse</hi> of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> there are the ill begotten Children of her Whoredoms, whose names in the 1 <hi>Chapter</hi> were called <hi>Loammi</hi> and <hi>Loruchamah,</hi> and these were many. The Children of Whoredoms are those who comply in judgment or practice with the common course of a Churches Apostacy, whose Faith and Principles (if they have any) are not the fruit of the immortall seed of the incorrupted Word of God; but of the inventions and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of men, or the delusions and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures of <hi>Satan,</hi> which their Adulterous Mother, the Church that so breeds them, (who is damned for that she hath forsaken her first faith) is so fond of. If a Woman be a gaudy, light Person, it may readily render her Children suspected: but if she be an arrand notorious Whore, then it is too likely, and in the case of Religion, it is almost necessary and certain, that <hi>si Mater Meretrix, Filia talis erit.</hi> If the mother be a Whore, the Daughter will be such also, and so the Proverb shall be fulfilled <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 44. <hi>As is the Mother so is the Daughter.</hi> Papists breed their Children Papists, and other Folk breed their Children such as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are, and few Children make their Fathers

Religion better: and therefore sad is the case of young ones that fall into corrupt times: and sad is the condition of these times wherein young ones are bred corrupt. There is little appearance, if Soveraign goodness interpose not, that they shall soon be better: Because a person ordinarly persists in those Principles wherewith they have been first possessed by education: for <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that <hi>whatsoever way a Child is trained up in, he will not depart from it when he is old:</hi> and, <hi>quo semel est imbutarecens servabit odorem testa diu.</hi> A new vessel will keep the first scent long. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there is real ground of fear, that such times shall still grow worse and worse: for evil begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings have worse proceedings, <hi>they proceed</hi> (saith the Prophet <hi>from evil to worse;</hi> Jer. 9, 3. And <hi>evil men and seducers,</hi> saith the <hi>Apostle, proceed and wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</hi> 2 Timoth. 3. 13. <hi>I hid me and was wroth,</hi> saith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Isai. 57, 17. <hi>And he went on frowardly in the way of his heart:</hi> And what shall the end be? and where will they stand? if the Lord say not that also which followes in the 18. <hi>verse, I have seen his wayes, and I will heal him.</hi> Prelacy will breed Popery to which it naturally inclines.

But the other sort of Children that are the <hi>Children of the Whore,</hi> yet <hi>not of her Whoredoms,</hi> but of her Marriage bed, are these whose Faith is the off-spring of that first Faith of the Apostat Church, and that unspoted chaste Religion which she professed, before she forsook her first Faith and brake her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Marriage; and who owne their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Father, whom their Whorish Mother hath dishonoured and forsaken, and who with grief and shame make mention of the lewdness of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who mourn for her back-slidings, and plead (as here in the <hi>2d verse</hi> they are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) for the honour and right of their Father: With these it shall not fare worse for their Mothers cause, for they are fellow sufferers of reproach with their Father, and they bear his name: nor will he deny his interest in them, they are <hi>Ammi,</hi> nor yet will he refuse them Fatherly kindness and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are <hi>Ruhamah</hi> to him: And though their base Mother by Adulterating her Faith doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit her dowry of the priviledges of a true Church; yet their Righteous Father will find himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by their Mothers Marriage Covenant and contract, to give them the Inheritance of lawfully begotten Children: and they shall be kept and brought up in his House, when she shall be sent off to call her Lovers <hi>Baali,</hi> with her Adulterous

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iece she is, to whom the Lord does all this, neither minding God nor his Covenant nor Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; but courting her lovers and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her lightness: and yet the Lord pursues her, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ight and litle worth as she is, courts her, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites her to come home. All this is strange, and yet all this is but like God, that the <hi>Holy One of Israel</hi> should thus like the <hi>Adullamite</hi> Judah<hi>'s friend Gen.</hi> 38. go to seek a Harlot by the way side.</p>
                  <p>But consider. 1. That when the Lord Married her, he knew all the faults that followed her, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ook her with them all. If God had not known before what she would prove, it might be strange that thus he suits her: but if there be any thing to be admired here, it is his first love to her whom
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59412:59"/>
he knew to be such an one. But <hi>2dly</hi> consider where will the Lord do better? Where is there any in the World that without his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking would serve him otherwayes? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore till the Lord find a better match, he thinks (and with all reason) even as good hold him at his first choise: Especially since 3. He knows of a way how to gain her: And 4. sees her already rewing her courses, and saying that she will return to her first husband. And by all this 5. he will let it be seen that he is not so unstable and light as she is. She could find in her heart to entertain others in his place, and surely she was not ill to please, that could take an Idol in his rooms: but yet he will make it manifest to all the World, that <hi>he is God and changes not;</hi> and therefore he will mantain his old kindness to her, and will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the love of her espousals, and the kindness of her youth: For 6. Foolish as she was, he had gotten more love of her in former times, than he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of all the World besides. And thus the very case stands betwixt God and his deboarding Children and backsliding People unto this day.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59412:62"/>
his People, is confirmed By these three things from the Scripture. The 1. is, Scripture <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> to this purpose, such as the many <hi>Beholds</hi> that the Lord either prefixes or annexes to his works, whereof we have one in this place; and <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 37. We are commanded to <hi>mark and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the end both of the upright and of the transgress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</hi> And to the head of commands (because I love not to multiply things without great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) I refer all these things that are proper perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents and pendicles of a command. 1. <hi>Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> such as <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 31. O <hi>generation see ye the word of the Lord.</hi> 2. <hi>complaints and expostulations</hi> such as Isai 26. 11. <hi>Lord when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see.</hi> 3. <hi>Promises,</hi> such as Hosea. 6. 3. <hi>Then shall ye know, if ye follow on to know the Lord</hi> &amp;c. 4. <hi>Threatnings,</hi> such as Psal. 28. 5. <hi>because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up;</hi> with Psal. 50. 22. <hi>Consider this ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver.</hi> 5. <hi>Commendations,</hi> such as Psal. 107, 43. <hi>whoso is wise and will observe these things</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Hosea</hi> 14. 9. And he that was a wise man and a great observer tells us <hi>Eccles.</hi> 2, 14. that <hi>the wise mans eyes are in his head.</hi> 6. We have also <hi>Discommendations</hi> and <hi>Exprobrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> wherewith the Lord upbraids such as observe not his works and ways <hi>Isai</hi> 42. 18. <hi>they are deaf and blind that will not see:</hi> yea <hi>Ieremy</hi> 4, 22. calls them <hi>Sottish,</hi> and the <hi>Psalmists</hi> call them <hi>Bruits Psal</hi> 92, 6. So then by the command of God which is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted determiner of Duty it is a necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59412:62"/>
duty to observe the Lords works and ways towards his People.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>2d.</hi> thing that confirmes the point, is this, That the Works of God are wrought before his People for that very end, that they may observe them: and he makes his ways known to men, that all men may observe him: take but one pregnant place for this. <hi>Isai</hi> 41, 20. <hi>That they may see and know and consider and understand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the Holy one of Israel hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it. The Holy one of Israel</hi> is no Hypocrite, and yet he doth all his works to be seen of men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing that confirmes the point is, the usefulness of the works of God: There is never a work of God, but it hath some excellent instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to men that will observe them: every work hath a word in its mouth. There is something of use in every one: God speaks no idle words: every word of God is pure, yea his words are like Silver tryed in the furnace seven times: there is no dross nor refuse in the Bible: the <hi>light of Israel</hi> and <hi>his Holy One</hi> works no unfruitful works, like the works of darkness: Gods works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence are an inlargement and continuation of his first piece of Creation; and if the first edition of his works was all very good, perfect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproveable; how excellent to all admiration must the last edition be, after so many? But who is wise to understand these things, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to know them? who hath these two useful volumes of the word and works of God bound in one, and so makes joynt use of them in their day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59412:63"/>
reading? But howbeit many are unlearned, and to many the book be sealed, yet there are rare things in the book. So then since the works of God are so useful, it concerns us to observe them as things tending, even as also they are intended, to our great advantage. And upon this very useful consideration, we will find our selves obliged to observe seriously the Lords works and ways to his People; except we can answer that question, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, seeing he hath no heart to it. Prov.</hi> 17, 16. <hi>I</hi> shall not here mention that which is, if not a strange confirmation, yet a clear illustration of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and it is the practice of Saints in Scripture who have been diligent students of all the works of God universally, and particularly of his ways to his People: and some have been such proficient by their observations, that they have been able to leave us a perfect Chronicle, with a diurnal account of events in their time, as the Scripture-Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; others have searched so deep, by the special assistance of him that searcheth all things, even the deep things of God, that they have been able to frame us certain and everlasting Almanacks of the state of future times; as the Prophets. But to pass these, as being acted and assisted by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary motion and measure of the Spirit of God, Look we thorow all the Scriptures, how Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous observers of the works of God and his ways whether in general to his People, or to themselves in particular, we find even ordinary Saints and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary persons in their ordinary conversation to have been.</p>

                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:59412:63"/>
Now being convinced that it is our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Duty to observe diligently the works of God, and his Dispensations to his People: Two great Questions require to be answered for our further satisfaction, and better instruction in this Duty. 1, <hi>VVhat are we specially to observe in the works of God and his Dispensations to his People?</hi> 2. <hi>How are we to observe the works of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the first Question then, be it presupposed, 1. That there is no work of God, nor any thing in any work of God, how common and ordinary soever, that is not <hi>excellent and Glorious, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be searched out, Psal.</hi> 111. 2, 3, 4. But 2. Of all the works of God, some are more Glorious and observable than others, and of every work of God, some things are more excellent and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy than others. 3. That we are not able to observe or take up fully any work of God; far less all his works. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8, 17. Whereupon it follows in all reason 4. that we are to apply our selves to the observation of some things especially in the works of God. Otherwise as by a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual endless divisibility, of the least continuous body (according to the principles of <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Philosophy) a midges wing may be extended to a quantity able to cover the outmost Heavens: so the observation of the meanest work of God, may abundantly furnish discourse deducable to perpetuity. But then what shall come of short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathed man, whose days are an hand breadth, in the attempt of an impossibility? he mustly by the gate, and leave the rest (as <hi>Italians</hi> do their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59412:64"/>
chess playes) to be told by his posterity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I</hi> shall but hint compendiously at these four things chiefly, to be observed seriously in the works of God, and his ways towards his People.</p>

We would consider and observe seriously the works themselves with all their circumstances, and this is a part to know the times, to know what the Lord is doing to his people in the times <hi>none would be such strangers in Ierusalem as not to know the things that happen there in their days</hi> Luke 24, 18. David Psal. 143, 5. <hi>can say, I meditat on all thy works, I muse on the work of thy hands.</hi> We might think him a bad Mariner who being at sea should not be able at any time to tell from what airth the wind did blow; and we may think him a litle better Christian who can give no account of the times, nor of the Works of God in the times; and knows not, it may be cares not, how the wind blows upon the Church and People of God. Every one that would be worthy of their roome in the time, would study to be acquainted with the accidents of divine Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the time; not out of <hi>Athenian curiosity,</hi> but <hi>Christian inquiry;</hi> But if it be asked, how far is it betwixt <hi>Antioch</hi> and <hi>Athens?</hi> or plainly what difference is there betwixt Christian inquiry and <hi>Athenian</hi> curiosity? it may not be amiss (as <hi>Paul inpassing by beheld their devotion Act.</hi> 17. 23.) by the way to take notice out of <hi>Act,</hi> 17. 19. 20. 21. of these three properties of <hi>Athenian</hi> curiosity, which difference is from Christian inquiry,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It runs all upon new things; Even the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59412:64"/>
truths of the Gospel, and the best things in Gods dispensations, if once they become old and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, do not relish with curiosity. 2. Curiosity satisfies it self with telling and hearing of those new things; it hears to tell, and tells what it hears, and tells that it may tell, and nothing els, as the <hi>Text</hi> says; it is taken up with the report of things more than with the things; it is an empty airy thing. 3. It is a time spending thing: they spend their time so, sayes the <hi>Text:</hi> Curiosity like nigards can spend well upon another mans purse, and give li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally of that which is none of its own: let no man trust his time to Curiosity, which will be sure to give him a short account of <hi>All spent.</hi> But for further satisfaction in the difference betwixt <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> curiosity and Christian Inquiry, let all that be considered which rests to be answered to both the Questions proponed before, upon a particular sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey whereof, we shall be able to give a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct judgment in the case of this difference. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is kindness not curiosity that makes men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how their friends do: so where there is true kindness to the People of God, it will kyth in a solicitous inquiry concerning their state in all things. But, as the man asked Christ, <hi>who then is my neighbour?</hi> so may the Church and People of God justly ask, But who is my friend? she sees so many as the <hi>Levite,</hi> pass by on the other side, who never turn aside, so much as once to ask how she does, and to whom all is as nothing that she suffers. <hi>Lament.</hi> 1. 12, <hi>Is it nothing to you all ye that</hi>

                     <p>The <hi>2d</hi> thing to be observed in the works of God, is, the Author and hand that worketh these works. This the Saints have observed in the works of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 39, 9. this they will that others may observe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 109 27. This all may, and ought, and shall in the end see <hi>Psal.</hi> 9, 16. <hi>Isai</hi> 26. 11. who ever be the <hi>Amanuensis</hi> or what ever be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gods works, as <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles, are all gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven under his own hand, with this inscription, <hi>all these have my hands done.</hi> The Scripture hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse expressions to this purpose, of the finger of God, the hand of God, the arme of the Lord, and God himself appearing in his works, intimating the gradual difference of manifestations of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, appearing sometimes more darkly, sometimes more clearly in the works and dispensations of God. And yet even the smallest character of providence, if men had on their Spectacles, is sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous and may be discerned that it is the hand writing of the Lord, for that it hath a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar stampt of Divinity that cannot be counterfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Yea not only shall it be well with the Righteous in the end, but <hi>every thing</hi> how cross soever in the way shall conduce and <hi>concurr to work his wellfare:</hi> And this is a truth that shall never fail, and wherein there is no fear of mistake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And the Scripture abounds with Noble instances of this truth. But by the contrary, all things how pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous soever that fall to the wicked in his way, shall in the end redound to his woe, and turn to his greater misery: of this likewise there are in Scripture instances not a few. Learn we then to observe dispensations of particular events with humility and submission to a better Judgment.</p>

                        <hi>2dly</hi> We must observe the works of God with Patience, <hi>if we would know the Lords going forth we</hi>

There is I, so much of surprisal in many dispensations, that often they escape our first thoughts: verily, says <hi>Jacob,</hi> 
                        <q>God was in this place, and <hi>I</hi> knew it not </q> 
                        <hi>Genes.</hi> 28, 16. <q>when the Lord brought back the captivity of Zion, sayes the Church, we were as men that dreame <hi>Psal.</hi> 116, 1, When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel delivered <hi>Peter,</hi> he wist not whether that it was true that was done; but thought he saw a vision</q>

                        </gap>, second thoughts are the wiser. <hi>I say</hi> (ays <hi>David) I am cut off from thine eyes;</hi> but I said it over soon, <hi>I said it in my haste,</hi> I took no leasure throughly to consider the matter: And <hi>therefore I will look again toward thy Holy temple,</hi> I looked, but I must look again; I said, but I must say again. The Scriptures gives many instances, of the Saints mistaks and errors in the first thoughts of Gods dispensations: and in these <hi>pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Somtimes again 3, the Lord goes thorow in his dispensations by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of contraries: he brings his People into the dark, before he cause light shine out of darkness; he brings them (as the Text says) <hi>into the</hi> driery <hi>Wilderness, and there he comforts them;</hi> he wounds before he heal; he kills before he make alive; he casts down before he raise up. And therefore there is need of Patience to observe the whole course of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59412:71"/>
dispensations and their connexion: for if we look upon them by parts, we will readily mistake in our Observation. I find likwise 4. In many Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations a reserve, the Lord keeping up his mind, as it were to bait and allure his People to observe: <hi>Verily thou art a God that hidest thy self O God the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Israel, Isai</hi> 45. 14. O Lord we cannot see what thou wouldst be at: what I do thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not now (sayes Christ) but thou shalt know afterwards. Like a man if he see his hearers slack their attention to a serious discourse, he breaks off and pauses a little, to reduce them to a serious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: so does God in his works to gain us to a diligent Observation. Threfore in our Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Dispensations, we would be like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Godly servant <hi>Genes.</hi> 24, 21. <hi>he held his peace, to wit whether the Lord had made his journey prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous or not.</hi> Moreover 5. in some Dispensations the Lord uses a Holy simulation, and makes as if he would do that which he hath no mind to do. Sometimes he makes to take leave of his People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tell his Erand, <hi>Let me go says he to</hi> Jacob, when <hi>Iacob</hi> was but yet beginning to know that it was he, and ere ever there was a word of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which he came to leave with <hi>Iacob</hi> for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in his encounter with his Brother. And Christ made as if he would have passed by his Disciples at Sea: and the like semblance he made <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 28. Now if we can have the patience to observe, we will sometimes see the Issue of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations other than it appeared. And for pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Observation of Dispensations 1. <hi>respice finem</hi>

                        </gap> I said above. We must not conclude of Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neither by appearances nor parts: We must wait till we see every part do its part: for <hi>all works together Rom.</hi> 8. 28. And 2, <hi>respice usque finem,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or observe to the end, is an other direction necessary to the practice of the former: whose would see the end must behold with patience to the end. <hi>Daniel</hi> 12, 8. enquires concerning the end of things, and he observes till the time of the end, he looks thorow all interveening times of the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of these events manifested to him; so albeit none of us hath a prophetical Spirit to lead us thorow future times, yet the Faith and Patience of Saints teaches us to wait all our appointed time. In our patient Observation of Dispensations we must be like the Prophet <hi>Isai</hi> 21, 8. where he saith <hi>I stand continually upon the watch tower in the day, and I am set in my ward whole nights. My soul waits for the Lord</hi> sayes David. <hi>more than the watch waits for the morning</hi> Psal. 130. 6. I say more than they that wait for the morning, and by such patient Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation he had seen many a foul night have a fair morning: <hi>Sorrow may be at night, but joy comes in the morning.</hi> Psal 30, 5.</p>

Now all these uses of afflicting Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59412:77"/>
are as pertinent to the Cases of particular Persons, whose heart knows its own grief, and who know every one the plague of their own heart. And by all the rest Prayer by the Holy Ghost is prescribed, as a chief ingredient in all the cures of an afflicted case <hi>Jam.</hi> 5, 13. <hi>Is any man afflicted let him Pray.</hi> Prayer hath its famous witnesses in the Scriptures, of the great things that it hath done; neither wants it its witnesses in the breasts all the Saints. One word of sincere Prayer will cause <hi>Devils,</hi> and men, and lusts, and fears, and cares all run, and will burst the strongest bands. One word of sincere Prayer from the end of the earth, will at a call bring God to the Soul, and with him light, joy, peace, inlargment and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solace. But if any be so obstinate, as the <hi>Jews</hi> were in the case of the Blind man, that they will not believe famous well qualified witnesses, who know what they speak, and speak that which they have seen; I say but of Prayer to them, as the blind mans Parents said to those of him <hi>John</hi> 9, 21, <hi>ask him, he shall speak for himself.</hi> Try but Prayer in earnest, and I have no fear to be found a false witness: for its own works shall praise it self best, and then I shall be thought to have spoken within bounds. And thus <hi>I</hi> have answered the questions proponed for instruction in the Observation of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dispensations: all which may serve (as I said) to state a clear difference betwixt <hi>Athenian curiosity</hi> and <hi>a Christian inquiry</hi> into the works of God and his ways towards his People.</p>
                     <p>Having already prosecuted the Doctrine in a

way (as I hope) not unuseful, there remains the less to be said to it by way of Use distinctly, in the usual way. Only be it remembered that we observe the Lords Dispensations in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said: and for incouragment take but one place <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 42, 43. <hi>the righteous shall see it, and rejoyce and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.

                     <p>THE <hi>second</hi> thing in the Words is, the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Churches Condition. <hi>I will bring her into the Wilderness,</hi> And hence the Doctrine is, <hi>That these to whom the Lord minds good, may expect to come to the possession of intended blessedness by the way of a Wilderness, Behold</hi> says the Lord <hi>I will allure her, and speak comfortably unto her:</hi> there is my design upon her, and these are my thoughts of Good concerning her, but first <hi>I will bring her into the Wilderness.</hi> In the prosecution of this Doctrine, three things are to be considered. 1. What is this <hi>Wilderness?</hi> 2. Wherefore doth the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59412:78"/>
Lord bring his People into the <hi>Wilderness?</hi> 3. What use we are to make of this intimation of such a Condition?</p>
                     <p n="1">1, First then, what is the <hi>Wilderness?</hi> I Answer 1. in general, it is a Figurative expression of an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Condition, <hi>I will bring her into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> that is, I will erercise her with such Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as men are wont to meet with in a <hi>Wilderness.</hi> And therefore <hi>2dly</hi> I find a <hi>Wilderness Condition</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting these things particularly.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. It imperteth a Condition of Want and scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of Temporal and Spiritual things <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 37. <q>those of whom the World was not worthy were destitute of all things:</q> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10.<q> The Apostles that made many Rich, were themselves as poor: and they that possessed all things were as having nothing.</q> 
                        <hi>Psal.</hi> 107 4, 5.<q> They that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in a Wilderness are hungry and thristy; and their Soul fainteth in them.</q> 
                        <hi>David Psal.</hi> 63. 1. says <hi>my Soul thristeth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee, in a dry and thusty land where no water is:</hi> he had no doubt his own temporal Wants, and those great enough, but his greatest Want was of the waters of the Sanctuary, as is clear from the <hi>2d verse, To see thy power and thy Glory so as I have seen thee in the Sanctuary:</hi> and the same was his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the 42. and 43. <hi>Psalmes,</hi> And this is the supposed Condition of all the People of God. <hi>Isai.</hi> 41. 17. <q>they are poor and needy, seeking water and there is none, and their tongue fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thrist.</q> The want of Water which is a most common thing, denoteth the extremity of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59412:79"/>
scarcety and want. And this is the first thing in a Wilderness-Condition. The many hungry Bellys, and no fewer hungry Souls in these times which are crying, <hi>my Leanness, my Leanness,</hi> do plainly say, that we are entred more nor a days journey into the Wilderness.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>2d</hi> thing imported in a Wilderness-Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Desolation and Barrenness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 1. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 33. <hi>a Wilderness is a dry land, a thristy land where no water is.</hi> Jer. 9, 12. <hi>It is burnt up like a Wilderness,</hi> and likwise a Wilderness is a desolate place: there no foot of man doth come; there the Cities are made heaps; there nettles grow upon the ruines of Glorious Temples. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation and Barrenness is the cause of scarcety and want in a Wilderness. And this likwise we have felt in our Wilderness; we Want, but we know not where to get it: the Wells are stopped, good Occasions for our Souls are removed, our Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are removed into Corners, the Songs of our Temples are become howlings. We may sing the 8 <hi>verse</hi> of the 46. <hi>Psalme</hi> with a sad note, <hi>Come behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth:</hi> and where Desolations end, there beginneth Barrenness and dry breasts. As in one place we have the Wells of water and the Streams from Lebanon stopped, in the next place we come to, we find Clouds without rain, and Pits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out water, Trees whose fruit is withered, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit, <hi>Epistle</hi> of <hi>Iude</hi> 12 <hi>verse,</hi> men who either never had any thing, or elss have lost what once they promised. As if Christ (O sad!) had come
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59412:79"/>
by and said, henceforth never fruit grow upon you; if we were thristy beside the water, or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry beside Food, or sick beside the Physician, or sorrowful beside a comforter, or in darkness beside light, we might the better bear it: But that it is other ways shews we are indeed in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

                        <hi>3dly</hi> The Wilderness importeth a Solitary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Separation from comfortable, sweet and useful Society: <hi>David</hi> felt this in the Wilderness <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 4. <q>When he remembred that he had gone to the house of God with the multitude, with the voice of joy and praise, with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that kept Holy day: and for that his Soul was poured out in him:</q> 
                        <hi>Heman</hi> felt this in his Wilderness <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 18. <hi>lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,:</hi> The afflicted, overwhelmed Composer of the 102, <hi>Psalm</hi> felt this likwise in his Wilderness, 6, and 7, <hi>verses.</hi>

                        <hi>Isai</hi> 35, 1. <q>The Wilderness is a solitary place.</q> Good company and sweet comfortable useful So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety hath this to prove it a choice mercy, that (as the rest of that nature) it is never well known nor prized by us, till we are denyed it, and deprived of it. And now (with <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Butler <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 9.) <q> I remember my faults this day;</q> and <hi>I</hi> fear <hi>I</hi> have too many fellows in the fault, who either neglect disdainfully, or els abuse good Company to the increase of vanity. Now begin I to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59412:80"/>
more of that Text <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. 9, 10, 11, 12. And what <hi>a woe is it to him that is alone,</hi> and yet <hi>I</hi> doubt not but the kindness of the Lord is shewn to many, even in separating and scattering them one from another: And to confirm me in this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I</hi> remember the Opinion of some who have been in account for skill in things of that nature: And thus they have thought, that when a Family or Bairn-time incline to a Consumption (which being a disease hereditary runs much in a blood) in that case it is good that they part Company, and live at a distance one from another, for that the disease is strengthned by their social conversation. I apply, that the evil and hazard of the Company of those that are tenderly beloved Children of God, may move him even in kindness to send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: but they will find it a kindness not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable as needful. As <hi>I</hi> could like to be hungry beside good meat, or weary beside good lodging: so I would choose to be solitary beside good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that is, so to enjoy my self by my self, as that I might likwise enjoy the help of Christian Company at will with conveniency. And as I am sure that God was never the instituter of the <hi>Monks</hi> order; so, sure I am, none can choose to shun good Company, but such as would choose their own affliction, and forsake their own mercy. Only I must here mind that good People are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways good Company: but a good Man or Woman are only then good Company, when they shew their goodness in Company, so that they may do good to the Company: and therefore, though it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59412:80"/>
may seem a <hi>Paradox,</hi> yet it is too true; that we cannot always say we have been in good Company, when we have been in the company of Good Men. Let Good People keep fellowship and company; let the evils and vanities of good People be discharged the Company, let Good People do good in Company, and so Good People shall be Good Company. But as often as we miss good Company, let it mind us that we are in the Wilderness, And be it here ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (because I love not to multiply) that it is no small part of the Saints Wilderness to be vexed and intested with evil Company. The Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrives a Wilderness to be the place of Owls, Ostriches, Wolves, Lyons, Serpents, Satyres, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Dragons and all evil Beasts and doleful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: And as it is said of Christ literally, <hi>Mark,</hi> 1, 13. that in the Wilderness he was with the wild Beasts, so Christians are mystically neighboured with the like in their Wilderness: their righteous Souls are vexed with hearing and seeing daily their doleful and detestable practises, besides their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions whereof it follows to speak, particularly.</p>

This Wilderness importeth a Condition of Weariness and fainting: This yet follows natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally from all that hath been said <hi>Psal.</hi> 107. 5. <hi>those that wander in a Wilderness, their soul fainteth in them;</hi> Psal. 63. 1. <hi>Davids</hi> Wilderness was <hi>a thristy,</hi> or (as the Original hath it,) a weary <hi>Land:</hi> and <hi>Isai</hi> 32, 2. it is expresly rendered <hi>a weary Land.</hi> The Saints case in their Wilderness is often like that of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 11, 12. who was so outwearyed that he fell off from his company and sunk in the Wilderness. <hi>David</hi> often complaineth that he was weak, that his spirit failled, his soul fainted, this throat was dry, his eyes failed whilst he cryed upon the Lord and waited for him. And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it is that the Saints so often weary and faint by the way: but a great wonder it is, that any of them should hold up to the end: They have such long stages in the Race that is set before them, and those in a thirsty Wilderness where hardly they can drink of the brook by the way: and they must run it so oft about with fresh parties whereof pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59412:86"/>
the worst comes last upon them, when they are already so much exhausted, that there is great reason, for him that would wager upon their heads, to ask, whether they have so much confidence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining as to answer that Question <hi>Jer.</hi> 12. 5. <q>If thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace wherein thou trustedst they wearyed thee, how wilt thou do in the swelling of <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                        </q> But the Lord that makes the Question must answer, and one Prophet must Answer another: and how <hi>Jeremy</hi> could do all that, <hi>Isaiah</hi> can tell <hi>Chap,</hi> 40. from the 28 <hi>verse</hi> to the end: <hi>the everlasting God, the Lord that creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ends of the earth fainteth not, neither is weary,</hi> &amp;c. Let the people of God in their Wilderness expect to have their hands full of it, and as much as shall put them to a strict necessity either to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or utterly to give it over. Psal, 27. 13. <hi>I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.</hi> Now this is the Wilderness: and thus is answered the first thing in the point, What is the Wilderness.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The <hi>second</hi> thing to be considered in the point is, <q>Wherefore doth the Lord bring his People into the Wilderdess?</q> The Scripture sheweth that for one or more of these five Reasons the Lord doth this.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He doth it for their sin: and that in these five Respects. 1. to convince them of sin. It is long many a time ere the Lords sinful People will see or acknowledge their sin: yea they will say

they are innocent when their transgressions are most evident. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2 23. and therefore <hi>verse</hi> 35. <hi>I will plead with thee, because thou sayest I have not sinned.</hi> Such as are kindly Melancholians may know by experience, what effectual impressions the change of places hath to the changing of mens minds: and for this it is necessary often times that men be sent to learn that in the Wilderness, which they could not, it may be they would not, see at home in a land inhabited: <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 21, 22. <hi>I spoke unto thee to thy prosperity, but thou saidest I will not hear, and therefore thou shalt go into captivity.</hi> Affliction is quick-sighted, and necessity is wise and Ingenious: affliction according as it is blest, or not blest of God, hath very contrary effects upon men: <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us <hi>that affliction makes a wise man mad:</hi> and he that is greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, that affliction sometimes makes a mad man wise <hi>Luk.</hi> 15, 17. it brought a distracted Prodigal to himself. Many men think it a piece of Wit and Gallantry to mantain their sinful courses in a Day of prosperity; and if he be a beneficed person or one in place, he is ill worthy either place or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice who is so scant of Discourse, that he cannot <hi>(if this our craft be in danger to be set at nought</hi> Act. 19. 27) make an Oration in defence of <hi>Diana;</hi> and at least, cannot say to his Companions with more truth than Wit, though yet with more Wit than Honesty, <hi>Sirs ye know that by this Craft we have our wealth, ib. verse</hi> 25.

his Rod which is sitted for the back of fools; and is the only cogent argument with such persons. Take two instances shortly, one is <hi>Isai.</hi> 31. 2. those people were bent upon Idolatry, and when they were reproved and threatned for that by the Lord, then they were confident in the assistance of <hi>Egypt:</hi> and when yet they were taxed for that, no doubt, they would tell the Prophets, Self-defence was not unlawful, and many such witty stories, till the Lord concludes the dispute with that, <hi>yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call back his words, but will arise against the house of the evil doers, and against the help of those that work iniquity.</hi> And now let those great Wits and grand Disputers say to it Jer. 13. 21. <hi>What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee?</hi> Say to that Gallants, or you have said no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The next instance is <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17. from 11 <hi>verse</hi> to the end; <hi>Zedekiah</hi> had given an Oath of fealty and subjection to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> he Rebells against the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> and breaks his Oath: the Lord pleads with him for that, O! might he say (mark you the Language of our times) it was a forced Oath made against his will: yea, may be, it was an unlawful Oath for him to subject himself and the Lords People to Heathens by a bond: and therefore why might not he take his occasions to break it, if once he had but strength to maintain the breach?

that it is called significantly the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> Oath, in the 16 <hi>verse.</hi> I mark 2. In the same <hi>verse</hi> against other Covenant-breakers.

I mark 3. from the 20 <hi>verse</hi> against all Patrons of Perjury, and such as teach Rebellion against the Lord; the Lords great Argument, which usually he reserves to the Conclusion of such Debates: well, says the Lord, in the 19 <hi>verse,</hi> he hath sworn an Oath, and hath broken it: but I will let him know what an Oath is; I will Swear another and will keep it: <hi>as I live saith the Lord, surely I will recompense it upon his own head.</hi> And in the 20 <hi>verse, I will spread my net upon him, and he shall he taken in my snare, and I will bring him to</hi> Babylon <hi>and will plead with him there, for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.</hi> And this was performed 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25. 6, 7. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 20, 21.

If any of us hath a Friend who is leud and dissolute and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, we are ashamed of him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Faults reflect upon us: And therefore we hold our selves obliged for our own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to testify our displeasure against him.

                     <p>The <hi>3d.</hi> Account is to imbitter sin to them, Jer. 2. 19. <hi>Know therefore and see, that it is an evil</hi>

O that all who are in Affliction, and in the Wilderness, would take this advantage of their impetuous over-hailing Lusts and Idols; and had Wisdom to improve such a good occasion, of a perpetual Divorce and Separation, from the sins that were wont easily to beset them, and as easily to prevail with them!

Jer. 2. 31. But Affliction fits them better both for the one and for the other. In prosperity, as in the noise of a City, every thing is heard, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hearkened to: and the common noise swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows up the most distinct and audible voices in a confused insignificant sound. But in Affliction, as in a Wilderness, the stillest whisper of a voice is soon discerned and seriously attended to. Likwise i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In a Word, the Lord in the Wilderness and by Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is tuneing his People to Obedience, that he may bring them forth singing the Songs of Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Gods commands and his mercies will have another kind of lustre and relish to a Soul coming out of a sanctified Wilderness. Formality in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with much vanity and many superfluities wait but too well upon Prosperity: but the cold wind of the Wilderness bloweth these all away, and strengthens the vital heat of the inward man, and makes solk more Religious than formerly with less noise and adoe. Prosperity is an unthankful Piece: for readily the more it receives, the less it accounts of what it receives; and (as a full Soul loaths the honey comb) with a fastidious insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it thinks, and by falsely thinking truely makes abundance of mercy a very misery: but (as to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet) the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, and an afflicted lot blessed of God, will give a man a good stomach for a piece of the bread of

Adversity, and a Cup of the cold water of Affliction; and will teach him to say Grace to it thus: <hi>I am less than the least of all thy mercies</hi> Genes. 32, 10. So said <hi>Iacob</hi> when he was coming from his twenty years travels in the Wilderness of his Afflictions in <hi>Padan Aram.</hi> Prosperity extenuates, sanctified Adversity aggravates mercies: to it any thing less than Hell is a mercy. <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed:</hi> to it any mercy is a great Mercy: a great mercy is an extraordinary one: and an extraordinary is a marvelous incomprehensible one. Prosperity counts its mercies by Subtraction, it will take its Bill with the unjust Steward, and for a hundred it will write fourscore, and for fourscore, it will write fifty: But in the Wilderness men learn to cast up their Mercies by Multiplication with the help of Division: in the same place cited <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>That we are not consumed,</hi> to some might seem but one mercy, and that a poor one too: yea but the lamenting Prophet finds mercies in that mercy. And truely the mercies of the Lord are homogeneous things, whereof every part hath the Nature and Denomination of the whole: as every drop of water is water; so the least piece of any Mercy is Mercy: and the afflicted, humble, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soul loves to anatomize and diffect the Lords Mercies into parts, as Physicians do humane bodies, that they may informe themselves the better of the number and nature of the parts, and of the frame and structure of the whole. The 136 <hi>Psalme</hi> hath this common with those Mercies which it recounts, that there is more in it than every one can see:
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59412:92"/>
This only to my purpose, everyone may see, how the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells out the <hi>Lords</hi> Mercies by parts, and insists upon one and the same Mercy, to shew that every part of it is a Mercy; and that, as all the rest, derived from the underived, uncreated, unexhaustible, and ever runing fountain of the <hi>Lords</hi> Mercy that endures for ever. Prosperity, like the Widow and her Sons in the matter of the oil, loses and comes short of many Mercies for want of the vessels of faithful accounts and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments. The Saint in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as the Disciples in a desart place, obeys <hi>Christs</hi> Frugal command, it gathers up the remaining Fragments of mercies that nothing be lost, and with those it fills whole baskets: As by the blessing and miraculous Power of Christ, the broken meat, after that Dinner, whereat so many thousands were well filled, was more than that which at the first was set down whole. O! but it is good hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing house with <hi>Christ!</hi> It is good to have our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be otherwise what it will, with his presence and Blessing, and to have it coming thorow his hands.

This, as the rest of divine Arts, is best profest in the Wilderness: and therefore it is that the Lord sends so many of his most hopeful Children thither to be bred: and there they are continued till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

The Lord brings his People into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, that he may lead them by, and deliver them from that which is worse. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 17, 18. <hi>And it came to pass when Pharoah had let the People go, that God led them not thorow the way of the land of the Philistins, though that was near: for God said lest peradventure the People repent when they see war and they return to Egypt; but God led the People about thorow the way of the Wilderness of the red sea.</hi> The Lord prepares his People a place in the Wilderness from the fury and persecutions of men. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 6. And albeit before, I called Persecution one of the parts of a Wilderness-Condition; yet I would have it understood, that every one that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderness, is not led thorow all the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, nor made to see all the evils thereof, nor do all Afflictions tryst upon every afflicted person: for often times God makes one a mean to prevent and escape another: even as in the case in hand, the Lord sends sometimes his People to enjoy <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Ieremys</hi> wishes in the Wilderness, that so they may be ridd of ill neighbours: for we say in the Proverb, <hi>Better be alone than in ill Company.</hi> And likwise the Lord by bringing his People into the Wilderness delivers them from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion and vexation of the sins of those with whom they conversed aforetimes.

It is no doubt a grief and great Affliction to many of the Saints and Servants of God, that they are removed from their people and place: But when

judgements come upon aplace, better to be away than in place. And in the judgment of judicious and great Divines, it prognosticats no good to a place, when the Saints and Servants of God are driven out thereof.

                     <p>The <hi>second Use</hi> shall be for Information to all such of the Lords People, as are either upon their way to the Wilderness, or are already arrived there: they would not think strange of such a condition: it has been, it is, and it will be the lot of the <hi>Lords</hi> Children <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 5. the high way to Christs mountain of Myrrh and hill of frankincense lyes thorow the Wilderness, and there he comes forth to meet them, and leads them up in his bosome, leaning upon his own arms.

For now that the Lord through so many ages, hath led his Saints to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by so many different paths of Dispensations, (for there is but one common road of Religion, the Kings high Way) I doubt there is any untroden path remaining to be discovered by this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

In all the World I know no such ready way to Apostacy, and utter forsaking of God as Discouragment.

since our Princes and Nobles turned herdmen to the <hi>Philistines,</hi> and servants to <hi>Prelates,</hi> their work hath been to stop, and take away, and strive for <hi>Isaac</hi>'s wells, to deprive the People of God, moe ways than one, of those occasions of pure and plentiful Ordinances, which they had digged and drunk of: had with labour provided and with refreshment enjoyed.

Rain water in a Pool, is neither so good nor so enduring, as a spring or fountain of living Water: and yet the former is good, where the latter cannot be had: for to the hungry Soul, every bitter thing is sweet, and little will do a poor man good. If God give us an occasion of a good Sermon, or a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or make any other good means to drop upon our heads, as unexpectedly as the rain falls from the Heaven; or if we have the benefit of the neighbour-hood of a faithful Minister for the time, these things, howbeit for their nature and vertue they be fountain water, yet herein the best of them is but like a Pool, that they are of an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain endurance.

But we would seek good Company and make use of it. <hi>Mal.</hi> 316 <hi>the fearers of God,</hi> that were then in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, <hi>spake often one to another.</hi> But wandering and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>settlment (another great mischief of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) will not let the Saints lodge together: and for that the word of the <hi>Psalme</hi> says, <hi>they go from Company to Company:</hi> when they are driven from one Company, they must draw in to another. Many men never grow good till they are going to die (and indeed, in this World, he that mindes to be good, may make him for another World; and blessed be God, we know of another) even so the Saints oft times scarce begin to know the useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and sweetness of one anothers Company, nor to use it accordingly, till they must want it. Nor do they any thing worthy of their Society, till they be going to separat. <hi>I said in my heart, that this also is vanity</hi> and a sore evil.

                     <p n="10">10. And lastly, In the Wilderness we would long and haste much to be through, and press with importunity for a delivery: This we see in <hi>David. Psal.</hi> 42. <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 107 6. those who wandered in a Wilderness cryed unto the <hi>Lord</hi> in their trouble. And <hi>Moses</hi> who had been long in the Wilderness was very earnest to have gone over <hi>Jordan,</hi> to see the good Land, though for his fault at <hi>Meribah</hi> it was denyed him. <hi>Deut,</hi> 3. 25. 26. This direction is nothing so strange, as is the disposition of those to whom it is meant: For I begin to observe many who have seen the Lords Glory and Power in the Sanctuary, but too modest, not to say worse (be it from despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, or from some worse quality) in their Suits for a restoration of these Mercies: Either the length of our affliction hath put us so far out of memory, or the deepth of it hath put us so far out of hope of better dayes, that as if there had never been, nor never should be better dayes, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with the present. Truly it asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes me to see such a Spirit of slackness possess many; as if the Lord had said to us, <hi>Ier.</hi> 29. 5, 6, 7, 10. <q>Build ye houses and dwell in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For thus saith the Lord, that after seventy years be accomplished in <hi>Babylon,</hi> will I visit you, and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59412:106"/>
form my good word towards you, in causing you to return to this place:</q> Our disposition looks like those that were to have a seventy years afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and long continued Captivity. And indeed considering <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 13. <hi>All this evil is come upon us, yet made we not our Prayer before the Lora our God,</hi> &amp;c. I observe, that Security and a slack dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is the attendent, or rather the presage and fore-runner of a continued Affliction: And by the contrary a Spirit of restless importunity, is a comfortable Prognostick of a speedy delivery: See it confirmed in the instances of <hi>Daniel, Nehemiah, Ezra,</hi> who upon the very point of the deliverance were stirred up, and with themselves stirred up the People by Prayer and Fasting to ask Mercies of their God. Take then the direction <hi>Isa.</hi> 62. 6, 7. <hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence, and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem <hi>a praise in the Earth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And thus with patience I have got through the Wilderness, and considered the intimation of the Churches condition, which is the second thing in the words of the <hi>Verse.</hi> In conclusion, be it minded only, that all that hath been said to this point, doth alike concern the Church in general and Saints in particular: For neither I nor any other, who from this mount of contemplation do view the Wilderness at a distance, can expect to have it said to us, as was said to <hi>Moses</hi> of the Land beyond <hi>Iordan, Thou shalt not go over into it:</hi> but rather as was said to <hi>Abraham: All the Land which thou seest shall be thine: Arise and walk through</hi>

                        <hi>the Land, for to thee will I give it.</hi> Not to speak of what we have had, or at the time have, none of us can promise in the Life of our Vanity, that we shall not have, if not at once, yet successively, one after another, all the described parts of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for our Lot.</p>

                     <p>THe third thing in the words is, The <hi>Lords</hi> Design, <hi>I will allure her.</hi> Hence the Doctrine is, That the <hi>Lords</hi> great Design in the vicissitudes of all Dispensations to his People, is to gain them to himself; that he may have more of their Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Service. The point is confirmed; 1. From the account Scripture gives of Gods various Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations to his People: Take but this <hi>Chapter</hi> for an instance; he both afflicts her and comforts her, and all that he may have her heart. 2, From the first and greatest Command in the Law of God, which is, <hi>That we love him with all our Heart,</hi> &amp;c. As the Law is understood to be the mind of the King; so the greatest Command of God is the surest Evidence of his Will concerning this, <hi>That we abide only for him, and do not play the Harlot, nor be for another man,</hi> Chap. 3. 3. It is easie courting where we may command: And in this the <hi>Lord</hi> hath he advantage of all other Lovers: The Soveraigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59412:107"/>
of his Propriety in us, bears him to challenge our Heart and Service, without once asking our consent, and to resent every repulse and refusal, not simply as a displeasure, but really as a wrong, in defrauding him of what is his own, by a just Title of many respects, antecedent to our volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary consent. 2. The <hi>Lords</hi> design is so manifest in his kind way with his People, that as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be hidden, so it seems he would have it known that every one may think him a Suter: Even as when a man frequents the House of his Beloved; presently, by his frequency and other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of his Carriage, the meanest Servant of the House discovers his design: Yea, and the Lord is not ashamed here expresly to tell his Errand, <hi>I will allure her.</hi> Some men if they intend a match with, and have a design upon a person, they set their designs abroad; either in Policy to further them, and thereby to know how the person intertains such Reports, that accordingly they may behave themselves in their intended Address; or else in vain Glory to vaunt of them: So the <hi>Lord</hi> causes the Report go loud of his blessed purpose, that it may be seen he is both serious in the matter and glorious of it, to have sinners love him. Now the <hi>Lord</hi> allures either Morally and Externally, or Internally and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Morally and Externally, while he courts Souls with Arguments and Motives fit to take with rational and ingenuous Spirits. Effectually and Internally, when by the Power of Grace he makes such fit Motives and Arguments have their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59412:107"/>
due weight and work upon Hearts. According to this division, for explication of this Blessed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the <hi>Lords</hi> alluring his People, I shall <hi>first</hi> touch upon some of the chief Motives that are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this purpose, (for to reach them all I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume not) 2<hi>dly,</hi> I shall treat of the inward Power of Grace, that makes these Motives effectual up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul. And <hi>3dly,</hi> shall conclude the point with Use.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Of motives, the <hi>first</hi> is his own Glorious Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency outshining every shadow of likness, let be equality: <hi>Who is a God like unto thee?</hi> And that I am now upon a love designe, and upon the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Eleazer Abrahams</hi> servant <hi>Gen.</hi> 24 to seek a Wife to my Masters Son, I am concerned as a Friend of the Bridgroome to express my self in the proper termes of such a Subject: And <q>O that my heart could indite good matter, that I might speak the things that I have made concerning the King!</q> Let it then be condescended, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, by any but willing to be satisfied, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a person to the heart of his beloved, and in him you have it. 1. for his Dignity and Descent, <hi>he is the King, and the Kings son:</hi> 2.

                     <p>The <hi>Lords second</hi> Motive and external allurement is his Words: Words are very charming and entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things: and <hi>how forceable are right words?</hi> says <hi>Job.</hi> Hence the <hi>Latines</hi> wisely give the name of <hi>verba dare,</hi> to that which the Court calls a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Countrey plainly calls <hi>a Cheat.</hi> Hence the way of Fishing which catcheth by the Ear, applauded of the greatest Wits, approven and much practised by Lovers, the most ingenious because the most serious Anglers, who busk their hooks with words, and bait with the artificial flee of Complements.

the finest man that can say fairest to it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Solomon</hi> both a Wise Man and a great Preacher and Spokes-man hath said <hi>Proverb.</hi> 17. 28. <hi>even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise;</hi> yet with most men, even a wise man, if he bold his peace, is counted a fool: But the truth is, <hi>multum ille assecutus est qui bene didicit loqut, bene qui tacere non minus assecutus est,</hi> 
                        <q>he hath attained much who hath learned to speak well: and he hath attained no less who hath learned to hold his peace well.</q> But to say no more in general of the allurements of Words: how specially excellent are the words of the Lord to the purpose of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converting and heart-alluring? <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>They are good words and comfortable words,</hi> Jer. 15. 16. <hi>Thy words were found and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me, the joy and rejoycing of mine Heart.</hi> Gold and Treasure is alluring unto any, Honey and Apples to Delicate Persons: And if it were even the mortal forbidden Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil; yet if it be good for Food, and I leasant to the Eyes, and a Tree to be desired, it must be had, if the price should be Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.

And the Words of God, which are the Flower and first Fruits of all fit Words, are <hi>Apples of Gold in Pictures of Silver,</hi> Prov. 25, 11.

How charming the <hi>Lords</hi> Words are, we have famous instances in the Gospel, that with his Words he catched those, that were sent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to catch and entrap him: he sent them back with this Report, <hi>never man spoke like this man.</hi> And here in the <hi>

                     <p>The <hi>third.</hi> chief Motive and Allurement is, The Works of the <hi>Lord</hi> and his Doings, He hath done for his People, and is daily doing to them, that which cannot but rationally entice any inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Soul to be for him: If God had not loved us, I should have wondered at every thing he does for us: Love is the chief of the wayes of God to us. God loved the World. <hi>God so loved the World,</hi> A Wonder indeed! But after that stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious portent of his Works to us, <hi>That he loved us,</hi> I shall wonder at nothing he does for us: For what will we not do for those we Love? But again, I must wonder, that he loved us, and in this love to us, he was humbled and emptyed for us: For us he came into the World: For us <hi>He took the likeness of sinful flesh, and the form of a servant:</hi> For us he suffered Temptations, Crosses and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in his Life, and for us he tasted death; <hi>He gave him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>s for us:</hi> He came under the Law, and Sin, and the Wrath, and Curse of God for us: For us he drank the Cup of astonishment, which
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59412:109"/>
would have made all the Elect tremble to Eternity. Yea and he rose and was victorious over death for us: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e hath also ascended Heaven for us, and there he interceeds for us: he is our Friend at Court, he stands in the way there, that nothing pass against us: and when there is hazard he warns us, and by his Word and Spirit he keeps intelligence with our Souls, and gives us daily accounts of the true state of our Spiritual business: Thence he issues daily many favours on our behalf, <hi>Psal.</hi> 103 2, and forward. <hi>Forget not all his Benefits, who forgiveth all thine Iniquities,</hi> &amp;c. And his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Mercies are not the least part of what he doth for us: That he prevents and holds off us so many temptations, suares and evils that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would even over-run us: and that for all these he waiteth to be gracious to us, at the voice of our Cry when he shall hear it: And in a word that he is so wholly taken up for us, as if he had nothing else to mind but us. Now to a rational ingenuous Spirit, and every one that deserves to be called a Man, all these will be <hi>the Coras of a Man, and Bands of Love. Hos.</hi> 11. 4. Yea there is some secret al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring, quality, in the saddest and darkest of Gods dispensations to the Soul of the Saint. Hence we never find the Godly Soul more fond so to speak) of its beloved, and more earnest upon him, than in the time of desertion, which of all dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is the most afflicting to such an one. If the Lord withdraw, such an one will fall down sick of Love to him; and then go tell him O ye Daughters of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that I cannot live in his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59412:110"/>
absence: And if he do not come quickly skipping like a young Roe or Hart; yea, and if he take not the nearest way over the mountains of <hi>Bether,</hi> he may come too late, to lay his hands upon the eyes of his distressed Beloved, <hi>Psal.</hi> 28. 1. <hi>If thou be silent to me</hi> (sayes <hi>David) I shall be like them that go down into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And in our <hi>Text,</hi> the Wilderness is the alluring place to this ungracious froward Church.</p>
                     <p>The fourth chief Motive wherewith the Lord allures his People, is, his Gifts. Gifts and tokens use to pass betwixt Lovers, and accordingly in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> the Lord allures this whoorish Church with Gifts: So <hi>verse</hi> 15. <hi>I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope.</hi> A Gift is a tempting and inticing thing: and therefore the Lord hath forbid <hi>Iudge,</hi> the taking of Gifts; <q>For a Gift blinds the Eyes of the Wise, and perverts the words of the Righteous: </q> And therefore <hi>Isai</hi> 33. 15.

                           </gap>.</hi> And the more strange it is that men can take so largely from God, and not be thereby enticed after him. <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>A mans gift make room for him,</hi> and whithersoever it turneth it self, it is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous, that <hi>Every one is a Friend to him that giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Gifts,</hi> Prov. 18, 15. and 19. 6. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider

Gods Gifts: His Gifts are 1. <hi>Free</hi> Gifts: And what is freer than a Gift?

His Gifts are Rich and rare Gifts, <hi>Grace and Glory, and every good thing:</hi> yea himself: For the Covenant Gift, is, <hi>I will be their God:</hi> yea our Selves and our Souls <hi>He gives Life and Breath,</hi> Act. 17. 25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If we possess and keep still his Gifts, we cannot handsomly refuse his sute for our kindness and service, for no ingenuous Woman will possess or retain that man's Gift whom she minds not to entertain. But if any should presume disdainfully to return the Lords Tokens to him, and to send
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59412:111"/>
back his Gifts; then he hath yet the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: For if we send back all his Gifts, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all to him that ever we had of him, then must we needs with all send back and return our selves, and our Souls, and all that we are, or have, or can: For he gave all these; and he requires no more than what he gave. So that of necessity we must either be all for God, or we must be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; or else we must be most base in being any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we are not for God, and in retaining his Tokens, when we have rejected himself.

                     <p>The Fifth chief Motive, wherewith the Lord allures his People, is, his Carriage and Demeanor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59412:111"/>
he was, and was called <hi>deliciae generis humani,</hi> the darling of mankind. But, O, how transporting is the Lords way and Carriage towards his People! Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Lovers use to frame their Carriage, as well as their Cloathes, into the best fashion and dress, and they study to make their entries <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o neither practice they the best Manners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at home. But as the Lords Carriage to his People, is alluring, at his first appearing, and in his first address to their Souls; so they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have it always the same: For <hi>He is God and changes not,</hi> and all that is but his ordinary. But behold his Carriage, I pray you; with much Patience he waits upon his Peoples consent, as if their Love were worth the waiting upon; and indeed it it be not so, it is enough that he account it so; in much mercy he overlooks many faults in them, and puts the best construction upon many of their unhandsome and unkind Actions: In much kindness he makes them many a visit: With much earnestness he invites them, with much respect he intreats them, calling them by all their best names, in discretion fitting their Titles to his design. In much condescendence and tenderness he complyes with them, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes himself to them, and all this he doth so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually, constantly and faithfully, that they must
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59412:112"/>
say, if they be ingenuous, that <hi>all his wayes to them are Mercy and Truth:</hi> And for all this he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Sixth chief Motive wherewith the Lord allures his People, is, the Example of others, who have led them the way in loving, choosing and commending him. Example is an alluring thing: And the World is more ruled by Example than by Law. Example oft-times usurps upon Reason; sometimes it agrees with her; but seldom is it subject to Her. And thus while men ask rather <hi>quid fit,</hi> what is done, nor, <hi>quid fieri debet,</hi> what ought to be done, <hi>Many follow the broad way that</hi>
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:59412:112"/>
                        <hi>leadeth to destruction,</hi> while but <hi>few do find the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that leadeth to Life,</hi> Many choose rather to go to Hell in company, than to go to Heaven alone. But in Religion and in Travel, I would hold the rule, to choose day Light rather than Company: Nor would I willingly wait for any man till Night, who in the dark, Might lead or mislead me whither he would. If once a man turn his eye off the fixed Light of Scripture, the wandering Star of Example may lead him whither he knows not, and lodge him where he would not. Now how the Lord allures his People by Example, see <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3 4 There the Church finds others before her, whom she would gladly follow: <hi>The Virgins love thee, draw me, we will run after thee;</hi> Lord I love good company well, and therefore let us all go together. And as she finds good Example before her, she leaves the like after her, that allures others to follow her, as she had followed others, <hi>Cant.</hi> ch 5, and 6. <hi>Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Heart was fixed,</hi> his Harp was out of Tune: when his Faith had got footing, his Affections were to seek. The Case is common and too well known to the People of God: In Preaching, Hearing, Reading, Meditating, Praying, Praising, or any other Duty of our Life, the Affections oft times do not answer. But Grace hath a skilful hand, and is a Musician so expert, that if the <hi>Tenor</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> be but well set, and the <hi>Base</hi> of Godly <hi>sorrow</hi> record well, ordinary failings in the other parts, shall not be much discerned.</p>

2. This teacheth Ministers the Art of Preaching, They must be both serious and dexterous: as friends of the Bridgroom, and Ambassadors for Christ, they must be so well acquaint with the laws of love, as to be able (a Divine blessing concurring) to allure the wildest and most froward Soul. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster would be a Seraphick lover, one of the order of <hi>Peter:</hi> Peter, <hi>lovest thou me?</hi> Lord <hi>thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est all things, thou knowest that I love thee.</hi> Peter, <hi>feed my lambes,</hi> feed my sheep. If our way with sinners, be not the most taken way, let it be the most taking way, and so we shall not mistake the way. Many Ministers are but cold Suters for Christ, and why? they are troubled with an error of the first concoction, they erre concerning the end: they seek their own things, and not the things of Christ, they serve not our Lord Jesus, but there own belly: they eat the fat, and cloath themselves with the wooll, but they feed not the flock: put them to tryal, and it will be found they cannot read the Bible: they lisp like the men of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> for <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> they say <hi>Sibboleth;</hi> give them but to read that short text 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 14. they read it, I seek not <hi>you,</hi> but <hi>yours;</hi> and if they read right, I seek not <hi>Yours</hi> but <hi>You,</hi> they are the greatest of lyars. In a word, they are like many in our days (and those are even like them) who court the fortune more than the person: in this age, a rich man needs not want Children; let him make Images of his Silver, and these shall not want matches, such who for their generosity deserve, as often they get, the reward of a silver

I should hold my self everlastingly obliged to him that would give me a well done coppy: and though I did not like it, for him that did it, yet would I love it for them that it is like.

I have seen the Heathen <hi>Venus</hi> their Godess of love and beauty, painted with a flaming heart in her hand, (a pretty embleme of that Scripture <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 11.

If men knew to do the <hi>Epicureans</hi> right in their opinion of Felicity, and could speak as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and not as taunting Satyricks, I could ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be, than be called an Epicurean: For Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious custom, (even like <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who in all things loveth the preheminency) hath usurped so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far upon the World, that she prevaileth equally in mens Words and practices, calling things as she lists. Whence a sensual Sow wallowing in the mire of Lust, must bear the name of an Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean; whercas, in Truth, an Epicurean is no other than a man placeing Happiness in rational Pleasures and intellectual Delights worthy of men: Even as I, according to the Scripture, have placed it in those Delights that are Spiritual and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Saint. The cutting off of a Member deserves not the name of a Cure, but is the Uncomfortable result of the desperate wits of Extremity and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, in a deplorable Case; and an expedient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the preservation of the whole, with the loss of the part: For better it is to go to Heaven with one Eye, Hand or Foot, than to be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell with two. The <hi>Stoical Apathetick</hi> method (if the <hi>Stoick</hi> be not as much wronged as the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean)</hi> is but a pitiful cutting, at best a curb, no wayes a Cure of a corrupt World. A man will
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59412:122"/>
suffer much before he suffer the loss of his Limbs: and he hath wrought but an undesirable Cure, that by cutting off of a Member hath made a man creple or maim: The World will want much before they want their Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: And indeed who would choose to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable? Wherefore the only expedient method in this case, will be diversion, whereby men may save their Members; the World may enjoy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Pleasures, for measure as much greater as for quality better, than formerly in their courses of Iniquity; only they must not run any more in the Channel of Sensuality, but in the vein of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Spirituality. Consider then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and Pleasures of Godliness, and then let reason say, who hath the sweetest Life, the Saint or the Bruit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. For their nature, they are unspeakable and full of Glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. the Word is significant in its own Language <gap reason="foreign">

The Saints Delights in Earth, are a cup of the same Wine, for kind, which they shall drink in the Kingdom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though it be not of so high a colour, nor of so rich a relish to us here in the Cellar, as it is to them at the Kings Table. Holiness is much mistaken in the World, and so is Heaven and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, which is no other, than the top and upper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd of Holiness, or Holiness in its Holy-dayes Cloathes. If men would consider this, I suppose
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59412:123"/>
some should be as afraid of Heaven as they are of Holiness: Yea I am really of the mind, if God should open a door in Heaven to a Prophane Liver, and say, Come up hither, that he should not dare to enter: The Beauty and Light of that Glory, so contrary to Darkness, would dazle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, and utterly undoe him. If a man should be permitted, yea commanded to throw himself into a burning Fiery Furnace, like that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> durst he yet do it? Yea though he were very cold and never so much needed to be warned. And who among Hypocrites or Prophane Livers <hi>shall dwell with devouring Fire?</hi> Who amongst them shall <hi>dwell with everlasting burnings?</hi> Isa. 33 14. In a word, men must either say that it is a great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happiness to be in Heaven, or that it is their great Happiness to be more Holy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The pleasures and delights of Holiness are of the highest descent, they spring from the rock of Eternity. And O! how pure? how wholsome? how pleasant must they be? The pleasures which God gives his People, have himself for their spring, and life for their vertue. Psal. 36. 8. 9. <hi>with thee is the fountain of life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They have the deepest root, and so farrest in upon the Soul: as the delights of Hypocrites, World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and prophane persons are but the dreggs; so they are but the scruse and pairings of pleasures: their pleasures are but Skin-deep: in the midst of all their laughter, the heart is sad: they are as Hypocritical in their delights as in their duties. The Soul and Conscience of a wicked man hath
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59412:123"/>
nothing like Christ but this, that they are never seen to laugh: they are men of sorrows indeed, and many sorrows are their portion: That is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to them of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 32 10. with <hi>Isai.</hi> 65. 13, 14.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Consolations, Joys, Pleasures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Godliness the most strong and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: in the multitude of their frighting, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tempting, doubting and inquiring <hi>thoughts, Gods comforts delight their soul.</hi> Psal, 94. 14. These turn their mourning into dancing, they make them sing in a Prison, and rejoice in tribulation: But Affliction maketh a wicked man soon to forget his pleasures, as waters that pass away: yea and the memory of their former delights, is to their present sorrows, as he that <hi>singeth songs to a heavy heart,</hi> and their song is, <hi>miserum est fuisse saelicem:</hi> It is the greatest misery to have once been happy.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The delights of Godliness are pure and chast delights, they are such as the Soul enjoys with Gods blessing and approbation, yea with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Psal. 37. 4. <hi>delight they self also in the Lord;</hi> the pleasures of Godliness are our duty. And for their <hi>Chastity,</hi> they are like the pleasures that a man hath in the company of his lawful Wife. Prov. 5. 19 <hi>Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, and be thou ravisht with her love:</hi> the word in its own language is, <hi>Eire</hi> thou always in her love: If a man must play the fool, let him do it lawfully: and if it be an error, it is an innocent one to erre with Gods approbation. But the delights of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness are impure, whoorish and strange delights
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59412:124"/>
such as a man hath in the company of a harlot: and <q>why will thou my son be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosome of a stranger? </q>
                        <hi>Prov,</hi> 5. 20.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The delights of Godliness are secure and safe delights. This follows from the former. Here the Soul is ridd of all fear of going too far: there is no excess in those pleasures: <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 18. in wine there is excess: but be filled with the Spirit; there is no excess in that, the more you drink of that the more sober you are: and also in the delights of Godliness, there is no fear of the sad after-claps of sorrow, that conclude sinful pleasures: for <hi>the end</hi> of that mirth is <hi>heaviness. Prov.</hi> 14 13. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly mans sinful pleasures are but a showr-blink that ends in a tempest: their delights are like the pleasures of drunkards, who drink and swill till their head ake, and their heart be sick: and they have their sentence with <hi>Babylon. Ier,</hi> 51. 39. <q>In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not awake, saith the Lord</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. This follows from all that is said, The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights of Godliness are constant and induring pleasures. John 16, 33. <hi>your joy no man taketh from you.</hi> As the World doth not give the Saints joy and delight, so neither can it take these from them. The Saints delights in Godliness, are like spring waters that will rise as high as they fall in their courses. As they descend first from Heaven, so they never cease running till they ascend thither
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59412:124"/>
again: they are like living running waters, that make what turnings they will, about mountains or whole countreys, in end they fall into the Sea: The River of pure pleasures, that <hi>maketh glad the the City of God,</hi> hath its outgoing into the Sea of that fulness of joy, that is in Gods <hi>presence,</hi> and that ocean <hi>of pleasures that are at his right hand for evermore.</hi> And now I go forth unto the streets, and stand in the open places and cry: O all ye who love pleasures turn in hither, tast and see that the Lord is Gracious. I am so litle an enemy to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and so much an <hi>Epicurean</hi> in opinion (as you see) that if any man shall shew me pleasures more pleasant than those of Godliness, I am content to change for the better: and that shall be when men and beasts make an exchange of Soules; water and wine of natures and vertues; and Heaven and Earth shall change places; when evil shall be good; black shall be white; bitter, sweet; darkness, light; crockedness, straight; heaviness, light; when cold shall be hot; and time shall be Eternal.</p>
                     <p n="4">4, Godliness is the only perfect, harmonious, and uniforme of all the Soules lovers: what lame and defective pieces are all her companions? I said as much in the description of the inward power of Grace as may shew, how exactly commensurable her perfections are to all the powers, and to the whole capacity of a man: she satisfieth the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, will and affections; and exercises the whole man. But of her defective companions, some want the head as error, superstition, profan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: whatever of the will and affections, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59412:125"/>
practise be in these, yet they are against the truth of a well informed judgment: some want the heart as Hypocrisie and formality, whatever of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, profession or practice be in these; yet the will and affections do not consent: some want the hands and feet, and are meer trunks; as all those who pretend to know, will and love their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters will, but do it not. And for their moral qualifications, The first is a fool; the next is a knave; and the last is a sluggard. But compleat Godliness hath the head, heart hands and feet, with all the parts of a perfect man: and is a wise, trusty and active piece. And as it is compleat and perfect so it is most uniforme and harmonious. <hi>Ungodh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> is a <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Division,</hi> a <hi>Babel</hi> of Confusion, <hi>it parteth chief friends, and putteth a man at variance with those of his own house:</hi> the wicked are like the <hi>troubled Sea:</hi> their lusts are continually fighting and warring one against another, and altogether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Holiness: whence are Wars and fightings, but from your lusts? <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 1. Ungodly mens lusts are like themselves, for extremes they are, and they are like extremes that differ alike from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and from the mids: A varice differeth as much from Prodigality her Sister Vice, as from Liberality her contrary vertue. But Godliness sets a man at one with himself: it is a heart-uniting thing. Psal. 86. 11. <hi>unite my heart to fear thy name.</hi> It makes a good understanding betwixt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the will, the affections, and the whole man. And <hi>blessed be the Peace-maker,</hi> shall she not be <hi>called the Child of God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59412:125"/>
5. Is it not the great Glory of Godliness, that as many do sute her, as few do espouse her, and she hath as many pretenders, as few matches? Are not all men, her pretenders? Do not her greatest adversaries pay her the Devotion, at least of a complement? Is not their great request to her, like that Isai. 4. 1. <hi>only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach?</hi> Do not her greatest enemys Glory to be called her servants? Call an evil man good, and you cannot please him beeter: for he hateth as much to be <hi>called evil,</hi> as to <hi>be good;</hi> And loveth as much to <hi>be evil,</hi> as to be <hi>called good.</hi> And it is yet as much her Glory that few do enjoy her. But pray, whom doth she reject? are they any but the Ungodly? those unworthy Persons that were brought in upon her, and came to mock her: nor doth she despise any that have not first despised her: or should she prostitute her self to such as care not for her? none get a Rejection from her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their own consent: and they take it before they get it: for as none are Godly, so neither are any Wicked against their will.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Beside the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come, which makes Godliness profitable to all things 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4. 8. It is the ready way, even in ordinary probability, to give a man honour, wealth, and pleasure, and to continue these with him, yea even in this World: (I would these tymes did give a better testimony to this Observation: but I hope the Observation shall stand when some are fallen; and shall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, when these times are past way) for that
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59412:126"/>
these things are as naturally purchased by good and vertuous, as lost by lewd and wicked practices. And how shall a man have Honour, who prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes himself to courses wherein he hath none, but base and unmanly persons for his Companions? Are not Pages, Grooms, and Lackeyes, as good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows as their Lord himself at Whoreing, Drinking, Swearing, Carding, <hi>where all are fellows?</hi> Is not my Lord well Honoured, when he sends his man to convoy a Whore to the Chamber, who (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon the Road he uses to lead the way for his Master, thinks he will do him the like service here, and serves him with his own remains? But who doth not Reverence the Presence, and Honour the Face of a really Good man? Yea many a time such an one hath more Reverence than God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with Evil men, who dare do many things in the Eyes of God, that they will be loath to do in presence of such a man? Yea how convincing many a time is the Carriage of a Godly man to his greatest Enemies? <hi>Surely thou art more Righteous then I</hi> (said <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>David)</hi> and when <hi>a Mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh even his Enemies to be at peace with him,</hi> Prov. 16. 7. An excellent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine (I think it is <hi>Greenhame)</hi> sayes well; <hi>Let not a Saint be afraid of Men; for that by his Prayers, he hath more Power of their Hearts, than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have:</hi> And the Scripture sayes the same, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?</hi> And how well had it been with the Profane Ruffian, that he had spent that Time, Strength, Estate, and Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59412:126"/>
for God, in the way of Godliness, with the sweet and sure gain of his Soul, which he hath wasted in riffling and base living, with the evident hazard of his Soul's ruine, if that may be said to be ruined that was never repaired, nor in case. But be it yet that the godly man attaineth not to these advantages Temporal; The Peace of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, the Contentment of Soberness, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence of Faith, and the Rejoycing of Hope, do more than compense all that is wanting elsewhere, and cause that a good man is satisfied from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Prov</hi> 14. 14.</p>
                     <p>Now let all that hath been said, be a reproof of the Worlds hard opinions of Godliness, and give cheque to their unkind dealing with her, as if she were a sorry Piece, to be desired by none, but such as would be miserable. I have not yet travelled so far, but that I can remember from whence I set forth: In my entry upon the point, I told my Erand was with <hi>Eleazar Abraham</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Genes.</hi> 24. To seek a Wife to my Master's Son, and to Espouse and bring home Souls to Christ: And now to conclude, Let me with them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. 57, 58. Call the Damsel, and enquire at her Mouth, <hi>Wilt thou go with the man?</hi> And she said (so be it said unto me) <hi>I will go.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth and last thing we learn from the point, in a word, Is, to put a good construction upon all Gods Dispensations to his People; for his thoughts towards them are <hi>Thoughts of Peace, and not of evil, to give them an expected end,</hi> Jer 29. 11. And in complyance with the Lords great design, in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59412:127"/>
vicissitudes of all our Lots, let us learn to give him more of our Hearts: For he brings his People into the Wilderness, and there he allures them. If these Melancholly times do but make us more tractable, condescending and kind to <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> we may well expect, that he will speak comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably unto us.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>I will bring her into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and will speak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably unto her.</head>
                     <p>ANd thus I am led by the hand into the fourth and last thing proposed to be considered in the Text. The <hi>juncture and coincidence</hi> of the Churches affliction and the Lords <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations. I will bring her into the Wilderness, and I will speak comfortably un to her.</hi> Hence the Doctrine is, That the Lord useth to tryst his peoples sadest afflictions with his sweetest consolations. He is a God that comforteth those that art cast down: It is his way and use, The Apostle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in consolations by Christ, as their sufferings for Christ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded.</hi> And reading through all the Scripture, I never find the Saints more indulged with the sweet consolations of God and his kind manifestations, than in the greatest afflictions. Reasons of this are, 1. His free love and kindness. So it becomes him <hi>with whom the fatherless find mercy:</hi> He loveth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth the Stranger, he is a Father of the Fatherless, and a Husband to the Widow, a Judge of the oppressed out of his holy habitation: He will be known in adversity to be a Friend. 2. Their necessity: Then they need consolations, and then they come in season: Prov. 30. 6. <hi>Wine should be given to those that are of heavy hearts: When I said my foot slippeth, thy mercy Lord held me up.</hi> This was a mercy that came in good season. 3. Their fitness: As then they most need con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59412:127"/>
so then are they fittest to receive and intertain them. The Lord will not have his Consolations to run by and be spilt, by pouring them out into full vessels: But <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst, for they shall be filled.</hi> I spoke before upon the second part of the Text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how afflictions fits for consolations; and that therefore, God sometimes brings his people into the Wilderness, that thus he may fit them.</p>
                     <p>Most sweet are the Consolations wherewith the Lord trysts his people in their afflictions. 1. He draws forth to them the bowels of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ost tender compassions. In <hi>all their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he is afflicted,</hi> Isa. 63. 9. Jer. 31. 20. <hi>Since</hi> I <hi>spoke against him,</hi> I <hi>do earnestly remember him still, therefore my bowels are troubled for him,</hi> Zach. 2. 8. <hi>He that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye.</hi> It is a very acceptable consolation to an afflicted person, to mourn with them, and to be touched with their condition: And the Lord cryes <hi>alas</hi> at every touch of affliction that comes upon people: Nor need they fear he shall forget them: For whatever is a mans pain, it will not fail to put him in mind.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He ownes them and takes notice of them, when others sight them and care not for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 7. <hi>He knows their Soul in Adversities,</hi> Psal. 142. 4, 5. <hi>I looked on my right hand and beheld, but there was no man that would know me, refuge failed me: No man cared for my Soul: I cryed unto thee O Lord, I said thou art my refuge, and my portion in the land of the living,</hi> Jer 30. 16, 17. and forward: The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises with great Mercies to owne his Church, because in the 17 verse, <hi>They called her an out-cast, saying, this is</hi> Zion <hi>whom no man seeketh after,</hi> Lament. 1. 12. <hi>It was nothing to those that passed by,</hi> to see all that she suffered. But her desire is frequently throughout the Chapter, Behold O Lord for I am in distress. Yea and he will behold, <hi>For his eyes behold the things that are equal,</hi> Act. 7. 34. <hi>I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people, which is in</hi>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59412:128"/>
                        <hi>Beholds mischief and spight, to requite it with his hand,</hi> Ps. 10. 14.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. He vouchsafes them a more special presence, <hi>Ps:</hi> 91. 15. <hi>I will be with him in trouble,</hi> Psal. 23. 4. <hi>In the valley of the Shaddow of death thou art with me,</hi> Isai. 43. 2. When thou passest through the Waters I will be with thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Lord is ever near to those that fear him: but in affliction he goes very near them. They have alwayes his special presence, <hi>Ps.</hi> 140, 13. <hi>The upright shall dwell in thy presence.</hi> But in trouble they have a more special presence. His presence is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a secret supporting presence, whereby his people are held up, they know not how: For many a time when the Saints look back upon those times, wherein they said, <hi>their strength and their hope is perished from the Lord,</hi> and see the way that they have come, they wonder how they have win through: <hi>But God was with them whilst they knew it not.</hi> Or else his presence is a manifest comforting presence, and that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls his <hi>visiting of his people.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Then the Lord vouchsafes his afflicted people many a kind visit: And in those visits, 1. He salutes his people with Peace: <hi>He will speak Peace unto his people, and to his Saints: in the world ye shall have trouble</hi> (sayes he) <hi>but in me ye shall have Peace.</hi> 2. He gives a hearing to all his peoples Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, Complaints and Petitions: <hi>Lord thou hast heard the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the humble.</hi> 3. He speaks his mind to his people, both concerning their Duty and the issue of their lot. The times of the Lords visits to his afflicted people, are the times wherein he communicates most of his secrets to those that fear him. The Soul that goes through manyfest afflictions, is ordinarily the wisest and most experienced Soul: <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahit,</hi> who was so sore afflicted, even from his youth, was one of the wisest men in his time. Speculation speaks of cases like a Geographer, Experience speaks like a Traveller: That sayes that which <hi>our ears have heard,</hi> this sayes, <hi>that which our eyes have seen, declare we unto you.</hi> 4. In his Visits, he gives his people tokens for good: He comes never empty-handed to them, But gives them such things, whereof they may say in their straits, when he seems to have forgotten them, <hi>Lord whose are these:</hi> 5. And further (as the original hath the words of the Text) he <hi>speaks to his peoples heart:</hi> He satisfies them concerning his Dispensations, and convinceth them of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59412:128"/>
the equity and kindness of his dealing with them. He gives them such rational accounts of his dispensations; as makes them say, he hath taken the best way with them, and makes them sing, <hi>thou hast dealt well with thy Servants,</hi> Ps. 119. 65. And by convincing them that good is the Word of the Lord, <hi>Isai.</hi> 39. 8. He makes them say from their Heart, that if va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of lots were in their offer, they would choose the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: O but that speaks well: I will speak to her heart: I will even speak as she would have me. Thus he comforts by his kind visits.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. He comforts his people in affliction, by being all things to them, and doing all things for them. Thus we find the Saints in their afflictions making applications to God, with Titles suted to their condition: And <hi>it is God</hi> (faith the <hi>Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist) that doth all things for me.</hi> He is the <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>Israel:</hi> If they be scattered, he gathers them: if they go astray, he leads them; if they want, he feeds them, and <hi>makes them Lie in green Pastures, by the still waters:</hi> If they be in hazard, <hi>He is their refuge:</hi> Are they sad? He <hi>is the Health of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance:</hi> Are they weak or weary? <hi>He is their strength,</hi> and with him is everlasting strength: Are they sinners and guilty: He is <hi>the God of their Righteousness:</hi> Is Law intended against them? He <hi>pleads their cause;</hi> and <hi>stands at their right hand:</hi> Is the judge an unfriend to them? <hi>He is their judge, and their Sentence cometh forth from his presence:</hi> Do Kings or others command them to be Afflicted, Fined, Beaten, Imprisoned, Confined, Banished? Then <hi>Psal</hi> 44. 4. <hi>Thou art my King O God, command deliverances for</hi> Jacob: Have they no Friends, nor any to do for them? He that is the kind Lord can cause men shew them <hi>the kindness of the Lord:</hi> That which the Scripture calleth <hi>the kindness of the Lord.</hi> 1 Sam. 20. 14. hath as much in it, as may shew us, that the Lord, makes men Instruments at his pleasure, to shew kindness, and do a good Office to his people. And when the Saints and Servants of God come to count kindness, I hope there will be found more of the kindness of the Lord, than of men, in Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies that are done them. I am so little a Patron of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, That I shall thank him kindly, and pray (as our <hi>Scots</hi> Proverb is) <hi>The Lord reward him that doth me good, whether with his will, or against it.</hi> But truly when from
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59412:129"/>
men I meet with less kindness, where I might have expected more; and more where I might have expected less; The Meditation of this Scripture expression, <hi>To shew the kindness of the Lord,</hi> hath taught me the more earnestly to ask mercies of my God, and to leave the expressing and dispensing of it to himself, by Means and Instruments of his own choosing: He can make a <hi>Babylonian</hi> Enemy to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>

                     <p n="6">6. To add no more, for that hath all. The Lord comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his afflicted People by <hi>Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Use</hi> of this point shall be, for strong <hi>Consolation</hi> to the Saints in their greatest afflictions. The Lord hath laid it straitly upon us, to comfort his People in their afflictions, <hi>Isai.</hi> 40. 1. 2. and here, he takes it upon himself to be their Comforter: He hath given this Name and O shee to his Holy Spirit, <hi>The Comforter;</hi> and shall not the afflicted People of God with these words be comforted, and comfort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But according to the rule of Scripture. Comforts and Duties must be matched together: Nor must we expect in the event a Separation of those things, that God hath joyned in the intimation.
