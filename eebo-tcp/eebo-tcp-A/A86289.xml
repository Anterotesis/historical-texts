            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Contents of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are famous for two things, that had moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary events. The one, how a great variance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: The other, how a ſmall variance did proceed to an unhappy diſcord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:114920:3"/>The great variance was, whether ſuch as were converted to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt continue in the obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For ſome in the firſt Verſe of the Chapter were ſo rigid, that they held, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye be circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ye can not be ſaved, This point was decided. And they that were <hi>Jewiſh</hi> were overborn, by a moderate determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agreed upon by all the Apoſtles, and Elders that met at <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> Which is alſo remarkable, the men that were chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pickt out to be ſent to <hi>Antioch</hi> to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the oppoſites were <hi>Paul and Barnabas.</hi> And the flame was quencht by the autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Apoſtles, and their labour.</p>
            <p>But when matter of Doctrine, and deep diſpute could not divide the <hi>Church,</hi> Satan laid a ſmaller ſtumbling block in their way: and the two moſt holy Servants of God, <hi>the chief <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpires, and the Embaſſadors for peace, Paul &amp; Barnabas,</hi> daſht their foot againſt it, And they that pluckt a beam out of their Brothers eie, were troubled with a mote in their own. it was not about a point of doctrine, but upon a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a perſon, no way conſiderable to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114920:3"/>
the main benefit of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that begat a quarel, and a disjunction between them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John,</hi> whoſe ſurname was <hi>Mark</hi> (whether <hi>Mark, the Evangeliſt,</hi> or ſome other diſciple I leave it as uncertain) but, he had dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf to the miniſtry, and to go ſtep by ſtep with S. <hi>Paul</hi> as his fellow labourer. Yet he <hi>leſt Paul at Pamphylia to return to Hieruſalem,</hi> his own home, <hi>Act</hi> 13. 13 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded either by weakeneſs, and fear of perſecution, or ſome other domeſtical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. After this back-ſliding, the young Novice awakt, and was willing to mend his errour. So that when <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> reſolved to go a circuit, to examine the <hi>Churches</hi> which they had planted, whether they continued ſound in the Faith, <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> preſents <hi>Mark</hi> his ſiſters ſon, to be their fellow undertaker in that holy em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment <hi>Paul</hi> refuſed him, <hi>becauſe he had put his hand to the plough, and lookt back.</hi>

               </gap>ach ſtood very ſtiff to his own purpoſe and propoſition. Rather than <hi>Barnabas</hi> would ſuffer <hi>Mark</hi> to be diſcountenanced, he would forſake <hi>Paul</hi> Rather than <hi>Paul</hi> would conſent to <hi>Mark</hi>'s re-admiſſion, he would forſake <hi>Barnabas,</hi> And the <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114920:4"/>
was ſo ſharp between them, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted aſunder the one from the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have heard the two different caſes. In a matter of great diſpute the Church maintein'd it's unity, &amp; ſhew'd that it was built upon a rock. But in a petty diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (ſee how all men are frail, and unity will never be kept entirely) the greateſt pillars of it were ſhaken, and ſhew'd how peace was built upon the ſands. Here's the drift of the Text: not to excuſe diſcord, becauſe it was incident to two ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Apoſtles; but to teach us, that theſe burning lights did a little loſe their lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, becauſe their diviſion increas'd to that ſtifneſs, that they were ſeparated the one from the other.</p>
            <p>Upon the handling of the Text in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral points, Firſt, we muſt enter in at a breach, Here was a <hi>contention.</hi> Secondly, this ſtruggling was not between mean and ordinary Perſons, but between the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Holy Cauſe, <hi>between Paul and Barnabas.</hi> Thirdly, it was not carried with meekneſs, and cool temper, but it ſwelled high, it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>ſharp, a fretful contention.</hi> Fourthly, they fell not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114920:4"/>
out for any thing that toucht the life of truth, or the honour of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of <hi>Greece,</hi> as the Proverb is, did not ly upon it: it was only about the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of a perſon, whether <hi>Mark</hi> were ſit for the preſent work: that was all the matter, and no more. Fiftly, as ſmall a matter as it was, it waxt to a ſeparation, and to disjoyn theſe two in body, as well as in mind, <hi>They departed aſ under the one from the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is thus being re-capitulated. <hi>Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is the canker of <hi>Evangelical</hi> fruit, which is <hi>peace on earth, good will towards men.</hi> Yet the miſchief is the leſs, when mean ones contend: but wo to the <hi>Church</hi> becauſe of ſcandal, when <hi>Paul and Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> are the Actors in it. Yet again, if thoſe that were qualified with the greateſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the beacons upon an hill, did vary in a calm, and a mitigated manner, it were not ſo ſtrange, but it might be expected. This was not ſo well: it was a variance joyn'd with paſſion, and acerbity; a ſore that can not be toucht without much compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion For all this, if the provocation had been ſuch, wherein piety could not yield,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114920:5"/>
it had been conſtancy, and not contention to be inflexible: But this was a caſe of no ſuch weight, wherein charity might not have ſatisfied conſcience, and conſcience have ſubmitted to charity. Laſtly, after ſo many diſcords, if the cloze of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique had been ſweet, it had not wanted harmony: but this determined in a final acrimony; from a wrinkle in the garment it came to a rent; it was a contention that grew to a ſeparation; and that's the partition-wall that re-trencheth unity.</p>
            <p>Now I reſume all this again. And that which we meet firſt of all at the door of the Text is <hi>contention.</hi> None of the leaſt: ſins, none of the leaſt puniſhments. For if <hi>Babel</hi> it ſelf could not be built up among <hi>diſcord of tongues</hi>; how much more can <hi>Sion</hi> never be well built up with <hi>diſcord of hearts</hi>? If the net be broken, the Fiſhers of Men may catch a draught, but they can keep nothing. Cut a ſeed of wheat in twain, and the pieces loſe the nature of fructification. If words be not well put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they will make no ſenſe: and if mens ſenſes do not well joyn together in one profeſsion, they will make no <hi>Church.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114920:5"/>
Contention</hi> is the Devils wedge to rive aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; it turns order into a heap, amity into jangling, unity into Schiſm, and truth into Hereſie.</p>
            <p>There is one <hi>Themiſtius</hi> in <hi>Euſebius</hi> that made an Oration before <hi>Valens</hi> the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> about the time that there were many diſtractions on foot in the cauſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and he flatter'd the ſin with this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; <hi>Deum ſectarum varietate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius innoteſcere,</hi> That the variety of Sects would diſpread the knowledge of God the wider over all the Earth. No doubt they will make a loud noiſe, but a bad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. And where many Sects ſpring up, it calls Truth the more into queſtion, &amp; the fewer proſelytes will be gained. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ſlowed out of the Rock in the Wilderneſs were more than elementary, for <hi>they were ſpiritual drink, in a figure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 4. and <hi>yet they were waters of ſtriſe,</hi> Exod. 17. 7. Even the ſpiritual fountain it ſelf was a troubled water: but that which troubles it is a carnal ſpirit. <hi>For while there are ſtriſes, and diviſions among you, are you not carnal, &amp; walk as men</hi>? 1 Cor. 3.3. The walk of men is contention: the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114920:6"/>
way of God is peace. We are ſure he is in <hi>the ſtill voice</hi>: and we are ſure that he is not in the <hi>whirl-winds of controverſies and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two men of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſtrove together, Ex 2. 13 Their own Doctors make it out from their bold traditions, that they were <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi>: An unlucky couple, whoſoever they were. <note place="margin">All 7 26.</note> 
               <hi>Moſes would have ſet them at one,</hi> but they rejected him. He would have made them all quiet, before he took upon him to be the <hi>Prince of their deliverance</hi>: but ſince they lov'd variance better than amity, he departed, and came not to them again in fourty years. The cankardneſs of two men coſt them fourty years bondage more, before he return'd again to deliver them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Men that are addicted to moderation, will ſhun the company that reſounds with brawling and bitterneſs. As the paſſage is well known about <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> how he removed from his Palace in the Eaſt, becauſe every corner of the Imperial City was filled with adverſe Diſputations about Religion; and after ſome ſpace of abſence he wrote <hi>to his Clergie, Patefacite
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114920:6"/>
mihi aditum &amp;c.</hi> I would return unto you: but make the way to receive me ſmooth &amp; plain by Peace, which you have made ſo rugged by your Contentions. Much more you may preſume, that <hi>God</hi> will depart from that Church, where the flames of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious diſcords are broken out. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>God is the author of peace, ſo let us be lovers of concord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore elſe hath he made us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of one Table, but to invite us to the conjunction of one Heart? <hi>ſo our Apoſtle, for we being many are one bread, and one body,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 17. <hi>One bread</hi> in the thing which we do communicate: <hi>One body</hi> among them that do communicate. So our Elders ſay, it is <hi>Signum unitatis, vinculum cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</hi> Yet the unity doth not riſe from the outward ceremony, that we all eat of one Sacrament: but that we eat of it with one Faith, are gathered together in one Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and depend upon the grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation of one <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe earneſt prayer was for his Diſciples, <hi>That they all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they all may be one in us,</hi> Jo. 17. 21.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114920:7"/>The uſe of it to the beſt is this There is nothing that we ask in prayer for our ſelves, or <hi>Chriſt</hi> for us, but likely there is ſomewhat requiſite on our part, to do our duty, that we may obtein it. Be it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore propounded, what we ſhould do as well as pray, <hi>that we may be one, and that no contention fall among us</hi> Firſt bring a ſupple, a ſoft, a tractable mind, that hath a good affection to agreement, and I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to furniſh you with Rules enough, that if you differ in no greater things than <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did (yea what if they were greater?) you may ſoon greet one another with the kiſs of Peace. But if we ſtand at this diſtance, I have pitcht upon my reſolution, I muſt have my will, and will not yield an inch, ſuch an untractable obſtinacy can never profit by any exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Onely by pride cometh contention, ſaies Salomon,</hi> Prov. 13. 10. He that is wife in his own opinions, will never want occaſions to begin them, nor arguments to maintain them. And he that thinks the yielding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty loſeth in his honour, had rather lead and periſh, than follow after and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. As <hi>Core</hi> had rather die in his own
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114920:7"/>
way, than be ruled by <hi>Moſes</hi> and ſave his life. But humility is limber, and will eaſily bend; it is never given to contradiction; it ſtands not upon vain points of reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to carry the ſway in every oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For let the wrangler get the better in obſtinacy, the modeſt Chriſtian ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in charity. Mortifie ſelf-love, and Peace will pleaſe you better than Victory.</p>
            <p>Away with ſtrife <hi>God</hi> himſelf did abate and condeſcend from it for ſaies the <hi>Lord, My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man,</hi> Gen. 6. 3. And when <hi>Chriſt</hi> was upon the earth in the fleſh, he uſed the ſame calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>He ſhall not ſtrive, nor cry, neither ſhall any man hear his voice in the ſtreets,</hi> Mat 12. 19. The beſt that he can ſay for himſelf, that continues in contention, is, It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable that I ſhould yield, for I am in the right. It were no hurt for a modeſt judgment to ſuſpect it ſelf in that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of perſwaſion. But be it granted that the right is on your ſide: was not <hi>Eliſha</hi> aſſured by his prophetical Spirit, nay by his very eyes, that <hi>Elias</hi> was aſcended up to heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? yet when the ſons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets urg'd him, that they might appoint
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114920:8"/>
fourty men, leſt peradventure he was caſt in a mountain, or in a valley, though <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha</hi> knew it was labour in vain, yet, ſaies the Scripture, 2 Kin. 2. 17. <hi>When they urged him till he was aſham'd, he bade them ſend.</hi> Here was a tractable diſpoſition, that was aſham'd in a right cauſe to perſiſt in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this which I have required, that men be not rigid, but humble, &amp; flexible, the rules to be kept <hi>for compoſing ſmaller debates,</hi> &amp; my Text reacheth to no other, are theſe. Firſt there is no exception to be made againſt <hi>the ſentence of the Law</hi> under which we live. It is an indifferent judge, ordeined to try our cauſes, before we were born. It hath no paſſions, no kindred, no corruption to tranſport it. It is the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique wiſedom not of one age, but of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. What colour can there be for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man to refuſe it? Unleſs he would quite take away Juſtice, which were to pluck the Sun out of the Firmament, to demoliſh the pillar that upholds the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>According to the ſentence of the Law, which they ſhall teach thee: and according to the judgment, which they (The Rulers)
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114920:8"/>
ſhall tell thee, thou ſhalt do,</hi> Deut. 17. 11. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the Kingdome hath <hi>Statute-La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> ſo the <hi>Church hath Canons,</hi> which ſerved our turn, to much benefit, in the beſt ages, before <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> came forth to help us. And if they that flight them had lived, when the diſtreſſed <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were ſerved with the <hi>Emperors</hi> writts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every week, to be haled to heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Rites &amp; Feſtivals, nay to flat Idolatry, how glad would they have been to have nothing laid upon them, <hi>but Canons for Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and forms of prayer</hi>? Now they are wanton. And being no longer ſcared with the <hi>howling of the Wolf,</hi> they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the <hi>whiſtle of the Shephard.</hi> And they that could preſs upon their Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervants—I know what—lumps of pitch and hair, able to choke the Dragon in the <hi>Apocryphals</hi> to ſwallow them, a few <hi>impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forms</hi> can not be bolted through the fine fives of their conſciences, which for almoſt fifteen Centuries were never cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd to be offenſive.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when ſome caſes fall out, for which neither <hi>Laws nor Canons</hi> have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114920:9"/>
               <hi>Cuſtom</hi> hath much force to decide them. For it can not be thought, but in a long tract of time, ſome that are ſincere and uncorrupt would hinder the progreſs of a thing, if it were not laudable. Long permiſſion is a tolerable confirmation. That <hi>Custom</hi> is an arbiter of peace, I refer to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 16. <hi>If any man ſeem to be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtom, nor the Churches of God.</hi> As who ſhould ſay, you go againſt <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> your behaviour is of the new cut, therefore your <hi>contention</hi> is in vain.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, if it fall out that <hi>Laws</hi> are ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and <hi>Cuſtomes</hi> are contrary one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, then, by the Privilege which we have above beaſts, we muſt reſort to <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi> I will put you an inſtance. The <hi>Churches of Aſia</hi> obſerv'd their <hi>Eaſter day</hi> upon the <hi>Jews Paſſover,</hi> accounting their <hi>Cuſtom</hi> from the time of St. <hi>John.</hi> The <hi>Weſtern Churches</hi> kept their <hi>Eaſter</hi> upon the firſt day of the week, claiming their <hi>Cuſtom</hi> from the dayes of other Apoſtles. Hear how <hi>reaſon</hi> interpoſeth in this debate. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cuſtom</hi> hath the tradition of the beſt antiquity for it: But the <hi>Reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> may moſt fitly be celebrated upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114920:9"/>
the firſt day of the week, the ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord roſe from the dead, call'd the <hi>Lords day.</hi> Unto this all the <hi>Churches</hi> gave ear, and ſo it is eſtabliſht to this day.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, I report me to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> how they handled a diſcord in this Chapter. Some would have all the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> kept, which would have made the <hi>Gentiles become Jews, and not Chriſtians.</hi> Some would have none of them be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, no, not for a time, to ſatisfie the weakneſs of the <hi>Jew,</hi> which would have provokt the <hi>Jew to eſteem the Gentile a ſcandalous Chriſtian.</hi> To prevent all Schiſm, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> &amp; <hi>Elders</hi> fall upon that courſe, which we call <hi>Media conſilia, a middle tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Some ceremonies the <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form unto: that will appeaſe the <hi>Jew.</hi> Some ceremonies the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall forgo: that will edifie the <hi>Gentile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, what think you of <hi>arbitration</hi>? And the fewer <hi>arbiters</hi> the better. When many take the thing in hand, commonly it is ſo long a doing that it is never done. Make the appeal then to few. Nay why not <hi>to one perſon</hi>? I am ſo directed by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Is there not a wiſe man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114920:10"/>
you, not one, that ſhall be able to judg be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his brethren</hi>? Not that <hi>one, or many</hi> ſhould have dominion over your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but to make him, or them, the ſettlers of outward peace. This is it, as every Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar knows, which S. <hi>Hierom</hi> delivers to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent troubles in a Church, <hi>Niſi exors quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam dignitas,</hi> &amp;c. Unleſs you give ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of power to <hi>one Biſhop in a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe,</hi> to examin external order, &amp; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſound doctrine, you will have ſo many faſhions as there are men, and ſo many Faiths as there are Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though</hi> there are ſo many remedies to ſtop contention, <hi>Law, Canons, Cuſtom, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Middle temper, Arbitration,</hi> yet my Text tells you they do not alwayes prevail: for the moſt conſiderable members of <hi>Chriſts</hi> body were at odds, <hi>Paul and Barnabas,</hi> which is the next point. Had they been enmities with Inſidels, and Pagans, with thoſe that are without, they had been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural: for <hi>what agreement hath light with darkeneſſe</hi>? But this was a jarr at home, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, a <hi>Civil warr</hi>; I tremble to ſpeak the word though in a bare meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor. This is not an oppoſition between
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114920:10"/>
               <hi>Iſmael and Iſaac</hi> of two venters, but between <hi>Jacob and Eſau</hi> in one womb: nay between the <hi>Pilot and the maſter</hi> in one ſhip. God help us, if the right hand ſight againſt the left, when both are made to defend the body. When the Rams of the flock contend, the poor Sheep that look on muſt ſtand amazed. But ſuch infelicities have been ſo frequent, in all ages, that the Devil hath caſt a bone between the <hi>Champions of our cauſe,</hi> that ſuch as take ſcandal at it ſeem to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſet men over us, to govern the <hi>Church,</hi> who have impotent paſſions, and not <hi>Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what if <hi>Angels</hi> were appointed to rule the <hi>holy Church</hi>? I do not ſay they are, nay, I ſay they are not. Yet ſome Divines, I could name good ones, <hi>Theodoret, Gregory the great,</hi> and others, are of opinion that the <hi>good Angels, guardians to the Churches and Provinces,</hi> &amp; miniſtring ſpirits to the Saints on earth, do not alwayes fulfill their charge, without oppoſite wayes in their ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance. That which they chiefly ground it upon is the 10th chap. of <hi>Daniel,</hi> v. 13. When <hi>Daniel</hi> beſought <hi>God</hi> to have the Temple built again, &amp; the people reſtored
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114920:11"/>
that were ſent into <hi>Babylon,</hi> the <hi>Archangel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> took his part, <hi>but the Prince of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Perſia</hi> withſtood him. I like their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that ſay, the Prince of the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi> was no <hi>Angel,</hi> but <hi>Cambyſes the Son of Cyrus,</hi> who recalled all favours intended to the <hi>Iows</hi> by his father <hi>Cyrus,</hi> while <hi>Cyrus</hi> was buſie in his wars againſt the <hi>Scythians.</hi> Yet antiquity knew not this interpretation; they made this out of it, that the <hi>Angels Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the Jews, and Porſians,</hi> not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecret will of God, what he would determine, labour'd in ſeveral wayes, for the good of diſtinct Nations over whom they had the charge. The <hi>Angel</hi> miniſtring to the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhew'd all readineſs to bring that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> moſt ſcandalous in their Idolatry. The <hi>Angel of Perſia</hi> might attempt to have the <hi>Jews</hi> remain ſome longer time, to reclame the natives of <hi>Perſia</hi> from Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They have no contrary wills or oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among themſelves: for <hi>God makes peace in his high places,</hi> Job 25. 2. It is a variety without a variance, when they do their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors diverſly, as <hi>God</hi> hath placed them, proſecuting nothing abſolutely, but condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, as <hi>God</hi> ſhall pleaſe in the end to ſettle it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:114920:11"/>This is a dark and a miſty point, therefore I ſtip out of it. But I ſtand to this doctrine, that <hi>Paul and Barnabas,</hi> &amp; ſuch good men as they are, may purſue a good meaning in a contrary way one to another, and be guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. For it is the ignorance of good men, and not their perverſneſs, which makes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeek the true end by multiplicity of means, and very oppoſite. <hi>Cyprian</hi> &amp; <hi>Cornelius</hi> were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſometimes, ſo were <hi>Chryſostom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> ſo were <hi>Cyril</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodoret.</hi> None of them but lov'd the truth. But they had not all the ſame fancy, the ſame complexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the ſame educatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: therefore Truth did not enter into them all through one &amp; the ſame perſwaſion. Cloth of the ſame making hath not alwayes the ſame die. And they that are propenſe to glorifie one <hi>God,</hi> in the ſame Church, with the ſame Charity, do not all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes build with the ſame materials. <hi>Paul</hi> loves the Church as well as <hi>Barnabas,</hi> but he would not offend it for want of Juſtice. <hi>Barnabas</hi> loves the Church as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> but he would not offend it for want of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and compaſſion. Here's one Wooll, &amp; one Cloth, but dipt in two colours. Then I let you ſee, that for their part that do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114920:12"/>
conſent to maintain the true Goſpel, the inequality of their judgements may be inoffenſive.</p>
            <p>I would I could ſay for our own parts, that the diſſentions of our Reformed Churches were unblamable, and that there were no tranſgreſſion againſt charity in our diſcords. But there are two wounds, deeper than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which can not be concealed, <hi>that ſtink and are corrupt through our fooliſhneſs.</hi> The one continued by the unrelenting <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries</hi> among the <hi>rigid Lutherans,</hi> never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to cry out, and yet never proving, that, with the ſubſtance of bread remaining, <hi>Chriſts</hi> fleſhly body is in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of his Supper, by the communication of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Divine Nature to the Humane. In vain they have been urg'd to fall back to a more moderate ſentence. For Scholars love the opinions w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> themſelves have broacht, more than <hi>Monarchs</hi> do the Kingdoms which themſelves have conquer'd.</p>
            <p>Our other rent falls upon a leſs ſubject, but the breach is no leſs that it hath made between party and party. Therefore do not imagine, that I mean thoſe hard Diſputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Gods eternal decrees, and ſtrange working
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114920:12"/>
of his grace.</hi> Theſe are canvas'd alike by all part: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> will never ceaſe, &amp; never be decid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I mean in the ſecond place the ſtruggling to admit, or not admit, ſome antient, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, out ward forms of worſhip. In whoſe forbearance I could never perceive, why Learned and Wiſe men ſhould be Incorrigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble The queſtion is, whether every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſhould obſerve thoſe decencies, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial parts of reverence, which the <hi>Church,</hi> wherein he lives, hath appointed. While they that reſiſt ſtand upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own liberty, they take away that liberty which is inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Church their Mother, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe comlineſs and order, for the better beautifying of God ſervice.</p>
            <p>Theſe, which I have named, theſe are the two quarrels, at which the Papiſts clap their hands, to ſee us brawl among our ſelves. I confeſs we cannot triumph in a perfect Peace. But do they inſult upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us for it? what they? whoſe janglings are ten for one of ours, and twice ten times greater, as a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone is bigger than a pebble Let them, and none but them that have no contentions in themſelves, <hi>caſt the firſt ſtone at us.</hi> It is not their dependence upon <hi>one Supreme Head,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114920:13"/>
that can keep them from diviſions. To fit it with a ſimilitude, <hi>Job</hi> deſcribes <hi>Leviathan,</hi> or rather <hi>God himſelf,</hi> c. 41. 15. <hi>His ſcales are his pride, ſhut up cloſe together as with a ſeal, they ſtick together, that they cannot be ſundred.</hi> It is not that <hi>Leviathan</hi> hath <hi>one grout head,</hi> which keeps him from offence: his ſafety muſt be that <hi>his ſcales ly cloſe, and cover him.</hi> But how uneaven the ſcales of <hi>this beaſt</hi> lye, let it be judged from the irreconcilable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of <hi>ſeculars and regulars</hi>; of <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi>; of <hi>Tridentine</hi> and <hi>Anti-Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentine Catholiques.</hi> And no wonder it there be turbulent opinions in the congregation of malignants: for the beſt of Gods ſervants draw not the ſame yoke, without a little jogging of the Ark, there was <hi>a contention between Paul and Barnabas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, to our wonder, it reſted not there, it exceeded the bounds of meekneſs: for in the <hi>third point</hi> my Text ſaies it was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a ſharp contention.</hi> An unanimity of opinions is not neceſſary to friendſhip, ſaies <hi>Aristotel</hi> very well. Dear friends may retain the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of love together, and yet vary in ſome concluſions of judgment. A little more may be granted, That each may be earneſt in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114920:13"/>
their own way, to win the other to aſſent: as <hi>Martha</hi> preſt it home, and complain'd of her ſiſter <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſhe did not joyn with her in the ſame houſhold care. It was a light word, and no violation of kindneſs <hi>Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tationes apud benevolos non lites ſunt, ſed jur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> ſaies <hi>Cicero</hi>: The diſſentions of them that keep benevolent minds, are not fallings out, but wranglings. As <hi>Paul reſisted Peter to his face,</hi> Gal. 2. 11. boldly, but charitably. His confidence for the truth became him, and his inoffenſiveneſs commended him.</p>
            <p>It was otherwiſe at this bout between him and <hi>Barnabas</hi>: paſſion &amp; provocation tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported them both ſo far, that it was <hi>a ſharp contention.</hi> The <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> hath a curſt meaning it it. When a diſeaſe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted a while, and begins it acceſs and violence again, that's call'd a <hi>paroxyſm</hi> of ſickneſſe: and when a brable is worſe and worſe, lowder and lowder, that's a <hi>paroxyſm of contention.</hi> Theſe two, that had been fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Souldiers under <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s banner, in ſo many travails, in ſo many perils, in ſo many perſecutions, they cannot bear with one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other with patience, and they that were ready to die together, cannot live together:
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114920:14"/>
they that were the ſtrongeſt confederates in the world, are the ſtrongeſt oppoſites. O what a fickle and fallacious thing is the concord of men! Anger is ready to run into enmity: and wrath tears off the ſeales from the bond of love.</p>
            <p>Yet I muſt not ſay that the <hi>ſharpneſs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſuch ſweet Olive-Branches had any taſt of the <hi>vinacre of reproach,</hi> or that they peirced one another with opprobrious ſpeeches. I do not onerate them with any ſuch accuſation. That's ſitter for <hi>Jobs</hi> defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med beaſt, lately mentioned, <hi>Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and ſparks of fire ſly out,</hi> Job 41. v. 19. Have they no regard of their common brotherhood in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who are not ſatisfied to <hi>contend,</hi> but they muſt mix <hi>ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> with it? And no ſmall quantity. A ſting is a little matter: they tear one another in pieces, as with the paw of a Lion. Their pen drops nothing but gall &amp; venom, as if their quill were pluckt from the wing of a Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrice. Then they think they write ſtrongly, when they rail lowdly, indeed when they lye lowdly. And he that ſhould ſtrive to be more powerful in truth, thinks he hath prevail'd when he is more bitter than his adverſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:114920:14"/>
               <hi>Quis leget haec</hi>? what man of <hi>Godly</hi> temper can read ſuch lines, which ſtink of malice in every ſentence, as if they had been wrot in dog-dayes? <hi>Michael the Archangel</hi> would not ſpeak to the Devil <hi>in a railing accuſation, Ep. Jud.</hi> v. 9 Though <hi>Satan</hi> deſerved the worſt that could be ſaid, yet an <hi>Archangel</hi> was too good to utter ſuch filthineſs. Let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very reader enjoy his own judgment: for my part, I ſeldom expect Truth &amp; Argument in that book, where I find fury and diſtemper in the ſtyle. <hi>Antibi Mavors ventosâ in linguâ</hi>? And who is there of a candide, and a clean ſoul, that will not ſooner be gained with the coolneſs of Charity, than with the heat of Rage? Therefore as much as in us lies, let there be no jarrs, no diverſities among us: be peaceable in our Civil, peaceable in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious profeſſion. But if ſundry ſhapes and appearances of reaſon will not ſuffer us all to enjoy the ſame knowledg, and the ſame conſcience, yet let us diſſent as Brethren, not as Enemies Avoid theſe <hi>paroxyſms, and ſharp contentions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I am</hi> ready now for the fourth point: and I think my Hearers expect it with ſome attention. Having acquainted you that <hi>Paul</hi>

and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did diſagree, &amp; not ſimply ſo, but with ſome eagerneſs and provocation, might not a ſolid judgement ſuſpect, that ſome great offence had thruſt it ſelf in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them? You ſhall find it otherwiſe, that the <hi>contention</hi> was in no weighty cauſe, it toucht not the life of truth, or the honor of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the verſe before my Text will tell you all in the beginning of it, <hi>Paul thought it not good to take Mark with him.</hi> And our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation gives it more than is due to it, as I conceive. We ſay that <hi>Paul thought it not good,</hi> as if it were a matter of good or evil. Much better thus, as I apprehend, <hi>Paul thought it not fit. Paulus haud ae quum cenſebat,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> very aptly. <hi>Paul thought it not meet,</hi> as it is in one of our Engliſh Tranſlations. It was not what was <hi>good,</hi> for it was <hi>good</hi> either way, but what was more <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>meet</hi> that made the controverſie.

little daunted, when he was in jeopardy of his life. But give him his due, he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Faith, but retired home for fear of the worlds anger. He had not forſaken <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ô nothing leſs, but intermitted the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his vocation. Yet he defended not this fault, but repented, and bewayled it. Now he would fain begin a freſh: for he felt himſelf by the grace of God more ſtrong and reſolute than ever, and offered himſelf couragiouſly to endure all ſtorms and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts for the glory of <hi>Christ.</hi> Should not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence be ſhewn to his unſeigned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? Is it not often ſeen, that ſuch as fly from their colours return again, and ſight it out valiantly? Was not <hi>Peter,</hi> that had deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Maſter, reſtored to his <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had <hi>wept bitterly? Paul</hi> himſelf had been a perſecutor, &amp; <hi>yet obteined grace.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with it, that <hi>Mary,</hi> the mother of this <hi>Mark,</hi> had ſpared her Houſe to receive the Apoſtles, in the hotteſt times of <hi>Herods</hi> rage, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 12. Surely the ſon of ſo good a mother deſerved ſome mildneſs and benign favour from the <hi>Preſidents of the Church.</hi> And what was more proper to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> than to reconcile offenders that had gon aſtray?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:114920:16"/>Theſe reaſons prevailing not with <hi>Paul,</hi> you may imagine with me, if you pleaſe, that his ſentence was to this purpoſe. That they are worthy of great reproof, that make execuſes, and follow not <hi>Chriſt, when he calls them.</hi> What do they deſerve, that are recreants after their calling, and leave their ſtation, when they have taken up <hi>Christs Croſs,</hi> with Covenant to follow him? The young Diſciple had give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> up his liberty to follow his <hi>Master</hi>: and was no longer his own, no more than a wife can leave her husband, or a ſon his father. And <hi>he that loves his life more than Chriſt, is not worthy of him. Mark</hi> could fore-ſee well enough, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions to come would be farr greater than the former: if he could not endure light ones, he would utterly ſink under thoſe of the latter growth. His repentance was good, that is, it was profitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but to be repulſed for his levity, would be more profitable to others, by the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the example. Or if he were not thruſt quite into the order of the Plebians, yet let him be reſtored to his function after a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time of probation. An eaſie pardon would flatter him in his fault: this repulſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114920:16"/>
would make him know the magnitude of his ſin. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay for himſelf, that he was never ſtreightned in his bowels, but was full of pitty to <hi>Oneſimus the fugitive ſervant</hi>; to the <hi>inceſtuous Corinthian</hi>; and who was't but he, that went ſo far, <hi>that he wiſht to be anathema for his brethren</hi>? Yet Favour muſt give place to Juſtice A <hi>Biſhop</hi> muſt act the part both of a <hi>Father</hi> and a <hi>Mother</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> in tenderneſs he muſt be a <hi>Mother,</hi> but a <hi>Father</hi> in diſcipline. <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſpake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately for a kinſman, but he ſpake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially for the cauſe of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the whole ſtate of their oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as I can deviſe it in a form of pleading. The odds between them do not lye in any point of doctrine: for the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of immediate inſpiration of Truth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd by <hi>Gods grace</hi> to their <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi>; then they could not diſſent in a cauſe of Faith. The ſtrife was no more but whether <hi>Mark</hi> was fit at that time to be their fellow labourer. And why might not <hi>Paul</hi> have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a little of his rigour to have gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Barnabas</hi>? And why not <hi>Barnabas</hi> have taken the denial friendly to content <hi>Paul</hi>? Sacrifice <hi>ſmall and indifferent things</hi> to the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114920:17"/>
fruition of peace. To hold faſt to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions in <hi>petty matters</hi> with all the ſtrength of our will and wit, is not conſtancy, but a worſe thing.</p>
            <p>You would hear from me now perhaps, which of theſe two upheld the better cauſe. <hi>Non noſtrum inter vos &amp;c.</hi> It is not ſit for my meanneſs to make my ſelf a <hi>Judg</hi> between ſuch <hi>famous Apoſtles.</hi> This I will ſay with ſubmiſſion, that <hi>Pauls</hi> proceedings were grounded upon <hi>Juſtice and diſcipline: Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> his motion was grounded upon <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and humanity.</hi> Many of the wiſer ſort, I think, will vote with <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of men will vote with <hi>Barnabas</hi> But the ſpirit of <hi>Moſes and Elias</hi> are both good: the Ark conteined both <hi>Aarons Rod,</hi> &amp; the <hi>delicious pot of Manna.</hi> Sometimes the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſeem to favour <hi>Barnabas,</hi> which bid us <hi>bind up the broken in heart,</hi> &amp; not <hi>to break the bruiſed reed.</hi> Again, they ſeem to favour <hi>Paul,</hi> when they charge us to <hi>remove away all ſcandals,</hi> and <hi>them that ſin rebuke before all, that others alſo may fear,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 20.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Scripturae non pugnant,</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> diſſent, there is no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Scriptures. For they bid us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114920:17"/>
and retain ſins, bind &amp; looſe ſinners, as a prudent man ſhall judg upon the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of actions. But it is an heavy thing for that <hi>Church,</hi> where the <hi>Fathers</hi> of it can neither <hi>bind nor looſe,</hi> neither do the work <hi>of Paul nor Barnabas.</hi> But <hi>Noverint univerſi,</hi> the <hi>power of the keyes</hi> is inherent in their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>in actu primo</hi>; and can no more be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from it, than light from the Sun, or moiſture from the water of the Seas. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>in actu exercito</hi> it may be qualified in the practice of it.</p>
            <p>I return to the point that's under my hand: are there any other circumſtances to ſway our judgment in it? ſome, but of no great force. As that ſuch as were preſent at this <hi>contention</hi> may ſeem to incline to <hi>Paul.</hi> For after this, <hi>Barnabas,</hi> like a Hen with one Chicken, went into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> without any more company than <hi>Mark,</hi> that we read. But the Brethren, plurally, all of them <hi>did commend Paul to the grace of God.</hi> And what ſhall we think of this paſſage, that from this time the Scripture records all the travails of <hi>Paul</hi> exactly till he came to <hi>Rome</hi>: but after this, the ſtory of <hi>Barnabas</hi> his jornalls is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in ſilence for ever?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:114920:18"/>To counterpoiſe this a little, I will allege <hi>Paul</hi> againſt himſelf, and draw enough from his own pen, to ſhew that <hi>Mark</hi> did blot out the ſtain of his former levity with the high praiſe of the <hi>great Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.11. <hi>Take Mark, and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the miniſtery.</hi> This was not long before <hi>Paul</hi> died. The other quotation is in an Epiſtle written from <hi>Rome,</hi> a good while after this <hi>ſharp bickering,</hi> coloſ. 4. 10. There he offers them the ſalutations of <hi>Mark,</hi> and adds, <hi>Touching whom ye have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Commandement, if he come unto you receive him.</hi> May we not inferr from hence, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> was not altogether in the wrong, though <hi>Paul</hi> would not hear of it at firſt, ſince twice, in the dayes following, he ſet ſuch a precious value upon <hi>Mark</hi>?</p>
            <p>Let me put in but to one ſcrutinie more, and ſtay upon it in the cloze. Which of theſe two hath the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> obſerv'd in it's practice from age to age? Truly the moſt antient, that is, the beſt times of it, were as ſevere as <hi>Paul.</hi> For if a Clergy-man ſhrunk in the wetting, as we ſay, either he was thruſt down to a <hi>Laical communion,</hi> or chaſtned with a penance of many years: the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114920:18"/>
               <hi>Canons of the oldeſt Concils</hi> are full of this. But the middle, and latter times of the Church have been as remiſs as <hi>Barnabas.</hi> For the longer we know evils, they are the more familiar to us; and the more familiar they grow, the leſs they are corrected. Further than this I will not, I dare not go, to make a preciſe deciſion, which of theſe two had the fairer end of the quarel. Let them ſtand, or fall to their own Maſter, by whom they ſhall be judged. But our judgment may be clearly convinced againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both, that their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence fell upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch an object, ſo mean, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, in reſpect of peace, that it did little deſerve a <hi>ſharp contention,</hi> but leaſt of all to extend unto this acrimony, that they ſhould <hi>depart aſunder the one from the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is</hi> the laſt point, &amp; the ſaddeſt word of the Text, this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>departing aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> To come even with the time, I will fall preſently upon the uſe. Firſt, this is utterly againſt our Savious rule, <hi>Go and be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to thy brother,</hi> Math. 5.24. A wound will never be healed, but by drawing the parts together that were diſſolved. <hi>Eſau</hi> &amp; <hi>jacob, Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> the remoter diſtance they kept, the further they were from pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114920:19"/>
as ſoon as ever they met, they melted, &amp; embraced. Affability and ſweet conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation ſtrikes fire out of a flint. But disjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons is an eclypſe of friendſhip, till the light of one doth ſhine with a propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſpect upon the other. Seek for Charity, &amp; purſue it. Go home, and offer thy ſelf to thoſe whom thou haſt offended. Though there be no hoſtility in your heart, yet you can not call it a reconciliation of love, if you eſtrange your preſence from your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
            <p>I know that in the caſe of theſe <hi>two Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> though they were prevented with an error, yet ſhortly after their unkind fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, they return'd to their <hi>Chriſtian temper,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>ſundry Texts of Scripture Paul</hi> did put himſelf in the ſame ſcale with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as with his ſworn brother, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. <hi>I only, and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working</hi>? and Gal. 2. 9. <hi>James, Cephas, and John, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowſhip.</hi> This is a great evidence of their redintegration, the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> mediating this in ſecret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſouls in their abſence. But I ſtick to my Doctrine, that this was not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114920:19"/>
the <hi>Kings high way,</hi> the ordinary, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road to attonement, to keep aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. It is <hi>God</hi> that <hi>maketh men to be of one mind, and to dwell in an houſe,</hi> ſaies the Pſalm. It is not by diſſevering, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming under one roof, that begets Unity. Make the contract <hi>Per verba de praeſenti,</hi> and then it is indiſſoluble</p>
            <p>Here is another thing worthy our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. They that are the kindle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coales, and divide others, many times draw both parts againſt themſelves. Satan followed his old rule here, <hi>Divide &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera,</hi> divide both, and maſter both, ô he propounded ſome great victory to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, it <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> would break a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder. It was effected: but what got he? Both turned againſt his Kingdom. For by taking ſeveral journeys, they communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Goſpel twice as farr, as they could have done in one company: as ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corn ſerves beſt for the uſe of man, when it is ſcatter'd abroad. If <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had both gon to <hi>Cilicia, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> had wanted them: or if both had gone to <hi>Cyprus, Cilicia</hi> had wanted them. Now they were ſingled, they propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114920:20"/>
the Faith of <hi>Christ</hi> both by Sea and Land. <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſailed into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> journied into <hi>Cilicia.</hi> This was not like a Bowes-ſtring ſnapt aſunder; but they were two ſtrings to one Bow: and that which was <hi>diviſion</hi> to themſelves, was <hi>multiplication</hi> to the Goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, they performed what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, to <hi>viſit their brethren in every City, where they had preached the word of God,</hi> Verſe 32. of this Chap. All go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, in all ages, have approved this to be the beſt: way to conſerve U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Not that every City, much leſſe every Conventicle, ſhould be entire within it ſelf, and acknowledg no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over it. As if every Pariſh ſhould be like a ſeveral Hand, divided from the continent. Such a government can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſhewn in any Civile Policy, ſince the World began. And I could never learn, why ſpiritual Adminiſtrations ſhould not be knit together in as good rank, and ſubordination, as temporal, It is impoſſible to avoid a multitude of corruptions in Faith, and not to contract a prodigious licentiouſneſſe in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114920:20"/>
Diſcipline, where the part, <hi>againſt nature,</hi> ſhall not depend upon the whole: where the <hi>part</hi> ſhall have no correſpondence or communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>with the whole,</hi> but upon ſufferance, and courteſie. Then the whole <hi>Church</hi> ſhall be nothing elſe but a geat Schiſm, and yet no man ſhall be convinced to be a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique. But to prevent ſuch confuſion, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſuperviſed the ſeveral Cities where they had laid the foundation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Faith; and, like careful Rulers, interpoſed the power with which <hi>Christ</hi> had endewed them, to keep their Brethren diſperſed far and wide <hi>in one.</hi> Though they <hi>were two</hi> upon a ſmall diſguſt, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred there was but <hi>one Shephard, and one Sheepfold,</hi> whoſe peace they ſtudied to preſerve by their paſtoral vigilancy.</p>
            <p>I have done, and am at ſhore. You ſhall ſtay but a minute or two for your landing. It is to give my reaſon in ſhort, why I have preacht to day upon this Subject. It is well known, from the time of the <hi>Firſt Nicen-Council,</hi> that <hi>Biſhops</hi> were to hold <hi>Synods</hi> twice a year.
