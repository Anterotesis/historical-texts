            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You know also, that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, not inconsistent with these Sacred Things, may yet fall short, or lay no good Foundation for the Proof of them. I shou'd be very willing to be convinc'd that the <hi>Principles of Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> as you have represented them in your ingenious Essay, are not of this Nature. I know they are not so intentionally; but according to the best Improvements that I can make of them, I do not find that they will reach so far, as to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49228:3"/>
give us a firm and full Basis for Morality, the certainty of <hi>Reveal'd Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Immortality of the Soul</hi> of Man. I say, I do not find: for it does not follow from thence, that the learned Author cannot make better Deductions from them than I can, and extend them farther, and with more Force. I know, and see by daily Experience, that a Person that hath a particular Genius and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for such and such Principles, or such an Art or Science, can carry it farther than another that has not that Talent. If I had all the Tools and Materials fit for making a good Watch, I cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

My Intention, at present, is only to be informed how far all the Principles of that ingenious Essay taken together, will give us a sure Foundation for; <hi>Morality, Revealed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and a <hi>future Life.</hi> As to Morality, we thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I allow that you may infer from Observation and Reason, that such a Distinction is useful to Society and Governments: but so the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians say, and that this is the only Bottom of Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Religion. Both Divines and Philosophers, you know, make a more immutable and intrinsick Distinction, which is that I cannot make out from your Principles. If this Distinction be a Delusion to us, 'tis such a one as I cannot help or disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: This I am sure of, that the Distinction, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Gratitude and Ingratitude, Fidelity and Infidelity, Justice and Injustice, and such others, is as sudden without any Ratiocination, and as sensible and piercing, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But I will leave this to your farther Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: And you having signified, in several parts<note place="margin">Pag. 294. §. 16.</note> of your Treatise, that you think <hi>Morality</hi> as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Demonstration, as Mathematicks; this gives<note place="margin">Pag. 314. §. 18.</note> me reason to suspect that it is not the deficiency<note place="margin">Pag. 369 §. 8.</note> of your Principles, but my own short-sightedness, that makes me at a loss, how to discern that Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or make out that Demonstration, from your Grounds.</p>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ll us, nor any reflection upon their Idea's. You will say possibly, that Miracles and the completion of Prophesies, are sensible Effects which accompany the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and from these we infer that the Author of them and it, is powerful and knowing. I allow the Inference so far as it goes, but how do we know from these Effects, That Being to be Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49228:4"/>
as well as Powerful and Knowing? I mean Veracious in all things propos'd to us in this way, and in all the Parts and Promises of the Revelation.</p>
            <p>To consider and propose this Matter more at large, 'Tis not enough (as I judge) for our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and to establish the certainty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, that we know the Physical or Metaphysical Attributes of the Divine Nature: we must also know its Moral Attributes, as I may so call them; such as Goodness, Justice, Holiness, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Veracity. Now, these I am not able to deduce or make out from your Principles. You have prov'd very well an Eternal, All-powerful, and All-knowing-Being: but how this supreme Being will treat us, we cannot be assur'd from these Attributes. If you say we know that by Revelation, then the Question returns, How do we know the Truth of that Revelation? We must not take it from the Report of that Revelation it self, for then we argue in a Circle: And it must be collected from some other Attributes, than the bare Power and Knowledge of the Revealer.</p>
            <p>If you say Veracity is a Perfection, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently must belong to the Nature of God: I think so too according to my Principles: but I do not find that you make use of that Argument, nor do I remember, amongst those many Idea's and Significations of Words, which you have sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defin'd, that you have any where told us what <hi>Perfection</hi> is; what its Idea or Definition. If it be from this Head that you wou'd deduce
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49228:5"/>
the Veracity of God, 'tis necessary you shou'd tell us what is to be understood by <hi>Perfection</hi> in your Way: how it is deriv'd from the Senses, and how it includes Veracity.</p>
            <p>Where you mention the perfections of God, you take no Notice of Veracity. And in that long Catalogue of Idea's, you have given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, I do not perceive, as I said before, that you have any where told us what is the Idea of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, what it contains, or how it is formed: though it be a Name and Notion generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and of more Importance than many of those Idea's you have so curiously anatomiz'd. And to add that in the last place, not only the Truth of Revelation, but also of our Faculties in other Things, depends upon the Varacity of their Author.</p>
            <p>The Immortality of the Soul, was a third Thing which I cou'd not clear to my self, upon your Principles. You suppose that the Soul may<note place="margin">

                  </gap>
               </note> two Suppositions, I cou'd not make out any certain proof of the immortality of the Soul, and am apt to think it cannot be done.</p>
            <p>As to the First: I wonder how you can observe that your Soul sometimes does not think; for when you do observe it, you think. If a man cou'd think and not think at the same time, he might
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49228:5"/>
be able to make this Observation. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that be, I do not understand how the Soul, if she be at any time utterly without Thoughts, what it is that produces the first Thought again, at the end of that unthinking Interval. You say Matter cannot produce a Thought; and you say an unthinking Substance cannot produce a Thought: and I know nothing in (unthinking) Man, but one of these two. What is it then that lights the Candle again, when it is put out? Besides, I am utterly at a loss how to frame any Idea of a dead Soul, or of a Spirit without Life, or Thoughts. What is the Soul when she does not think? what Idea or Definition can you give of her in that State? she must be actually something if she exist. She must then have some Properties whereby she may be defin'd of describ'd; something whereby she is distinguish'd from Nothing, and from Matter. Then after all, What Security can we have upon this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, that we shall not fall into this Sleep at Death? and so continue without Life or Thought? And bare being is but the immortality of a senceless Stone. You think also which is more surprising, that Angels sleep by fits. If Angels have Bodies, there may <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>retence for this: but if they have no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">

               </gap> can have no Fumes or Vapors that cause Sleep, nor any wast of Spirits to be recrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Besides, according to your Opinion we know nothing of Angels but by Revelation, and where does that Revelation tell you that these active Spirits sleep or slumber? or dream, as you and I do sometimes. And after all, the common Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty still returns; How they awake, and how

they pass from their unthinking State, to a thinking State again; which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>But there is still a farther Doubt or Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in this Case, even as to the Nature of God and his Immateriality. I'm afraid the Materia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists will profit too much from that Notion or Concession, that Matter may think: For, say they, if Matter be capable of thinking, it may have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49228:8"/>
Will and Understanding, and any other Faculty of a thinking Substance, and in any Degree of spiritual Perfection, and consequently may be God; at least we have a fair Chance for it; what it is capable of, it may have fatally, or it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for any thing we know; there being no Contradiction in the Case. You seem to think that Matter is as truly capable of Cogitation, as of Notion: and if one be connate, as we think it may be, the other may be so also.</p>
            <p>They will further argue with you thus. You say you have no Idea of the Substance of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor know what Properties may flow from it: you do not know then, whether it includes Cogitation, or excludes it? So we have, say they, <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> a fair Chance for it, seeing you acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we have no Idea of the Substance of Matter that excludes Cogitation, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the supreme Cogitant-Being may be Matter, for any thing we know.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, as you seem to acknowledge that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>our Proof of the Immateriality of the Soul, does <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> no higher than Probability; so I'm afraid your Proof of the Immateriality of God, or any Proof that can be deduc'd from your prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, will rise no higher than Probability. Tho' I think you some where say, that you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated that <hi>God is immaterial.</hi> I heartily wish it, and that the Doubts I have suggested on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to provoke a clearer Proof, may be effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfy'd.</p>
