            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DEFENCE OF THE <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> Againſt the Anſwer to his Book, And the Reply to his Letter.</head>
            <byline>By the Author of the late Conſiderations.</byline>
            <p>I Remember at the time when Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Hyde</hi> was at his heigth at <hi>Court,</hi> a Poor Woman who got her Living by a piece of Ground which her Old Husband uſed to Digg, carrying her Garden-ſtuff one day to Market, and not Selling it, comes Home exclaiming, that ſhe could not Sell her <hi>Beans</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95998:2"/>
               <hi>Cabbages;</hi> and ſhould never have any good Market any more, ſo long as that filthy <hi>Hyde</hi> was Chancellor.</p>
            <p>I know not the AUTHOR (whoſoever he be) of the Diſcourſe which came out for an ANSWER to His Grace the DUKE of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; but the Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Gentleman has really, as to the main point of his anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of that Generous DUKE (when the reſt is Impertinence) the force only (and prejudice) of what was ſaid by this Woman.</p>
            <p>There are ſome in the Nation that have been, and that are for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience;</hi> ſome that have been, and that are of the Wiſeſt of the Nation (ſuch as my Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> and my Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales)</hi> who have ſhewn their Minds ſtill againſt the Stiffneſs of theſe Church-Men, who never would be got, when time was, to condeſcend in leſſer
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95998:2"/>
things for the ſake of greater. And there comes this <hi>Gentleman</hi> now, and he Argues, That therefore all the <hi>Plots,</hi> all the <hi>Rebellions,</hi> all the <hi>Evils</hi> that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> muſt be Imputed to ſuch Men, and ſuch Principles.</p>
            <p>The Argument really is the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Woman: <hi>Socrate ambulante fulguravit. Socrates</hi> going abroad, it Lightened; This Lightning did a great deal of hurt; Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> muſt be ſent to <hi>Newgate:</hi> Therefore <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> muſt be put to Death. I deny the Argument.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Fanaticks</hi> (ſay theſe <hi>Diſputers)</hi> are unquiet; Therefore they muſt be <hi>Proſecuted.</hi> I ſay, <hi>No;</hi> but therefore give them <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> and they will be unquiet no more. A Carrier had two Horſes, one of them being Galled through the negligence of his Man, the Man unknown to his Maſter
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95998:3"/>
gets the Saddle fitted to his back, and all is well: One day a New Hoſtler, perceiving nothing, puts on the falſe Saddle; The Horſe going out, Winch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and caſts off his Pack. The Maſter being enraged, falls a beating the <hi>Horſe;</hi> but the Man that underſtood the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, does but change only the Saddles, and both the Horſes go quietly along.</p>
            <p>I will appeal to any Man of <hi>Senſe,</hi> though of never ſo little <hi>Reaſon,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eaſe, Happineſs,</hi> and <hi>Plenty</hi> are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt to make People Turbulent, or <hi>Oppreſsion?</hi> Take off the thing that pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, take off Proſecution, do but change the Saddles, and ſet them both aright, and ſee then whether the <hi>Church-men</hi> or the <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> and <hi>Catholicks</hi> will be moſt Governable. Let this King give that Liberty which his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors refuſed, and you ſhall ſee whether this King will not be beloved above all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95998:3"/>
that went before Him. I pray go over to <hi>Holland,</hi> go any where elſe, where Liberty is granted, and ſee, if People Rebel in ſuch Places. I am aſhamed, that Men ſhould have need of Spectacles to ſee the Sun!</p>
            <p>There are ſome, I know, upon the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi>'s ſending out theſe Papers, have aſperſed him for another <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> as if he would make himſelf Head of the Fanaticks: There are others apt to cry out, He is undermining the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> and deſigns <hi>Popery:</hi> But as I know that my own ſelf do deſign nothing but the Publick Benefit, ſo do I judge of his Graces undertaking: That is, as the undertaking of a Perſon over whom a great Reaſon, and the Love of his Countrey does predominate, with Indifferency to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95998:4"/>
the Church-men, the Fanaticks, and alſo thoſe of the Romiſh Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, The attempt of the Duke at this time for <hi>Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> looks to me to proceed from ſuch a Spirit as the Enterprizes of <hi>Dion, Epaminondas, Timoleon,</hi> and ſuch like, who were Liberators of their Countrey: In compariſon of whom, the Conqueſts of <hi>Caeſar, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Pyrrbus,</hi> who ſought themſelves and their own Greatneſs, were but Spoil and Latrociny. The Papers Writ againſt him, the Duke himſelf hath thought fit to take Notice of in a Letter, which Letter having one thing in it that is enough to make him Print it, [to wit, <hi>The Explanation of the Kings Promiſe]</hi> the reſt of it I count comes to this Signification,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95998:4"/>
That the Author is by no means to be made his Grace's Match, but to be left to others: Unto whom alſo, one of them being come out already, I'le leave him.</p>
            <p>Neither, indeed, is the Field here proper for his Grace to Deſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; it being the Parliament Houſe only, which is the fit place; where this cauſe is to be Fought, where he will meet with his Equals, and where we ſhall know who ſhall carry it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Replyer</hi> to the Dukes Letter, who Inſiſts only upon the ſame thing, which the <hi>Anſwerer</hi> does, the <hi>Diſtractions, Miſeries, Regicide,</hi> in the late Times, and therefore the <hi>Government</hi> muſt <hi>Fence againſt them</hi> by denial of <hi>Toleration,</hi> I muſt add (this being nothing ſtill but the Fallacy <hi>non cauſae pro cauſa</hi> before) that, As
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95998:5"/>
the <hi>Anſwer</hi> is not worthy the pains of the Duke, ſo the <hi>Reply</hi> does require no Body's. Although indeed, in the Paper of <hi>Conſiderations moving to a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration,</hi> come out ſince both, there is one little Parentheſis, <hi>viz. [Stated Rightly, that is, of All, ſo far as they are Tolerable, whereof the Wiſdom of a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament is the fitteſt Judge]</hi> does Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupate all Objections, and ſtops the Throat of this Flap-Mouth Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
