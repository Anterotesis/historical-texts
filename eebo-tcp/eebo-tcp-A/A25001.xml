            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT of the coming up of <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl <hi>of DANBY,</hi> from the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> on
<date>Saturday the 27. of <hi>May,</hi> 1682.</date>
            </head>
            <p>AN <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> having been granted on <hi>Friday</hi> the 26 of <hi>May,</hi> 1682. for the bringing up the Right Honourable <hi>Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> at <hi>Weſtminster</hi>; His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower,</hi> &amp;c. accordingly brought up the next day, being the 27th, where the Warrant or other Inſtrument of his Commitment being read.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> (who was of his Lordſhips Council) directing himſelf to the Lord Chief Juſtice, reminded the Court of the time when he was laſt brought up by <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and what was by his Lordſhip and his Council then deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That he might be bayled: And that albeit what was then offered by his Lordſhip, or his Council, the Court did not think fit to grant it at that time; yet that at the Concluſion, his Lordſhip ſaid, that they would take it into farther Conſideration; And that after ſo long a ſpace, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> was come up to hear what the Determination of the Court was upon ſuch their Conſideration, (or Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> uſed words to this effect.)</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Pemberton</hi> Replyed, ſaying, You muſt remember, Mr. <hi>Saunders,</hi> we did not take time to conſider of it, we told my Lord of <hi>Danby</hi> we could not Bail him; you muſt neceſſarily know that we had given our Opinion in it then.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Saunders</hi> then ſaid, he begg'd his Lordſhip pardon, if he had miſtaken his Lordſhip, but that he muſt confeſs he had underſtood his Lordſhip ſo at that time.</p>
            <p>Then the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> himſelf began, and continued a Diſcourſe for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours, (without being interrupted) the ſubſtance of the moſt remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable paſſages whereof, take as followeth.</p>
            <p>Directing himſelf to the Lord Chief Juſtice, his Lordſhip firſt ſaid, he met with an objection he did not expect, and that he muſt aſſert what his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had ſaid to be true, as to his Lordſhip (with his own mouth) having ſaid, that they would take time to conſider of his Caſe till the next Term; and that he did appeal therein, both to the reſt of the Judges themſelves, and to all who were then preſent in Court, and that at his going away the laſt time from that Court, he had given his Lordſhip thanks, as then underſtanding they would take his Affair into farther conſideration.</p>
            <p>He ſaid that he would not give his Lordſhip the trouble that now he did, but that he thought it the caſe of every man of <hi>England,</hi> and that not only the Right of a Peer, but every Engliſh man was concerned.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip gave ſome Reaſons why he had not come ſooner up to hear the Reſult of their Conſideration, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the next Term after he had been there, an Indictment was preferred againſt him for the blackeſt of Crimes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of having a hand in the Death of Sir <hi>Edmundbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> in which caſe he wondred that any Engliſh Jury (and ſome of them Gentlemen) could believe an Iriſh Papiſt againſt an Engliſh Proteſtant, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50859:3"/>
ſepecially an Iriſh Papiſt, who was upon Tryal for his own life, and whoſe Evidence (if it had been true) was but an hear ſay only. But that that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was much abated, ſince he heard that the Foreman of that Jury had been as ready to acquit another of a Murder, as to find him guilty that was Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip inſtanced in the trouble of Conſcience, which poſſeſt that wretch who Swore it againſt him (meaning <hi>Fitzharris</hi>) That he ſent a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to beg his pardon, and could not go to his Grave in peace, until he had obtained it.</p>
            <p>That before that perſon dyed, he confeſſed that he had Sworn falſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Lordſhip, and he named ſome other men who had put him upon it, and whether it did proceed from any guilt of thoſe perſons, who might fear they were diſcovered, or from what other cauſe, his Lordſhip could not tell. But that he was informed there were perſons yet tampering, to ſee how they could procure ſome Evidence, which might yet revive ſomething of the ſame kind ſtill againſt him.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, he was in hopes, that Malice which had hitherto proſecuted him, would at length have been at an end; but he found that whilſt he was kept under this confinement, he was always to be the object of their Malice and forged Inventions.</p>
            <p>He inſtanced not only in his long Impriſonment, but in the many Attempts that had been almoſt every week, for almoſt two years to inſnare him; and particularly he named one <hi>Mackrath,</hi> another Iriſh Papiſt, who under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of doing him a favour, would have made him a Tool to have promoted their fallacy, That Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> killed himſelf, but that he had the good fortune preſently to detect that villany, as he hoped he ſhould yet live to do of ſome others.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe, that he had afterwards omitted coming up, upon ſome proſpect there was at one time of a Parliament, before which he deſired rather to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, could he ſee any hopes of one in any reaſonable time.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, his Caſe had ſuch Circumſtances, that made it differ from all other Caſes; That he was Accuſed and Committed without any Oath or Affidavit made againſt him for any one Crime. That the Popiſh Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi> were under other Circumſtances, Oaths having been made againſt them of the Blackeſt Crimes; (how regularly he did not inquire.) That there was not a Caſe but his, in which there was not ſome Affidavit made.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip made ſome recital, with what difficulty the Houſe of Commons raiſed his Crime to the name of Treaſon, of the Opinion of Sir <hi>William Jones</hi> againſt it; but that at length they gave it the Title of Treaſon, upon a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Long Robes ſaying, that elſe it would dwindle to nothing in the Houſe of Peers.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip inſtanced in the Kings Pardon, which he then produced in Court, and demanded the benefit of it, and which His Majeſty had been graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly pleaſed to declare to both Houſes of Parliament; not only of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but of his Innocency, and that he would grant him his Pardon ten times over, if this was defective either in matter or form. Alſo, that His Majeſty had declared it in a particular Speech, the ſame having been Printed and Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by Authority throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That he had not only been thus Committed, and thus detained for above for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Months, but that for the moſt part of this time, there had been no manner of Proſecution; That if the Parliament had ſat ſix days longer, he had either been acquitted or Bailed; and that inſtead of being in Cuſtody, he had been really puniſhed before any Crime was committed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:50859:3"/>His Lordſhip inſtanced in great loſſes (even of life) which had been in his Family, which had he been at liberty had in all probability been prevented.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip quoted ſeveral Caſes, and how each ſucceſſively had been made a preſident to the other.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Tertio Carolo,</hi> and <hi>Melvins</hi> 1 <hi>Car.</hi> and Sir <hi>Tho. Darnells.</hi>
               </note> That he had his Majeſties conſent to be Bailed, directing himſelf to Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> who thereupon ſtood up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Court, that his Majeſty was willing his Lordſhip ſhould be Bailed, if the Court thought it could be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip further ſaid, his Majeſties conſent had now a ſecond time been declared in that Court, he deſired the Judges would anſwer him, why the Kings Priſoner ſhould be kept in the Kings Priſon by the Kings Court againſt the Kings will; that it was neither better nor worſe but a plain failure of Juſtice, if a Peer Committed by the Houſe of Lords muſt be kept a Priſoner till Diſcharged by the Houſe of Lords; for whom the Lords made a Priſoner, was in effect the Kings Priſoner, for that the Lords cannot ſit, but when the King will have them ſit, nor ſit any longer than he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip then deſired to read ſome written Papers, (which as I conceive was a Collection of the opinions of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook,</hi> and others in ſuch caſes) from which he made ſeveral inferences, and concluding them, ſaid, theſe were the words of the Law, beſides the Sence of very great Judges.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip then produced ſeveral papers taken out of the Lords Journall, particularly one bearing date 23 <hi>December</hi> 78, when the Queſtion was put, whether the Lord Treaſurer ſhould then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw? and carried in the Negative, and on the 27<hi>th</hi> of the ſame Month, the queſtion put, whither upon the Impeachment brought from the Houſe of Commons, the Lord Treaſurer ſhould be Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and carried in the Negative; and that then it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Judges whether they can Bail any perſon in caſe of Miſpriſion of Treaſon, wherein the Kings life is concerned.</p>
            <p>To which the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Scroggs,</hi> and the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>North,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Jones,</hi> and three other Judges, gave ſeverally their opinions, that the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> may take Bail for High Treaſon of any kind, if they ſee cauſe.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip made uſe of Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Arguments of Law for gaining the right of liberty to the Subject: He ſaid, if a man was rightfully Impriſoned, yet the Law intended his Impriſonment no longer than was neceſſary for his being brought to Tryal, and that the Law had provided a remedy for all men by ſome ordinary Court of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip named ſome Judges in former times, who at the end or diſſolution of a Parliament were requeſted to Bail men, and that thoſe Judges ſaid, they muſt firſt know the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure therein which they looked upon then to be principall neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50859:4"/>His Lordſhip ſaid, that it was evident that he was a Priſoner at the Kings will and pleaſure, and no bodies elſe.</p>
            <p>Upon ſome foregoing words (which I omitted to take.)</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip took occaſion to ſay, that the King alone cannot alter a Law, nor that either Houſe of Parliament alone could not: Nay, that the King and one Houſe alone could not, and that he was well ſatisfied the King and both Houſes would never alter any Law made for the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip inſtanced ſomething concerning the Kings Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath, and how he was thereby obliged to do Juſtice to his Subjects at all times, without ſtaying for the Aſſiſtance of any extraordinary Court; and that he had appointed his Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> as a conſtant place for all his Subjects to reſort to for Juſtice.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip made uſe of ſome of the ſayings of the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> concerning the Houſe of Lords, one whereof was, that he would always have reverence to that ſupreme Court, but yet he ſuppoſed that ſupreme Court would deſire them to do nothing but what was according to Law, and therefore he did grant execution upon a Writ of Error, notwithſtanding that the ſame was then depending in Parliament.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſaid. he ſaw no reaſon why a bare Impeachment of the Houſe of Commons ſhould keep a man all his life time within four walls, when the Order of the Lords was not underſtood, to reſtrain them from proceeding on Writts of Error, and Appeals depending in Parliament, which were as ſtrictly comprehended within the words of the ſame Order. And his Lordſhip ſaid, he could not underſtand how any Court could take upon them to ſplit the Lords Order, ſo as to ſay which part thereof ſhould be binding and which not: His Lordſhip urging to be Bayled, only that he might appeal to the Parliament, his deſire being that there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings might be kept intire.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip made a queſtion, whether another Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (which might conſiſt of new Members) would Impeach him <hi>de novo,</hi> or indeed whether if that Parliament that did Impeach him, had ſat any time; they would have Proſecuted the ſame things, being at that time done in heates, his Commitment being by meer diſtemper of that juncture of time, and his Lordſhip cited a preſident of the Lord <hi>Mordent,</hi> who was Impeached in one Seſſion of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and after a Pardon procured, was never more queſtioned by the ſame Parliament.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip very often made uſe of <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; he craved leave to obſerve the Speech of a great man who was once in that Court upon his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> having likewiſe been Committed from the Lords Houſe, and it did appear they would have Bailed him, had it not been upon an Adjournment of Parliament, if it had been a Prorogation, he had been Bailed. He ſaid, that man was a great Peer (that he meant the Earl of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50859:4"/>
               <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>) had born great Offices in the Kingdom, and was allowed to be a very knowing man, which Lord had ſaid, that that Court ought to Judge an Act of Parliament void, if contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> much more an Order of Parliament. That in one part of that Speech, the ſame Nobleman ſaid, he did not think it a kindneſs to the Lords to be made abſolute and above the Law, as it muſt be if it be Adjudged that they may Commit a man to an Indefinite Impriſonment; and that the ſaid Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> further ſaid, in the ſame Speech, that the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> are the only proper Judges of thoſe things, and that if no relief is to be had there, nor no inferiour Court could relieve what will become of us.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> likewiſe ſaid, that in the worſt of times they ſtill had regard to Juſtice in theſe things, and particularly they mentioned, that in ſome of <hi>Bradſhaws</hi> proceedings, they would not admit Orders of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be of any force after the Diſſolutions of the ſaid Parliaments. And ſaid that he hoped we might have as much Juſtice now as in thoſe times.</p>
            <p>He ſaid he was ſorry he could not have Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> to argue the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validity of an Order of the Houſe of Lords, after the Diſſolution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he had done in thoſe times, in Sir <hi>John Stowels</hi> Caſe.</p>
            <p>That he would ask any Commoner in <hi>England,</hi> whether they would be willing the Lords ſhould have ſuch a power over all their liberties, as is now pretended they have, he ſaid he has been offered by ſome of thoſe very Lords that were for the ſaid order, to be his Bail.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, that this Court had power to Bail a man, and to Act in many things where they had not power to determine, and inſtanced in the Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Juſtice in <hi>Eyres</hi> Seat, and in the caſe of a Peer, bringing his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don before them, where they do allow that Pardon, yet had no power to try a Peer. He ſaid that exact preſidents were not to be expected in his caſe, for he believed there never was ſuch a caſe of any Engliſh-man before this caſe.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, he himſelf was at Council-Table, when the late Judge <hi>Atkins</hi> was complained of to the King and Council, for Bailing a man in the caſe of Murder; that Judge came and gave reaſons why he did it, and thoſe of the long Robe, in Council allowed thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as to the legal part. And at the ſame time, the ſaid Judge told the King that he had done greater things than that, for which he was complained of, for in his very laſt Circuit he had Bailed a man for High Treaſon, for which alſo he gave his own reaſons and they were allowed.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſumming up all, ſaid, that if the Court would not Bail him, he hoped they would prefix a time for his Impriſonment, or that he muſt needs look upon his Impriſonment to be indefinite, that it had been the opinion both of the Kings Attorney 3. <hi>Car.</hi> and of the Counſell for the Priſoner at the ſame time that where no danger could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by a mans being at liberty, he ought to be Bailed after long Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ſix months had been then accounted a long Impriſonment. That if he could not be relieved by this Court, he was certainly an indefinite Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:50859:5"/>He named the cauſe of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who was put in Chains firſt, and afterwards askt what he had done.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip did not compare his own caſe thereto, but ſaid he was accuſed without any Oath made againſt him, and that the Articles againſt him did not amount to Treaſon, had they been true. He repeated His Majeſties having declared his conſent a ſecond time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome other things which were particular to him and no man elſe, and a caſe that cryed loudly for Juſtice.</p>
            <p>He ſaid, he did think, that if Bail was denyed him under his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, every man of <hi>England</hi> was concerned, and ſaid he wiſht that the future conſequences of it may be duly conſidered.</p>
            <p>That this Court had power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it was apparent, that that Court, as alſo the Courts of Chancery and Exchequer, did relieve upon Appeales and Writs of Error, beſides that if he was Bailed, he was yet bound to appear before that extraordinary Court, when ever his Majeſty ſhould be pleaſed to call it, whereas in the other caſes there would be no further proceedings, unleſs they were revived by the Plaintiffs in Parliament.</p>
            <p>That whereas there might be ſome apprehenſions of the Lords diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in caſe he was Bailed, he was confident he could have the Major part of the Lords, who for their own ſakes would be content to be his Bail, and if ſo, it would take off the fear that they ſhould be offended thereat.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſaid he hoped he was before juſt Judges of the Laws.</p>
            <p>That what ever had been ſaid of him concerning Arbitrarineſs, he doubted not but it would upon due inquiry be found quite otherwiſe. That he prayed Juſtice, and left what he had ſaid to their conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice then ſpeaking, ſeemed to ſay, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> had reflected upon them, as if they had denyed him Juſtice in not hearing his Council.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> deſiring leave to interupt his Lordſhip, did acquit the Court of any ſuch Imputation, and ſaid, that it was not in that Court, but elſewhere, that his Council had been forbid to plead for him; which was alſo acknowledged by Mr. Juſtice <hi>Jones</hi> to be true.</p>
            <p>The Lord Chief Juſtice then proceeded and ſaid, that for his ſaying the greateſt part of the Lords would be his Bayl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That it was not the fear of another Court had any influence upon them, or that they ſhould do ſuch things as they feared to be called to account for, but that it was the doing of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>That they had heard his Lordſhip with a great deal of Patience, and were not ſenſeleſs of his Lordſhip's great ſufferings; that they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſenſible, that the Kings deſires were, that his Lordſhip ſhould have no longer Impriſonment than the Law requires; and that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that the King had done as much therein as lay in his power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50859:5"/>That it was not denied, becauſe that Court could not Bail for ſuch Crimes; neither would the Indictment found againſt him, about Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey</hi> have hindered, nor was the Order of the Lords that which hindered them, but that they were to act according to Law.</p>
            <p>But he prayed his Lordſhip to conſider that they could not relieve him according to Law. That he did agree to ſome things mentioned by his Lordſhip; and that it was a very hard caſe he ſhould lye ſo long in Priſon: but here was the miſery, they could only compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate him, for that his Lordſhip was Impriſoned by a higher Hand, and where they had no Power to Intermeddle.</p>
            <p>He inſtanced in Indictments for Treaſons, and ſeveral other great Caſes in which they could Bail Men, but in this Caſe the Supream Juriſdiction of the Nation had laid their Hands upon it, which was attended by the Houſe of Commons with an Impeachment.</p>
            <p>Whether their Lordſhips had Cauſe, or not Cauſe to Commit his Lordſhip, they could not inſpect, but that they ought to believe that his Lordſhip was juſtly Committed; and that their Lordſhips, in their mature deliberation, would do nothing unjuſtly. That over all the Courts in the Kingdom they had a Juriſdiction; (that only excepted) and as it would be very Incongruous for an Inferior Court to bail whom they had Committed, or to call in queſtion their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; ſo would it be in like manner for them to do in this Caſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lords exceed their Juriſdiction, and were above them. The Opinion of all the Judges in <hi>England,</hi> being likewiſe taken therein, and he was Impriſoned by too High a Court for them to Bail him. But that his Lordſhip was not indefinitely Impriſoned, as he alledged; for whenever His Majeſty pleaſed to call a Parliament, he will have remedy: That the King has power to do it when He pleaſes; and for His Peoples good no doubt He will, when He ſees fit; but that at ſome time the Circumſtances of State differs from other times; that it may not for ſome ſpace of time be thought convenient; and though this may prove miſchievous to a ſingle Perſon, or to two or three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; yet ſuch things muſt be indured for the Good of the Publick. He ſaid, That if they of that Court Committed a Man for High-Treaſon, and the King Adjourn them from time to time, this Man could not be Bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until they ſate again; ſo that he did confeſs (as his Lordſhip had ſaid) that there is a Temporary failure of Juſtice where theſe Caſes happen, but not an Indefinite one.</p>
            <p>He told his Lordſhip he muſt be content to wait the Kings Pleaſure when he will call a Parliament: That for his part he was before of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that they could not Bail his Lordſhip, and was ſo ſtill.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to this anſwered, That he muſt confeſs that his Ears did tingle to hear his Lordſhip ſay that the KING had done as much as lay in His Power, when His Majeſty is bound both by His Oath, and by the Laws, to ſee Right done at all times to His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and he deſired to know whether this was not the King's Court, to which he had deputed a Power to ſee that Right done?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50859:6"/>He ſaid alſo that he was now under greater amazement than before, ſince his Lordſhip had both granted that this Court can Bail any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and that the Order of the Houſe of Lords did not hinder it, which his Lordſhip, till now, took to be the only Obſtruction to his Liberty.</p>
            <p>That he hoped he had ſatisfied his Lordſhip, that although he was impriſoned by a Higher Hand, yet that the Bailing of him did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with the Juriſdiction of that higher Judicature.</p>
            <p>That for what his Lordſhip had ſaid of the Opinion of all the Judges in <hi>England</hi> being taken in his Caſe, he muſt needs inform his Lordſhip that that was a miſtake as to himſelf, for that the Opinion of the Judges had never been asked in his particular Caſe, but once upon his Petitioning the King for Liberty to go to his Country-Houſe at <hi>Wimbleden,</hi> with a Guard or otherwiſe as his Majeſty ſhould think fit; which Petition was referred to the Judges, and they according to their wonted Prudence and Caution, did only Report, That they thought his Majeſty could not legally grant the Petitioners Requeſt.</p>
            <p>That whereas his Lordſhip ſaid, That he was not indefinitely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned, for that whenever his Majeſty is pleaſed to call a Parliament he will have Remedy, and that he muſt be content to await the Kings Pleaſure when he will call a Parliament, He took theſe to be fuller Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments than any himſelf had made, to prove that his Impriſonment was indefinite, and at the Kings Pleaſure; ſo that he was now more fully confirmed than ever to be of that Opinion.</p>
            <p>He ſaid further, That his Lordſhip had miſtaken him, in thinking he had ſaid there was only a Temporary failure of Juſtice, and not an Indefinite one; for that he had ſaid he took himſelf to be under an abſolute failure of Juſtice, and that his Lordſhip had rather proved the ſame, than ſhewed any thing to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid he was not a Judge at that time when the Judges Opinions were asked, but deſired his Brother <hi>Jones</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late how it was, which he did accordingly, Implying, That the Caſe being put, Whether the Lords in the Tower might be Bailed, or have any Liberty; it was the Opinion of the Judges they might not.</p>
            <p>But that he did confeſs he did think the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in that Queſtion, but that it related to the Popiſh Lords only.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to that anſwered, That it did not reach his Caſe, ſince they went upon a general Queſtion, Whether the Lords in the Tower might be Bailed; affirming and ſhewing many Inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Caſe differed from the Popiſh Lords.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſaid alſo that the Lord Chief Juſtice had argued for him; That it is true the King might call a Parliament when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and therefore it was as true, that a man may lye all his life time in Priſon. And he ſaid he did expect ſtronger and more powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to have convinced him, but now he was more encouraged than before, not to give over a Cauſe which did ſo much concern eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in <hi>England</hi> as well as himſelf.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip ſaid he had wrong done him, that the King could do him no wrong, being adviſed by his Courts; beſides that the King
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50859:6"/>
had now ſhewed his will to have him Bailed; and he could not ſay that the Lords did him wrong, becauſe there was nothing in their Order to hinder his Bail (beſides that their practice had been contrary in the Caſe of a Commoner) and that he would not ſay this Court kept him a Priſoner, but by ſome body he was kept a Priſoner, or elſe it may be the Stars might keep him a Priſoner.</p>
            <p>Albeit he was legally Impriſoned, yet by <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> to be without any proſpect of relief, they being to have Juſtice done them by Law, at all times, and without delay.</p>
            <p>That he was in the Kings Court for Juſtice, and ſhould deſire that every Judge might deliver his Opinion ſeverally; which they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>Some Reaſons were by them offered why his Lordſhip could not then be Bailed: For their giving of which he was pleaſed to make an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
            <p>Part of the Judges ſaid there was a vaſt difference between his Caſe and the Lords in the Tower; that his preſſing Arguments, the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Caſe, and great Affliction he lay under, did make them incline to believe, That it were not amiſs if it was taken into farther Conſideration; and one of them ſaid it would do well if the reſt of the Judges were conſulted between this and the next Term.</p>
            <p>A Council that was at the Bar thereupon moved that his Lordſhip might come up the next Term by Rule of Court.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſeemed diſpleaſed with the forwardneſs of the Council, and the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> excuſed it, as if not done by his deſire or directions; but ſaid that they were like to be troubled with him again, for that he ſhould not eaſily give over a Cauſe wherein he took the Liberty of the Subject in general to be as deeply concerned as himſelf.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> then ſtanding up, uſed theſe, or like words, to the Earl of <hi>Danby. Your Lordſhip muſt for the preſent be content to be Remanded:</hi> And ſpeaking to the Lieutenant of the Tower, told him <hi>He muſt take back his Priſoner.</hi> After which words the Lord <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> immediately left the Court.</p>
