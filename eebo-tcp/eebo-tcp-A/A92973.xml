            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Severall Conſiderations preſented to the ſerious View of the ſeverall Companies of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable City, this day aſſembled for the choyce of Magiſtrates, and other Officers.</head>
            <head>Read, Conſider, Proſecute.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere are but twenty ſix Aldermen in this City, and at leaſt fourteen of them enjoy great places of profit, conferred upon them by the Ruling party of Lords and Commons, and Army Grandees. And for this end only, namely, that they may preſerve their intereſt in the Citty, and by the ſaid Aldermens power and prevalency, in reſpect of their authority, and Relation, may have the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oportunity to enſlave you, and make pou ſerviceable to the carrying on their deſignes, namely, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation <hi>of their own power,</hi> though to the utter ruine of the King and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>The men engaged by ſuch places of profit, are Alderman <hi>Woolaſton, Gibs, Foulke, Andrews, Avery, Edmunds Cullum, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inconveniences that come upon the City hereby, are many, but in particular as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By this meanes the very <hi>Rule</hi> by which this City is governed, is no other then the <hi>will</hi> of thoſe great Ruling men, by whom theſe <hi>Pentionary Aldermen</hi> are acted: They not daring to promote or countenance any thing, unleſſe it be ſutable to the pleaſure of their great Maſters whom they ſerve, and by whoſe power they gain ſuch great Revenues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By this means All Taxes are continued upon us, for the countenance and aſſured aſſiſtance of theſe men in ſuch great power amongſt us (who they know will improve their utmoſt intereſt to enforce the people to obey what they command, becauſe they themſelves are thereby advantaged) giveth encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſaid ruling Faction of Grandees to heap Taxes upon the City, as renewed and redoubled Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, Aſſeſſments, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this means you are deprived of the liberty of free Choyce of your Magiſtrates, being ſuffered to chooſe none but ſuch as theſe Aldermen, (being the major part) ſhall think fit, (moſt Courts of Aldermen conſiſting of the greateſt number of them) it being all the work they do for their great penſions, namely to employ all their time and power to preſerve the Intereſt of the ſaid ruling Faction in the City.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By this means you have nothing in agitation of publique concernment but it meets great oppoſition in all Councels; and not only ſo, but it is made known alſo to the ſaid Ruling Party, and if by them diſliked, preſently their power is interpoſed, to hinder the ſaid actings, and you thereby made liable to Delinquency by vertue of their diſpleaſure, which is a ſufficient crime now adays to deſtroy any man, witneſs the late impeachment of the Aldermen, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the world, that Magiſtrates ſhould have the receiving and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the publike Treaſure, for it doth not only ſerve as an inducement to corrupt tfiem, and make them ſervants to the corrupt wills of thoſe men, by whoſe power they enjoy thoſe places of profit, but alſo, gives them an opertunity to abuſe and cheat the people; for if he that hath a ſword in his hand may have the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the publike Treaſure, he may be his own Carver, (as ſome of them have been) and who ſhall dare to call him to an account?</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Theſe Premiſes conſidered.</head>
               <p>The only remedy againſt all theſe evils, and many more too large here to be inſerted, is</p>
               <p>To cauſe all the ſaid Aldermen ſo employed to do one of theſe things,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Either lay aſide theſe their offices and places, and wholly apply themſelves to the work for which they were made Aldermen, or</p>
               <p n="2">2. To lay off their Gowns, and tye themſelves only to their offices, and let other men (not ſo ingaged) be choſen to ſupply thoſe places, upon whoſe good or evil improvement, the well or ill being of this City chiefly depends.</p>
               <p>This will make you free, conduce to a ſettlement, and be an univerſal good to all parties and intereſts, therefore while it is called to day, proſecute it peaceably and unanimouſly, and expect a bleſſing.</p>
