            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, I come<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to renew my old importunity, and require your Authority, to call the Printers of <hi>Paris</hi> to account: They have set forth, in my name, certaine Letters, which I acknowledge to be mine, and deny not to father; but yet I ought to have beene of counsell to them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering I never meant they should gadde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the streets. By this meanes, when I thinke
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:3673:5"/>
I am in my Closet, I finde my selfe upon the Stage; they carry me abroad, when I desire to be private, and what I intended an inclosure to my Friends, they lay in common for all the Country. You know Sir, that this kinde of writing hath alwayes beene priviledged; and that many things are entrusted to the bosome of Letters, which neither curiosity, nor hatred ought to prye into: nor ever will, if that be any thing discreete; This, any thing generous. An Enemie in warre, that neither spares mens goods nor lives, yet makes a conscience of opening Letters; and the law of secrets, seemes more forcible than the law of Armes: Yet so unfortunate am I that what an Enemy will not offer in Warre, I suffer in Peace; and that by men, that would be thought to have no thought of doing me hurt. I have nothing so properly mine, which they thinke not as properly theirs; Nothing kept so close, which they bring not to light. If hold could bee layd on intellectuall things, they would dive (I thinke) into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts of my heart: but since <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3673:5"/>
from their Arresting. They arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves a more soveraigne power than Princes do, who alwayes leave to private men, the free use of that which is theirs, and never offer to make a High-way of my Garden, nor a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-fare of my Court-yard. This is a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, whereof the consequence reflects upon you, and wherein you are more interrested, than my selfe; for I do not beleeve, you would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to see those excellent discourses which I have heard you make to your Auditours, bee disfigured by an uncorrected Impression; and it would grieve you, that prophane hands should touch them without choyce or discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thereby marre their lustre, and defile their purity. I therefore humbly intreate you in this point to take care of your selfe, and to do your selfe right: The boldnesse of these mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary persons is not restrained by Respect, it must have a stronger Bridle; and if you give it not a stoppe by feare of punishment; neither our Closets, nor our Beds will have any thing so secret, which will not bee cryed upon the Market place, and to speake in the Comoedians phrase: That which <hi>Iupiter</hi> speakes to <hi>Iuno</hi> in her eare, shall bee made Table talke for all the people. You being as you are, the censor of manners, and Pylot of the state; it belongs to your place to restraine this so Tyrannicall an usurpation upon the liberty of mens spirits, and whilst you desend from violence our fortunes and our lives; you must not expose to the same violence, other of our goods, no lesse deare to

And having obliged me to you already upon the like occasion; I doubt not but you will maintaine that first favour, with a second, and make the Printers know, that you have taken my Name and Writings into your protection, to defend them against all their practises. This shall bee to me a singular favour, and which shall binde me, all my life, to seeke out meanes to testifie, that I am</p>

                     <p>SIR, having adventured to speake Latin, I feared my boldnesse might have had but ill successe; and I doubted, whether in a forraigne Country I might passe for an Enemy, or for a Friend. But your Letter hath given me assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my condition. I account it as the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Pattents of my Naturalizing; and where I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3673:6"/>
was afraid to bee held a <hi>Barbarian,</hi> I see my selfe suddenly become a Cittizen of <hi>Rome.</hi> For since there is now, no more Vse, that can serve for the Law; nor People, that can serve for the Iudge of a dead language; I have therefore recourse to you Sir, in whom I seeme to see the very face of the most pure Antiquity; and who, after the dissolution of the body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, do yet preserve the Spirit. It is false to say, The <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Vandalts</hi> could just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bragge they left nothing of any worth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them: I finde still the full Majestie of the language in your writings; and your stile hath in it, not onely the Ayre and Garbe of that good time; but the very Courage and the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. You draw your Opinions from the same Well, and I see no cause that any man can have to contradict them. It is certaine, that to gaine beleefe, one must keepe himselfe within the bounds of likelihood; and present to posterity examples which it may follow; and not Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, with which it may be frighted. Words that are disproportionable to the matter, seeme to savour of that Mountibankes straine; who would have it beleeved, he could make a statue of a Mountaine, and would perswade us, that a man were a mile long. There are some mens workes, not much lesse extravagant than this Mountibanks designe; and most men seeme to write with as little seriousnesse; and with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle care to be beleeved. And though men make a conscience in dealing with particular persons; yet when they come to deale with the Publike,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3673:7"/>
they seeme to thinke themselves dispensed with; and that they owe more respect to one neighbour than to whole Nations, and to all Ages to come. You know notwithstanding, that this is no new vice; and not to make a troublesome enumeration of the antient ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Favour: Is not that base delight of <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leim</hi> come even to us? and was he not a Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave, that desired one should know he was in love with his Chaine? I could curse the ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of good letters, that hath bereft us of the booke which <hi>Brutus</hi> writ of vertue; wherein wee might have seene the infamous profession he makes of unmanlinesse; to have more care of the orders of a corrupted Court, than of upholding the maine structure of the Latine Philosophie. If it had beene his fortune to have outlived <hi>Sejanus;</hi> I doubt not, but hee would have taken from him all the praises hee had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to make a present of them to his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour <hi>Macron:</hi> and if the gappes and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his booke were filled up, one should see he had not forgotten so much as a Groome in all <hi>Tiberius</hi> house, of whom he had not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Encomiums.</hi> Wee live in a Government much more just, and therefore much more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; the raigne of our King is not bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of great examples. It is impossible the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinall, should bee more dextrous, more sage, more active than it is: yet who knowes not that hee hath found worke enough to doe for many Ages, and battailes enow to fight for many Worthies: That hee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3673:7"/>
hath met with difficulties worthy of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent forces of himselfe, farre exceeding the forces of any other; it is necessary, that Time it selfe should joyne in labour with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Master-workemen to produce the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of excellent workes. The recovery of a wasted body, is not the worke of onely one potion; or once opening a veine: the reviving a decayed estate, requires a reiteration of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and a constancy of labours. The sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of desperate cases, goes not so swift a pace, as Poets descriptions, or Figures of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Wee must therefore keepe the extension of our subject within certaine bounds; and not say, that the victory is perfected, as long as it leaves us the evills of warre, and that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines any Monster to bee vanquished, seeing even poverty is it selfe one of the greatest Monsters; and in comparison whereof, those which <hi>Hercules</hi> subdued, were but tame and gentle. With time, our Redeemer will finish his worke; and he that hath given us security, will give us also no doubt abundance. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of the world, and the necessity of affaires affoords us not yet to tast this happines; it shall bee a joy unto mee, to see at least, the Image of it in your History: to returne and re-enter by your meanes into these three, so rich and flourishing yeares, after which the peace hath shewed it selfe but by fits; and the Sunne it selfe hath beene more reserved of his beames, and not ripened our fruits but on one side. You shall binde mee infinitely unto you,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3673:8"/>
to grant me a sight of this rare Peece, and to allow me a key of that Temple, which you keepe shut to all the world besides. I assure my selfe I shall see nothing there but that which is Stately and Magnificent; specially I doubt not but the Pallace it selfe is admirable, and that your words doe Parallell the subject, when you come to speake of the last Designes of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased King; and of the undoubted revolution he had brought upon the state of the world, if he had lived. And though in this there be more of divination, then of knowledge; and that to speake of such things be to expound Riddles; yet in such cases it is not denyed to be <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;</hi> and I do not beleeye that <hi>Lyvie</hi> recounting the death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> did lightly passe over the Voyage he intended against the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and that he stayed not a little to consider the new face he would have put upon the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth if death had not prevented him. If all my affaires lay here, yet I would make a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Paris,</hi> expressely for this; and to reade a discourse, made after the fashion of this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph, which pleased me exceedingly. He had a Designe to winne <hi>Rhodes</hi> and overcome <hi>Italy.</hi> I should have much a doe to hold in my Passion till then; but now I stand waiting for your <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that I may learne of him that pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which he teacheth, that I faint not in waiting till it Printed, and in state to be seene; and till he come abroad under your Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; like to those glorious bodies, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clensed from all impurity of matter, doe

glister and shine on every side. This is an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, with whom your Preface would have made me friends, if I had otherwise beene fallen out; and that the hardnesse of his phrase, and the vices of his age had given me any distaste from reading him. But it is long since, that I have held him in account; and as sad and thorny as he is, hath not beene unpleasing to me. Me thinkes, I finde in his writings that darke light; or light some darkenesse, which an ancient Poet speakes off; and I looke upon the obscurity of his writing, as I should looke upon a peece of Ivory that were well wrought and polished. This hath beene ever my opinion of him. As the beauties of <hi>Africa,</hi> doe not therefore leave to be Amiable, because they are not like to ours; and as <hi>Sophonis be</hi> would have carryed the prize from many <hi>Italian</hi> faces; so the wits of the same Country, doe not leave to please, though their eloquence be a forreiner: and for my part I preferre this man before many that take upon them to be imitators of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Let it be granted to delicate Eares, that his stile is of Iron but then let it be granted also, that of this Iron; many excellent Armours have been forged, that with it he hath defended the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and innocency of Christianity, with it he hath put the <hi>Valentinians</hi> to flight, and hath pierced the very heart of <hi>Marcyon.</hi> You see I want not much of declayming in his Praise, but to avoid this inconvenience, I thinke best to breake off abruptly.

And I vow unto you, I tooke a pleasure to suffer my selfe to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, with the first lines of your Letter. But it must be one, that knowes himselfe lesse then I doe, that dwels long in this errour. After a pleasing dreame, One is willing to awake; and I see well enough, that when you take such advantage to speake of my Travell: you make not use of the whole ability of your Iudgement. You doe me a favour, I cannot say you doe me justice; you seeme to have a will to oblige me to you, by hazarding to incurre the displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Truth. Now that you are your selfe at the Goale; you encourage with all your forces those that are in the race; and to perswade them to follow you; make them believe they shall goe beyond you. An admirable tricke of Art, I must confesse; and which at first I did not discover. But whatsoever it be, and from

what ground soever this wonderful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of yours proceeds; I esteeme it not lesse then an ambitious man doth a Crowne; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out piercing into your purpose. I take a joy in my good Fortune which is not small Sir, to be loved of you, whom I have alwaies excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly loved; and whom I have a long time looked upon in the <hi>Huguenot</hi> Party, as an excellent Pylot that affronts a great Fleete, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe but in a Pinnace. The Right and Authority is on our side; the Plots and Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems on yours, and you seeme not lesse confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in your courage, then we in our cause. It is certaine, that this is the way to give a sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the shew of a just warre: and to a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of mutiners, the face of a well ordered Army. By this you keepe many in a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that which hath now lost the attractive<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace of Novelty; and though it be now ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its declination; yet it cannot be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that it holds still some colour, and some apparance, by the Varnish of your writings; and that never man hath more subtilly covered his cause from shew of weakenesse; nor more strongly upheld his side from ruine then your selfe:</p>

                     <p>This is my ordinary language, when it comes in my way to speake of you. I am not of the passionate humour of the vulgar; which blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the liberty of their judgement; and finds never any fault in their owne side, nor vertue

It is indeed a kinde of sacriledge to devest any man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he be, of the gifts of God, and if I should not acknowledge that you have received much; I should be injurious to him that hath given you much; and for difference of the cause, wrong our Benefactor that is indifferent. It is true, I have not alwaies flattered the ill dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>French;</hi> and was put in some choler against the Authors of our last broyles; but observing in your Bookes, that our intendments are alike; and that the subjection due to Princes is a part of the Religion you professe; I have thought I might well speake of your conformity herein, as much as I say; and in so doing, be but your Interpreter. Whether the tempest rise from the Northerne winde, or from the Southerne; it is to me equally unpleasing; and in that which concernes my duty; I neither take Councell from <hi>England,</hi> nor yet from <hi>Spaine.</hi> My humour is not to wrestle with the Time; and to make my selfe an Antagonist of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; it is paine enough for me onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Cato,</hi> and <hi>Cassius;</hi> and being to live under the command of another, I find no vertue more fitting then obedience.

                     <p>SIR, I am true, if not liberall; and I send you that I promised, though I cannot send you what I would. This is neither a moove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the use of your house, nor an ornament to beautifie your closet; it is matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course onely for two or three dayes at your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and a Novelty that will quickly grow stale. But if your selfe have any better opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and that you account it of any value, I am contented that you leave my stile to the mercy of any that will arrest it; so you please to justifie my intentions to men that are reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not suffer in the Country where you are, that an honest man should bee oppressed with the hatred against his side. If I were a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voulted <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and that the words I write did come from the mouth of a Fugitive, they might with good reason bee taken in ill part; and we finde that a <hi>Graecian</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> was once punished for serving the <hi>Persians</hi> to bee their Interpreter: but I desire you to consider, that the cause I maintaine is the cause of my Prince and Country, which I could not maintaine coldly, without a kinde of treason. We punish Prevaricatours and Traytors, but true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full enemies wee prayse, and I cannot thinke
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3673:12"/>
that <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinall of <hi>Cueva,</hi> will thinke the worse of my passion, for the publike liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who hath shewed himselfe the like passion, for one particular mans Regency. I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that a good action should make me lose his favour, or that being himselfe extreamely just, hee should not more esteeme of my zeale, which is naturall and honest; than the choller of Doctor <hi>Boucher,</hi> a mercenary man, and a Pentioner to a stranger. It will be no Novelty to say that of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which hath beene alwayes said of great Empires, and that rapine and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty is a reproach even to Eagles and Lyons. To be a Tyrant and an Vsurper, is it not in other termes to be a Grandee, and a Conqueror? And are not violence and severity vices that exceed the reach of vertue, and which makes our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality ridiculous; I blame sometimes the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailes of Kings, but I never lay hands upon their royalty, and if I seeke to cut off super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities and excesses, it cannot therfore be justly sayd, I teare that off which I seeke to prune. Crownes are to me sacred, even upon Idolaters heads; and I adore the marke of God in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great <hi>Cham,</hi> and of the great <hi>Mogoll.</hi> Having now made this declaration which yet is more expressly delivered in my booke: I hope there will be no place left for calumnie, and I promise to my selfe, that for my sake you will whip the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in point of generousnesse, and shew them, that she hath shewed her selfe principally to doe a favour to enemies, and to mingle things which seeme hard to bee min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled,

                     <p>SIR, I vow I am one of the worst Courtiers of <hi>France,</hi> and to justifie Fortune, for having little favoured me, I will accuse my selfe for having little courted her, yet for the love of you I have used an extraordinary endeavour. My affection hath gone beyond my action, and I have put my selfe to the venture to goe as farre as <hi>Gascogny</hi> to seeke you out.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3673:13"/>
and I should have put hard with the best of the Country to have had the honour to offer you my service first of any, but God did not thinke me worthy of my desires. It was his pleasure I should make a journey of fifty leagues not to see you, and I conceive my happinesse to be such, that if I should goe to <hi>Paris</hi> with the like intention, God would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently inspire the Kings heart to send you away in some Embassage: Be pleased therefore Sir to spare me this travaile; I dare undertake no second voyage, for feare least such a thought onely should remoove you from the station where all the good of life is seated, and out of which a man can have no contentment, but what he can get by the force of Reason and Philosophie. It sufficeth me that I have this one way left me, to present you my Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and that from time to time I can make you reade that your <hi>Idaea</hi> is the deare company of my solitude, &amp; your reputation the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble trouble of my repose. In the estate I now am in, this in effect, is all the part I claime in the affaires of the world; these are the newes for which I retaine still my whole enquiery; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse unto you the publicke prosperities would be lesse deare unto me if yours were not bound up in one volume with them.

I had the pleasure Sir to see all these things before they were visible; I saw the fruit when it was but in the budde, I knew the Gold when it was yet in the mine, I remember your happy entrance into the world, and that you have not needed a time of probation for being perfectly an honest man, you sayd things to mee in your infancie which I make use of now in my old age; and I keepe for a Monument a letter you once writ to me from <hi>Villesavin</hi> as a seede of all the dispatches, and of all the instructions you shall ever make. At that time I was proud of my fortune, and you gave me leave to boast of your friendship, I dare not now use the privacie of such tearmes; it is fit my ambition should be more modest and more moderate. I crave now only an acknowledging and a protection, and this I hope Sir you will not deny me; but take me for one of the charges descended upon you, with the inheritance of Mounsieur <hi>d' Ayre</hi> your deceased Vncle; Beare with my passion as a thing of your owne, and which you cannot put

                     <p>SIR, what occasion soever it be that brings me your Letters, it cannot be but very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3673:15"/>
I feele a joy at the only sight of your name, &amp; the honour you doe me to remember me, is so deare unto me, that though perhaps it be fortune that doth it, yet I cannot but thank you for it. You are one of those whose least favours are <hi>Obligatorie,</hi> &amp; you never cast them from you so carelessely, but that they deserve to bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gathered. When others beare you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and hold you deare, it is but to be just, and to pay debts, but when you doe the like to others, it is to be liberall, and to bestow fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. You may then imagine what glory I account it, that the meanenesse of my spirit hath the approbation of your judgement, and I am not a little glad that my inclination hath so good successe, not to be hated of one whom I should love, though hee hated mee. For a traine to this first favour I require from you a second; be pleased Sir that I aske you, if it be in truth my selfe whom you exhort to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, whether you thinke in your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that I am fallen into the vice contrary to this vertue? It is now foure yeares that I suffer outrages, they thinke it not enough to doe me wrongs unlesse they print them too; they doe me hurt, and would have me thinke my selfe beholding to them for it; an infinite Army of enemies are come into the field against mee, under the Colours of <hi>Philarque;</hi> it is not two or three private men, it is whole Companies, whole Troopes that set upon mee: I am the Martyr of a thousand Tyrants, and if this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy influence passe not over, or abate not, I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:3673:16"/>
shall come at last to be the object of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all the world. They have painted mee out a publicke sinner amongst honest men; a a man that cannot reade amongst Schollers, a mad man amongst the sober: These good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they have done mee hitherto without any revenging, I am as yet a debtour of these cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to them that have lent them to mee; I have taken these blowes with hardinesse in stead of repelling them with force, and my patience hath beene such, that many have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it want of courage: If this bee so, you will grant me Sir that you trouble your selfe about that which cannot be, that another mans praises should be insupportable to mee, when I have not been sensible of my owne Calumnies: I am not like to be in hast to hinder by my violence the making of friendship, who have by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missenes as it were consented to my owne ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. There is no colour to thinke that I should complaine of words feigned, and such as declay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers use in sport, who have not so much as spoken a word of the most cruell action that ever the most premeditated malice could bring forth. Let our friend if hee please make an Epitaph or a deifying of—let him imploy all his Morter and all his Art, to build him either a Sepulcher or a Temple, and to speake after the manner of—, let him erect him a shrine, and place him amongst his houshould saints: I say nothing against all this, nor condemne his proceeding, whether it be that he honour the memory and merit of the dead, or that hee
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3673:16"/>
stand in awe of the credit and faction of his heires. I easily beare with these small spots in my friends, and exact no more of them then they can well spare. I know that Greeke and Latine make not men valiant, nor are things that descend to the bottome of the soule, they scarce reach to the outermost su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies: they stay commonly in the memory and in the imagination, and polish the tongue without fortifying the heart: I should there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desire too much, if I should desire at all that these goodly knowledges should get a new vertue for my sake, and should worke a greater effect in the spirit of—then they wrought in the Poet <hi>Lucan,</hi> whom feare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to accuse his mother, and to praise a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. If it stay but upon mee that this deare child should see the light, after so many sower lookes and so many throwes, I am ready my selfe to serve for a Midwife. I am content it shall be published to day, and to morrow bee translated into all Languages, that the Author may not lose a day in his glory, and that his glory be not bounded within River or Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. Never feare that I will impaire his ill nights, or adde the care of one processe to his ordinary watchings, if hee have no other u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3673:17"/>
he rose. Besides, I have too much care of my owne quiet, to goe about to trouble his; and I love his contentment too well, not to procure it, being to cost me nothing, but the dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling his weakenesse, And this I entreate you Sir, to assure him from me. But knowing you to be wise and vertuous in the degree you are, I doubt not, but of your owne head, you will tell him, that it becomes not a man of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to countenance such petty things; and in a point of Schollarship to use as much formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ceremony, as if it were the Negotiation of an Ambassador, but much more, that it is a base quality to juggle with his friends; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having said a truth, which was not for all mens taste to make a Comment upon it, of a Sophister. I have read <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and the Bookes of—and therefore should know the stile of <hi>Tyberius;</hi> and the Art of Equivocation; but I should be loath to seeme ingenious, to the prejudice of mine honour, and to make use of poyson, though I had one so subtill that would kill without leaving any marke to be seene; I have loved men in affliction; and have made use of men in misery. Lightning hath not dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me from places which it hath made fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; I have given testimony of my affection, not only where it could not be acknowledged, but where it was in danger to be punished. I am not now so dealt withall my selfe; and yet if the justice of my cause were not as it is to be regarded; me thinkes the violence of my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries ought to procure me some favour;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3673:17"/>
doth not even honour oblige those that have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feeling of it, not to joyne with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude which casts it selfe upon a single man? Oppression hath alwaies beene a sufficient ground for Protection; and Noble mindes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seeke better Title for defending the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; but the neede there is of them; and to take part with a stranger, it is cause enough that many assault him, and few assist him. and such also I doubt not is your mind. I am not lesse perswaded of the generousnesse of your mind; then of the greatnesse of your Spirit, and assure my selfe you are not the lesse on my side, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I have many persecutors, as because also, I am firmely,</p>

M. the Baron of Saint <hi>Surin,</hi> who will beare me witnesse, that after I had read it. I desired nothing more for perfecting my joy, but that I might be such a one as you make me, and be like my picture. If this be the coale of <hi>Holland</hi> with which you make, such draughts, it sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passeth all the colour that we use here to paint withall, and yet the beauty costs you nothing, but you shal handly make me beleeve it; I know Gold and Azure, and can easily distinguish it from coale, I see Sir the Ambushes you lay for me. The Facilitie of your stile covers the force of it, but weakens it not, and under a shew of carelesnesse, I finde true Art and Ornaments. It secures not your turnes to doe better in the place where you are than wee; and shutting us out to hold possession of the ancient and solid vertue, but you goe about to take from us all that is any way passable to corrupt estates, I meane the glory of Language, and not suffer us to have this little toy to comfort our selves withall, for the losse of all our truer treasures. After fifty yeares overcome you will now be talking of a parley, and thinke to make your selves masters of men by a more sweet and humane way then the former, as much in effect as to bee, that you have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beene termed the brothers of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and heyres of the old <hi>Catoes,</hi> who made profession of severity, and yet not ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the graces.

He is ful of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects he hath left behind him, and when I talke to him of our Court and of our confusions; hee answers with telling mee of your government and good order. And here you shall pardon me if I change my complement into blame, and require to be righted by you for dehauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a friend, who with one looke of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance allayes and sweetens all the bitternesse of my life. The number of my persecutors is in a manner infinite, but for how many thinke you I account so brave a champion? Take him from me and you leave mee quite disarmed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst ill fortune, I loose my comfort for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie, and my example for vertue.

                     <p>SIR, I learne by the <hi>Gazette</hi> that you have received a wound at <hi>Mastricke,</hi> so it bee light I forgive it you, but though it bee but a scratch I love you too well not to accuse you of too much forwardnesse. They that are poore in reputation ought to presse up to the trenches, and such fervour is as well beseeming fresh souldiers as young Fryers; but for you, you have seene too many warres to be called by the first name, and your valour having beene shewed in the presence of the Prince, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the testimony of the very enemy; it seemes to mee that your part is not so much to bring it forth as a new matter, as to keepe it up as a knowne good. I would have you make good actions, yea ordinary; but I would have you doe it now, if it might be had with a body charmed and with inchanted Armes, that leaving behinde you all danger, you might have before you nothing but glory. If God had given us three or foure lives, we might at any time venture one, and sometimes in a bravery let one goe, being assured we have another in store, but to be prodigall in poverty, and to be carelesse of ones head when no art can make him a new, this is a point hath no apparence of reason. Wee must not set so light by the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3673:19"/>
beauties of heaven and the Rayes of visible things, nor turne our eyes from a spectacle so magnificently erected for us: I offend perhaps the eares of your courage with this discourse, and you are like to send my counsaile away as it came, yet take not distastfully an officious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and thinke it not strange that I acquaint you with my feares, seeing a goddesse was not ashamed to attire her sonne in a womans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to preserve him; it would greeve me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to see you come halting home, or with but one eye, and to bring such untoward favours from the warres; I will not be bound to flatter your griefe with that word of a <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonian</hi> mother, Courage my sonne; you cannot now take a steppe that puts you not in minde of your vertue, and lesse with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the histories of <hi>Salust,</hi> he made osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a face remarkeable onely for skarres, and for having but one eye, wherein he tooke a pleasure though it made him deformed, and cared not for losing one part of himselfe, which made all the rest the fuller of honour. Spare me I beseech you this kinde of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which I should give you, if you suffer the like losses, and be not so hot in seeking after a faire death which can gaine you nothing but a faire Epitaph. Give mee beleefe onely this once, and after this I will leave you to your owne beleefe, and commend you to your good Angell.

In the name of God come and draw me out of the unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse you have put me in, I have something, I know not what, lies heavy at my heart, and nothing will lighten it but your company: That which a superstitious man would doe for a dreame, or for some idle presage, do you I pray you for a friend: who carries you alwayes in his minde, and who is more then any in the world,</p>

It is no small matter to entertaine eyes that use not to stay upon vulgar objects; and to minister pleasure to a minde which hath nothing in it but lawfull passions, and indeede Sir the height of my ambition is bounded there. If I had no other payment for all my travaile, but onely your good opinion of it, I should not complaine for being ill payd, and your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath made me full recompence for all the wrongs I have received. The number of my enemies is great, I see it well, the time doth not favour me, I confesse it, but having your favour Sir what can I feare under so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a protection? Seeing those to whom God hath given clearer eyes then to other men, and a more soveraigne reason, as well as a more sovereigne dignitie, have no ill opinion of my opinions, what neede I care for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the base world? and how can I but hope that the truth assisted by a few sages, will be alwayes able to withstand a multitude of Sophisters? I now send you Sir my answer to such of their objections, that seeme worth the refuting, and which have but any sparke of apparance to dazle the eyes of simple people; the rest are so ridiculous that I dare not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne them, for feare you should thinke I had devised them my selfe to make matter for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; or that I coaped with them about points where I were sure they could doe mee no hurt. And yet why should I dissemble my

ill happe? Those ridiculous objections finde abettours and uphoulders, although I have ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice on my side, yet am I sued still, and persecuted by men I never offended; and that when I give over the field and intreate for my life, see the dealings of cruell mindes towards those that are good. They have no feare, but because I make no resistance; they magnifie themselves in the wrong of their advantage; they have not taken it; it is my selfe have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it them. Their first successe which my sufferance hath incouraged have beene new bonds for the continuance; and because I have used no words against their blowes, they thinke I judge my selfe worthy to endure them; yet all this shall not make me change my resolution, and I am bent to stay within the bounds into which I have voluntarily put my selfe. Although I am neighbour to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalls Court, yet I chuse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I know your love to him, is one of the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient you ever had, and hee therefore one of the first servants you ever entertainde: The choise of so judicious an infancie as yours, hath not I dare say beene rashly made; and I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover daily by the opening of his heart and thoughts unto me, the reasons you had to love him at first; I come not therefore as his Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citour

                     <head>To Mounsieur <hi>de Bois Robert.</hi> LETTER XII.</head>
                     <p>SIR, you are a better man than you would have me beleeve you are. Your words of Fire and Blood agree ill with the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your spirit, and having received from you a Letter of challenge, I expect from you another of friendship. You may make your profit of the good examples you have seene on that side the Mountaines, but follow not the <hi>Italian</hi> examples of being captious and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of spleene, as if it were a jewell. It is not fit the holy weeke should passe upon your choller without abating it. It would not bee an act of courage, but a hardnesse of heart, and the best extremities partake so much of vice, that even supreme right is no better than supreme wrong. Play not therefore the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant towards your friend, but stay your selfe within the bounds of ordinary justice. The limits that part justice from wrong are not so well marked out, but that one passeth them often before he is aware; and it is neither a lawfull greatnesse to make ones selfe terrible to those he loves, nor an honest resistance to stand obdurate to the prayers of men in misery. But perhaps I offer remedies to one in better state than my selfe; perhaps I am affrayd of in artificiall choller, and am frighted with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3673:23"/>
that which is but a Vizard. It may be you have a desire to know in what degree I love you, and that your hard dealing with mee is but to try me; such experiments would proove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to any other man besides your selfe, but you may make them safely, for I make you promise that my patience shall bee more insensible then your sence is tender. But yet muse a little upon the honour of our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and upon the opinion of the world. I make confession to you of my faults, and I am told you publish briefes of your dislike; I have told you confidently that I suffer in it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I tell it not with a good grace, you are offended with the incivility of privacie. Me thinkes you should not exact from a plaine country man so punctuall a discretion, by living amongst clownes I have forgotten all the good manners I learned with you: the wilde man you had civilized is returned backe to his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall condition. I doe not any longer walke in the woods, I wander there, and had it not beene to see my Lord Mayors shew, I had not beene seene in the City, although to say the truth, so obstinate a retyring might justly enough have beene censured as a kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; and as the study of wisedome takes from mee all admiration of vaine pompe, so yet it leaves mee the reverence of lawfull au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And to this purpose (that I may change the tenour of my discourse) I must tell you that I am very well pleased with my voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and doe not repent me to have performed
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3673:23"/>
a small Complement which hath discovered unto mee an eminent vertue. I have studied M. <hi>de Brassac</hi> now eight dayes together, I have observed him in publicke and in private. I have seene him handle different subjects, with so equall force, that I am even ashamed, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so perfect knowledge of his owne Art, yet he knowes mine much more better then my selfe. Hee is none of these limited wits that count themselves full, if they have but three words of Latine, and have but read one of Plutarkes lives: Take them out of certaine common places within which they entrench themselves and draw all discourse thither, every where else they are utterly disarmed and without defence; but his knowledge is so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall, and comprehends such an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thinges that one cannot touch upon any point where hee is not ready for you, and to draw him dry I doe not thinke there are que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions enow in the world to put unto him. In one day I have heard him discourse with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen about hunting and husbandry; with Iesuits about Divinitie, and the Mathematicks, with Doctors of lesse austere profession about Rhetoricke and Poetrie, without ever borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a forreigne terme, where the naturall were the fitter, and without ever flying to authority where the case in question were to be decided by reason. To answer a premeditated oration from point to point upon the suddaine, and to send backe our oratours more perswaded by his eloquence then satisfied with their owne,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3673:24"/>
this I have seene him oftentimes doe, and no man ever came to visit him, whose heart hee did not winne with his words, or at least left in it such an impression as is wont to bee the first elementing and foundation of love. No libertie can be so sweete as so reasonable a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; such a yoake is more to be valued then the Mayor of <hi>Rochels</hi> Halberds, and when one is once assured of the sufficiencie of his guide, it is afterwards but a pleasure to bee led. In lesse then one weeke hee hath new made all spirits here; hath fortified the weake, hath cleared the scrupulous, and hath given to all the world a good opinion of the present, and a better hope of the time to come. I vow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you I never saw a man that had a more pleasing way of commanding, nor better knew how to temper force and perswasion together. I have indeede knowne some not unfit to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but it hath beene in a Gally not in a City; such might serve for excellent follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but are never good to make Governours; they understand not the Art of governing Freemen; there are even some beasts of so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous a disposition, that it would be rudenesse to carry a hard hand over them; much more whom one might leade in his garter to curbe them, besides a bridle with a Cavasson. They thinke that power cannot subsist but by severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that it growes weake and scorned, vds it be not frightfull and injurious. This method and manner of governing is not like to come from the schoole and discipline of M. the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3673:24"/>
Cardinall, from whom nothing is ever seene to come that relisheth not of the mildenesse of his countenance, and receiveth not some im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression from the clearenesse of his eyes. All that have the honour to come neare about him are knowne by this Character, &amp; weare all the same livery, though they bee of different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving. There is not so sullen an humorist that is not mollified by his presence, nor so dull an understanding that he makes not preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with a word of his mouth; this you know, and I am not ignorant of; hee makes power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full use of weake instruments, and his inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions lift up spirits to such a highth as their owne nature could never carry them. Hee needes in a man but a small seede of reason to draw from him exceeding effects of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and he instructs so effectually the gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest spirits; that what they want in themselves they get by his instructions. These are workes which none can doe but he, materialls which none but he can put in frame; yet I thinke I may say without offence, that this is more of his choyse then of his nature. To spirits that languished for want of roome to stirre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in, hee hath given scope and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and where he hath found a vertue neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, to make it as bright as it was solid; he hath not forborne to crowne it with his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. There is not a mouth in all his Province that blesseth not his Election; and every man beleeves to have received from him that power which he hath procured to him, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3673:25"/>
will not use it but for our good. Amongst the showtes of exultation which waite upon him in all places where he goes; the joy of the people is not so fixed upon present objects, but that it mounts to a higher cause, and gives thankes to the first moover of the good influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which the lower heavens powre downe upon us. And in effect if <hi>Caesar</hi> thought hee tooke a sufficient revenge of the <hi>Africans,</hi> for their taking part with the enemy, by placing <hi>Salust</hi> to be their Governour; who did them more hurt by his private Family, then a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror would have done with all his Army; by the contrary reason wee may gather that the true Father of his Country hath had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of us in advancing M. <hi>de Brassac</hi> to the government of this Province, and meant herein to honour the memory of his abode there, and to make happy that Land, where perhaps he first conceived those great designes which hee hath since effected. I should not have spoken so much in this point if I did not know that you mislike not in mee these kinds of excesse; and if it were not the vice of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers now adayes to speake of the object of their love without all limits. Besides, I have beene willing to make you forget the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Letter by the length of the middle, and by a more pleasing second discourse, to take from you the ill taste I had given you by the first. And so adue Mounsieur <hi>Choler,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver feare that I will provoke you againe; it was my evill Angell that cast this temptation

that favour will never want Panegyricks and Sonnets; that the Court will never be without Sharkes and Cheaters: that Vertue will ever be the most beautifull, and the most unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing in the world. And what can you write in the generall of affaires, that hath not relation to one of these points? And for my owne particular, what can I heare, but that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some Booke is written against me, or that my Pension is like to be ill paid, or that I shall not be made an Abbot, unlesse I be my selfe the Founder of the Abby: such newes would be terrible to a man more interressed than my selfe, but to me, they are in a manner indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and trouble mee no more, than if you should tell me it will be foule weather all this Moone, or that the water is growne shallow in our river, or that a tree in my Wood hath been overturned by tempest.

I am, as you know, unhappy enough not to know her, but seeing the honest men of <hi>Greece</hi> have used to adore upon adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and built Altars to unknowne Deities, it may as well be lawfull for me to use devotion to this Saint upon the credit of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> who have now these three yeares looked upon her, as upon one of the true Originalls, whereof they revere the Statues; they all agree in this, that since the <hi>Porciaes</hi> and the <hi>Corneliaes</hi> there never was any thing scene comparable to this; and that those divine women, which were the domesticall Senate of their husbands, and the rivalls of their vertue, have no other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over this <hi>French Lady,</hi> but that they died in an age of funerall Orations. You send mee word that you finde her in the same estate you left her, and that she is now as fresh and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as ever she was, and I easily beleeve it; this long continued state of youth is no doubt the recompence, of her extraordinary vertue: the calme within sweetens and cleares the ayre without, and from the obedient passions of her minde, there riseth neither wind nor cloud to taint the purenesse of her complexion, as there are certaine temperate Climates which bring forth Roses all the yeare long; and where it is counted for a wonder, that such a day it was cold or snowed: so are there likewise certaine

It is better Sir, that this perpetuall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of scandall be removed by my absence; and that I leave peace to my friends by leaving the field to my adversaries. This resolution is not so unmanly as some would point it out unto me, change onely the termes; and that which they call cowardice and running away, is but to be better advised &amp; to yeeld to the time. I have read a word in a letter which <hi>Cicero</hi> writ to <hi>Brutus</hi> that confirmes me much in this opinion;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3673:29"/>
You withdrew your selfe, saith he, out of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted city, you gave place to Varlets; for you <hi>Stoickes</hi> say, That a wise man never runnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. <hi>Cato</hi> himselfe, who would rather die, than live to see a Tyranny; was he not resolved to goe voluntarily into banishment for avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a more supportable evill? And thinke you, that hee had more reason to love his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, than I to love my quiet? Or that his griefe was more just than mine? As all resisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are not honest, so neither are all flights shamefull, and as there are some naughty joyes, so there are some reasonable griefes; and you shall see in the Paraphrase of your friend, that for a disgrace which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> received at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> his heart failed him, and he grew weary of his life. The authority of so great an example, bindes you to pardon in me, the weakenesses you charge me with; for my selfe, mee thinks I heare continually soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in my eares, the voice that cried to <hi>Arseni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Fuge, sede, tace;</hi> which seemes to councell me, to give my selfe satisfaction by my quiet, and to give others contentment by absenting my selfe, and by my silence.

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cousin, wee were put in hope we should have the happinesse to see you in this country, and that here you would make one of the reposes of your voyage, but you have not beene pleased to make us so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie; It seemes you thought not our walkes pleasant enough for you, you scorne now the fountaines of <hi>Maillou,</hi> and the river of <hi>Balzac;</hi> these sweet Objects, which heretofore gained your inclinations, and enchanted the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of your tender yeares, are not now able to excite in you the least desire, nor so much as to tempt your graver age. I finde in this some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be offended at, and whereof to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. If you had to doe with a Poet, hee would make a mighty quarrell betweene you and the Deities of the Woods and Waters; and would send you most reproachfull Elegies in behalfe of the Nymphes whom you have scorned. But it makes well for you that I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not the language of the Gods, and that I can speake no otherwise than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people doe: this will defend you from a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3673:30"/>
number of naughtie Verses; and I will say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you more spightfull than this, that you seeme to reserve your selfe all for <hi>Paris,</hi> and feare to be prophaned with the basenesse of a Village. Princes and their affaires leave not in you so much as one poore thought for us; and the pleasures of the country are too grosse and meager, for a taste that is used to more delicate and solid pleasures. You see Sir, my deare cousin, that my complaints are sweete, and that I justifie you in accusing you. It is certaine, there is a part of the active life, which one may call delightfull; and though Vertue have her joy with lesse tumult than Vice, yet the very secrecie of her joy aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth also the sweetnesse, and vapours not out the puritie thereof; and so it happens, that while you sought but after honesty, you have found withall delight also: you dreamed but of being vertuous and profitable to your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and into the bargaine, you have content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment also and pleasure for your selfe. For in effect considering your humour, I doubt not but the paines you take, is your sufficient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the paines you take, and that your very action keepes you in breath; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refresheth you; and as one in <hi>Aristotle</hi> said, That it was a death to him, when hee was not in some office; so I verily beleeve, that to take away imployments from you, were as much as to take away your life, and that you would refuse even felicitie it selfe if it were offered you without having some thing to doe.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3673:31"/>
You doe well to love a burden that graceth you more than it weighes, and not to thinke it a trouble to be in a race which you have entred with as much applause as they can desire that are going out. You have beene mens joy, from the instant you were first seene, and your many imployments that have since so happily succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, have but ratified the good opinion that was had of you being yet unknowne. There are some men that get more reputation by play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon advantage; but yours is a lawfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, and this integritie which hath nothing in it, either fierce or fearefull, this learning which is neither clownish nor quarrelsome this course which can avoid Precipices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out turning out of the right way, are none of the qualities with which men use to abuse the world, none of the enchantments which you make use of to dazle our eyes. And though our eyes were capable of illusion, yet having me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the grace &amp; favour of a Prince, the clearest fighted the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

You would not beleeve the pleasures that Madam <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3673:31"/>
our selves wee should see you in our Desarts, but since your honour calls you otherwhere; it is reason we rest satisfied with so sweete a necessity, and to beare with patience that the publicke hath neede of your service. It is farre from me to preferre a short satisfaction of my eyes before the long and durable joyes I expect from the progresse of your reputation; and if I should desire that for your comming hither you should put your selfe the farther off from your ends, my desires should bee indiscreet, and I should not be the man I ought to be.</p>

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cosin, if the counsaile I have given you did not give me an interest in the resolution you have taken, yet I could not chuse but acknowledge it to bee good, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the good successe it hath produced. It is true that till now I never liked of long deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations, nor of stayd lovers; but seeing your wisedome hath concluded in favour of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3673:32"/>
your love, and that it is no longer an idle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the person you love; I seeme to conceive the designe you had in drawing out the lines of your love to such a length; in which it cannot be sayd there hath beene time lost, but that you would taste all the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of hope before you would come to that of possession; this is not to be irresolute but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till, and not to make a stoppe of contentments but to husband them. This is not to have an apprehension of being happy, but to have a desire to be happy twice, so that in this point you are fully justified. This circumspection which I accused wrongfully, and which is equally remooved from Furie and Effeminate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, puts the passions into a just and durable temper, and makes the minde capable of its felicitie by a serious preparation; and I vow unto you that the life you have begun was well worthy you should take some time to study it; It is not fit to enter the state of marriage rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and by the conduct of Fortune; all the eyes that prudence hath are not too many to serve for a guide in this businesse; many men fall into a snare whilst they thinke to finde a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and errours are there mortall where repentance is unprofitable; but God be than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked you are out of danger, and your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is in sanctuary. There is no <hi>Nectar</hi> nor Roses now but for you; (accept from mee I pray this one word of a wedding Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement) and in the estate you are in, what are you not? Since a Conquerour that is crowned
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3673:32"/>
is but the figure of a lover that injoyes; the lover receiving that really which the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror but dreames. You offend not the peoples eyes with proud inscriptions, nor astonish them with the clamour of your conquest; you celebrate your triumphs covertly, and draw no mans envie upon you; you reigne by your selfe alone, and all the pompe which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse drawes after it, is not comparable to that which you injoy in secret. I am not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with lawfull pleasures, and ought not to bee with forbidden; but I have heard it sayd, that in the first there is a certaine peace of spirit, &amp; a confident contentment which is not found in the other: And as the Hony is lesse gathered from the flowers then from the deaw which falls from the stars; so these chaste plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are seasoned from heaven &amp; receive their perfection from the heavenly grace and not from their owne nature. I have learned from the antient Sages, that there is not a more anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nor a more excellent friendship then this; that in this sweet societie greefes are divided, and joyes doubled, and that a good wife is a <hi>catholieon</hi> or universall remedy for all the evills that happen in life. I doubt not but she whom you have chosen is worthy of this name; and though I should hold your testimony in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition; yet I have heard it deposed with so great advantage on her part; and by so tender and judicious spirits, that I am not onely glad in your behalfe for the good company you have gotten you, but give you thankes also in my
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3673:33"/>
owne behalfe for the good allyance you have brought me. I am exceeding impatient till I see her, that I may betweene her hands abjure my wrong opinions; and if neede bee, make honorable amends before her for all the blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies I have heretofore written against marriage. I solemnely by this Letter ingage my selfe to doe it, and intreate you to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her, that shee may accept my retractations, which proceede from a heart truly penitent and full of passion, to testifie to you both, that I am</p>

                     <p>SIR, your Letter hath runne great hazards before it arrived here; It wandred about seaven moneths together, and that now at last it is come to my hands; I ascribe it to the remorse of a man unknowne, who being but halfe wicked, contented himselfe onely with opening it, but would not by any meanes that I should lose it. Happy were I if I could as
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3673:33"/>
well recover other things I greeve for, and that I could say, hee were but strayed whom I loved with my heart; but I have lost him for ever, and you are never able to restore mee that I lent you; yet I lay it not to your charge, nor to the charge of your innocent Country. I am not of that mans humour, who spake a thousand villanies against poore <hi>Troy,</hi> and tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all her Histories and Fables, because (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth) his brother dyed there, and perhaps of a maladie that he had gotten somewhere else. My greefe is wiser then his, I should take my losse unkindly at your hands, if you were your selfe the richer for it, but now the losse is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to us both; we both lament a common friend, and your selfe have rather the greater share in this sad societie, in as much as herein you have advantage over me, for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him the last duties. Hee saw your teares fall amongst his blood, you filled your eyes and your spirit with all circumstances of his death, and I doubt not but it hindred you from being perfectly sensible of the victory at <hi>Mastrich,</hi> and to shew a joyfull countenance in the most joyfull day of all your Princes life. For my selfe, I am not as yet capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, yet have layd upon my wound all the plasters Philosophie could minister. Mee thinkes my griefe is to mee in place of my friend; I possesse it with a kind of sweetnesse, and am so tender of it, that I should thinke it a second losse, if I had it not to passe my time withall; yet I must intreate it a little forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3673:34"/>
that I may have time to make you an account of your liberalitie, and that you may know what is become of the presents you sent me; I received them Sir after your Letter, and that by another kind of adventure. I have imparted them to the worthiest persons of our Province, I am at this time adorning my Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with them, and make more reckoning of them then of all the riches your Havens can shew, or then all the pretious rarities the Sea brings to you from the farthest parts of the earth. There is as much difference betweene your friends stile, and that of other Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists, as betweene the stoutnesse of a Souldier and the coynesse of a Courtesan.

Hee stands not dreaming upon a word of no difficultie, erecting as it were Trophees of like passages, after the fashion of our Note-makers now adayes, who heape up places upon places, and bring nothing in their writings, but the cruditie and indigestion of their reading. He handles Grammar like a Philosopher, and makes Bookes to be subject to Reason; and the authority which time hath given them to the Principles, which truth hath established; he hath discovered that <hi>Idea</hi> of art, which the best workemen never yet came neere, and hath added that last perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which shewes spots and impuritie in the most elaborate writings.

Sir, to goe make my selfe an Artist under his discipline, and to be at once both your Courtier and his Schollar.

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cosin, I never doubted of your affection towards me, but I thought it proceeded of pittie rather then of merit; and that having nothing considerable in me, but my ill fortune; your good nature was thereby one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited to doe me this charitie, but now I see, you propose to your selfe a more noble Object, and thinke to finde a better reason for your loving me; yet I know not whether it be so just as the former, and whether you may as lawfully respect a vulgar person as you may protect an unfortunate? If I had had any such seedes of goodnesse in me as you speake of, my ill fortune would have stifled all their vertue. Nothing can bud forth in an aire perpetually tempestuous. It is not enough for the labouring man that he take paines in his husbandry, and that his soyle be good, but there must be a sweetnesse of the season also to favour his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell: which I have hitherto proved so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that I wounder how I have the heart to be alwayes planting for tempests to spoile. I finde more good for me in idlenesse than in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and more gaine by doing nothing than by doing well. When I am idle, I am at least at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3673:36"/>
quiet; and envy rests as well as I, but as soone as once I offer but to stirre, there is presently an alarum raised in the Latine Province: and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is made before I have conceived any thing to be opposed. Other mens good deedes are rewarded, mine onely, if any of mine be worthy the name, must looke for nothing but defacing: a very hard suiteit would be, but to get their pardon: and I follow not vertue, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without reward, but I follow her with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. You thinke not withstanding that I take a pleasure in this ungratefull occupation; and that I have a greater forwardnesse to it, than I finde resistance. You thinke my spirit should never shrinke for ill successes, and that of its owne fertiltie without either one beame of the Sunne, or one droppe of dew, and at the mercy of all windes, it is able to budde and bring forth some thing. You judge too favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably of a vigor that is halfe extinguished, and consider not that melancholy indeede, is inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and pregnant when it comes from the temper which <hi>Aristotle</hi> commendeth, but that it is drie and stupid when it proceedes from the continuall outrages of adverse fortune. And therefore Sir, my deare Cousin, expect nothing from me to answer your expectation, and to merit the veneration you speake of in your letter. I cannot endure such a great word in your mouth; are you not afraid to come under my office of a Grammarian? One such impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per terme is unexcusable, unlesse it be you had relation to that old Verse, <hi>Res est sacra miser;</hi>
                        <pb n="65" facs="tcp:3673:36"/>
or to that brave fellow in the controversies of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who in the life time of the Oratour <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius,</hi> but upon the wane of his spirit, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he reverenced his very Cynders, and would use to sweare by his shadow, and by his memory. It shall suffice me that you handle me in this manner, that Mounsieur your President and your selfe would sometimes say in lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me, he had beene further off than now he is, if he had met with fewer ambushes in his way. I require your recommendation of my service to that rare personage, whom I dare not call the last of the <hi>French;</hi> I remember what was laid to <hi>Cremutius Cordus</hi> his charge; but how ever, I account him worthy of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>France,</hi> and of the Senate which we have not seene, that had the honour to be Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor betweene the Emperour and the Pope; a mediator betweene the King and his People. I require from you but onely the like favour, and I acquit you of your veneration, provided that you keepe for me your good will, which I cannot lose if you be just, since I am.</p>

                     <p>SIR, the account I make of you is farre from being a scorne. One should doe you wrong to take you for any other than your selfe; and it would be a hard matter to finde a man for whom you could be changed without losse. I see therefore your drift, you would not thinke the number of your Vertues compleate, if you added not humility, and you would make me see that there are Capuchine Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guenots. Indeede a fine noveltie, but it belongs not to you, to be so modest; nor to take upon you Perfection who have not yet attained Conversion. To speake uprightly, your respects and your submissions are not sufferable, men used to speake otherwise in the golden age; and to say nothing more hardly of you, you are too unjust a valuer of your selfe. Doe what you can, you are never any more able to weaken the Testimony which Madam <hi>de Loges,</hi> and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Chapelain</hi> have given of you, then you can deny me your friendship which I crave of you in their name. You see how contagious an ill example is; and how I imitate you in condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you. I can play the Reserved as well as you, and seeke for mediators and favour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that favour you have granted me already. These are the subtilties of my passion, to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3673:37"/>
end I may taste a second joy; I will make you tell me twice one thing; I will have you once again lay forth your letter to our former view, thereby to husband the better for so long time, the pleasure I take to heare you assure me that you love me. Such assurances should perswade me but little in the mouth of many men; but for you, I know with what Religion you make your promises, &amp; of what holinesse your word is. I know you approve of no lies, but those of the Muses, and that fictions in Poetry you can beare withall, but banish them from your conversation; I am glad therefore I have found one face among so many vyzards, and that I can lay hold of something, I can feele, and that hath truth in it. It is nothing but the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of my minde that gives mee the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to approach other vertues, with all which I am at defiance, if I finde not this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in their companie.

                     <p>SIR, since you will have me to write that in a letter, which I spake unto you by word of mouth, this Letter shall be a second te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony of the account I make of—, and of the feeling I have of the courtesies received from him. During the time wee had his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I considered him with much attention; but in my conscience observed nothing in the motions of his spirit, but great inclinations to great designes, and to see him doe wonders in the world, you neede wish him no more but matter of imployment. Hee hath all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendments of an honest man, all the Characters of a great Lord: by these he gaines mens eyes in present, and their hearts in expectation, and afterwards brings more goodnesse forth than ever he promised, and exceedes expectation with performance. And in truth, if this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick countenance had no wares to vent but vulgar qualities, this had beene a tricke put upon us by Nature, to deceive us by hanging out a false signe. The charge hee exerciseth in the Church, is no burden to him, hee hath in such sort acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modated his humour to it, that in the most painefull functions of so high a duty, there lies nothing upon his shoulders, but ease and delight. He embraceth generally all that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3673:39"/>
hee beleeves to be of the decencie of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and is neither tainted with the heate which accompanies the age wherein he is, nor with the varietie which such a birth as his doth commonly bring with it. In a word the way he takes goes directly to <hi>Rome.</hi> Hee is in good grace with both the Courts, and the Pope would be as willing to receive the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of him, as the King would be to give it. He hath brought from thence a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar approbation, and hath left behind him in all the holy Colledge a most sweete odour, and that without making faces; or making way to reputation by singularitie. For in effect, what heate soever there be in his zeale, hee never suffers it to blaze beyond custome: his piety hath nothing either weake or simple, it is seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous all and manly, and he protesteth, it is much better to imitate S. <hi>Charles,</hi> than to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit him. Concerning his passion of horses, which he calls his malady; since hee is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme in it, never counsell him to cure it, it is not so bad as either the Sciatica or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>out; and if he have no other disease but that, hee hath not much to doe for a Physitian. One may love Horses innocently, as well as Flowers and Pictures: and it is not the love of such things, but the intemperate love that is the vice. Of all beasts that have any commerce with men, there are none more noble nor better conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and of them a great Lord may honestly and without disparagement be curious. Hee indeede might well be said to be sicke of them,

who can sed mangers of Ivory to be made for them, and gave them, full measures of peeces of gold; this was to be sicke of them, to bestow the greatest part of his estate upon beautifying his Stable, and to make a mocke what men said or thought of chusing a Consull by his horses neighing. You shall give me leave to tell you another story to this purpose, not unpleasant. It is of <hi>Theophylact,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> who kept ordinarily two thousand horses, and fedde them so daintily, that in stead of Barley and Oates, which to our horses are a feast, hee gave them Almonds, Dates, and Pistache nuts; and more than this, as <hi>Cedrenus</hi> reports, he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them long time before in excellent wine, and prepared them with all sorts of precious odours. One day as hee was solemnizing his Office in the Church of Saint <hi>Sophia;</hi> one came and told him in his eare, that his Mare <hi>Phorban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> had foaled a Colt; with which hee was so ravished, that instantly without having the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience to finish his Service, or to put off his Pontificall Robes, hee left the mysteries in the midst, and ranne to his Stable to see the good newes hee had heard, and after much joy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed for so happy a birth, he at last returned to the Altar, and remembred himselfe of his dutie which the heate of his passion had made him to forget. See Sir, what it is to dote upon horses; but to take a pleasure in them, and to take a care of them, this no doubt may make a man bee said to love them: and neverthelesse not the lesse the wiser man.

Even Saints themselves have their pleasures and their pastimes, all their whole life is not one continued miracle; they were not every day foure and twentie houres in extasie amidst their Gifts, their Illuminations, their Raptures, their Visions; they had alwayes some breathing time of humane delight, during all which time they were but like us: and the Ecclesiasticall Story tells us, that the great Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who hath delivered Divinitie in so high a straine, yet tooke a pleasure, and made it his pastime to play with a Partridge which he had made tame and familiar to him.

                     <p>SIR, there is no more any merit in being devout; Devotion is a thing, so pleasing in your Booke, that even prophane persons find a rellish in it, and you have found out a way how to save mens soules with pleasure. I never found it so much as within this weeke, that you have fedde mee with the dainties of the antient Church, and feasted me with the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gapes</hi> of your Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> This man was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unknowne to me before, but I vow unto you, I knew him not before, but onely by sight; though I had sometimes beene neare unto him, yet I could never marke any more of him than his countenance and his outside: your Paraphrase hath made me of his counsell, and given me a part in his secrets; and where I was before but one of the Hall, I am now one of the Closet, and see clearely and distinctly what I saw before but in cloudes, and under shadowes. You are to say true, an admirable Decipherer of Letters, in some passages to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret your subtilty is a kinde of Devotion, &amp; thoroughout the manner of your expressing is a very charme. I am too proud to flatter you, but I am just enough to be a witnesse of the truth; and I vow unto you, it never perswades me more that when it borrowes your style.

There reflects from it a certaine flash which pleaseth instantly as beauty doth, and makes things to be lovely before one knowes they are to be loved. Your words are no way unworthy of your Authour, they neither weaken his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits by stretching them out at length, nor scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the sence by spreading it out in breadth. But contrariwise the powerfull spirit which was streightened within the bounds of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise stile, seemes to breath at ease in this new libertie, and to encrease it selfe as much as it spreads it selfe: hee seemes to passe from his fetters into triumph, and to goe forth of the prisons of <hi>Rome</hi> where <hi>Nero</hi> shut him up, to enter into a large kingdome, into which you bring him with royall magnificence.

                     <p>SIr I had heard that before, which you sent me word off by your footeman; and had rejoyced already, for the new Dignity of Mounsieur the President Segnier. It seemes you thinke he is made Keeper of the Seales, for none but for you, and that no Feast for the joy of it should be kept any where, but at <hi>Cadillac.</hi> Within these foure<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> daies, you shall see it kept all the Country over; it is a favour the King
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3673:43"/>
hath done the whole Realme. It is not so much for the purity of the Aire, and for the fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of the earth, that we ought to call it a happy yeare, as for the election of worthy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates. I therefore take a joy in this Newes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> Lam a Subject of the Kings; &amp; this is my first part of joy I have in it: but beyond this, I have a second Right of rejoycing, in that I am inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ressed in the advancement of a modesty, which I know; &amp; make account to be made happy, by the prosperity of him, of whose honesty I am assured. I put not forth this last word, at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture: I am ready to make it good, against whosoever shall thinke it rash, and I know he hath preservatives against all the Poysons of the Court; and a judgement that cannot be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with all the bribes of Fortune. There is nothing of so high a price, for which hee would be willing to leave his vertue: if hee had lived in <hi>Neroes</hi> time; he had beene a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Martyr, but living now under a just Prince he will proove a profitable Officer. To preserve a life, which is to continue but a few daies: he would not obscure that life, which ought to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ot upon his honour, would be more insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him, then the effusion of all his blood. He knowes that in the administration of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, being the Interpretor of God; he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not worke of himselfe; that this Divine Act ought to be a Generall Suspension from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane affections, and that in the exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he is no longer at his liberty, to shew love
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3673:43"/>
or hatred; revenge or gentlenesse. He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that he makes not law, but onely declares it, that he is a Minister, and not a Master of his Authority, and that the Soveraignty is in the Law, and not in himselfe. This is the reason why in every cause he censures, he bethinkes himselfe of his owne proper cause, which shall one day be censured; he so judgeth, as if Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity were to take a review of his Iudging; and as though the present time, were but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alternate to the future. Thus I have heard him to make his account; and from his Principles I have drawne my conclusions, and in a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence I had sometimes with him; he seemed to me a better man then I have set him forth. In such sort Sir, that I am not of a minde to contradict you, in your writing of him to me, you say nothing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not of my knowledg, &amp; in my writing of him to you, I do nothing but follow your conceits. Never feare that the common errors will deprave his Spirit, he hath laid too sure a foundation in the knowledge of Truth, he is too strongly confirmed in the good Sect. Having often and seriously meditated on the conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of humane affaires, he values them just as much as they are worth, but hee addes nothing by opinion, he hates neither riches nor authoritie; this were the peevish humour of the <hi>Cynicks,</hi> to hate a thing that in it selfe is lovely, he makes use of them after the manner of the Academy, and of the <hi>Lycaeum,</hi> which never thought them impediments to happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but rather aides and furtherances to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3673:44"/>
Or may we not say more probably that he hath drawne his doctrines from a Spring nearer hand; and that hee hath not gone out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to finde out the truest wisedome? Hee hath examples at home, which may serve him for <hi>Idaeas</hi> of perfection, and Sages in his owne race, which are Artists of vertuous life. Whilst he governes himselfe by their Rules, hee may well passe by all forraine doctrines; and having his diseased Vncle before his eyes; hee neede not care to have <hi>Socrates</hi> for a myrrour: <hi>Quippe malim unum Catonem quam trecentos Socratas.</hi> The memory of this illustrious personage is in such veneration thorough all <hi>France,</hi> and his name hath preserved so excellent an Odour in the prime Tribunall of Christendome; that it is not now so much the name of a Family; as it is the name even of integritie and constancy it selfe. Remember the Greeke Epigramme I shewed you in a Manuscript; which saith, that in a place at <hi>Athens</hi> when one named <hi>Plutarch,</hi> there was an Eccho answered Philosophy, as taking the one for the other, and making no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the two. By the like reason the Muses might use the same Figure, and act the like miracle, in favour of this new Pillar of justice. They never neede to use reservations; nor feare too deepe engaging themselves, whatsoever they lay forth before hand for his glory, shall all be allowed them againe in the reckoning. Having beene bredde up in their bosome; and being entred into their Sanctuary, he will never suffer them to stand waiting and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3673:44"/>
catch cold at his gate, no that a <hi>Swytzer</hi> shall keepe them out from entring his base Court. They shall never have I assure my selfe that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy advantage to have given him all; and receive backe nothing from him againe, to have enriched his minde with a thousand rare Knowledges, and then hardly get him to seale them an acquittance. Let us now come to the other part of your Letter; and assay to satisfie your Doctour concerning his Objection. Hee findes fault with me, because I praise the Pope for his beauty, and sayes that such praise is for women and youth, and belongs not to old men and Priests. First Sir I answer, he wrongs mee in changing my termes; for I make a great difference betweene beauty and a good Visage: of this I spake in the person of the Pope, and should never have thought I had committed a sinne, though I had spoken of the other also. As concerning age, you know there are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull old men, though there be not beautifull old women, and you remember that antient personage, who by report of History was of equall pleasing to all companies thorough all the ages of his life. As concerning the quality, besides that God rejected in sacrifice all leane and unsound Oblation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e required also to have hansome Priests, and you may shew your friend in the Bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> that not onely the lame and pore-blinde, but even the flat nosed, were exclused from being Ministers in sacrificing. But if being as he is a prophane Doctour, the holy Scriptures doe not please him; yet hee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3673:45"/>
might have remembred that old word of the <hi>Tragicke</hi> Poet, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, upon which I had an eye when I said, This Visage worthy of an Empire. And yet more being a <hi>Gascogne</hi> Doctour, I wounder hee never read the <hi>Panegyricke,</hi> which a countrie man of his pronounced at <hi>Rome</hi> before the Emperour <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius;</hi> where hee should have found these words; <hi>Augustissima quaeque species, plurimum creditur trahere de Coelo; sive enim Divinus ille animus venturus in corpus, dignum prius meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur hospitium, sive cum venerit fingit habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum pro habitu suo; sive aliud ex alio crescit; &amp; cum se paria junxerunt utraque major a sunt, parcam Arcanum Coeleste rimari; Tibi istud soli pateat imperator cum Deo consorte secretum. Illud dicam quod intellexisse hominem &amp; dixisse fas est; talem esse debere qui a gentibus adoratur cui toto orbe terrarum privata vel publica vota reddun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; a quo petit Navigaturus serenum, Peregrina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus reditum, Pugnaturus auspicium. Virtus tua meruit imperium, sed virtuti addidit forma suffragium. Jlla praestitit ut oporteret te principem sieri; haec ut deceret.</hi> In this discourse, there are some termes which yet may seeme fitter for a Pope than for an Emperour: and here is to be noted, that <hi>Theodosius</hi> was no young man, when <hi>Latinus Pacatus</hi> praised him thus for his beautie, for it was after his defeate of the tyrant <hi>Maximus;</hi> and when after many victories ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> hee was in full and peaceable possession of his glory. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before this <hi>Gregory Nazianzon</hi> had up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3673:45"/>
the Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> for his ill favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Visage, for the ill feature of his face, and for other deformities of his body, of which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse hee was not guilty. Though one might here question the holy Oratour, whether in doing this hee did well or no? Yet from hence wee may at least gather, that the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contrary to these hee blames, ought justly and may be lawfully made account of, and that such praises which reflect upon the Creatours glory, are much more Christian than those ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations which trench upon the scorning of his knowledge. Your friend therefore is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely more severe than hee neede to be. He is much to blame to reject in this sort the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of heaven, and the advantages of birth; and to imagine that holinesse cannot be Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar and Apostolicke, unlesse it be pale and leane, and looke like one were starved. These are the dreames of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who will have it, that our Saviour was in no sort beautifull, and therein gives the lie to all Antiquitie, and to the tradition of the whole Church. He drawes a Picture for him, which is not only injurious to his Divine, but dishonorable also to his humane Nature. This in my opinion is one of his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test errours, and which most of all startles me in reading his Bookes. If hee would have it, that his watchings and abstinence had dried up his blood, and made him looke gastly; it may perhaps be granted him: but to say, that to the burnt colour of <hi>Africke,</hi> hee added also that of burnt Melancholy, and of overflowing cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:3673:46"/>
I like not such accusing, either the Sunne of that countrie, or the temperature of that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but leave every one in his naturall estate; and so should he have done. But to goe about to disfigure the most beautifull amongst the children of men, and to eclipse all the beames and lustre of a divine countenance, this is an abuse which no patience can beare, no charitie can ever pardon. You wondered at this strange opinion when I last shewed it unto you; and I perceived you suspected I did him wrong; now therefore to justifie my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with you, and to let you ree I did it not to abuse you: I send you here the passages I promised you to looke at. The first is in his Booke of Patience; where Christ is called <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliosus sibi ipsi.</hi> The second in his Booke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Iewes,</hi> where hee is said to be, <hi>Ne aspectu quidem honestus,</hi> but heare the third, which will fright you to heare, in his Tract of the flesh of Christ; <hi>Adeo ut nec humanae honesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis corpus fuit; tacentibus apud nos quoque Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetis de ignobili aspectu ejus, ipsae passiones, ipsae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que contumeliae loquuntur; passiones quidem hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manam carnem; contumeliae vero inhonestam.

Certainely my censure is of this number; for I perceive beautie offends him, and hee
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3673:46"/>
would easily subscribe to <hi>Tertullians</hi> opinion. Yet say no more to him of all this, but that which hee must needes know, and spare sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out a second Processe against a man that hath too much of the first, and deserves you should take some care of his quiet; since hee is from the bottome of his heart,</p>

                     <p>SIR, It is told mee from all parts that you speake of me, as of one that is deare unto you, and of my ill fortune, as of a thing that concernes you. If this tendernesse proceeded from a soft effeminate spirit, yet it would not be without merit; and oblige me infinitely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you; but now that it comes from a feeling of the purest spirit in the world, and the least capable of weakenesse; how much ought I to esteeme it, and of how great price to value it? It wants not much of making m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e love that griefe which procures mee so glorious a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation; and I vow unto you, that to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:3673:47"/>
of you, is a more pleasing thing than to be favoured of the Court. In that country men goe upon snares and ruines, the best places there are so slippery that few can stand upright; and if the miserable pretenders avoid a sudden fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it is by enduring a tedious hanging, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving perpetuall affronts, and returning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall submissions. I therefore like much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to hide my selfe here with your good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and my owne good quiet, than to beare a shew there with their frights and soure lookes; and I blesse the winds, and count my Shipwracke happy which hath cast mee backe upon my old home. Some that were more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible than my selfe, would in this case com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of the world; but I content my selfe to forget it: I will neither have warre, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the world: I have sounded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate to all my passions; as well those that be troublesome as those that be pleasing; and I protest unto you Sir, I should reade with more delight, a relation of one of your walkes at <hi>Cadillac,</hi> then the most delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some passage of all the <hi>German</hi> History; when I thinke upon you in company with—, me thinks I see <hi>Laelius</hi> come to visite <hi>Scipio,</hi> and confirming him in the resolution he hath taken to stand a loofe from the tumults and turbulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of worldly affaires, and by a quiet retreate to place his vertue, and his glory in a sure hold. I am extreamely glad of the honour hee will doe my father to passe this way, and bring you along with him; and you may well thinke

I am well assured Sir that I honour you infinitely, but am infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unsatisfied to offer you so meane a thing; there is no reasonable man that doth not as much, and since so much is due to you for onely your vertue, how much am I to pay you more for your affection?

Ever since the time

he renounced his errour, hee hath continued firme and stedfast in the doctrine you taught him: of an erronious Christian you made him an Orthodox, and your hand is too happy to plant any thing that doth not prosper. He is therefore your workemanship in Christ Iesus, and otherwise so perfect a friend of mine that I know not, if in the order of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ought not to set him in equall ranke with my owne brother. This at least I know, that the least of his businesses is the greatest of mine, and I will not onely part your favour betweene him and me, but will become your debtour for the whole my selfe alone. I am now polishing those writings which I had condemned, but that you asked their pardon; and since it is your will they should not perish, I revoke my sentence, and I am resolved your selfe shall be the other person of my Dialogue; after the example of that Roman you love so well, whose bookes of Philosophie are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly his conferences with <hi>Brutus,</hi> or other Sages, the true and naturall judges of such matters; yet Sir it is impossible for me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble any longer a griefe I have at my heart, and to end my Letter without letting you see a little cut you have given me there; you made me a promise to come backe by <hi>Balzac,</hi> and now you have taken another way: Thus the wise men of the East dealt with <hi>Herod;</hi> yet I am neither tyrant nor enemy to the Sonne of God.

                     <p>SIR, since you have taken pleasure in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging me, I will not have you have the greefe to loose your obligation, nor that my incompetent acknowledgment should make you have the lesse stomacke for doing good. I know your goodnesse is cleare and free from all forreigne respects, and hath no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but it selfe; it is not at any mans prayers that the Sunne, riseth neither doth he shine the more for any mans thankes; your courtesies are of like condition: Your favours have not beene procured by my making suite; and as of my part nothing hath gone before the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses I have received, so on your part I assure my selfe you expect not that any thing should follow them; yet something must bee done for examples sake, and not to give this colour for shewing little courtesie to such as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine

that men are ungratefull. The place where you are is full of such people; all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merces are but Amusements, and to make men beleeve the whole world is given to deceive; and it is a great merit in you that you can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low so forlorne and solitary a thing as truth is; in a Country where Divines maintaine her but weakely, and where shee dares scarce bee seene in a Pulpit, doth it not shew an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary courage to take upon him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute her amongst the pretenders, and that in open Theater? It is no meane hardinesse to be good at the Court, to condemne false Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes where they have made a Sect, and where they have gotten the force of Lawes. I have beene assured you make profession of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult vertue, and that in the greatest heate of calumnie; and the coldest assistance that ever a poore innocent had, you have beene passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately affected in my behalfe, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unknowne unto you, but by the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of my ill fortune, and even at this present you are taking care of some affaires of mine which I in a manner had abandoned, and upon the report you heard of my negligence you make mee offer of your paines and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie.

                     <head>To Mounsieur <hi>du Pleix,</hi> the Kings Historiographer. LETTER. XXIX.</head>
                     <p>SIR, since the time that persecution hath broken out into flames against mee, I never received more comfortable assistance then from your selfe, and I account your strength so great, that I cannot doubt of the goodnesse of a cause which you approve. You were bound by no Obligation to declare your selfe in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, and you might have continued Neutrall with decencie enough, but the noblenesse of your minde hath passed over these petty rules of vulgar Prudence; and you could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to see an honest man oppressed, without taking him into your protection. This is to shew mee too much favour in a Kingdome where Justice is no better than Mercenary, and where paiment comes not, but after long solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing. I know well that the soundest part is of my side; and that my state is not ill amongst the wise; but on the other side, there are so many opposites on the By, make warre upon mee; that I am ready to leave my selfe to the mercy of the multitude, and to be perswaded by the number of my enemies, that I am in the wrong. It is therefore no small Obligation I am bound to you in, that you have preserved the libertie
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3673:51"/>
of your judgement amidst the altercations and factions of passionate men, and have taken the paines to cleare a truth, which is to mee of great advantage, and was to you of small importance. I doe not desire that men should count me lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; this qualitie hath often troubled the peace of the Church; and they are not the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that make Schismes and Heresies. And lesse I pretend to the art of well speaking; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bad Citizens have used this as an instrument to ruine their country, and a dumbe Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is much more worth than an ill minded eloquence. That which I desire, and which would trouble me much to have taken from me is honesty; of which onely I make profession, and without which wee are never able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine salvation, where with all the Greeke and Latine of our Books we may incurre perdition. Mounsieur <hi>Gyrard,</hi> a man you dare trust, and one that hath never borne false witnesse, will answer for me concerning this last point. Hee hath seene my soule to the very bottome, and can assure you without deceiving you, that I am no lover of vice; and if you desire assurance that I am an extreme lover of vertue, hee will enter into bond for me that I am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, that sorrow is happie which hath you for a comforter. I finde more contentment in your compassionating me, then I finde affliction in others persecuting mee: and I am farre from wishing ill to an age, to which I am beholding for so excellent a friend. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I easily pardon it, the wrong you say, it hath done me; and should be more unjust than it selfe is; if being beholding to it for a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; I should thinke much to partake of its iron and rust. It is not now onely that opinion governes the world; there hath beene dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against Reason in all ages. Contentions and Heresies have ever beene, and the truth it selfe was not beleeved, when it came into the world in person and would have spoken. I seeke not the favour of the multitude, it is seldome gotten by honest and lawfull meanes; and in that Enchanters have advantage over Prophets. I seeke the testimonie of few; I number not voyces but weigh them: and to shew what I am, one honest man is Theater enough. Therefore never trouble your selfe that things have befallen me as I made account they would, and never aske for reason of the vulgar who have it not. Ignorance can never be just, nor goe right in the darke: Alarums
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3673:52"/>
are given, and surprizes are made by the favour of night: this is the time of murthers and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, shee the mother of dreames and phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes. Your selfe have had your part in this experience as well as others. And at this very time I am talking with you, it may be you are accused by some for being a miscreant, for not beleeving that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> made prayers to God for <hi>Trajans</hi> soule; or that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was ever a bosome friend of <hi>Seneca.</hi> It may be you are called <hi>Haguenot</hi> for doubting the infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Philarchus,</hi> and denying some of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. It may be you are charged with seeking in vaine to perswade a Master of Art, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> had as much learning as <hi>Ramus;</hi> and that <hi>Ciceroes</hi> stile is as good as that of <hi>Lipsius.</hi> What shall I say more? It may be your deare and well beloved <hi>Martiall</hi> puts you to more paines to defend him than to imitate him: some Scholler of <hi>Muret</hi> maintaine boldly against you, that hee is a beastly Buffon; and perhaps the contrary will not be beleeved upon your bare word.</p>

                     <p>SIR, my deare cousin, if I could with any honesty leave the businesse I have in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goumois:</hi>—should not goe into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> without me; and I would make this journey of purpose onely to have the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse to embrace you; you would know mee presently by the old yellownesse of my face; and thereupon the force of blood would draw along with it a little tendernesse, and I doe not beleeve but you would make a difference betweene your owne and strangers. The effects of Grace destroy not the affections of Nature; they onely take away that which is impure and earthly; and I assure my selfe you doe not love me lesse than you did, but that you love me in a better fashion. I am told that the kinde of life you have chosen is not austere, but onely to your selfe, and that your thornes pricke no body else; in truth, a devotion that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3673:53"/>
pleaseth me exceedingly, and I could never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with this studied sadnesse, which disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the hatred it beares to men, under pretence of the love of God. I am right glad you have taken the other way, because wee may now come safely to you, and never be afraid your vertue should scratch us. Christian Philosophie hath nothing in common with the Cynicke. This disguiseth, and that reformeth; one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the countenance, the other regulates the spirit; and indeede without an exact mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the superiour part: all the paine that is taken about the inferiour is to no purpose with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, Mortification is not so good as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalitie; and if you doe nothing but change your cloath of gold for a russet coate; and your cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke band for a demy collar, you shall no doubt be a loser by the change. But the case is not so; you have left cares and trouble, for calmenesse and quiet; and you possesse a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse which Kings can neither keepe with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, nor suffer amongst their neighbours; I speake of Peace, which in vaine is expected from their Alliances and from their Leagues, being not to be obtained but onely of God, and who gives it not but to his friends. You are a happy man to be of that number, and you may beleeve mee that I am not troubled about it, seeing there is good hope I may have a benefit by it my selfe, and that your prayers may draw mee after you, I doubt not but they are of great power and efficacie, and doubt as little that I am my selfe of the number of those you hold

                     <head>To Mounsieur <hi>D' Andilly,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor of the King in his Counsels. LETTER XXXII.</head>
                     <p>SIR, I perceive that Mounsieur the great Master is a great extender of Expositions, and hath tied you to explaine your selfe in a matter whereof I never doubted. Herein hee hath exceeded his Commission, and done more than hee had in charge to doe. I seeke no new assurance of your friendship; this were to shew a distrust in the old, whereas the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already laidis such that makes me forbeare even ordinary duties, for feare I should make shew to neede them, and as if I would hold by any other strength then your owne inclination. Care and diligence, and assiduitie are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the true markes of sincere affections, which I speake in your behalfe as my owne:
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3673:54"/>
Truth walkes now a dayes with a lesse traine, men use not to make open profession of it, but rather to confesse it as a sinne: her enemies are strong and open, her adherents weake and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret: yet Sir, if she were in more disgrace, and were driven out of <hi>France</hi> by Proclamation: I should beleeve you would be her receiver, and to finde her out, I should goe directly to <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone.</hi> I therefore never doubted of your love; God keepe me from so evill a thought, onely I marvelled that—knew nothing of it, and that you let him take possession of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, without recommending unto him, your friends there. To satisfie my selfe in this point; I said in my minde, that certainely this proceeded from the great opinion you had of his justice; and that conceiving there would not be with him any place for Grace or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; you would not doe me a superfluous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. This is the interpretation I made of an omission, which in appearance seemed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you; and this is the conjecture I made of your silence, before I came to know the cause. Now I see I was in the wrong, to imagine you had such subtill considerations; or that you were restrained by such a cowardly wisedome which dares not assure the good to be good, least such assuring should corrupt it. For my part I renounce a prudence that is so dastardly and scrupulous, that feares to venture a word for a vertuous friend, because this friend is a man, and may perhappes lose his vertue. You doe much better than so, and Pam glad to find you
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3673:55"/>
not so jealous of the glory of your judgement, but that you can be contented to be slighted and scorned, when it is for the benefit of a friend you love: let us leave fleame and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to old Senatours; and never make que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether wee ought to call them infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of age, or fruits of reason: These are good qualities for enabling men to judge of criminall causes, but are nothing worth for making men fit to live in societie: and he, of whom it was said, that all he desired, hee desired extremely, seemes to mee a much honester man than those that desire so coldly; and are so indifferent in their desires. If you were not one of these vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reasonable men, and had not some of this good fire in your temper, I should not have your approbation so good cheape. That which now galls you would not at all touch you; and things which now descend to the bottome of your soule, would passe away lightly before your eyes. There came yesterday a man to see me, who is not so sensible of the pleasures of the minde, and tooke great pitty of me and my Papers: hee told me freely that of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges which require study, he made reckoning of none but such onely as are necessary for life; and that he more valued the stile of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ry than that of <hi>Cicero;</hi> he more esteemed the penning of a Chancery Bill, than the best pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Oration that ever <hi>Cicero</hi> writ. I thought this at first a strange compliment, but thinking well of it, I thought it better to seeme to be of his opinion, then undertake to cure a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3673:55"/>
I therefore answered him, that the Patriarch <hi>Calarigstone</hi> so famous for the peace of <hi>Uervins,</hi> was in a manner of his minde, who being returned from his Embassage, and asked what rate and admirable things hee had seene at <hi>Paris;</hi> made mention of none but their Cookes shoppes; saying to every body, as it were with exclamation <hi>Ueramente quelle rostisseries sono Cosa stupenda;</hi> as much as to say that there are <hi>Barbarians</hi> elsewhere, then at <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco.</hi> One halfe of the world doth not so much as excuse that which you praise: our merchandise is cried downe long since, and to bring it into credit againe and put it off, there had neede returne into the world, some new <hi>Augustus</hi> and <hi>Antoninus.</hi>—saith, that whilst he waites for the resurrection of these good Princes; hee is resolved to rest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and not to publish his Verses, till they shall be worth a Pistole a peece. I feare it will be long ere we shall see this Edition come forth; for my selfe who make no such recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of my Prose; I have no purpose to make merchandise of it; yet desire I not nither to tire my hands with writing continually to no profit. I meane to make hereafter no other use of my Penne, then to require my friends to let mee heare of their healths; and to assure you Sir, that I am no mans more,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I had a great lon ging to see—and you have done me a speciall kindnesse to send it mee over. Yet I must tell you, that your sending it gets him a greater respect with me then his owne deserving, and if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point me not to make some reckoning of him, all that I shall doe for his owne sake, will bee but to beare with him. A man had neede be of a sanguine complexion, and in a merry veine before that should be mooved to laugh at his poore jests. Melancholicke men are too hard to be stird, that which goes to the Centre of other mens hearts stayes without doores in theirs, at least it toucheth but very weakely the outside; and oftentimes I am so sadly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposde and in so sullen an humour, that if a Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be not excellent I cannot thinke him tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable nor indure to heare him. It is certaine the <hi>Italians</hi> are excellent in the art of jeasting, and I could marke you out a passage in <hi>Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cace</hi> that would have made—and all his predecessours the Stoick Philosophers to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit their gravitie. But there are not two <hi>Boccaces,</hi> nor two <hi>Ariostoes,</hi> there are many that thinke themselves pleasant when they are indeede ridiculous; I would our good—would leave his wrangling about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3673:57"/>
and fall to this kinde of writing, in which in my opinion hee would prove excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. This would draw his Genius out of Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and give it the extent of all humane things to play in; onely he should spare the Church for her eldest sonnes sake, and forbeare the Pope for M. the Cardinalls sake, one of the Princes of his Court. These are respects you ought to have, untill your conversion furnish you with other more religious, and change this your honest civilitie into a true devotion. If we be not bound to speake of mens-honour reverently, yet we are bound to speak seriously, and even at this day we call <hi>Lucian</hi> an Atheist, for scoffing at those Gods who we know were false. For the rest Sir, I pray take heede you shew not my Letter to—, he would give me a terrible checke in behalfe of—, hee would not indure I should speake so insolently of an Author approved by the Academie, <hi>De gli insensati de Perouse,</hi> and indeede I had not spoken as I did, but that I dare trust your si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and know, that to discover a secret to you is to hide it.

                     <head>To the same another. LETTER. XXXIIII.</head>
                     <p>SIR, I am going to a place where in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good of you I shall finde no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and where your vertue is so well knowne, that if I say nothing of it but what I know, I am sure I shall tell no newes. I bring along with me the last Letter you writ unto me, and meane to bee earnestly intreated by Mounsieur—before I yeeld to grant him a Coppy. As for Madam—shee should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine an enemy upon this passeport, and though shee were resolved to give me no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, yet shee would never deny it to the reader of your writings. I know of what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count you are in her heart, and how much I ought to feare least all the roome there be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up before hand with your favour. Yet such opinion I have of her justice, that I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly make her Arbitratour of our difference, and require her to tell whether she think I have done wrong to—in desiring him to give over his going to Law, and to passe the rest of his dayes in more quiet and sweet imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The art of jeasting, whereof I speake is no enemy to the art of morality whereof you speake, rather it is the most subtle and most antient way of retailing it; And that which would fright men, being used in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3673:58"/>
forme, delights and winnes them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, being used under a more pleasing maske. A wisedome that is dry, and altogether raw, is it for the heart? it must have a little seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, such a kind of sawce as <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to make it; that <hi>Socrates</hi> I say whom all the Families of Philosophers account their Founder, and acknowledge for their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch. The story sayes he never used to speake in earnest, and the age hee lived in called him the feoffer. In <hi>Platoes</hi> Booke you shall finde little else of him but jeasting; with disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly persons you shall see him counterfet a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a Drunkard, thereby to claw them whom he would take. He shunnes the stile of the Dogmatists, or to speake definitively of things, as thinking it an instrument of Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and a yoake that oppresseth our libertie. In short he handles serious matters so little seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously that hee seemes to thinke the shortest way to perswade was to please; and that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue had neede of delight, to make way for her into the soule. Since his time there have come men who contented not themselves with laughing, but make profession of nothing else, and have made it their recreation to play upon all the actions of humane life. Others have disguised themselves into Courtiers and Poets, and left their Dilemmaes and their Syllogismes to turne jcasters, and to get audience in privie Chambers. Wee see then the world had not alwayes beene sad before <hi>Ariosto</hi> and <hi>Bernia</hi> came into it, they were not the men that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3673:59"/>
brought it first to be merry; Ieasting is no new invention, it was the first trade that wise men used; who thereby made themselves sociable amongst the people. <hi>Theophrastus</hi> who succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Aristotle</hi> thought it no disparagemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> to Philosophie, nor that there was in it any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comlinesse unfit for his schoole <hi>Lycaeum,</hi> he is excellent at descriptions, and counterfeitings, and his Characters are as so many Commedies, but that they bee not divided into Acts and Senes, and that they represent but onely one person. <hi>Seneca,</hi> as solemne and of as sullen hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as he was otherwise, yet once in his life would needs bee merry, and hath left us that admirable <hi>Apotheosis</hi> of <hi>Claudius,</hi> which if it were lost, I would with all my heart give one of his bookes <hi>de Beneficiis</hi> to recover againe; and a much greater ransome if it were possible to get it entire. No doubt but you have heard speake of the <hi>Caesars,</hi> of the Emperour <hi>Iulian;</hi> that is to say, of the sports of a severe man, and of the mirth of a melancholicke man, and from whence thinke you had the <hi>Menippaean</hi> Satyrs their names? Things so much estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of by antiquity, and under which title the learned <hi>Varro</hi> comprised all wisedome divine and humane; even from <hi>Menippus</hi> the Philosopher, who was of a Sect so austere, and so great an enemie to vice, that <hi>Iustus lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> doubts not to set it in comparison with the most strict and reformed order of the Church. I am much deceived but Madam—will not bee found so scrupulous as you, and not
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3673:59"/>
give her voyce in favour of an opinion autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised by so great examples. And indeede Sir, why should you not like that our friend should reserve some mirth and some plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure for his old age? and having declaimed and disputed abroad all day, should come at night to have some merry talke in his owne lodging; why should you thinke it amisse, that after so many warres and cumbats I should counsaile him to refresh himselfe with a more easie and lesse violent kinde of writing; and to afford us such wares as may bee received as well at <hi>Rome</hi> as at <hi>Geneva?</hi> These thirty yeares he hath bin a Fencer upon Paper, &amp; hath furnished all <hi>Europe</hi> with such spectacles; why should hee not now give over a quarrell that he is never able to compose? He may in my opinion honestly say, <hi>it is enough,</hi> and content himselfe to have outlived his old adversaries, without staying to looke for new. Having had to doe with Mounsieur <hi>Coeffeteau,</hi> and with Cardinall <hi>Perron;</hi> it would bee a shame for him to meddle now with a dizzy headed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or with the Anticke of <hi>Roan;</hi> and a poore ambition it would be in my judgement to erect Trophies of two such broken Bables; it were better hee left <hi>individualls</hi> and fell to judge of <hi>species</hi> in generall, and that he would consider other mens follies without partaking of them. It were better to discredit vice by scorne, then to give it reputation by invectives, and to laugh with successe, then to put himselfe in Choler without profit. Though there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3673:60"/>
sorts of disciplining men, and correcting their manners; yet I for my part am for this sort, and finde nothing so excellent as a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine that pleases. Many men feare more the bitternesse of the potion that is given them, then the annoyance of the infirmitie that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends them; we would faine goe to health by a way of pleasure, and he should bee a much abler man that could purge with <hi>Raspices,</hi> then he that should do it with <hi>Rhubarbe.</hi> Our Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman by—his leave is none of these; for commonly hee neither instructs nor delights, he neither heales nor flatters their passions that reade him; hee hath neither inward treasure nor outward pompe; and yet I can tell you, as beggarly and wretched as hee is, hee hath beene robbed and ransacked in <hi>France.</hi> Hee could not save himselfe from our Theeves; and you may see some of his spoiles which I present you here.</p>

This is an accident which I reckon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst my misfortunes; and I cannot suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently complaine of this Violatour of the law of Nations, who hath beene so cruell as to breake our Commerce, the very first day of our entring into it; and to make mee poore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making himselfe rich. I am more troubled for this losse, than for all that shall be said or written against mee: Slander hath a goodly catch of it to be at warre with mee, it shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make me yeeld; it is an evill: is it not a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for a private man to be handled in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as Princes and their Officers are? And is it not a marke of greatnesse to be hated of those one doth not know? I never sought after the applause of—, which cannot chuse but have corrupt affections in such sort, that when they praise me, I should aske what fault I had
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:3673:62"/>
done? Though their number were greater than you make it, this would be no great novelty to me, who know that truth goes seldome in the throng; and hath in all times beene the Possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but of a few. Even at this day, for one Christian there are sixe Mahometans; and there was a time, when <hi>Ingemuit orbis, &amp; se Arria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num esse miratus est.</hi> If God suffer men to be mistaken in matters of so great importance, where their salvation is at stake; why should I expect hee should take care to illuminate them in my cause which no way concernes them; and to preserve them from an errour which can doe them no hurt? Whether I be learned or ignorant; whether my eloquence be true or false, whether my Pearles be Orientall, or but of <hi>Venice:</hi> what is all this to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? There is no cause the publicke should trouble it selfe about so light a matter; and the fortunes of <hi>France</hi> depend not upon it. Let the Kings subjects beleeve what they list; let them enjoy the libertie of conscience which the Kings Edicts allow them.

                     <p>SIR, I am unfortunate, but I am not faulty. I was assured you had written to me, but I received not your letters. You have beene my defendour; and I have beene a long time without knowing to whom I was bound for defending me: whether it were a man or an Angell that was come to my suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour. These are honest injuries, and generous supererogations. This is to deceive in charitie, and to his advantage that is deceived. This is to bring againe that good time, wherein Knights unknowne to become free-men, that were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed without telling their names; or so much as lifting up the Beavers of their Helmets. You have done in a manner the like; you have hidden your selfe under a borrowed shape; thereby to take away from a good action, all apparence of vaineglory; and to let them that are interessed, see, that you are vertuous with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking for reward. For my selfe, I doe not thinke I am bound to follow the intention
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3673:63"/>
of this scrupulous vertue. If you have a will to shun noise, and the voice of the people; yet you cannot refuse the acknowledgement of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man: nor let me from paying what I owe you. Because you are modest, I must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ungrateful, as I am not by my good will, I assure you. You possesse my heart, as absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as you have justly purchased it; I am yours by all the sorts of right, not forgetting that of the warres. I will even beleeve that my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie hath gotten a full victory, to the end I may more justly call you my Redeemer; and that you may have the crowne that was due to him had saved a citizen.

                     <p>SIR, I have too great a care of your reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to seeke to have you be found a liar. It shall not lie upon mee, that you be not a man of your word; and that your friend is not contented; and seeing it is expected to see this present day what I have written of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; It is not fit to put off till to morrow the effect of your promise: or that hee should lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish in the expectation of so small a thing. It is true my Booke is not here, and my memory is not now so faithfull, that I dare trust it to deliver that I gave it to keepe: yet I conceive after I have stined it up in your name, which is so deare unto me, I shall finde enough to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your desire, and receive from it this good office. I seeme therefore to remember I said, that after so many yeares, that the Christian Muses have beene in <hi>France:</hi> hee is the onely man hath entertained them with honour; and hath built a Pallace for this soveraigne science to which all other are subject and inferiour. He hath drawne her out of an obscure and close mansion, where like the poore <hi>Socrates</hi> she discoursed in prison of the supreme felicity, to place her in a seate worthy of her, and to set
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3673:64"/>
up a stately and sumptuous race for the exercise of her children. From hence wee may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the dignitie and merit of our Sorbone: for which a man the fullest of businesse in all the world, hath yet had so particular a care amidst the most violent agitation of his thoughts, that the designe of the house hee crects for her, hath found place in his breast, amidst the Forts and Rampires of <hi>Rochell.</hi> If our predecessors the <hi>Gaules</hi> next to their gods, gave the second place of honour to their <hi>Druides,</hi> who shewed them but a dimme and confused light of the state of our soules after this life; what respect then, what reverence can be too great for those venerable Fathers, who teach us by a knowledge most infallible; what the chiefe and supreme good is; who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us in certainty, the things that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the heavens, who make us true relation of that admirable commonwealth of happie citizens that live without bodies, and are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>materiall; and who deliver to us the wounders of the intellectuall world, more pertinently and more directly, than wee relate to blinde men the ornaments of this visible world.

lustre. Seing the memory of the most part of the <hi>Romane</hi> Lords is perished together with their Baths, their Aqueducts, their Races, their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheaters; whereof the very ruines are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ruined and lost; I find that M. the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall understands more than ever they did, and goes a straighter way to eternity, travelling in a place where his travell can never perish &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the care of his name to a company that of necessitie shall be immortall, and shall speake of his magnificence as long as there shall be spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Sinne and Grace, of good and evill Angells, of the paines and rewards of the life to come. I assure my selfe I have not spoken too much; and I thinke I could not have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lesse: it is lawfull for us to set a price upon our owne; and if an antient writer said, that more worthy men came forth of <hi>Isocrates</hi> Schoole; then out of the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horse: why may not we say as much of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Thomas?</hi> Me thinks I know not how to speake to our countrimen, but of the <hi>Lycaeum</hi> and of the Academy: and it is now five and twenty yeares that I have beaten my braines about the Gymnosophists the Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and the Rabbins: but when all is done, wee should remember that wee are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians; and that we have Philosophers that are nearer to us, and ought to be dearer to us then all they.

I now therefore send you an Edition of it reformed, done expresly for you, and which I have taken care to cleanse from the staines, that in the two former were distastefull to you.

All this have I already done; and although in that unhappy passage which gave you distaste: I had not somuch a meaning to bite as to laugh; yet I confesse I tooke my marke amisse for laughing justly. Oftentimes one countenance for another changeth the face of the most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent action of the world: and though I failed onely in ill explaning my selfe; yet it was fault enough, seeing thereby I gave you cause to doubt of my intention. Truly, my Lord, it was never my meaning so much as to touch the resplendent glory of your divine Princesse. I know well enough, it was fitter to consider her by the magnanimity of her spirit; whereof your whole posteritie shall taste the fruits, then by the light flower of bodily beauty; which not onely falls away by death; but runs away at the very first approaches of age. I should come out of another world, if I were ignorant of the <hi>Encomiums</hi> shee hath in this kinde received by all peoples voyces. She hath I know beene stiled the Starre of the North:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3673:66"/>
the goddesse of the sea; the true <hi>Thetis.</hi> I have read in a Letter, which <hi>Henry</hi> the great writ unto her in the hight of all his troubles; and in the violence of the league: these words, <hi>I will Madam be your Captaine Genorall.</hi> Even hee that excommunicated her, spake of her with honour: and hee was, as you know, an understanding Prince, and admirable in the Art of Ruling. Hee tooke a pleasure to be discoursing of her with Embassadours resident at his Court; and would sometimes say merily, that if hee had beene her husband, certainely Greatnesse and Authority would have beene the issues of so renowned a marriage. But though she had not ascended to this high degree of reputation, and though shee should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested of all these glorious markes of honour; yet there are two considerations; lesse speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous indeede in the eyes of the world: but more sensible to my spirit, that would binde mee strongly to reverence her memory: One Sir, that she hath not scorned our Muses; the other, that shee hath loved your house. I was taught by <hi>Cambden,</hi> the knowledge shee had in all kindes of learning; so farre, as that she had happily Translated out of Greeke into Latine some of <hi>Sophocles</hi> Tragedies; and some of <hi>Isecrates</hi> Orations. Of the same Authour also, I have learned the great part your Ancestours bare in her confidence and secrets; and your name is so often used in the history of her life, that where soever <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is mentioned, there <hi>Cicile</hi> for the most part is never left out.

                     <p>SIR, I have never beene sociable since your departure from hence; no man can make me speake; and I doe not yet breake my sullen silence, but onely to tell you, I am the saddest Hermite that ever was. Those whom Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> reports to have beene companions of Serpents and Scorpions, were never of so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward an humour as I, for I have their vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and I have not their consolation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pleaseth mee in the place where I am; you have carried away with you all its worth and goodnesse, and it is not the hardnesse of the season, it is your absence that obscures the beauties of my solitude. It was not well done
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3673:67"/>
Sir to accustome mee to a pleasure which you meant so suddenly to take away from me, or to say better, to shew mee onely my good fortune thereby to procure me envie, and then goe presently and make others happy with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it; and yet I know well, that such petty considerations owe obedience to a greater, and that particular interests ought alwayes to give place to publicke. Mine therefore is not so deare unto me, but that I willingly forget it upon such occasions, and easily forgoe my owne conceits, to enter upon the purpose of divine providence. The peace wee hope for shall perhaps by your voyage be advanced, and you are now perhaps sent from heaven to goe whither you thought to have gone without commanding; If peradventure there be found some particular men that are too much heated, your <hi>Eusebius</hi> and your <hi>Theodoret</hi> will helpe to allay their heate, and if they be too stifly bent upon severitie, you will make them abate their rigour by the examples you bring them, of the moderation of their fathers; I have too good an opinion of so many worthy Prelates as are in your assemblies, to imagine they would ever agree to arme Princes, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a penitent, or against an honest man, mistaken; and would not in the interests of their order content themselvs with imploying the Thunderbolts of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> but would doe their uttermost to call forth also those of the <hi>Arsenall;</hi> Whatsoever may be sayd in defence of such proceeding, it can never in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3673:68"/>
have so generall approbation, but that some honest spirits will bee scandalized by it. This would bee to bring excommunication into a poore account, to make it serve onely for an Essay, and for a preparative of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to make it the first plaster of a light wound, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ought to be the last remedy of the extremest evills. Such practise would be farre from the custome of the antient Christianitie, and of the age of Martyrs; and I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, neither can it be, that Christian Pastors should become Butchers of their Flocke; and that the Church which hither to hath beene in persecution, should now it selfe begin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secure. This Church Sir, as your selfe and my masters your brethren teach us, is not a cruell Stepdame, proud and maligning her spouses children; but it is a naturall mother, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning her owne, and desirous to adopt even Proselytes and strangers: You tell us that shee runnes after the greatest sinners, and goes as a guide before all the world, which is farre from saying that it stands not with her dignitie to be an instrument of their conversion, nor so much as once to take care what becomes of them; It is you who assure us that shee is content to lose her richest vessels, so as thereby shee may recover the sacriledge of her robbers; it is from you wee learne that shee is farre from animating justice to ruine innocents, who gives sanctuary of pardon to Delinquents. I have heard speake of the sweet nature and signing of the Dove; but never of her cruelty
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3673:68"/>
nor of her roaring; and to give her clawes and teach her to love blood, would be no lesse then to make her a Monster; this would bee Sir to make love it selfe turne wilde, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphise it into hate. This would bee to imitate the antient Pagans, who attributed to their gods all the passions and infirmities of men; no man I hope shall be able to lay such prophanation to our charge, wee will be no corrupters of the most excellent puritie, no handlers of holy things with polluted hands, no stretchers of our defects to the highest point of perfection: They which doe so, in what part of the world soever they be, are Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes in your Bookes, accursed in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, condemned by the rules of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and by the examples of your life. These false Saints doe not serve Christ, but serve themselves of Christ; they sollicite their owne affaires in his name, and recommend it as his cause when it is their owne suite. Periwasion that they doe well makes them more hardy in doing ill; they call their choller zeale, and when they kill, they thinke they sacrifice. Thankes be to God no part in the whole body of our Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie is so unsound; it is returned to its oyle, and to its balme, in whose place the civill warres had substituted deadly Aconite and bitter Wormewood. The League is dead, and <hi>Spaine</hi> heartsicke, our Oracles are no longer inspired by forreigne Deities, the spirit of love and charity animates all our Congregations; and no doubt he that ought to be the mouth of the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3673:69"/>
assembly, will consider that Bishops are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of mercy, and not of justice; and that to them our Lord said, <hi>I leave peace with you,</hi> but said not I leave vengeance with you; the wisedome of M. the Cardinall will strip off all the thorny prickles of passions, and sweeten all the bitternesse of figures, before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to come neare the King. This divine spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is farre surmounting all orations, all delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and all humane affaires, and in this he will easily finde a temper both to preserve the honour of the Church, and yet not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the humilitie of him that submits, both to give full satisfaction to the first order, and yet not withdraw regard from the merit of the second; both to make us see heads bowed and knees bended before the Altars; and yet no houses demolished, nor governments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, whereof the Altars should receive no benefit. I am in hope you will doe me the favour to informe me of the occurrents of the whole history, whereof I doubt not, but you are your selfe one of the principall parties, and I expect by your letters a true relation of all the newes that runnes about. In the meane time Sir, I trust you will not take it ill that I speake unto you of this great affaire, as a man that sees it a farre off; and whom you appoint sometimes to deliver his advise upon matters, of which he hath but small understanding. At your returne we will renue the Commerce we have discontinued, and since you will have it so, I will once againe play the Oratour, and the

If you make so great account of good desires, I merveile what price you set upon good deeds; and if you thus bestow your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments without necessitie, I feare you, will want them when you have neede; you should goe more reserveldy to worke, and retaine more providence for the future. A man may be a good husband, and yet not bee covetous; and seeing limits and bounds are fit in all cases, they cannot bee unfit in the case of courtesie: Thinke not therefore Sir, that herein you have done an act of acknowledgement, you have gone farre beyond the bounds of this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. If there be a vice opposite to ungratefulnes, your too great officiousnesse hath made you fall into it, and by the excesse you have avoided the defect. The interests of M. the Cardinall <hi>Bentivoglio</hi> have no neede of recommending, but amongst people that are not yet Civilized; that which concernes his honour, is no matter of indifferencie to them that know his vertue, and they that know it not are no better then Barbarians. If to doe him service I had not run whither you prayed me to goe, and if I had not required an absolute suppression of that discourse, whereof you required onely but a sweetning; I had performed my duty but very weakely, and had deserved blame in that for which you praise me. Though his name were not resplendent in history, nor his dignitie in the Church, yet he should have I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>stre enough in his very stile and writings, and though he were not a grandchild of Kings,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3673:70"/>
and a Senatour of the whole earth; yet I finde something in him more worth then all that: I consider him without his Purple, and deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of all externall ornaments; regarding onely those that are naturall to him; and which would make him most illustrious, though hee had but a blacke cap on his head, and most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, though he were but a private man. These are advantages hee hath over other men, and which hee communicates to this age of the world, goods that hee possesseth and I enjoy. For I vow unto you that in this sad place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my owne humour hath miss-led me; and where there is no talke but of Suits and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells; I should not know in the world how to passe my time; if I had not brought his booke along with me. This hath beene the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of my voyage, and is now the comforter of my Exile, and after I am dulled with a deale of troublesome discourse, and have my eares filled with idle chat, I goe and purifie my selfe in his delicate relations; and gather my spirits together, which the noyse and clatter had before dispersed. I never saw in so sober and chast a stile, so much fulnesse and delight; if nature herselfe would speake, shee could never make choyse of more proper termes then those he useth; and where proper termes faile, shee could never more discreetly borrow forreigne then he doth. The Character of his phrase is so noble, that by this onely, without any other signes I should easily know hee is come of a good house; and I see that fortune
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3673:71"/>
which hath beene so great an enemy of his blood, and hath done so much hurt to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, hath not yet beene able to take from him the marke of their greatnesse, nor the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and language of a Prince. At your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from thence you gave me thankes for loving qualities that are so lovely, and that making profession of Letters, I am put in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for him who preserves their honour, and who in his country is the Crowne and glory of our Muses; as often as there is question for his service I shall neede no second considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to put mee in heate about it; I tell you plainely, I shall doe it no whit the more for any love of you, I intreate you to provide some occasion apart from all interests of his, where you may see the extraordinary account I make of your merits, and the desire I have to manifest unto you that I am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, you could never have falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n againe to your pen upon better termes then you have
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3673:71"/>
done; and I have a conceite your silence hath not beene so much a neglect as a meditation. The Letter you pleased to write unto me is so full of infinite excellent things, that it seemes you have beene making provision three yeares together to make one feast, and that your spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for so long a time had no other meaning but to bee magnificent for one day. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch of the <hi>Constantinopolitan</hi> slave you sent me, and the newes of <hi>Koppenhagen</hi> you writ unto me are so inriched with ornaments of your making, that I see plainely whatsoever passeth thorough your hands receiveth an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of excellencie, and that glorious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements have neede of you to be their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian. It is not strange unto me that M. your brother hath pleaded my cause, I am an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall clyent of your family, and as it is my part to honour my benefactor, so it is yours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve your benefits: But verily I could never have thought this last action should have had the Court of <hi>Denmarke</hi> for a Theater, and the King and his daughters the Princesses for Iudges. You sent me word I had a famous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree passed on my side, and that the assailant was as much hissed at, as the defendant was applauded. God be praised that grants us ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice amongst the Gothes, for injuries done us by the French; and that raiseth up in an end of the world a soveraigne defender of perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted innocencie, such succour sometimes hee hath extraordinarily afforded when men aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don her; the Lyons have become humane, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3673:72"/>
then leave her without protection; &amp; in the most frightfull desarts there have beene found Nurses for children, whom the crueltie of their mothers had exposed. Let us therefore never beleeve that sweetnesse and humanitie are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the earth or of the Ayre; they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper goods of the easterlings, nor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertues of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> They are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and passant, all climates receive them in their turne, and it is not the <hi>Cimbricke Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonesus</hi> any longer, it is <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> that at this day are Barbarians. This divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of whom your brother writes such won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, hath no doubt contributed much to this change, and though there should shine no other Sunne upon the bankes of the <hi>Balticke</hi> Sea, this one were enough to make vertue bud forth in all hearts, and to make Arts and discipline to flourish in all parts. This is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Pallas</hi> that shall have her Temples, and her suppliants shall be president of Letters and studies, as well as the former. Even that which you say of the defect of her birth, and of the obscuritie of her mother, might bee ground enough for a Poet to make an entire worke and to assure us that shee was borne and came out of her fathers head at least Sir if your relations bee true, shee is the lively Image of his spirit, the interpretour of his thoughts, the greatest strength of his estate, and who by her eyes and tongue reigneth and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over all objects that either see or heare. Why should I dissemble or hide my content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3673:72"/>
I must confesse I am proud in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est degree for the praises shee hath given me. Never Prince passed the <hi>Rhine</hi> more happily then mine hath done, seeing so good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hath attended him there, and that there hee should be crowned by a hand which was able to give wounds to all others. What shall I say more? I scorne all the antient triumphes when I thinke upon this: I hope for no lustre, but for her splendour, I seeke for no glory, but in her recommendation; her onely voyce is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the suffrages of a whole Diet of all the north; and what reason they should not forever be banished the Empire who blame that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> she praiseth, or that would oppose the soveraignty of her excellent judgement? As for our common enemie, condemned by her; to keepe company with the Hobgoblins of <hi>Norway;</hi> since hee is no longer in the world. he is no longer in state to do her obeysance. If it be not that God will have that to bee the place of his purgatory which shee would have to be the place of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and that this proud spirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>find to live amongst the tempests &amp; other fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke issues of the North, as <hi>Varro</hi> speakes of Satyres. You have read I suppose the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues of Saint <hi>Gregorie;</hi> and therefore must needs know that all soules are not purged after one manner, but some passe thorough the fire, and others endure the Ice; and the extremitie of cold is no lesse an instrument of the divine justice, then extremitie of heate.

                     <p>SIR, be not scandalized, nor take exception at my silence. The greatest part of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I writ; are but the paiment of my old debts: and before I answer one, I cast up my reckoning three or foure times. I seldome stay upon matter of compliment, all I can doe, is but to defend my selfe untowardly; I thinke
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3673:73"/>
my selfe sufficiently honest, if I be but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently uncivill; and because I am apt to doe courtesies voluntarily; I expect also voluntarily to receive them; of you Sir especially, who judge not friendshippe by the looke, and knowes that superstition is more ceremonious, then true pietie. The new favours I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from your Muses are to mee as they ought to be, exceeding sensible: yet thinke not, that this makes me forget your former benefits: and that I carry not in minde, that it is you that gave me the first taste of good, and the principles of vertue; you doe but build upon the foundation you laid your selfe; and give estimation to your owne paines. Having beene my guide in a countrie which I know not; it is for your honour it should be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I have made some progresse there, that so it may apppeare your directions are good. Thus your Poeme hath in it a hidden art, which few understand; and I am but the colour of your designe. You enjoy your selfe all the glory you have done me; all the glory you have imparted to mee stayes still with your selfe; and you have found out a way how to praise your self, without speaking of your self: and how to be liberall without parting from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. If you come this Sommer to <hi>Paris,</hi> I will give you account of an infinite number of things that will not dislike you; and in revenge thereof, I require to heare from you some newes of our male content;</p>

                     <p>I know not whether you will be able to bring the state into his favour; but this I know, it is no small worke for perswasion to effect, seeing hee is no lesse obstinate in his errours, then you strong in your Reasons. Whatsoever he say of the time; and of the carriage of things; the impunitie with which he triumphs, is a visible marke of the moderate goverment of this Kingdome; and in any country but this; his Head long before this time had paid for his tongue. But I heare he is of so vile an humour, that he is angry for his very liberty; and thinks it is done in scorne, that hee hath not all this while been put in the Bastyle. He valewes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be worthy of an informer; and of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, and thinkes hee hath merit enough to be punisht in state.

                     <p>SIR, I finde by the Letter which Mounsieur <hi>de Mantin</hi> writ unto you, that you have done mee good offices with him; and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your word, hee takes mee for more than I am worthy. It is your part now to make that sure unto him which you have warranted, and to disguise mee with so much Art, that may make good your first deceit by a second. For to think that I shall be able to answer his expectation, and satisfie your promise: I know he expects too much; and know you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised too much, that which hee speakes of me and of my writings, seemes rather to come from the passion of a lover, than from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of a Judge; and I ought to take it, rather as a Present, then as a Recompence. I know besides, that the place<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from whence hee writes hath alwayes beene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the habitation of courtesie; and that the sparke of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> which hath rested there, since it parted from thence; hath left a light which gives an influence to the manners and spirits of the Country. Yet distinction must be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the civilities of <hi>Avignon,</hi> which extend
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3673:75"/>
to all sorts of strangers, &amp; the resentments of an able man, which respect nothing but reason, and a difference must be put betweene the honesty of a compliment, and the Religion of a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Mounsieur <hi>Malherbe</hi> deceased, who never gave any mans merit, more than its due: and but coldly praised the most praise-worthy things; yet hath heretofore to me, in so high a degree extolled this man, of whom we speake; that I could not but thinke, it must needes be a very extraordinary Vertue that transported him so unwontedly, and a very pressing verity, that forced him to open himselfe so freely, I have since beene confirmed in my judgement of him by divers persons of good qualitie, and generally by the voyce of all our country: But yet there is in this more cause for me to feare, than hope: Wise men doe but only taste an errour; with which common people drinke themselves drunke: They do not plunge themselves in false opinions, they passe them lightly over; and I am afraid you will ere long receive another letter in retractation of this, he hath now written so much in my favour, if the worst come to the worst; and that there be no meanes for me, to keepe all the good you have gotten me; I yet may lawfully require to have a part left me; which Mounsieur your brother in Law cannot honestly deny me. I am unfit for the termes hee gives me; I willingly returne them backe to himselfe. Let him keepe his Admiring for Miracles; or at least for the great stupendious workes of Nature; I aspire
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3673:75"/>
not, nor have any pretence to so high a degree of his account; but I thinke I have right to his friendshippe; and that both of you are my debters of some good will; seeing I honour you both exceedingly, and passionately am</p>

                     <p>SIR, I am not altogether prophane, yet am but a simple <hi>Catechumene</hi> neither: I adore your mysteries, though I comprehend them not; and dare not give my spirit that liberty which you give it. Is it fit to be a judge of a Science, of which it is yet but learning the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet? It scarce knowes visible Objects, and runnes a hazard, when it considers but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour face of Nature; as for that which is above, it climbes not to it, nor soares so high. My curiositie is not so ventrous: and concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the condition of superiour things; I wholly referre my selfe to the Sorbone. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinke therefore that I will give my Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of your Booke: I have not yet discovered the bottome; onely the barke, I must tell you seemes very precious; and I am ravished with
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3673:76"/>
the sound and harmony of things, I understand not, this kinde of Writing would have astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Philosophers whom it could not have perswaded: and if Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> had but shewed such a peece as this to <hi>Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stius,</hi> he could not chuse but have beene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with it, and must needes have admired the probabilitie of Christianity; though he had not knowne the secret. These are not words that one reades, and are painted upon paper: they are felt, and received within the heart. They live and moove, and I see in them the si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of the first Christians; and the style of that Heroicke age, where one and the same vertue, gave life both to discourse and actions; gave influence both to the soule and to the courage, made both Doctours and also Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. Tell mee true, Did you not purpose to your selfe a Patterne to follow? Have you not beene at the Oracle of—: have you not received some inspiration from our excellent friend? Me thinkes I meete with his very Character. In certaine passages I observe some markes and traces of his spirit; and when I reade them, cannot sometimes forbeare crying out: <hi>Sic oculus, sic ille manus, &amp;c.</hi> You neede not take offence at my suspition: so noble a resemblance is an inferiority lifted up ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely high.

                        </gap> worthy of the History I promised you, but onely that the Emperour as I heare, hath presented to the view of brave spirits, certaine new and very strange recreations by which hee hath gained a great opinion of his knowledge. As to make the Images in a peece of Tapistry, to walke, and move: to make all the faces in a roome, to seeme to be double; to make a river rise in a Hall; and after streaming away without wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3673:77"/>
of any, make a company of Fayries appeare and dance a round; these are his ordinary sports, &amp; to use the phrase of our friend; but the outside of his secret Philosophy. Signior <hi>Mercurio Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dano,</hi> sweares hee hath seene all this, and more; enough to finde you discourse for many mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings: and if you appoint him to set hand to his Penne, he will be a <hi>Philostratus</hi> to this <hi>Appolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> Hee hath told me, as hee hath heard it from him, that for certaine, the heavens me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uace <hi>France,</hi> with a notable revolution; and that the fall of—, hath not beene so much the end, as the change of our mysteries. For my selfe who know, that God never makes Mountibanks of his Counsaile; and that the vertue of the King, is able to correct the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the starres: I laugh at the vanitie of such Presages; and looke for nothing but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse from the ascendant and fortune of so great a Prince. But to change this Discourse, and this Mountibanke for another: I have seene the man Sir, that is all armed with thornes: that pursues a Proposition to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost bounds of Logicke; that in most peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conversations, will put forth nothing, nor admit of nothing that is not a Dialemma, or a Syllogisme. To tell you true, what I thinke of him; he would please me more if hee had lesse reason: this quarrelsome Eloquence affrights me more than it perswades mee. They which commonly converse with him; runne in my opinion the same fortune, which they doe, that live neere the falls of <hi>Nilus;</hi> there is no over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3673:77"/>
like that of his words, a man cannot safely give him audience; a <hi>Headache</hi> for three dayes after, is the least hurt hee can take, that but heares him after dinner. The Gentleman that brings you this Letter, hath charge given him from all in generall to entreate you Sir, not to forsake us in so important a matter: but to come and free our companies from one of the greatest crosses, that hath a long time affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted civill societie. You are the onely man in whom this Sophister hath some beleefe: and therefore none but you, likely to reduce him to common right; and to bring his spirit to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it selfe to Custome and Vsage. You can if you please make it appeare unto him; that an honest man proposes alwayes his opinions, no otherwise than as doubts; and never raiseth the sound of his voyce, to get advantage of them, that speake not so loud, that nothing is so hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as a chamber Preacher who delivers but his owne word; and determines withou warrant, that it is fit to avoid gestures, which are like to Threatnings, and termes which carrie the stile of Edicts; I meane, that it is not fit to accompany his Discourse, with too much acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor to affirme any thing too peremptorily. Lastly, that conversation reflects more upon a popular estate, then upon a Monarchie; and that every man hath there a right of suffrage: and the benefit of libertie. You know Sir, that for want of due observing these petty rules, many have fallen into great inconveniences; and you remember one who maintained an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3673:78"/>
at the Table, with too great violence, disturbed and drove Queene <hi>Margaret</hi> from her dinner. Such men commonly spoile the best causes; whilst they seeke to get the better, not because their cause is good; but because themselves are the Advocates; Reason it selfe seemes to be wrong, when it is not of their side, at least not in its right place, nor in its ordinary forme. They disguise it in so strange a fashion that it cannot be knowne to any; and they take away her authority and force, by painting her in the colours and markes of folly. Against these Ringleaders, it is that wee desire you to come, and to take the paines of applying your Exorcismes, particularly upon—you will have a thousand Benedictions, if you can drive out of his body, this devill of dispute and wrangling; which hath begunne already to torment us.

                     <p>SIR, that which I have written of you; is but a simple relation of that I have seene of you: and if there be any ornament in it: It must needs be, that either your selfe have put it there; or else that Fortune hath lent it to me. I had done it very innocently, I assure you, if I had spoken any thing well; who was so ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it. I should have hit a marke which I aimed not at; and have drawne a Picture, by the casuall falling downe of my Pensill. My drift was to entertaine my friend, who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to the negligence of my style: and with whom; if I committed any fault, I was sure of Pardon. Hee cries not out murther, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seeing one Vowell encounter another, nor stands amazed at meeting with an untoward word as if it were a Monster: This favour I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him; and he, the like from me: we allow all liberty to our thoughts: and if in trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together, wee should not sometimes vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the lawes of our Art, wee should never shew confidence enough in our friendshippe. Rhetoricke therefore hath no place in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings where Truth takes up all: There is great difference betweene an Oratour, and a Register; and my private testimony ought not to passe for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3673:79"/>
your <hi>Encomium.</hi> Yet you will have it to be so; you had rather accuse me of being eloquent, then confesse your selfe to be vertuous; and you avoid presumption, by a contrary extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. It seemes this occasion is dangerous to you; and as in a shipwracke, where all runne to save the dearest things: so you abandon your other vertues, to preserve your modesty. Shee doth her selfe wrong Sir, to stand in opposition to the publike voyce; and to reject the testimony of noble fame. Shee ought not to contradict the two chiefe Courts of <hi>Europe;</hi> whereof the one honoureth your memory, the other makes use of your counsels. <hi>Aristotle</hi> would never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove of this; who speakes of a vice, with which if a man be tainted, he resembles him to one, who will not confesse hee hath wonne in the Olympicke games, though men come and adjudge him the Garland; and calls himselfe still culpable: though three degrees of the <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opage,</hi> pronounce him innocent. Be not you, of solittle equitie to your selfe; and suffer mee to tell you what I thinke; seeing I thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is the common opinion; and I deliver not so much my owne particular conceit, as the generall beleefe of the whole world: They who preferre a Captaine of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabins</hi> before <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great; and know not how to praise the integritie of a Statesman, without affronting that of <hi>Aristides;</hi> fall into that excesse which reason requires should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided. Yet we ought not for all this, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to slight all merit of the present age; and fancie to our selves, that we are not bound to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3673:79"/>
revere vertue, unlesse it be consecrated by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie. For my selfe, I judge more favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of things present, and doe not thinke I run any hazard in subscribing to the Popes judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of you, that in serving the King, you have beene his governour. This would be to be too scrupulous, to feare mistaking, after him that they say cannot erre; and you are too cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, to count it a courtesie that I doe my dutie; and to give mee thankes that I am not a Schismaticke. Concerning the last Article of your Letter; I say it gives me not so much, as a temptation: neither am I indeede capable to receive it. It sufficeth me Sir, that you protect my repose here; for to enter into defence of my interests in the place where you are, as you doe me the honour to promise me; I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you not to undertake it. You could never looke for better successe, then the prime man of this age had, who could not obtaine of—; the favour he required of him, in my behalfe. It is much easier to breake downe the Alpes; and to bridle the Ocean, then to procure the paiment of my Pension: and there is nothing that can make a worker of miracles see, there is some thing impossible for him to doe; but onely my ill fortune. There are the bounds of this power, which is so much envied: The good will hee beares me, cannot draw from <hi>Spaine</hi> the eight thousand pounds which are due unto me: and it is Gods will hee should be disobeyed in this, that I may be a witnesse against them who say that he is absolute. I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreate you, seeing you desire to oblige me
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3673:80"/>
to you, to shew him the constancie of my pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which is obdurate against ill successes, and preserves it selfe entire amidst the ruines of my hopes, It shall be satisfaction enough for me that hee doe me the honour to beleeve I can adore freely and without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and that I should doe him as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence if he were not in so great a height of happinesse. I expect this favour from your ordinary goodnesse, and promise my selfe that you will alwayes have a little love for me, seeing I have a will to be all my life most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,</p>

                     <p>SIR, say what you can, I am not so indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to my passion as you are injurious to your owne merits. Amongst all your good qualities, you have one that seemes an enemy to all the rest, detraction doth you more ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice then you doe your selfe, and envie it selfe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3673:80"/>
gives you that which your owne modesty takes away from you. This is not to handle the truth civilly, to respect her then when shee embraceth you? This is to render her evill for good, to call her <hi>fabulous,</hi> when shee calls you vertuous. I finde in this Sir more scruple then Religion: The first and most antient cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie is thereby broken, and you are faultie in the first principle of your dutie; if before do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing justice to all the world, you deny to doe it to your selfe alone. It must bee a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisenesse of conscience that shall finde in you the evills you accuse your selfe of, and a sight more cleare then mine that shall see defaults in the course of your life. If you have any that are surely immateriall, and such as fall not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sence. They come not within the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any; It must bee a secret betweene your confessour and you. None is knowne Sir, at least not knowne to be revealed, and if any were so knowne, it would rather be found a proofe of humilitie then a marke of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. I am none therefore, as you say I am, of these charitable lyars, who attribute to them they love all that they want, nor of these forgers of commonwealths, who carry their imagination beyond all possibilitie of things; I present not unto you an <hi>Idea</hi> to make you better then you are, but taking you into considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I propose you as my example to stirre me up to goodnesse; I draw your picture for my owne use and not for your glory; I intend more the instructing my selfe then the pratling with

The object of so elevated a vertue fills my minde with great desires, and if it astonish me sometimes with its heighth, it makes mee at least see by experience, that an inferiour ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is possible to be acquired; so that to say true, I studie you more then I praise you, and am in this more swayed with interest then with passion: I meane this passion without eyes, that riseth onely from the animall part, for as for that which is reasonable and works with knowledge I have that for you in the highest degree, and by all kinds of obligations and of duties am</p>

                     <p>SIR, I acquit my selfe of a charge that was laid upon me, and send you from Mounsieur <hi>Favereau</hi> the verses hee lately made for the King; they have had the approbation of all <hi>France,</hi> but they have not yet had his owne, and if this publicke judgement bee not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by your particular, he takes it but as the passion of a mother; and that <hi>France</hi> doth
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3673:81"/>
but flatter her children. He thinkes no glory is legitimate whereof you are not the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and that things are not so good by their owne goodnesse, as by the account you make of them; you see by this Sir what ranke you hold in the Commonwealth of Letters, and that I am not the onely man that looke upon you with veneration, being seated in the Throane of the great <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and giving lawes to all the civill parts of Europe. The highest degree that a man can aspire unto, who is Prince amongst his owne, is to become a judge amongst strangers; and there to get re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence where he cannot pretend subjection. To this uppermost Region of merit are you ascended; the light of your doctrine shines upon more then one people, and more then one country; it spreads and communicates it selfe in divers places and kinds; it hath as well adorers a farre off, as admirers at home: He of whom I speake Sir is worth a whole multitude, and makes not onely a part of a choise company, but is himselfe alone a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and a number. Doe you aske for quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties intellectuall and morall? for vertues ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and militarie? would you have a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher a Mathematitian, a Poet, for Latine, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, French? you shall finde them all in his one person. Hee hath the key of the most sublime sciences, and the superintendance of the noblest Arts. Heretofore he hath beene the dispenser of the conceits of <hi>Marino,</hi> the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and pruning knife of the superfluities of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3673:82"/>
his stile, at this time he is overseer of all cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes; the Oracle that Carvers consult, and the spirit that guides the hand before Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Hee meddles in an infinite number of things with equall capacitie, and hath as many trades as Sage <hi>Stoicks</hi> had; but makes better workes of them then he did. It is not possible either to fill his spirit, or to set it about worke enough; so greedy and unsatiable it is of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, so impatient of rest, and growing fresh with action. And to impart to you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of a gallant friend of ours; hee is in as great a heate for the pleasures of the minde, as the Princes of <hi>Asia</hi> are for the pleasures of the body; and as they have many Concubines besides the <hi>Sultana</hi> which they marry, so hath he one profession as his principall studie, but leaves not for all that to follow other exercises, though follow them but with inferiour affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so that it cannot be sayd of him, that hee knowes all, but that hee ought to know; and that hee is nothing lesse then that hee ought to be. Hee acquits himselfe most worthily of his charge, and never stands in contemplation, when it is time to be in action. If hee be a great Poet, he is no lesse a great Lawyer; hee makes as well the draught of a Processe as the description of a Tempest; and having sung <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Amarillis</hi> with an admirable grace, he treats of <hi>Seia</hi> and <hi>Sempronia</hi> with no lesse soliditie. I give this testimony as religiously of him, as if I gave it before a Iudge, and as if my writing were upon oath. Is it not fit you
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3673:82"/>
should be ignorant of his merit, whom with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any merit you ought to respect, though but onely for his respect to you. It is fit you know that he is an elevated person, humbling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe before you, and a Saint offering you sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. It is fit also I should satisfie his desire, which you shall see in the word he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you, as hee was going out of his Inne and taking Coach, but that done Sir, it is not fit I should forget my selfe; I entreate you therefore you will be pleased that in presenting to you the vowes of another, I may offer you also my owne, and make you this true prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station, that I am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I have heard this day by a Letter from Mounsieur <hi>Chapelain,</hi> that you are at <hi>Paris,</hi> and that in some businesse of his; you have obliged him exceedingly: wherein you have done more than ever you ment; and your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath in it a double merit. I owe you thankes for it in my owne behalfe: and besides, being joyned as I am with him in communion of all goods and evills; you cannot fasten upon him, and leave me free. Hee sends mee no word of the nature of his businesse, in which you have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3673:85"/>
done him such good offices: but I doubt me, it is some imployment beyond the Alpes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon some Ambassadour to <hi>Rome.</hi> Whereof I thinke I may truely say, without giving reines to my Passion at all; that hee hath both the substance and the supplenesse, which are necessary in dealing with the braines of that country; and that hee, under whom he serves, may lie and sleepe all the time of his imployment, without any prejudice at all to the Kings service. They who see but his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side onely, take him for a neate man, and one of excellent and pleasing qualities: but I, to whom hee hath discovered that, which hee hides from all the world besides: I know him to be a man capable of great designes, and that besides speculative knowledge, hee possesseth those also which serve for use, and are reduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to action. I would say more, if the Poste would suffer me. I will onely adde this in point of his honesty, which I said to you once, of an antient <hi>Roman,</hi> that I see no example of vertue, in all the first Decade of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> that is of too high a straine, or too hard for him.

                     <p>SIR, in the Letter which—received from you, I saw a line or two for me, that would even tickle a heart that were harder then mine, and which I could not reade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some touch of vaineglory. There is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in yeelding to such sweete temptations, and though I know my merit hath no right to so gratious a remembrance, yet by what title soever I come to be happy, I am not a little proud of my fortune. These are Sir the meere effects of your goodnesse, and your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that art, with which you know how to gaine hearts, and to purchase men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out buying them. The fairest part of the earth in which you have left a deere remembrance of your name, gives this testimony of you by the mouth of its Princes, and of their subjects, but seeing in the place where you are, you meete with spirits of love and tendernesse; it cannot be that any should escape you, upon whom you have any designe to take hold. All things are biting beyond the <hi>Garonne;</hi> the Sheepe of that Country are worse then the Woolves of this; and I have heard a great person of our age say, <hi>That if France had a soule, certainly Gascognie should be the Irascible part.</hi> Yet I heare Sir, you have already sweetned all you found fowre

                     <p>SIR, I am very slow in answering your Letter, but I could not doe it sooner; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three moneths of continuall agitation, this is my first houre of leasure, and the first place I finde of commerce, to tender you the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3673:86"/>
I owe you. I see well that your word is not subject to the accidents of the world, and that I have chosen a plot which is out of the reach of Fortune. Your affection to mee is not of this brittle matter that friendships at Court bee made of; it is of a more excellent stuffe, and such as neither time can weare out, not my negligence weaken. I neede not doubt of preserving a good that you keepe for mee; your faithfulnesse is more then my negligence, and I am more assured of your honestie then of my owne; notwithstanding what certainty soever I have of your love, it is no trouble to me to have new assurances: Men that are well enough perswaded, yet will goe to a Sermon, and take a pleasure to heare that they know already. For my selfe I can never be weary of reading a thing that gives mee satisfaction, and though it were as feigned as it is true, yet you write it with so good a grace that it would bee a pleasure to be so deceived; yet it is fit to stay my selfe there, and not to fall from joy into presumption; how can you looke my spirit should containe it selfe within its bounds, knowing that I am talked of at <hi>Rome,</hi> and that my name is sometimes pronounced by the most eloquent mouth of <hi>Italy?</hi> you should have concealed the expresse charge you had from M. the Cardinall of <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> to send me his History; or at least for a temper to my vanitie, you should have told mee at the same time, that I must not impute a favour to my owne sufficiencie, for which I am beholding
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3673:87"/>
to your good offices; I may beleeve Sir that he had never had this thought of me, if you had not stirred it up in him by some favourable mention you made of my person; and I know he puts so great a trust in you, that after you have once made a commendation, hee would make a conscience to use his owne judgement in examining my worth. From what ground soever my happinesse comes, I am bound to acknowledge the visible cause, and to that I destinate my first good dayes journey that God shall send me. I will not faile to give thankes to M. the Cardinall, and to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my reading, that hee may see I know as well how to receive as hee to give. In the meane time I offer him a present farre unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the magnificence of his, and which will shew him, how with his hooke of Gold hee hath fished but grasse, such as it is you shall doe mee a favour to present it to him, and to let mee hold the possession I have in your love, whose I am all my life,</p>

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cousin, your Letter hath told me no newes, it hath onely confirmed mee in my opinion; and testified that you are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good, and alwayes doe mee the honour to love me. You have qualities of greater lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster then this, but you have none of greater use; and they that could live without your wisedome, yet cannot beare the misse of your goodnesse. My sister and I continue to implore it in a businesse which is already set on foote by your commendation, and which attends a full accomplishment by your second endeavour. It is neither without example nor without reason; it needes but such an undertaker as your selfe, and you may easily save it from rigorous justice, if you will but lend a little ayd to its equity. Of your will I make no doubt, it is the continuall agitation of the court that makes me feare, which drives men one way and their affaires another. But if the heavens helpe us not, wee are not like in hast to see it in any state of consistence; it will bee alwayes floting like the Island of <hi>Greece,</hi> untill a great birth shall make it stay; and that God make sure the Kings victories by the Queenes fruitfulnesse. In the meane time it is not fit
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:3673:88"/>
you should stay at home, but that you should make one in all voyages; but you must not bee of these voyages that get many hoasts, and few friends. You are in a state of obliging and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men beholding to you by doing alwayes good; and now for feare you should want matter to worke upon, I offer you matter here to set you aworke. Be pleased Sir; my deare Cosin, that I intreate you to deliver to—the Letter I writ unto him; and when you deliver it, to testifie withall unto him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the honour to bee to you as I am, the things that touch me must needs concerne you; Heretofore I have held good place in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and to use the termes of a man you hate not: <hi>Vetus mihi cum eo consuetudo, &amp; cum privatus eraet Amici vocabamur.</hi> Even lately at <hi>Paris</hi> hee offered mee courtesies that might have contented a prouder mans vanitie then mine; and I received from him more good words then was possible for mee to returne him. But these illustrious friendships require continuall cares, and an assiduitie without cessation. I know they are subject to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand inconveniences, and that they grow cold if they be not stirred up and kindled continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Three words of your mouth spoken with a due accent, may save me the solliciting of three moneths, and my requests ought not to seeme uncivill; seeing I desire nothing but this, that—should not doe mee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to make a promise, and then leave there, and think that enough. To this purpose I send

you a short instruction for—: and you may be pleased to be a meanes, that hee cast his eyes upon it; at such time as the businesse hee hath about your person shall permit him. I would not sollicite you so boldly: nor presse upon you so burdensome a familiarity, if you had not your selfe made the overture first. It is a persecution you have drawne upon your selfe by the liberall offers you made mee in your Letter; and I conceive you speak as you meane, as I doe, in protesting that I honour you with my soule; and am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I doe not know my selfe in your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: you are like those Painters, that care not for making a face like, so they make it faire.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3673:89"/>

They could not be Sir, either more fine, or more delicate: and I doe not thinke, that your pretended Barbarisme, comes any thing behind the <hi>Grecian</hi> eloquence. But tell me true; Is it not as artificiall as <hi>Brutus</hi> his folly? And are not you in plaine termes a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sener, to make us beleeve you come from that climate, from whence the cold and foule wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes? Whereas it cannot be you should be borne any where but in the heart of <hi>Paris:</hi> or if any place be more <hi>French</hi> then <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris:</hi> that certainely must needes have beene your Cradle. You speake too well, not to speake naturally; this garbe, and this purity, in which you expresse your selfe, is not a thing that can be learned by Bookes: you owe it to a neerer cause; and study goes not so farre as it. There have strangers beene Marshalls of <hi>France,</hi> but their accent hath alwayes discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they were not naturall: and they have found it more easie, to merit the leading of our Armies, and to gaine the favour of our King; then to learne our language, and attaine a true pronouncing. But Sir, seeing in your person, there is seene an Ambassadour of eighteene yeares old: and a wisedome without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: there is not so great a wonder in the world as your selfe: nor any thing incredible after this. It is fit onely, that you make more account than you doe, of this so rare and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a quality: and that you should use it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its merits; and not employ it upon

base subjects, that are not worthy of it.

                     <p>SIR, I am exceedingly beholding to you, for remembring mee; and for the good newes you have so liberally acquainted me withall. If the—loved Suger, as well as they love salt; they should have enough of it, never to drinke any thing but Hyppocras; nor to eate any thing but Comfits. Without jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting I vow, these are excellent Rebells; and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:3673:92"/>
their simplicitie is more subtill than all the Art and Maximes of <hi>Florence.</hi> These Mariners reade Lessons now to the inhabitants of <hi>Terra firma;</hi> and are become the <hi>Paedagouges</hi> of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There is nothing of theirs that troubles mee, but the proposition of their Truce. They should reject it, as a temptation of the devill: and I dare sweare, it was never set a foote, but to gaine time and opportunity: The good will, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> makes shew to beare them; is the baite they shew upon the hooke they hide, hee seekes not after them, but to catch them; and he makes shew of kindnesse; because hee could doe no good with force. Though I have not read the Booke you spake to me of; yet I doubt not of its worth and goodnesse; I know the Authour is a man of great learning and experience, and one that hath beene brought up at the feete of <hi>Gamaliel;</hi> I meane of—: who no doubt hath acquainted him with all the Mysteries of our state. For my selfe, it must needes be that I speake but at hap hazard of this matter: for it would be a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, if by living in the woods, I should learne the skill to governe cities; and that I should be a Polititian and a Lawyer, being scarce either a man or a citizen: for to speake truely, if the first be a sociable creature, and the other a mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of some part of the common wealth: I see not in the estate I am in, how I can justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to either of these two qualities. In favour therefore of Mounsieur—I yeeld up my right in all the good I receive from you; and in all
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3673:92"/>
the praises you give me, as things that much more belong to him than mee. Admire as much as you will, his subtiltie; but yet make some reckoning of my freenesse; and give him that which I leave him; but yet keepe for mee, that wich you cannot take from mee, without doing mee wrong: I meane your good-will; which ought to be the prize of my passion, and of the fidelity, with which I shall be all my life,</p>

                     <p>SIR, if my Letters had beene lost, you should have knowne long ere this the joy I have had in being cleared of the most important debts that troubled me, and in learning from your selfe that you doe me alwayes the honour to love me; not that I ever doubted of your goodnesse, but I have so much knowledge of my owne unfortunatenesse, that I cannot heare any ill newes so incredible which I doe not

That which you have once spoken, and indeede that you have but once conceived, is never changed nor revoked; and therefore as I have nothing more deare nor more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then your friendship, so have I nothing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so more assured or of more soliditie. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>German</hi> Probitie is not a whit altered by contagion of our ill examples, and the strength of your constitution hath beene able to resist the ill aire of our Court. It is not out of ignorance that you follow not the false maximes of this; but follow your owne and those that bee law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and if it be true, that the king of the Flies hath a sting indeed, but never stings, it is much more true of you, that having the power and abilitie to doe evill, yet for all that you are no evill doer. But this would bee too little to praise you but thus; they that understand you well will say with mee, there is nothing in vertue so high or difficult, to which your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not aspired; and as nature hath given you al the good qualities that cannot be acquired by studie, so your owne studie hath procured you all the good qualities that are not in the gift of nature. Though your courtesies had left mee my first libertie, and that there were neither Obligation on your part nor Resentment on mine, yet I should say as much as I doe, and give this testimony of you before all the

                     <p>SIR, this day being the six and twentieth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> I solemnly renounce all Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet after I have told you first that I never used any with you, but such as were most true, and that whatsoever I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto you heretofore untill now, is of as great force and vigour as if it had passed before a publicke Notarie. I have with a great deale of pleasure read the Latin which you did mee the favour to send me; the force of the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the Oeconomie of the discourse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent me exceedingly; onely one little word distasts me, and your friend might well have forborne to couple us with Mahometans and Infidells. The libertie which the King gives his Subjects, not to bee of his opinion, ought not to reach to the scandalizing of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and seeing he holds it a glory to bee the eldest sonne of the Church, to call this Church a whore, is in good French to call—He deserves Sir more respect, and your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours should have more descretion: For in truth, if their Religion were the prime Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the kingdome, and that they were at libertie to preach it in the <hi>Lovure;</hi> they could
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:3673:95"/>
never speake in higher termes, nor handle Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks in a ruder manner then they doe. I assure my selfe you will bee in this of my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: One must alwayes remember the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the time, and the state of affaires; wise men will never provoke them that are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily able to undoe them; and in the antient triumphs it was lawfull for the Souldiers to scoffe at their Generall; but it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the vanquished to speake reproachful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Conquerour; you may please to make some reflection hereupon, and I know you will conceive that innocencie it selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes culpable if it draw on persecution.

selfe I would perhaps not sticke to receive it, but if it cannot bee had without contesting, I will none of it; I love my ease too well, I say not to lose it, but even to hazard it in the best quarrell of the world. I am as patient and as utterly disarmed as an Anabaptist; I am afraid of a Potgunne or a Squibbe; farre from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon Muskets and Swords points, as they say in our Vicinage. It would be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to draw a man of this humour to a combat; but a much harder matter to make me stand in argumentation, being resolved to let the world hold what opinion it pleaseth, and ever to forsake my owne, if any man will wrangle with mee for it. I desire neither to establish my owne Maxims, nor to destroy other mens; and if a Master of Arts should come and try me with <hi>Omnis Homo Currit,</hi> I would answer him <hi>Lascialo andar;</hi> and if hee should goe on and say, <hi>sed Petrus Currit,</hi> I would reply, <hi>Lascialo star;</hi> and if he would conclude, <hi>Ergo Petrus non est Homo,</hi> I would take my leave of him and say, <hi>Che m' Importa?</hi> I have very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously considered of the Letter of——and absolutely lost all remembrance of my owne; I thought I had reason, and perhaps I was wrong, his intentions might bee good, but my interpretation of them was naught. The Conclusion is; Hee is a man I make infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite account of, and his friendship shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be dearer to me then my owne opinion.

God will reward a nature so free and noble, for my selfe I can but praise it, and give it the testimony that is due unto it. But to make it perfect, I entreate you it may bee as sweete as it is gracious, and heale me if it may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thrusting your nailes into my sores. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire not to be left in my ill estate by flattery, but I desire to be drawne out of it without rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; workes alone seasoned with sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse content mee more then good deeds that are dry, and come from a proud hand. Be not

therefore like the friends of <hi>Iob,</hi> who reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him in conforting him; but be compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a little to humane infirmities, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you cannot alter me unlesse you new make me. I dare not say, that I preferre the libertie of Desarts before the magnificence of Courts; and that chaines though never so well made and guilded over, doe yet not tempt me, I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, I know my selfe too well to meddle in a trade whereof I am not capable, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne a life which ought to be ended in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it. Thus Sir I doe that out of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which you thinke I doe out of lazinesse, and the faintnesse of my spirit comes from that of my body. But I know it is impossible to perswade you to this, and no meanes is left me to justifie my sicknesse but by my death, and when you have lost me, then you will finde and say I had reason to complaine. In the meane time I understand that the devils of <hi>Paris,</hi> of <hi>Bruxells, &amp;c.</hi> are all let loose, and commit out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon me in foure or five Languages.

when you will not affoord to give it mee. At the worst, I will love you still, as I have ever done, as a creature supremely excellent; though not supremely just: As there are some vertues that are fierce and scornefull; so there are some sciences which have attractives amidst their difficulties, and which draw us on in thrusting us backe, You are like these abstract know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: Your merit sweetens all your rigours: and how hard soever the persecution hath beene, which I have suffered: yet I vow unto you, I could never finde in my heart to hate the Tyrant. I have still so great a care of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that I would not be thought innocent; for feare he should be blamed to have done me wrong; and I had rather be a Prevaricatour, and treacherous to my selfe, then to seeme I had cause of complaint against him.

                     <p>SIR, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day I parted from <hi>Paris;</hi> I dreamt not of taking any journey; but a newes which I received, made me take horse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an houre after I received it. This is that which hindred me from taking my leave; and to use such compliments with you, as in such cases are accustomed. If I did not know you to be an enemy of the tyranny of Ceremonies; and that you, as well as my selfe, cut off from friendshippe all vaine pompe and superfluities, I should study for long excuses to justifie my journey: but in so doing, I should offer wrong to a wise man; to thinke hee had opinions like the vulgar: and that hee would either give or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:3673:100"/>
take so good a thing as liberty. I enjoy it as I would wish within these three or foure dayes; and I have received it at the banke of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver where I left it the last yeare. I banish from my minde all thoughts of the streete Saint <hi>Iaques;</hi> and dreame not either of my Prince or Commonwealth, either of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Bookes, or of my owne: I dreame, to say true, continually of you; and finde no Image in my memory so pleasing, as that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents mee the time of our being together. I would willingly employ <hi>Atlante,</hi> or <hi>Melisse,</hi> to procure me a more solid contentment; and to convey you and your library hither in a night. I cannot forget this deare retreate of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for, I know, that without this, you would finde even in <hi>Tyvolie,</hi> a want in your felicity; and that without your Bookes, our fruits would be but sowre; and our good cheere but of ill taste unto you. These are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations Sir, with which I flatter my selfe; whilst I stand waiting to returne to <hi>Paris;</hi> that I may there goe finde out a happinesse which cannot come hither to finde out me. If in the meane time you please to fend me some newes, whereof, you know provincicall spirits are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely greedy; you shall give me meanes, to make a whole country beholding to me; and you neede deliver them, but onely to—: who will ease you of the paines of writing them.

day have meanes to be revenged of him, for this malice: I doubt not to have libertie to walke abroad, when hee shall be tied to stay at home; and to have my turne in feasting and making merry, when hee shall stand waiting upon enterrements, and goe exhorting men that are to be hanged. Yet hee is all this while your Favorite in my absence, though hee ncede not thinke mee absent, unlesse hee will; for if hee love mee enough, to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for losing mee, hee may easily recover mee, by looking upon your face. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance betweene you and mee, is not the least of my vanities; and I vow unto you, I am proud of it in the highest degree: every day I thanke my mother for it in my heart; and doe a secret homage for it to Nature. It were enough for mee, to be taken for your Coppy; but my gray haires tell mee to my shame, that I am rather your Originall, and put mee in minde of this untoward advantage. I should not do much good, to paint them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse withall, I could discharge the pensivenesse that hath changed them: for the tincture of this blots out all other. It is fit therefore to be merry, and to banish sorrow, seeing this is the onely meanes to new make us, and to make us able to resist old-age. I resolve my selfe to do so, though it be but to doe Fortune a spight; and to take from her by my not grieving, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure she thinkes to take in her crueltie. But this goodly resolution stands in neede of you; my joy would be perfect, if you would sometimes

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cousin, the beginning of your Letter had frighted mee, and I was taking Alarum at these words of death and Physitians, but I recovered my spirits when I saw the first had failed of his blow, and that you use not the other but to strengthen you in an estate they have already put you; such dayes as this will prove more healthfull to you then all their Drugges, and the sweetnesse which begins to spring from the puritie of the Elements is the onely medicine that heales without corrupting, and cleanseth without fretting. For my selfe I thinke not of dying when I have once gotten <hi>March</hi> over my head, and me thinkes I finde my selfe renewed at the onely smelling of the Violets. I make use of them to more then one service, they serve me for Broaths as well as for Nosegayes. I cannot bee perswaded that cold purgeth the Ayre, or drives away sicknesse; and I am glad at heart to heare the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> is dead of the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the moneth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> and that in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> At least this will justifie the Summer and the hot Countries, and will serve us for a proofe against—when according to his custome he will pleade our adversaries cause. I am more happy then I thought I was; seeing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3673:102"/>
you assure me that I am sometimes the subject of your conferences; and though in this you run the hazard of being in the number of those Oratours who were blamed for making ill choyse of their subjects; yet pardon mee if I account the testimony of your remembring me, more deare unto mee then the glory of your well speaking; and if I like rather you should talke of my idlenesse and of my walkes, then to discourse of publicke affaires or voyages of Princes. I regard not the estimation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I would give a great deale to buy out that with which I have gotten it; but there are certaine friendships upon which onely I relie, and to be razed out of all accounts in the state would be lesse grievous to me then to be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of your memory. Continue therefore these conferences which are so pleasing to mee, and of which I am in spirit a partaker, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deny me not these consolations which are so sweete unto mee, and whose effect I feele a hundred miles off. I cannot dissemble the neede I have of you, I could not live if you did not love me, but withall you could not love a man who is more passionately then I am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cosin, I am exceeding glad to heare of your newes; as for newes of the world I set so little by them, and interest my selfe so little in generall affaires, that I may boldly say, I never yet read a whole <hi>Gazetta</hi> through; you may thinke this a strange di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staste of the present time, and a remarkeable impatience, specially in a man who complaines that <hi>Livies</hi> History is too short, and wishes <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus</hi> would never make an end.

                     <p>SIR, never was Host better payd then I, for making you poore Cheere; if you should make any long journey at this price, you would make your selfe a poore man before you come home, and your first courtesies are such, that they scarce leave any place for second. You are so good that you are unjust; to compare our fruits to those of <hi>Italy</hi> is not so much to advance our Village, as to vilifie <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Florence.</hi> This is to affront her whom <hi>Virgill</hi> adored, and to whom he sayd upon his knees and holding up his hands;</p>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Salve magna Parens fragum Saturnia tellus</hi>

                     </l>
                     <p>There is no reason to pardon this excesse to a man that makes profession of the truth, and who ought to speake that plainely which it is lawfull for Poets to disguise. These fellowes make waste of their ornaments and their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; they call the worst wine they drinke <hi>Nectar;</hi> and though the house of <hi>Cacus</hi> were no better then an Oxe stall, yet in their Verses it is made a Kings Pallace; such libertie is not allowed to Philosophers, and without dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to this qualitie, which you have so good title to possesse, you could never have bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aed your prayses upon such base Viands as I
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3673:105"/>
was faine to set before you. And for my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement with which you seeme much better satisfied, even that was yet much poorer, &amp; more meager then my cheere. You know Sir that in our commerce I contribute nothing but my Dociblenes, &amp; my eares; I am the people &amp; you the Theater; I meane a Theater reasonable and intelligent, inspired with sentences and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, to whose spectacles I would run from one end of the world to another, and never complaine of my paines nor of my journey. I would not onely returne you your visit in <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine;</hi> but to heare you; would doe much more, and goe much further, willingly untertake as long a voyage as <hi>Appollonius</hi> did, who travei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many kingdomes, and passed many Seas, onely to see <hi>Iarchas</hi> in his Throane of gold, and heare him discoursing of the nature of things. Your Indian visage and your yellow colour make shew of a <hi>Gimnosophist;</hi> but <hi>Gimnoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phists</hi> had not the vertue that lies hidden under this yellownesse; for though they made Trees to speake, and sent tempests on their errands, where they pleased, yet these were effects of their divellish arts, and no arguments of their wisedome. Yours is not onely more humane and more lawfull; but is used also with lesse pride and lesse violence. Instead of filling the eies with unprofitable wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, it makes to flow and streame in the soule necessary verities; it doth not astonish mee with prodiges, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright me with Thunder, but it perswades me to doae that I ought to doe, and instructs mee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3673:106"/>
to know that I ought to know. It is the same I thinke that appeared under the Empire of <hi>Trajan;</hi> and communicated it selfe to men by the mediation of <hi>Plutarch.</hi> How have you decked her without disarming her? how sweetned her countenance without weakening her force? how covered her Bones and Muskes with a faire flesh, and made her a body of a Carkasse? The Syllogisme, which by the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a <hi>Grecian</hi> is the <hi>Trident</hi> and <hi>Mace</hi> of Philosophie, is in your writings all painted and perfumed: After you have purged it from the rust of <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and from the poyson of Sophisters, you make with it a wholesome and delightfull lancing, and no man seekes to ward your blowes, because they heale and tickle. With these rare knowledges you should entertaine your friends, and not with the fruits of our Orchard, nor with those of my studies, which are as vulgar the one as the other; But yet seeing they please your taste, and that you demand of mee particularly the last peece you saw of my making, I have intreated—who carries it to <hi>Paris</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it unto you in the place where you are; By your example I call it my dissertation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee live in a country of libertie, and where faults of this nature are not under the jurisdiction of the Kings commission. But I durst not be so bold at the Court, where there is no longer any favour for naughty words, nor safety for innovatours of our Language. Remember therefore that I speake under <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicite,</hi>
                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:3673:106"/>
and in our most strait confidence; and imitate herein that Queene, who in publicke called her sonne by the name of her husband, but in private by the name of her favorite; much after this sort doe I; having conceived my worke from the acquaintance I have with the Latin; I let it in truth carry a French title, but in secret and speaking in the eare I give it the name of his father. It is now three moneths that M. <hi>de Nants</hi> hath beene in <hi>Britanie,</hi> and M. <hi>de Tholouze</hi> in <hi>Languedoc.</hi> Vpon the first oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie I will not faile to send them your rare Presents, and let them know in what heigth of account you hold them both. Do me the like office to Mounsieur <hi>Bourdelot,</hi> and assure him that I have great pretensions upon his lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and that I ground my selfe much upon his honestie. Hereafter one of them shall bee my treasure in the necessities of my spirit, the other my Sanctuary against the malice of the world. For you Sir, it is impossible for mee to expresse the high opinion I conceive of you; when the question is to speake of your vertue, I cannot finde words that give mee satisfaction, and therefore at this time you shall have from me but the common conclusion of all my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that I am,</p>

                     <head>To Mounsieur <hi>de Aigue bere</hi> Commander of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in <hi>Holland.</hi> LETTER XXXVII.</head>
                     <p>SIR, your Letter hath staied here a long time for me; if I had beene here at its first arrivall, I had sooner testified to you the joy with which I received it: and the especiall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I make of the meanest of your favours. I seek not after new acquaintance; I had rather I could forgo one halfe of those I have already but for yours; I vow unto you I have much desired it, and you had attractives for me, even in the malancholy of my <hi>Quartaine</hi> Ague. I discovered a great worth under the veile of your disvaluing your selfe; and saw well, that you sought rather to goe safely and solidly, than to goe in pompe and state, and had more care to nourish your minde, than to set it out in colours. I doe not therefore take you for a simple Captaine of <hi>Holland,</hi> who talkes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Stoccadoes; and Circumvallation; and studies such other words in that country, to come afterwards and fright us with them here in <hi>France,</hi> I know you possesse no lesse the vertues of peace, than those that make a noise and handle iron: and that you are a man of the Library, as well as of the Arsenall.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3673:107"/>
Mounsieur <hi>Huggens,</hi> I assure my selfe, is of the same minde; and I doubt not, but having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served you in both these kinds, hee rellisheth as well your spirit, as he values your courage. I am very glad of the correspondence that is betweene you; of which, if you please, I shall make use hereafter, for the safetie of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. But Sir, I have another, more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant request to make unto you; and I earnestly entreate you to doe for me, with my Lord—: the good offices, which I have right to hope your goodnesse will affoord me. It hath beene written to me from <hi>Paris,</hi> that hee had some sinister conceit of me; and indeede the coldnesse of his countenance, the last time I had the honour to doe him reverence, seemed to shew as much. This misfortune comes not to me by any fault of mine: for I sweare unto you Sir, that I have alwayes carried towards him a most religious respect, and have never spoken of him, but as of a man of very extraordinary parts. It must needes be, that this is some rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke of those impressions, which—hath left in him: and that he judgeth of me by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of my enemies. I will not revenge my selfe upon the memory of a dead man; nor lay aspersion upon the passion of so great a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; though there have beene some moved with motives lesse reasonable, that have wept for their Dogges; and built Tombes for beasts they loved. In that, I acknowledge the good fortune of—: but you know better than any other what his honesty was: and you
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3673:108"/>
ought upon this occasion to give your utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most testimony in behalfe of calumniated inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. I conjure you to doe it effectually: and from what coast soever the evill come, take into your protection an honest man, who pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately is,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I have received in one Packet, a Letter from you, of the foure and twentith of <hi>March;</hi> and another from Mounsieur <hi>Hug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> of the fifteenth of <hi>December.</hi> I give you a thousand thankes for each of them; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine not, that I staid a while for the latter, seeing if it had come a readier way, it had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not come so safe away: neither containes it any newes, wherof the knowledge might not be forborne without any danger: no matter in it, that either concernes the life of the Prince, or the good of the state. It might have come time enough, tonne yeares hence; for it speakes of nothing but of Kings and Commonwealths, that have beene long agoe. Our commerce hath
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3673:108"/>
no object, but our Bookes; and I have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complaine of a slownesse, that does a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to my negligence. But my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,—suffers me to be idle no longer; she will have me hereafter make use of her mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers; and by consequent, ease you of your conveying them. Yet for my part, I exempt you not altogether, but if you returne into <hi>Holland,</hi> at the time you have appointed; you shall doe me a favour to remember the note I send you. I intreate you also to demand of our friends in that country, what reason they have to bring into our language a new fashion of speaking; and which by the communication you have with them, is gotten into the letter you sent me. If you say, my Masters the States; you may as well say, Mounsieur the Counsell; and Madam the Assembly: and more than this; if many Senatours that make the body of a republike, may be called, my Masters the States, then every Senatour, which makes a part of that body, may be called Mounsieur the State: and if this be suffered, the most strange opinions of—shall be authorised by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like use: of the same words will be made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther language, and after this it cannot be thought strange, that—should speake of the <hi>Seigneury</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> as of the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Portugall;</hi> and that shee should marry with Mounsieur the Kings brother. It is true the League committed the like incongruitie when ita ve the Duke <hi>de Maine,</hi> the title of Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the State, and crowne of <hi>France,</hi> but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3673:109"/>
this was not without a checke: you know what sport the <hi>Catholicon</hi> makes at it; and with what force hee defends at once, both the rights of the Kingdome, and the lawes of Grammar. And where the same Authour in another place, calls the Assembly, which was held at <hi>Paris;</hi> My Lords the States; he did that but to make it rediculous; and not with meaning to speake regularly: Our deare friends may make of a little citie, a great; but of a bad word they cannot make a good: and though their liberty extend very farre, yet it reacheth not to license Barbarisme. Mounsieur <hi>Huggens</hi> will consider of this point; and if in propounding to the Counsell so important a matter, he shall speede well; he shall have the honour to purge his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try of a vitious phrase, as much in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Grammarians, as to free it from a <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra,</hi> or <hi>Chymaera,</hi> and therein shall shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a <hi>Hercules,</hi> or a <hi>Bellerophon.</hi> This is a way I take with my friends, to make my selfe laugh; because I am given to pensivenesse, when I am alone; and I cannot stirre up any joy in me, but by the presence, at least the representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some person, which is both deere unto me, and chosen for the nonce: of this number Sir, you are, and know well, that I am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, in the meane time, till I see you; be pleased to receive from mee a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which shall not be tedious: Onely to let mee congratulate with you the recovery of your health. God hath now a kinde of interest in preserving it; seeing you have consecrated it to him; and your life is vowed to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall meditation of his Mysteries. I doubt not of his blessing this your holy desire; and looke at my returne to finde a great Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher under your Cassocke. You will shew me as many Homilies, as heretofore you have shewed me Sonnets: and instead of <hi>Parnassus</hi> and <hi>Permessa;</hi> you will speake of <hi>Sion,</hi> and of <hi>Siloe.</hi> Yet moderate your selfe a little at first: and be reserved in a strange Country. I would not have you dive too deepe into the Abysses of Predestination; famous for the shipwrackes of so many Pilots; or to speake more plainely, for the heresies of so many Doctours. If you will take my counsell, you shall let the Iesuites and the <hi>Iacobins</hi> fight it out betweene themselves about the Question <hi>De Auxilijs;</hi> and never med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle amongst them, nor goe about to part them. The often using of Syllogismes is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous for health; there is nothing that heates the bloud, or enflame's choler more than Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3673:110"/>
Besides, though you make your selfe hoarse with speaking for the Truth, and make it never so plaine: yet you shall never make your adversary to confesse it; or ever be able to take hold of him, so long as he can slip from you by a distinction. Above all Sir, let not the love of Divinity make you forget your tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affaires, and the care of your fortune: for otherwise, It were better, I should study with you to halfes; and that you should make the Court both for your selfe and me. As I am like to acquit my selfe extreme badly; so you are likely to grow soone to perfection; and I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire not, one of these dayes to salute you by the Title, <hi>Of Most Reverend Father in God.</hi> I know you doe not dislike that wee should write to one another in this kind of stile, which <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Trebatius</hi> made use of, before such time as untoward compliments had corrupted friendship; and that this base jangling was brought into fashion. This <hi>Trebatius</hi> was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Lawyer: of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> made great account; and yet is alwayes wrangling with him about his Science, and his formall writs: the like liberty I am bold to take with you; whom I honour infinitely; and should not in this sort contribute to our common joy, if I were not with a perfect freenesse of heart,</p>

There is no Creditour nor Sergeant that you might not deale withall better cheape then with these troublesome friends. You are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate to be so beloved, and a man of whom so many other have use, can be of little or no use to himselfe. It is better yet to passe for a clowne, then thus to prostitute ones selfe by civilitie, and better never to sacrifice to the graces, then to make ones selfe the beast for the Sacrifice. You would perhaps intermit this course, but the time is past for that; a breach would draw upon you a warre; and you would runne the fortune of that poore Saint, who was murthered with pricks of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knives, and cut in peeces by his Schollers. You would be the object of a Rhetoricall, an Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall &amp; a Poeticall persecution; and the muses which now court you would grow furies, and fall a tearing you, so that you have no remedy now but to hold it out, if you looke for safety

in the place you are in, you must ever bee the mediatour betweene <hi>Apollo</hi> and Poets; you must alwayes have a thousand businesses both in Prose and Verse, your chamber must be the passage alwayes from the Vniversitie to the Court. This backe doore whereof you have sent mee a Platforme, is in truth an excellent invention, but this will presently bee discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and you will gaine nothing by it, but to be beseiged in more places at once. Doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sir, quit the place that is not tenable, and come save your selfe at———I am not so poore, but I can make you a reasemblance at least of the good cheere of <hi>Paris,</hi> and furnish you with innocent pleasures, such as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie and Priesthood will allow of; It shall be for as short a time as you please; and onely to make an ill custome take another course. All the family desires this voyage, particularly——who is in good hope his sonne cannot prove ill, seeing you have no ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, and for his daughter of whom you write mee so much good: I cannot stay my selfe from vowing to you, that shee is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of it; and perhaps would have deserved an Ayre with three couplets of your making, if shee had appeared in the time when you were the great Chaunter of <hi>France.</hi> But now that you have changed your course of life, there is no looking for any thing from you but spirituall discourse and Christian me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, which yet will serve as fitly for a Sex to which devotion belongs no lesse then

It must needs be some man who understands two things equally well, affaires and how to write, one that partakes of the life of a schollar, and of a Courtier; like to that God of whom the Poets say, he is of the one and other world, <hi>Utroque facit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercia

mundo.</hi> From the knowledge of Bookes, he drawes the vigour and force of his phrase, and from the practise of the Court; the colours and sweetning of his matter. Hee speakes the language of the Closet, and brings proofes of the Pallace; but in such sort, that neatenesse doth not weaken his Reasons; and his force is so tempered; that even Ladies may be judges of the processe. Once againe, I entreate you to send me the name of this sage Observer, and besides, to give me account what grace I stand in with Mounsieur <hi>de</hi>—: I was told in no very good grace; neither I, nor my writings neither. If I made but little reckoning of him; I should easily comfort my selfe, for this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: but in truth, it would grieve me much to be condemned by a judgement, to which I should make a conscience not to subscribe; and I rather beleeve, there are many defects in my Writings; then that in his taste there is any defect of Reason.

                     <head>To Mounsieur the Master Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate in the Parliament. LETTER XLII.</head>
                     <p>SIR, you know I have fed upon the fruits of <hi>Pomponne,</hi> even beyond the rules of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and I have signified to you in each place where they grew, that they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent; yet I now specially declare my selfe, in favour of the last you sent mee, and finde them, farre surpassing the Amber Peare, or all other kindes, which I cannot name. It is true, I affect specially the Tree it selfe that beares them: and I account the meanest of the leaves, no meaner than jewels: yet their owne goodnesse is such, that though they grew in the garden of—: or grew upon a stocke that Father—: had planted; yet I should not for all that, but highly esteeme them, and take a pleasure in their taste. In a word, to leave speaking in Allegory, and not to flounder my selfe in a Figure, into which you have most maliciously cast me: I say Sir, that in all your Presents, I see nothing but excellent; and least you should thinke, I meant to exempt my selfe from giving a particular account of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by speaking in generall termes: I let you know, that in the first place, the two lives spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of at the end of the discourse, please me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely; and next to this that place which is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:3673:113"/>
written upon occasion of—: that <hi>France</hi> is too good a Mother to rejoyce in the losse of her children; and that the victories gotten upon our selves, are fit to weare mourning, and be covered with blacke vailes. All that cuold have beene said upon this Argument, would never have beene comparable to this ingenious si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. And as he hath dexterously shunned a passage so tender, so he enters as bravely, and as proudly upon a matter that will beare it; when speaking of—: hee saith, that having over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the waves &amp; the winds, that opposed his passage, &amp; traversed the fires of so many canons of the enemies; with a few poore Barkes, hee made his way thorough a Forrest of great shippes. And a little after; where hee saith: that God, who bestowes his favours upon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by measure; seeing, that the admirable valour of ours, would easily conquer the whole world; if it had Prudence equall to its courage, seemes therefore to have given us, as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise to the greatnesse of our spirits; a kinde of impetuositie and impatience, which to our Armies have oftentimes beene fatall, and cause of ruine. But that now the case is altered in this point: for now the <hi>French</hi> are no longer <hi>French,</hi> then they are valiant: now these Lyons are growne reasonable; and now, to the strength and courage of the North; they joyne the prudence and staiednesse of the South, &amp;c. Also where hee saith, that the carriage at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal,</hi> is a thing incomprehensible; and for which we must be faine to looke out some new name;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3673:114"/>
for it cannot be called a Seige, seeing the place was surrendred before ever it was battered: nor it cannot be called a Battell, seeing no man strooke a stroake: nor it cannot be called a treatie seeing treaties are not made with wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in hand, &amp;c. But that which pleaseth mee most of all, because it toucheth indeede the string of my owne inclination; is that which he speakes of the Marquesse of <hi>Rambovillet:</hi> that there had beene Statues erected in honour of her vertue; if she had fortuned to be borne in the beginning of her race. For, as you know Sir, this illustrious woman, is of <hi>Romane</hi> stocke; <hi>Et de Gente Sabella;</hi> of which <hi>Virgil</hi> speakes. These are the passages I can call to minde, having not the Originalls by me: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken from me, by a neighbouring Lady; who affects the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> with the like passion, as Madame <hi>Rambovillet:</hi> so elevated a spirit may chastly enough be loved of both sexes; and let the slanderous History speake its pleasure; I for my part thinke no otherwise of it, then as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> loved <hi>Salomon:</hi> and as <hi>Nicomedes</hi> loved <hi>Caesar.</hi> I had begunne something for the triumph of this great Prince, but his death made my Penne fall out of my hand; and therefore you are like to have nothing from me at this time; in revenge of your Sonnet. For your <hi>French</hi> Prose, I send you another, which I will never beleeve to be Latin, untill—shall assure you, it is; to whom I entreate you to shew it from me: <hi>Vir plane cum Antiquitate conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,

                     <p>SIR, I make no secret of our friendship, it is too honest to be hidden; and I am so proud of it, that I thinke my selfe of no worth but by it.

                     <p>SIR, the time which my malady permits me, I bestow upon you, and make use of the respite of my sits, to tell you, I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved your last Letters, and the new assurances of your friendshippe; which is so much the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer unto me, because I know you use them with discretion; and that there be not many things you greatly affect. This makes for my glory, that I can please so dainty a taste; and that I can get good from one that is so covetous. It is no small matter to draw a wise man out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and to make Philosophie compassionate of others evills. Although the place, to which she hath raised you cannot be more eminent, nor more sure; yet my disgraces may because that her prospect is not so faire or pleasant:
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3673:116"/>
and how setled soever the peace of your minde be, yet the Object of a persecuted friend, may perhaps offend your eyes. Our Mounsieur <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> I assure my selfe, dislikes not this kinde of wisedome: he likes to have that husbanded &amp; dressed, which <hi>Zeno</hi> would have to be rooted out; hee knowes that magnanimity hath its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence betweene effeminatenesse and crueltie; and that the sweete and humane vertues, have place betweene the Fierce and the Heroioke. Poets sometimes make the Demy Gods to weepe; and if an old womans death were cause enough to make <hi>Aeneas</hi> shed teares; the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of one innocent, cannot be unworthy of your sighes. Yet I require from you, none of these sadde offices: your onely countenance is enough to give me comfort. I doe not live, but in the hope I have to see it, and to get you to sweare once againe, in presence of the faire <hi>Agnes,</hi> and the rest of your chamber Divinities, that you love me still. After that, if you will have us make a voyage in your Abby, I shall easily co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>discend: Provided Sir, that you promise me safety amongst your Monkes: and that they be none of those, that are angry at good lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and have no talke, but of <hi>Analysis</hi> and <hi>Cacozoale.</hi> If you have any that be of this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, you are an unfortunate Abbot; and you may make account to be never without suites.

or at least before the Sorbonne. God keepe you Sir from such Friers, and send you such as I am, who eate but once a day; and who will not open my mouth; unlesse it be to praise your good words, and to tell you sometimes, out of the abundance of my heart, that I am,</p>

Keepe your estimation and your bountie, for those that have nothing in them but Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Avarice: I am endowed from heaven with better and more noble passions; I like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to continue in my povertie, then in your disgrace; and will none of this cold specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive estimation, which is but a meere device of Reason; and a part of the Law of Nations, if you give it me single, and nothing else with it. I must tell you, I thinke my selfe worthy of something more; and that the Letter I write to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3673:117"/>
you, was worthy of a sweeter answer then you sent me. If therein I said any thing that gave you distaste, I call that God to witnesse, by whom you sweare; I then wandred farre from my intention. I meant to containe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints within so just bounds; that you should not finde the least cause to take offence. But I see I have beene an ill interpreter of my selfe, and my rudenesse hath done wrong to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie: yet any man but your selfe, would I doubt not have borne with a friend in passion, and not so unkindly have returned choler for sorrow. As for my pettish humour, it is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over, and there is not a shorter violence, than that of my spirit: whereas you have taken sixe whole weekes to disgest your indignation, and in the end come and tell me, you would doe me any good you can, upon condition to love mee no longer. I vow unto you, it is a glorious act to doe good to all the world, and to make even ungratefull men beholding. But Sir, if you thinke me one, to whom you may give that name; you doe me exceedingly much more wrong, then it is in your power to doe mee right: <hi>Neque decorum sapienti, unde amico in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famiam parat, inde sibi gloriam quaerere.</hi> I am wounded at the very heart, with this you have written; but since you will not suffer mee to complaine; I must be faine to suffer and say nothing; onely I will content my selfe, to make a declaration contrary to yours; and tell you, I will never make you beholding to mee, because I am not happy enough to be able to

                     <p>SIR, you cannot complaine, nor be in mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by your selfe alone: I partake of all your good and evill, and feele so lively a reflection of them, that there needes but one blow to make two wounds. And thus I am wounded by the newes you write, and though your griefe be not altogether just, yet it is sufficient to make me partake with you, that it is yours. We weepe for one not onely whom we knew not, but whom we know to be happy: one that in sixe weekes staying in the world hath gained that, which St. <hi>Anthonie</hi> was afraid to lose after threescore yeares pennance in the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3673:119"/>
Wildernesse. I wish, I could have had the like favour; and have died at the time, when I was innocent: being my selfe, neither valiant nor ambitious: I account those warres the best that are the shortest; and that, though in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise there be divers degrees; and diverse man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; yet there is not any that is not excellent good. Observe onely your goodly making of Saints, and you shall finde of all sorts; I meane of the one, and the other sexe: Religious and Seculars, <hi>Gascoignes,</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> You know well. I have appointed you here a chamber; and that you are my debtor of a visite, now a whole yeare, if you be a man of your word; but I feare me you are not, and that as your custome is, you will content your selfe with praising my quiet course of life; yet I would have you to flatter at least my spirit, though it be, but with some light hope of so perfit a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: promise me you will come, and make me happy; though you breake your promise, I shall enjoy at least, so much of good; and in doing so, you shal amuse me, though you do not satisfie me. I send you all I have of that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Incognito;</hi> of whom there is so much talke, and who hath made himself famous now these three yeares, under the name of <hi>Petrus Aureli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi> I cannot for my life find who he is. Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Filsac,</hi> told me lately at <hi>Paris,</hi> that of him that brought the leaves to Printing, hee could not possibly learne any more than this, that he was a man, who desires to serve God invisibly. And in truth, if you knew, in what sort he carries his secrecie; and with what care
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3673:119"/>
and cunning he hides himselfe; you would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse he takes more paines to shunne reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then ambitious men take in running after it. Farre from being a Plagiary, to robbe others of their glory, who refuseth that which is his own, and suffers a Phantasme, to receive those accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and praises which belong to himselfe. This is no man of the common mould; even in the judgement of his adversaries; and his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings savour not the compositions of his age. They are animated with the spirit and vigour of the former times; and represent us a Church we never saw. Yet it seemes in some passages, he hath lesse of Saint <hi>Austins</hi> sweetnesse than of St. <hi>Hieroms</hi> choler; and that he is willinger to doe that, which justice onely permits him, then that which charitie counsells him. I could wish he had shewed a little more respect to the gray haires, and rare merit of Father <hi>Sirmond;</hi> or rather that hee would have laid aside his Armes, and dealt with him in a gentler warre. But there is no meanes to bridle a provoked va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, nor to guide a great force, though with a great moderation. All Saints are not of one temper; it is enough for Religion to cut off vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and to purifie the passions. Our morall Divinitie acknowledgeth some innocent cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: and it is the beauty of Christs flocke, that there be Lyons amongst the Sheepe, and that as well the sublimest and strongest spirits as the basest and sweetest submit and prostrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the greatnesse of Christianitie. If I had learned nothing in his booke but onely to know what respect men owe to a Character
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3673:120"/>
reverenced of the Angells, I had not lost my time in reading him. If Bishops be of such emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent authoritie: shall we make any difficultie, to call a Prelate, My Lord; and esteeme him lesse than a Grande of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or then an Earle of <hi>England?</hi> You will tell me more of this, at your next meeting; and I doubt not, setting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the interest of——: send it mee backe when you have read it; and forget not the Chapters of honest <hi>Bernia.</hi> I am more than I am able to expresse,</p>

Yet hold on your course of goodnesse: which hath from the very first beene so ready to me, and freely makes me of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of that, for which it ought to make me be a suitor.

                     <p>SIR, you have a right to all occasions of doing good. I see not therefore, how I can forbeare to offer you one, and to the end, you may alwaies be meriting of thankes, why I should not alwaies be craving new courtesies. The bearer of this Letter is my neere Kinsman, yet our friendship is neerer, then our alliance, and the knot which Nature made, Vertue hath tyed. I humbly entreate your Lordship, to let him see you slight not things, whereof I make such reckoning, and to doe that for my sake, which you would much willinger doe for his owne sake, if he were knowne unto you. He is a man of mettall and spirit; and hath served the King in this Province, having also had the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3673:121"/>
honour, to be in person before him in very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous actions. At this time, he is troubled against all right and reason, and they that have drawne him, from the exercise of his charge, to make a walke to <hi>Paris,</hi> have nothing to say, but that they doe it of purpose to vex him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their manner of fight with him, is by flights and retreates, and they cast so many bones of difficulty, betweene his Iudges and him, that it is impossible they should ever come to any issue. They are not able to hinder his justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at last; but they are able to delay, and keepe him off a long time. You Sir, may save him this long journey, and may breake this Project of Calumny, if you please but to facilitate the overture, he will propose unto you, obtaining for him of—only one quarter of an houres audience. I assure my selfe, he will not be loath to heare him, being able to informe him of the state of things in these parts; and which he will doe faithfully. You shall therefore my Lord, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely oblige him, to take him into your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and you may be pleased to remember, that it is your deere sonne, that makes this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest unto you, one whom in the extasie of your Fatherly affection, you have sometimes called your glory; and the ornament of this Age, who yet accounts no quality he hath so glorious as that which he will never part with, whilst he lives; to be</p>

It is true Sir, that something is altered in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, and well neere one halfe added to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall; but the spight is, that base wares get no value by store, and the water that comes from the same Spring, can never be much differing: but if in any of the passages, I have not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come off ill, and that I have had some tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conceits, I acknowledge Sir, that I have had it all from the good education I had with you; and that it is the fruit of those Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which you have done me the honour to impart unto me.

But to speake truly, I feare this qualitie in you, no lesse than I esteeme it; you have too much knowledge in you for a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course that requires simplicitie in the Reader.

                     <p>SIR, I was upon the point of sending my footman to you, when I saw your footman enter my lodging, who brought me newes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding joyfull; and now I depend no longer upon Fortune, since another besides her selfe can make me happie; and am so indeed as much as I would wish, and should never know the value of your friendship, if I made it not the bounds of my ambition. To complaine of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3673:127"/>
and to be your favourite, are things that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a morall contradiction: it is an easie-matter to comfort a pension ill payd, when a man is in possession of store of treasure, and having nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the gift of impudency, nor of hypocrisie, it is not for me to prosper in an age which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemes them most that are owners of these qualities. It is enough for me, that M. the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall doth me the honour to wish me well, and condemnes not your judgement of mee; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disgraces, from whence soever they come, I am prepared to beare, and take for a favour the contempt that is linked to the profession of vertue. But it is too much to say of mee, that which <hi>Seneca</hi> said of <hi>Cato: Catonem saeculum suum parùm intellexit.</hi> These are transcenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of M. <hi>de Nantes,</hi> and impostures of his love. He stretcheth all objects to infinitie, and all his comparisons are beyond proportion. The Sunne and the Starres are common things with him, and he can finde nothing in Nature goodly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to serve for a similitude of that he loves. It is this deceitfull passion hath made you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that I am of some great worth, and that my barren soyle is fruitfull in high conceits. But Sir, I count all this nothing, if this love of yours perswade you not to come &amp; stay a while in it, and to be mindfull of your word. I have put Monsieur—in hope hereof, and make my selfe sure since you have made me a solemne promise; knowing that Truth is residentupon the mouth of Bishops.</p>

If you will know the successe, I can truly say, that all the company was well satisfied; but to tell you all, was even ravished with admiration of your bountie, specially my Niece, who in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test vanitie, that sexe is capable of, never durst imagine shee should ever have the honour to be praysed in Latin, and should serve for an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of commendation to the greatest Doctor of our age. Shee saith, this is a second obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you bind her in, to make her a <hi>Romane</hi> after you have made her your daughter; and to give her so noble a Country, after giving her so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Father. And yet to these two favours, I can adde a third, which shee forgot: methinkes Sir, shee fattens and grows gracefull with these prayses you give her; shee is fayrer by one halfe than shee was before. And if from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue there issue certaine beames which enlighten the objects that are neere it; and that beautie flowes from goodnesse, as from the Spring, I need not then goe farre to seeke from whence this varnish of her looke, this amiablenesse of her countenance, is growne upon her: It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly your late benediction that hath painted her; and to speake it in the words of the Poet,</p>

If this be the price of so poore a marchandise, as that I sent you, never was man a greater gainer by traffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king than I: and you seeme in this, not unlike those <hi>Indians,</hi> who thought to over-reach the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by giving them Gold for Glasse. I have long since knowne your great worth, though you would not be knowne to have such worth in you; all the care you can take to hide the beautie of your life, cannot keepe the lustre of it from dazeling mine eyes, and though you make your vertue a secret, yet I have pierced into it, and discovered it. And yet I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse unto you my infirmitie, I finde it too sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime for me, and with my uttermost abilitie am not able to reach it; all I can doe, is to respect it with reverence, and to follow you with my eyes and thoughts. The world cannot all rayse it selfe above the pitch of the presentage, and be wise in equall rank with <hi>Aristides</hi> &amp; <hi>Socrates;</hi> I am contented to be in a lower forme of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for I am a man, and they demy Gods; I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aspire to be their equall, nor their rivall, much lesse Sir, to be their judge or accuser.

                           </gap>fort</hi> judgeth culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, shee is not one that will complaine where there is no fault; and truly, if she had taken the mischance of her page in another fashion than shee did, I would rather have abandoned reason than maintaine it against her, &amp; would not have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3673:132"/>
trusted my owne testimony, if shee rejected it. You remember, that but hearing her Name, I fell downe in a trance, and that the very sight of her livery, strucke into me a religious horrour, and a trembling respect, which is not borne, but to things divine. And in this ranke, I place so rare a beauty as hers is; and though I be no man of the world, yet I am not so very a stranger to the occurrents of the world, but that I very well know, shee is universally adored; I must not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes passe for an Hermite; this I am sure, shee carries with her the desires and vowes of all the Court, and shee leades in triumph those Gallants, who have themselves triumphed over our enemies: yet I know withall, they depend more upon her by their owne passion, than by her endeavours, and follow without being drawne. These are Captives, whom shee trusts upon their word, for their true imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whom shee suffers to be their owne Keepers. In the course shee holds of honestie, her favours are so morall, or so light, that either they content none but the wise, because they desire no more than what is given them; or none but the unwise, because they take that to be given them, which was never meant them; so there are some perhaps well satisfied, but it is by the force of their imagination, and no body hath cause to be proud of a Fortune, which no body possesseth. As her vertue is as cleere as the fire that sparkles in her eyes, so her reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as much without blemish as her beautie; &amp; of this, honest people give testimony by their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3673:132"/>
words, and Detractors by their silence. Shee makes thornes that they cannot pricke, and makes slander it selfe to learne good manners. And therefore Sir, I should be very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, if I had been cause of displeasing her, whom all the world endeavours to please; and it would be a shame to our Nation, that a <hi>Frenchman</hi> should beare himselfe unreverently towards her, to whom very <hi>Barbarians</hi> beare a reverence. If this mis-fortune had besallen me, it is not the saving my Pages life, should make me stand in the defence; and I would never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to augment my traine, but to the end I might have the more sacrifices to offer upon the Altar of her choler. But shee is too mercifull, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish meane Delinquents, and too generous, to give petty Examples: shee reserves her justice for the Great ones, and the Proud; for those who having more tender senses, are better able to feele the weight of her anger; or els in truth her purpose is to shew me a particular favour, by a publike declaration, and to let the world see, shee makes a reckoning of that of which the world makes none. And knowing what the gratefulnesse of good Letters is, shee is desirous to have them in her debt; shee payes our studies before-hand, for the fruit shee expects from them, and obligeth the Art which can prayse the Obligation: shee is made beleeve, that I have some skill in this Art, and I perceive I am not in so little respect with her as I thought; and of this I am assured, by the paines it cost you, to make her take her Page againe that was hurt;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3673:133"/>
and by the civill language shee desired you to deliver from her. It exceeded indeed all bounds of moderation, and it seemes shee would not only for my sake protect an innocent, but would be ready, if need were, to reward a delinquent. For acknowledgment of which generous good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, all my owne spirit, and all my friends put together, can never be too much. It is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly your selfe to whom I must have recourse in this occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: you Sir, who set the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Beauties head, who have the power to make Queenes at your pleasure; and to whom <hi>Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia</hi> and <hi>Yzatide,</hi> are beholding for their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: having bestowed so great glory upon persons that never were; and set all <hi>France</hi> a running after Phantosmes, you may well take upon you to defend the reputation of a sensible and living vertue, and choose a subject that may be thankefull to you for your choice; and this is a matter you cannot deny, of which wee will talke more, and conclude it after dinner in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Lady that is interessed in it, into whose presence, I must entreat you, to be my usher to bring me, that so I may ever more and more be,</p>

It is farre from me, to maintaine a point, that you oppose; I give it over at the first blow, and yeeld at the first summons: yet I could never have thought, that of a jeast, there should have been made a fault; or that a poore word, spoken without designe or ayming at any, should have been the cause of so great complaints. You know, that in a certaine moderne Schoole, there is a difference made, <hi>Fra la virtu faeminile, &amp; la Donnesca;</hi> and it is held, that to make love, is more the vice of a woman, than of a Princesse; and lesse to be blamed in the person of <hi>Semird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> or <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> than in the person of <hi>Lucretia</hi>

or <hi>Virginia:</hi> I carry not my opinions so farre, and I meane to be no Authour of so extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a Moralitie. It may suffice, that without descending from the <hi>thesis</hi> to the <hi>hypothesis,</hi> I protest unto you, I should be very sorry, I had trenched upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reputation of that great Queen, or intended to corrupt the memory of so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent an odour, as shee hathleft behinde her; of whose great worthinesse, I have in other places sayd so much, that I should but shame my selfe to say any otherwise; and indeed, the termes I used were free, and not injurious, and such, as if they wound a little, they tickle &amp; delight much more: I neither spake disgracefully of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of her royall birth, nor gave her any odious or uncivill names, as some others have done, whom I condemne extreamly for it; yet Sir, I will yeeld to confesse, that I have said too much, and though my saying too much should have attractives to charm me, and were as deare to me as any part of my selfe, yet seeing it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastfull to you, I will for your sake cut it cleane off, and never looke for further reasons to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to it. I can deny nothing to my friends, and therefore make no doubt of the power you have over me, and of my testifying, upon this occasion, without further opening my eyes, that I am</p>

                     <head>To Monsieur <hi>de Borstell.</hi> LETTER XIII.</head>
                     <p>SIR, I am so farre from seeking to justifie my negligence, that I will not goe about so much as to excuse it: nothing but my being dead, can be a valuable reason why I waited not upon you, to offer you my service; all other impediments would prove too light, to have kept mee here: but such is your graciousnesse, that it is impossible to fall foule with you; such your indulgence, that you remit a fault before I can confesse it: you give me no leisure to aske you, at the very first, you oblige me to thanke you, and I have received my pardon here at home, which I never looked to obtaine, but at <hi>Oradour,</hi> and that with long solliciting. I have not yet seene the Ambassatrix, who hath done me the favour to bring it to me, and I cannot imagine, shee should be surprized with that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, as your Letter represents herein. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clones</hi> affliction, in respect of hers, would be but meane, and those women whose teares Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie hath hallowed, did but hate their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, in comparison of her: I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you doe her a pleasure, to raise her sorrow to so high a pitch; for after this you speake of, shee shall never be allowed to lift up her eyes, and you give her a reputation whereof shee is not worthy, if shee leave but one haire upon her
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3673:135"/>
head. I much distast your exaggerations, and cannot thinke shee will beare you out in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you make of her miserable estate: if it were such, as you make it, it would be capable of no remedie: <hi>Epictetus</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> would be too meane Physitions, to take her in hand; yet I meane not to contradict you:</p>
                     <lg>
                        <l>I thinke when death her husband sea'de,</l>
                        <l>Angelica with her Fates displeasde,</l>
                        <l>Lookt pale i'th face as Alablaster:</l>
                        <l>Charging the guiltlesse starres with blame</l>
                        <l>In the th'hard language, Rage could frame</l>
                        <l>When it is growne the Reasons Master.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <p>Yet the glory of her spirit makes me beleeve withall, that this sad humour was but a Fit, and continued not long, and that the same day upon the tempest there followed a calme. A man shall meet with some women of such spirits, that neither time nor Philosophie can worke upon them; and some others againe, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the worke of time &amp; Philosophie, by their owne naturall constitution. As there are some fleshes so hard to heale, that no Balme can cure the pricke but of a pinne; so againe, there are some bodies so well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posed, that their wounds are healed with plaine Spring water, and they close and grow together of themselves. I assure my selfe, our faire Lady is of this perfect tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that she wouldbe no example, to make widowes condemned for curling their locks, or for wearing their mourning gowns edged with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3673:135"/>
greene. You should alledge unto her the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Leonina,</hi> so highly esteemed of the Court of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the prime ornament of this last age. Knowing that her husbands quirry was come, to relate unto her the particulars of his death, &amp; hearing that his Secretary was to come the morrow after, shee sent the quirry word, to forbeare comming to see her, till the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary were come, that so shee might not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to shed teares twice. There is no vertue now adayes so common as constancy, nor any thing so superfluous, as the custome of comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. All the Steele of <hi>Biscay,</hi> and all the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>Thessalie,</hi> might well enough be trusted in the hands of the mourners of our time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any hurt. I scarce know a man that would not be glad to out-live, not onely his friends &amp; parents, but even the age he lives in, &amp; his very Country, and rather than die, would willingly stay in the world himselfe alone. Speake therefore no more of keeping <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> here by force, who in my opinion is not of herselfe unwilling; and not having lost the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> may therefore the more easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre her losse. I would to God Sir, I could be no sadder than shee is, and that I could forget a person, who is at this present the torment of my spirit; as he hath heretofore been the delight of my eyes: but melancholick men doe not so easily let goe the hold of their passions, and the good remedies you have sent to comfort mee for his death; I approve them all, but apply none of them: yet I give you a thousands marks,

                     <p>MAdam, seeing I could not come to see you at your departure, as I was bound to doe, I doe not thinke I shall doe you any wrong to send you a better companion than that I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed you; I meane the Booke I now send you, whereof you have heard so much talke, and which you meant to have carried with you into <hi>Perigord,</hi> to be your comforter for the losse of <hi>Paris.</hi> It is in truth worthy of the good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you have of it, and of the impatience with which I am a witnesse, you have expected it. And if wagers have been layd upon Queenes great bellies, and assurance given they should be brought abed of a sonne, why should I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that you have given before hand, your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of a thing that deserves the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the world? It will certainly bring you
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3673:136"/>
out of tast with the Present I gave you, when you desired me to looke you out some of my Compositions. In it you shall finde that, that will shorten he longest dayes of this season; That, that will keepe you from tediousnesse when you are alone; That, that will make you thanke me for my absence. For to say true, all visits will be unseasonable to you, when you set your selfe to the Recreation of so sweet a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; and whosoever shall come to trouble you at such a time, must needs have from you some secret maledictions, what civilities soever you make shew of, as your custome is. I would be loath to fall into this inconvenience, it is better I give my opinion a farre off, and in a Letter, which you may entertaine without any solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: since then you will have me beleeve, that my judgement is not altogether bad, nor my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions wholly unsound; I professe unto you Madam, that setting aside the affection I beare to the Authour of this worke, I have observed in the worke it selfe, a number of excellent things, which I could not chuse but prayse, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in an enemy. He is not so cholerick I hope, but that he will pardon me if I say that he is one of the most pleasing lyars that ever I saw. I complaine not of his impostures, but when he ceaseth to deceive me, because I would gladly have them last alwayes. His History hath quite removed my spirit out of its place, and hath tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the quicke all that I have sensible in me. I will not hide my weaknesse: I knew at first, that the painting I looked on, was all false, yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3673:137"/>
I could not hold from having as violent passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if it had been true, and as if I had seen it with mine eyes: sometimes sorrowfull, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times glad; as it pleaseth Monsieur <hi>de Bois Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> to tell me tales of good or bad fortune. I find my selfe interessed in good earnest in all the affayres of his imaginary Kings; I am put in feare for the poore <hi>Anaxandra,</hi> more than I can expresse, and as much I am humbled for the mis-fortunes of <hi>Lysimantus,</hi> and I have seene them both in such extremities, that I made so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne vowes for their safetie, when at the very height they were miraculously delivered. In conclusion Madam, though I have a heart hard enough, and eyes not very moyst, yet I could not forbeare to shed teares, in spight of my selfe; and I have been even ashamed to see, that they were but the dreames and fancies of another man, and not my owne proper evils which put into me such true passions. This is a tyrannicall power, which the sence usurpeth over the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and which makes us see, that the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hood of the imagination, is extreamly contagious to the intellectuall part, and that there is much more body than soule in this proud creature, which thinkes it selfe borne to command all others. The <hi>Aethiopick</hi> History hath oftentimes given me these Alarums, and I cannot yet reade it without suffering my selfe to be deceived. As for other writings of this kinde, it is true, I make some choice, and runne not after all <hi>Spanish Romanos,</hi> with equall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. They are indeed for the most part, but <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liodorus</hi>
                        <pb n="31" facs="tcp:3673:137"/>
in other clothes, or as—sayd, but children borne of <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Chariclea,</hi> and seeme to resemble their Father and Mother so neere, that there is not a haires breadth of difference betweene them. But in this worke Madam, I make you promise you shall see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, and shall finde in it this sweet ayre of the wide world, and these dainties of the spirit, which are not common in our Provinces. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesso unto you, there is in some passages some thing that may seeme too much painted, and perhaps too garish, and which will not beare examining by the rigour of Precepts; but then you must confesse as well that Fables looke chiefly after beautie, and care not though it be a little immodest, seeing this kinde of writing is rather a loose Poesie, than a regular Prose. As soone as I shall be able to ride, I will come and heare your Oracles hereupon, and tell you, as I use to doe, that as your selfe is one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest things I ever saw, so I am more than of any other,</p>

                     <p>SIR, though you should say, I present you alwayes with flowers that prick you, and offer you services that may seeme unseasonable, yet I cannot forbeare the sollicitations of my Letters, nor the trading with you by this way of Complements. The Booke which I have desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—to deliver to you, shall passe if you please, but for an Essay; and I am contented that my discourses Morall and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, shall contribute nothing to the mending of my own fortune, so they may contribute some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the recommending of my Sisters busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: if it become me to speake of a person that is so neere unto me, and if you thinke me wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be credited in the testimony I shall give of her, I am able Sir, to say thus much, that shee is a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either lifted up by her own strength above the passions of her sexe, or that Nature hath exempted her from them, by a peculiar priviledge: so farre, as that amongst us, shee stands for an example, and leads a life that is the edification of all our Province. But though shee make profession of severe vertues, yet shee aspires to no glory by sullen humours; shee hath

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cousin, I thinke my selfe a rich man with the goods you have given me another that should have received the same present, should not owe you for it the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, but the opinion of things, is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their value; and because I have neither minde nor eyes that be covetous, I account the Emeraudes of your Glasse-windowes, of as great a price as those of Lapidaries: at least, whereas they are without life and motion, these live and moove in my base Court. I know my riches, and am known by them, and after I have read my selfe starke blind, I goe and refresh my wearied sight in that admirable verdure, which is to me both a recreation and a remedie. Base objects, not onely offend my imagination, but even provoke my choler; and I should never receive a Monkey from the best of my friends, but onely to kill it: but I vow unto you, that beautie pleaseth me wheresoever I meet it; yet because it is a dangerous thing in womens faces, I like better to behold it in the feathers of birds, and in the enameling of flowers. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures so chast, are compatible with Lent, and

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3673:142"/>
I doe not amplifie any thing at adventure, nor suffer my selfe to be swayed with flattery; but in this point of Illumination, Madam, I alwayes except matters of Faith, least your Ministers should take advantage of my words. We must needs, I say, hold for certaine, that either you have been instructed by an extraordinary way, or confesse that you owe it all to your selfe, and that comming to know the truth, without stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and discipline, your vertue is a meere work of your owne making. It is no small matter for one that lives in parts remote from the Court, to be but tolerably reasonable, &amp; able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his common sence against so many oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites and oppositions, as he shall meet with; but in those remote parts, where you have no choice of Examples, there to discover the <hi>Idaea,</hi> from whence Examples are taken, to breath in an infected Ayre, and full of Errours; and yet reteine still sound opinions; to be continually opposed with extravagant questions, and yet alwayes returne discreet answers; To take pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of silly Buffons, when others admire them; to make a difference between jeasts picked up here and there, and those that come from the Spring it selfe; between wise discourses, and harmonious fooleries; between a sufficiency that is solid, and that which is onely painted; to doe these things Madam, ought to be called even halfe a miracle: and no lesse a raritie in these dayes than in former times, it was to see a white <hi>Aethiopian,</hi> or a <hi>Scythian</hi> Philosopher. Our Country may justly be proud of so admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

a birth; It is the great worke of her famous faecunditie, and wee may boldly say, there is that found in <hi>Saintoigne,</hi> which is wanting in the <hi>Circle;</hi> that which hinders the Court from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleat, and that which is necessary for the perfecting of <hi>Paris</hi> it selfe. But as well here as there Madam, if ever you will heare the vowes of those who wish your happinesse, I would thinke it fit, you should not make your selfe a spectacle for the vulgar, nor suffer your enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to be a recreation for idle persons. It deserves not to be approached unto without preparation; &amp; that they should examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves well, who present themselves before it. All spirits at all times, are not capable of so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a communication, and therefore, let men say what they will, I account the reservations you make of your selfe, to be very just, and it cannot be thought strange, that being as you are of infinite value, you take some time to possesse your selfe alone, and not to loose your right of reigning; which admits, as no division, so no Company. To use it otherwise Madam, would not be a civilitie, or a courtesie, but indeed an ill husbanding of your spirit, and a wastfull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of those singular graces, of which, though it be not fit you should deprive them that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour you, yet it is fit you should give them out by tale, and distribute them by measure. It is much better, to have lesse generall designes, and to propose to ones selfe, a more limited reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than to abandon ones spirit to every on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3673:143"/>
of the people, who leave alwayes a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine taynt of impuritie upon all things they looke upon: by such vitious sufferance, we find dirt and mire carried into Ladies Closets: if there come a busie fellow into the Countrey, presently honest women are besieged, there is thronging to tell them tales in their eares; and all the world thinkes, they have right to torment them: and thus, saving the reverence of their good report, though they be chast, yet they be publike; and though they can spie the feast sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon their ruffes, yet they willingly suffer a manifest soyling of their noblest part. You have done Madam, a great act, to have kept your selse free from the tyrannnie of custome, and to have so strongly fortified your selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst uncivill assay lants; that, whilst the Louver is surprized, your house remaines impregnable. I cannot but magnifie the excellent order, with which you dispose the houres of your life; and I take a pleasure to thinke upon this Sanctuary of yours, by the onely reverence of vertue made inviolable: in which, you use to retyre your selfe, either to enjoy more quietly your repose, or otherwise, to exercise your selfe in the most pleasing action of the world, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of your selfe. If after this your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie solitnde, you come sometimes and cast your eyes upon the Book I send you, you shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Madam, doe me no great favour: the things you shall have thought, will wrong those you shall reade; and so it shall not be a grace, but an affront I shall receive. I therefore humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat

you, there may be some reasonable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, between two actions, so much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: Goe not streight from your selfe to me, but let the rellish of your owne meditation be a little passed over, before you goe to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation in my worke. To value it to you, as a piece of great price; or otherwise, to vilifie it, as a thing of no value, might justly be thought in me an equall vanity.

This latter humilitie, is no better than the others pride.

                     <p>SIR, I never deliberate upon your opinion, nor ever examine any mans merit, when you have once told me what to beleeve. But yet, if I should allow my selfe the libertie to do otherwise, I could but still say, that I find Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de</hi>—well worthy the account you hold him in, and my selfe well satisfied of him, upon his first acquaintanee. By further conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, I doubt not, but I should yet discover in him more excellent things, but it is no easie matter, ever to bring us together againe: For, he is a Carthusian in his Garrison, and I an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite in the Desart; so as that which in our two lives makes us most like, is that which makes us most unlikely ever to meet: yet I sometimes heare Newes of him; and I can assure you, he is but too vigilant in looking to his Charge; hee hath stood so many Rounds and Sentinells, that it is impossible, he should be without rhumes, at least, till Midsomer. These are, to speake truly, workes of supererogation; for I see no enemy this Province need to feare, unlesse perhaps, the <hi>Persian</hi> or <hi>Tartarian:</hi> the very Name of the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3673:144"/>

I was yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in a great musing upon this, when suddenly a great light shined in my Chamber, and daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led mine eyes, even as I lay in my bed. And not to hold you long in suspence, the Name of the Angell I meane, was Madam <hi>d' Estissac,</hi> who thus appeared unto me, and willing to make the world see, how much shee hath profited in Religion, runnes after all occasions, to put her Christian vertues in practise. This somewhat abates the vanity I should otherwise have taken in her visite; for, I see it is rather charitie than courtesie, and I am so much beholding to my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie for it, that shee made a doubt whether I were sicke enough to merit it; as much as to say, a Paralitick should have had this courtesie from her sooner than I. They must be great miseries that attract her great favours; pittie which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the fayrest hands of the world to bury the dead, may well get of the fayrest eyes that ever were, some gracious lookes to comfort the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. What ere it be, I have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that no sadnesse is so obstinate and clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but pleasing objects may dissolve &amp; pierce, not any Philosopher so stony and insensible, but may be softned and awaked by their lightest impression. I verily thinke, another of her vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, would have set me on my legges, and made

me able to goe: but shee thought me not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a whole miracle, and therefore I must content my selfe with this beginning of my cure. I enforme you of these things, as being one that reverenceth their cause, and as one that loves me too well, to make slight of the goods or evills I impart unto him. This last word of my Letter, shall serve, if you please, for a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective to the former, I revoke it as a blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and will never beleeve, that all the Magick in: <hi>Paris,</hi> is able to make you forget a man, whom you have promised to love, and who passionately is</p>

I will hasten all I can to finish the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse I have begun, thereby to put my selfe in state to see you; and if my minde could goe as fast as my will, I should my selfe be with you as soone as my Letter. It is true, there cannot be a more delicate and daintie place, than this where I live banished; and a friend of ours said, that they who are in exile here, are farre hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier than Kings in <hi>Muscovia:</hi> but being sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from a man so infinitely deere unto mee, I doe not thinke, I could live contented in the Fortunate Islands; and I should be loath to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of felicitie it selfe, if it were offered me, without your company. Wherefore assure your selfe, that as soone as I can rid my selfe of some importunate visits, which I must necessarily both receive and give, I will not loose one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the time, that I have destinated to the accomplishment of—and will travaile much more assiduously than otherwise I should doe, seeing it is the end of my travaile, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can give me the happinesse of your presence. In the meane time, I am bound, first to tell you, that I have seene here—and then to give you thankes for the good cheare he hath made me. He beleeves upon your word, that I am one of much worth, and gives me Encomiums, which I could not expect from his judgement, but that you have corrupted it, by favouring me too much. I earnestly entreat you, to let mee heare from you, upon all occasions; and to send me by the Post the two books, which I send for to Monsieur—if you have not received

                     <p>MAdam, being in a fit of a Feaver, I heare you are at <hi>Oradour,</hi> where I should have the honour to see you, if the joy of so good Newes had the power to carry me thither, and

were able to give me the health, which it is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to promise me. Being therefore not in case to assure you in person, how sensible I am of your many courtesies; give me leave to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie unto you, that I am not unmindfull of the very last you shewed me, and that I give you thankes for the beginning of my amendment, whereof you are the cause. It is certaine, that when I was burning in a most extreame fire, I received a notable cooling and comfort, to heare you but onely Named; and this, Madam, is the first miracle you have done in this Countrey, if you stay but a while here, I hope we shall see many more and greater, and that you will leave some excellent markes, that you have beene here. Our Desarts shall be no longer rude, or savage, having once been honoured by your presence, the sweet ayre, that breaths on the bankes of the <hi>Loyre,</hi> shall spread it selfe hither; and I doubt not, but you will change all the choler of <hi>Lymousin</hi> into Reason, and make our Lyons become men. I doe not thinke, there is any will oppose this truth, unles perhaps—who had the heart to part from you with drie eyes, and could not finde teares to accompany yours. I have told him of it to his shame, before Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—and both of us agree, that in this occasion, he might honestly enough, have broken the lawes of his Philosophie, &amp; might have lost his gravitie, without any lightnesse. Whilst wee were together, they desired to see a part of my Prince, which as yet I dare not call by so illustrious a Name; for in truth, Madam,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3673:149"/>
he can be but a private person, untill such time as you proclaime him, and that he receive inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture from his Soveraigne: so I call your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, which is with me in such respect and reverence, that I should preferre it before Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it selfe, if they were two things that could be separated, and that I were allowed to choose which I would have. I would say more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but that methinks, I have done a great worke to say so much; for my head is in such violent agitation, with the heat of my last fit, that all I can doe at this time, is but to set my hand to this Protestation, that I honour you exceedingly, and am as much as any in the world,</p>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3673:150"/>
did, when I had some strength to resist it. By staying in my chamber, I loose all the fayre dayes that shine in the garden; all the riches of the fields are gathered without me; I have no part in the fruits of Autumne, whereof the Spring gave me such sweet hopes; and I am promised health at winter, when I shall see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a pale Sunne, a thread-bare Earth, and dead sticks, that have brought forth grapes, but not for me to eate. In this miserable estate, I have no comfort, but onely the Letter you did me the honour to write unto me, which is so precious to me Madam, that I even honour it, with a kinde of superstition, and am ready to make a chaine or bracelet of it, to try whether the wearing it about me, may not proove a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Remedy against my Feaver, than all the other I have used. There is but one word in it that I cannot endure, being not able to conceive why you should call your selfe Unfortunate: are you not afraid, least God should call you to account for this word? and charge you with ungratefulnesse, for making so slight reckoning of his great benefits and Graces? He hath lifted you up above your owne sexe, and ours too, and hath spared nothing to make you compleat; the better part of <hi>Europe</hi> admires you; and in this poynt, both Religions are agreed, and no contesting betweene Catholike and Protestant; The Popes <hi>Nuntio,</hi> hath presented our Beliefe even to your person, all perfumed with the complements and civilities of <hi>Italie;</hi> Princes are your Courtiers, and Doctours your Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers:
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3673:150"/>
and is this Madam, that you call to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate? and that which you take for a just cause to complaine? I humbly intreat you, to speake hereafter in more proper termes, and to acknowledge Gods favours in a more gratefull manner. I know well, that your loyaltie hath suffered by your brothers Rebellion; and that in the publike miseries you have had some private losses, but so long as you have your noble heart, and your excellent spirit left you, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, you should be unfortunate; for indeed, in these two parts, the true Madam <hi>Desloges</hi> is all entire and whole. It is I Madam, that have just cause to say, I am unfortunate, who am never without paine, never without griefe, never without enemies; and even at this very time I write from a house of griefe, where my mother and my sister being sicke on one hand, and my selfe on the other, I seeme to be sicke of three sicknesses at once; yet be not afraid, least this I send you should be infectious, as though I had a designe to poyson you with my Presents: for I have not yet medled with any of the Musque fruits, which I hope you shall eate; I have not durst so much as to come neere them, least I should chance to leave some light impression of my Feaver upon them: They are originally Natives of <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and have not so dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from the goodnesse of their auncestors, but that you will find them, I hope, of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing taste, and besides Madam, rhey grow in a soyle that is not hated of Heaven, &amp; where I can assure you, your Name is so often rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

                     <p>MAdam, see here the first thankes I give you, for you know, that having never done me but displeasures, I have never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned you but complaints: but now at last you have been pleased to beginne to oblige me, and after so many sentences of death, which you have pronounced against me, and after so many cruelties, which I have suffered, you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought your selfe, ten yeares after, to send me one good Newes, which truly is so pleasing to me, that I must confesse, you had no other way to reconcile your selfe unto me; and I cannot forbeare to blesse the hands that brought mee a Letter from Madam <hi>Desloges,</hi> though they were dyed in my bloud, and had given me a thousand wounds. The sence of former injuries, hath no competition with so perfect a joy, and of two passions equally just, the more violent is easily
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3673:151"/>
overcome of the more sweet. You have haste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the approach of my old age, and made gray one halfe of my haire; you have banished mee this Kingdome, and forced me to flie your ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, by flying into another Country: finally, it is no thanke to you, that I have not broken my owne necke, and made matter for a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: and yet foure lines of Madam <hi>Desloges,</hi> have the force to blot out all this long story of my mis-fortunes, and willingly with all my heart, I forget all the displeasures I have received, for this good office you now affoord me. I make you this discourse in our first language, that I may not disobey Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—who will have me write, but will not have me write in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other stile; for in truth, and to speake seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, now that he leaves me at libertie, I must confesse unto you Madam, that I am exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound unto you, for the continency I have learned by being with you, and for the good examples you have given me: your medicines are bitter, but they heale; you have banished me, but it is from prison: and if my passions be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the snow of my head, I have then never a white hayre, which I may not count for one of your favours. I therefore recant my former complaints, and confesse my selfe your Debtour of all my vertue. The time I have imployed in your service, hath not been so much the season of my disorderd life, as it hath been an initiating me into a regular life which I meane to leade. Your conversation hath been a schoole of auste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie unto me, and you have taught me, never to

                     <p>MAdam, my evill Fortune, gives one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beginning to all my Letters: I am impatient even to death, to have the honour to come and see you: but now that I am well, the ayre is sicke, and all the Countrey drowned: There is no Land to be seene between this and <hi>Lymousin;</hi> and the mischiefe is, that there is no navigation yet found out, for so dangerous a voyage. This bindes me to waite, till the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be fallen, and that God be pleased to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his Covenant with <hi>Noah.</hi> As soone as this shall be, I will not fayle to performe my vow, and to come and spend with you the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piest day of all my life. In the meane time Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, give me leave, to tell you, that I am not yet well recovered of the extasie you put me in, by writing unto me such excellent things, that I could not reade them with a quiet minde, nor indeed without a kinde of jealousie. All <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignon</hi> would be sufficiently paid with that you
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3673:152"/>
write of a dozen paltry Muske-fruits I sent you; &amp; you prayse my writings with words, which have no words worthy of them, but your own. This, of one side makes me envious, and of the other side interessed: and if the honour I receive by your flattering Eloquence, did not sweeten the griefe of being overcome, it would trouble me much that I had no better defended the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of our sexe, but should suffer it to loose an honour, which the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Latines</hi> had gotten for it. Yet take heed, you hazard not your judgement too freely, upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of humane things: you reckon him a Prince, who is not yet borne, you should have seene his Horoscope from the poynt of his conception, before you should speake of him in so loftie termes. But besides that nothing is lesse assured, than the future; and nothing apter to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, than hope: Consider, Madam, I beseech you, that you favour an unfortunate man, and that Faction oftentimes carries it away from truth. It will be hard for you, your selfe alone, to withstand an infinite multitude of passionate men: and it may be said to you, as was said to those of <hi>Sparta,</hi> upon occasion of the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic of the <hi>Persians,</hi> that you can never van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish as long as they can die. Herein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be feared, but for your selfe; for as for me, I finde in your favour, all I seeke for; and having you of my side, I care not what fame can doe, having once your testimony, I can easily flight hers; and all her tongues put together, can never say any thing for me, that is worth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3673:153"/>
the least lyne of your delicate Letter. It is at this time, the delight and joy of my spirit; I am more in love with it, than ever I was with—and if shee shew you that which I write to her, you shall finde, I make not so much reckoning of my ancient Mistris, as I do of your new mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger; and that I desire all the world should know, that I perfectly am,</p>

sleepe all night; to the end, that sending up sweet vapours into my braine, I might have in my i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination, none but pleasing visions.

It is not my designe, to talke idly, nor to set my stile upon the high straine; you know, I am bound to avoyde <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> as Mariners to avoyde Sands and Rockes; but this is most true, that with all my heart, I renounce the world, and all its pompes, as long as you please to inhabit the Desart, and if you once determine to stay there still, (though I have sent to <hi>Paris</hi> to hyre me a lodging) yet I resolve to breake off the bargaine, and meane to build me an Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, a hundred paces from your abode: from whence Madam, I shall easily be able to make two journeys a day to the place where you are, and shall yeeld you a subjection, and an assidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of service, as if I were in a manner of your household. There shall I let nothing fall from your mouth, which I shall not carefully gather up, and preserve it in my memory. There you shall doe me the favour, to resolve me when I shall have doubts; set me in the right way, when I goe astray; and when I cannot expresse my selfe in fit termes, you shall cleere my clouds, and give order to my confusednesse. It shall be your eares, upon which I will mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure the cadences of my sentences; and upon the different motions of your eyes, I will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

of the strength or weaknesse of my wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. In the heate of the travaile, and amidst the joyes of a mother, that lookes to be happily delivered, I will expose the Infant to the light of your judgement to be tryed, and not hold him for legitimate, till you approve him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Madam, we will reade your Newes, and the Relations that are sent you from all parts of Christendome: Publike miseries shall passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, without troubling our spirits; and the most serious actions of men, shall be our most ridiculous Comaedies.

                     <p>MAdam, wee receive the Answers of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles without making reply; perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is dumbe, and if you had left me the use of my tongue, I should then have had one part at least, of my spirit free from this universall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment that hath surprized it. You are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes lifted up above the ordinary condition of humanitie, and the divinenesse of your spirit is no longer an Article in question amongst people that are reasonable; yet I must confesse, you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shewed it more visibly, than in the last Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you writ unto me, &amp; if at other times I have beene dazeled with some beame, you have now made me starke blind with the fulnesse of your light. Spare Madam, I entreat you, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my sight, and if you will have me be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure your presence, take some more humane forme, and appeare not all at once in the fulnesse of that you are, I were never able to abide such another flash of brightnesse. My eyes are weary with looking upward, and with considering you, as you are a creature, adorable and divine. Hereafter I will not looke upon you, but on that side you are good and gracious, and will not venture to reason with you any more, for feare I should to my owne confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on illustrate the advantage of your spirit over

mine. You shall have nothing from me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, but prayers and thankes; and I will make you confesse, that I sollicite better than I praise. I therefore send you now Madam, divers cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses at one time, and persecute you with no lesse than three afflictions at once, I meane, three Letters of recommendation, which I request from you, in behalfe of—I humbly entreat you to deliver them to this messenger, and to write them in such a perswasive style, as might be able to corrupt all the <hi>Catoes</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though indeed, the cleernesse of our right, hath more need of their integritie, than of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.

Pardon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the weaknesse of a vulgar spirit, which feeles no crosses light, and falls flat downe at tho very first blow of adverse Fortune. Perhaps in prosperitie, I should carry my selfe better, and I doe not thinke, that joy could make me inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; but to say the truth, in affliction I am no body, and that which would not so much as leave a scratch upon the skin of a Stoick, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me to the very heart, and makes in it most deepe wounds. Griefe dejects me in such sort, and makes me so lazie in doing my dutie, and so unfit for all functions of a civill life, that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no longer at those that were turned into trees and rockes, and lost all sence with onely the sence of griefe. Yet Madam, as often as I call to minde, that I hold some part in your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and love; I am forced to confesse, that my melancholy is unjust, and that I have no good foundation for my sadnesse. This honour ought to be unto me a generall remedy against all sorts of affliction, and the misery that you complaine of, is not so much to be pittied as to be envied. From thence it is, that I draw all the comfort I am capable of, humbly entreating you to beleeve you shall never pitie a man in misery, that will be more gratefull than my selfe, nor that is more passionately, than I am</p>

                     <p>MAdam, I receive but just now your Letters of the five &amp; twentieth of the last moneth, and though I know not, by whom to send an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, yet I can no longer hold from expressing my joy, nor keepe my words from leaving my heart to fall upon this paper. The last time I writ unto you, I had heard of the unfaithfulnes of a friend of mine, which struck me to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart; since which time, a better report hath somewhat quieted me; but it is you, Madam, that have restored to me the full use of my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and are a cause that I am contented to live. Although corruption be in a manner universall, and that there is no more any goodnesse to be found amongst men, yet as long as you are in the world, it is not fit to leave it quite, but your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue may well supply all its defects. Besides Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, if it be true, as you doe me the honour to write unto me, that you account my interests as your owne; this very consideration is enough to make them dearer to me than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and I am therefore bound to preserve my selfe, seeing it seemes, you would be loath to loose me. One gracious word, which I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in your Letter, hath wonne me to you, in such sort, that I have no longer any power of my selfe, but what you leave me; and in all your

What businesse soever I am about, I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to let this thought make me a trewant at my travaile; it is a recreation, for which I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon all affayres; and there is neither Morall, nor Politique, <hi>Plato</hi> nor <hi>Aristotle,</hi> but I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently give him over as soone as you are once presented to my imagination. I hope I shall need to use no Oaths, to make you beleeve this veritie: you are well enough acquainted with my pride, and know that this Country swayne would not, turne flatteret for an Empresse.

                     <p>MAdam, you shall receive from me no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated excuses, I had rather confesse my fault ingenuously, than take the paines to justifie it untowardly. Indeed a fatall sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, cousin german to a Lethargie, hath seazed in such sort upon me since my comming hither, that I have not so much as written to my owne mother; so as having fayled in this first poynt, I thought not fit to fayle by halfes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never troubled my selfe much in the rest of my dutie. I speake Madam, of this exteriour dutie, and this affection in picture, which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes but a false representation of the soule, for as for the true respect, and the passion, which hath residence in the heart: I assure you, I have that in me for you, as pure and entyre as ever, and that he that calls you his Soveraigne, yet honours you not more perfectly, than I doe. Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—will I doubt not, be my witnesse herein; and will tell you, that what part soever I be forced to play amongst jeasters and merry companions, yet under my players cloathes, there will alwayes be found an honest man. I have beene sensible, Madam, of the losse, which—hath had, and have not bin sparing to speake of his unfortunate vertue; yet I never thought, he needed any comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

The paines I have hytherto taken, have beene but ill required.

                     <p>MAdam, I writ unto you about six weekes since, but my packet not being delivered where I appointed it, I perceive some curious body hath seazed on it, and sought for secrets, which he could not find. The losse is not great, to loose nothing, but a few untoward words; and small comforting would serve me, for so small a crosse; yet because they were full of the passion I owe to your service, and carried in them the markes of my dutie, I cannot but be troubled, they came not to your hands, and that my mis-fortune, gives you cause to complaine of my negligence. I dare not undertake to cleare my selfe altogether; for though in this I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no fault, yet I cannot forget some other faults committed before. The truth is Madam, I have been for some time so continually taken up with businesse, that I have beene wanting in the principall obligations of a civill life, and I have drunke besides so many bitter potions, and tasted so many bitter Pills, that I should but have offended you with my complements; which could not choose but carrie with them, at least some tincture of my untoward hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. What pleasure could you have taken, to see a medley of choler and melancholy, powred out vpon paper? and instead of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3673:162"/>
Newes, to reade nothing but pittifull Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and mortall Predictions? But enough of this unpleasing matter. I expect here within three or foure dayes, my Lord the Bishop of <hi>Nantes;</hi> and I would to God Madam, you could be here at that time, and that you were at leisure to come and taste the doctrine of this rare personage. I have heard you say hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you never saw a more holy countenance than his, and that his very looke, was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of perswasion. This conceit, makes mee hope, that he is the man, whom God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be your Converter, and to bring you into the bosome of our Church. Beleeve mee Madam, and you shall not be deceived; trust that enemy, who wounds not, but onely to draw out the bloud that causes a Feaver, and never make difficultie to commit your selfe to one, that intends your freedome. The triumph which the world makes you feare, is no way injurious to those that be the captives; nor like unto that of which <hi>Cleopatra</hi> tooke so sadde an apprehension: but in this case, the vanquished are they that are crowned, and all the glory and advantage of the victory rests on their side: I am not out of hope to see so good a dayes worke; and seeing you are rather layd asleepe in the opinion of your mother, than obstinate in a wrong cause: I intreat you, that you will not be frighted with phrases.

This is the faelicitie of the Golden age, where Plentie had no neede of tilling; and where there was reaping without sowing. Yet Madam, I must not so abandon my cause, that I forbe are to alledge the good it hath in it; it is long since I writ unto you, it is true, but the cause hath beene for that these six moneths, I have every day been upon comming to see you: and according to the saying of the Oratour your acquaintance, I have dispenced with my ordinary dyet, in hope of a great Feast, and to performe my devotion with the more solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. If Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—have kept his word with mee, he hath told you, how often he hath found me upon the very poynt of comming; but as many journeys, as I intended to make, so many crosse accidents alwayes happened to hinder them, and the mis-fortune that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies me, makes every dutie, though never so casie to another, impossible to me. Yet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I have never ceased from doing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all acts, of the reverence I beare you, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sweare, but by your merit. My braine is drie in any other Argument, and wordes are drawne from me one by one; but when there is occasion to speake of you, then I over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow in words; upon this onely Text, I take
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3673:164"/>
a pleasure to be Preaching; and Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—to whom I am alwayes before a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kener; as soone as I beginne discourse of you, becomes my auditour. I can assure you Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, he honours you exceedingly; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his ambassage to <hi>Rome,</hi> from whence Gentlemen returne not commonly without a certaine conceit of soveraigntie; nor the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the State, which make particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, thinke themselves the Publike, have beene able to make him take upon him, this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull gravitie, which makes Greatnesse ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and even vertue it selfe odious. He hath protested here, before good companie, that hee will never be found other, and that Fortune should have an ill match in hand, to thinke to corrupt him. I used my ordinary rudenesse, and intreated him, to be mindfull of his word, and to be one of our first exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of so rare a moderation: You shall see Madam, in a Letter I send you; that which hereupon I am bound to say of him: and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, to maintaine for me, that I am no common prayser: and that, if I were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of what I say, it is not all the Canons of the Towne should make mee to say it. It is onely the worth of things, or at least, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I have of their worth, that drawes from mee the prayses I give them. If Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—should returne to be a private person, I should not respect him a jot lesse, than now I doe: and if you should be made Governesse of

                     <p>I have shewed our Ladies the Description of this proud and stately Night, and of the rest of your magnificence, which if it were in a seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Common-wealth than ours, would be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Profusive Wast; they admire you in your house, as well as in your Verses, and agree with mee in this, that Wisedome hath a hand in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, and that, after shee hath discoursed of Princes, and matters of State; shee descends to take care of her Hosts, and lookes what is done in the Kitchin.

                     <p>MAdam, your place is before all other things whatsoever, and therefore no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full impediment can be alleaged, for sayling in the dutie, that is due unto you. I have these two moneths had great affayres; which in the rigour of your Justice, is as much as to say, I have these two moneths neglected my dutie. Having not written to you, in all this time, I am contented to call it, a Disorder, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I should call a Businesse, and I doe not thinke, I could with all the reasons of the world have made you patient, to stay so long, for the thankes I am to give you. Your present hath equally wherewith to content both the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and the vaine; it hath soliditie no lesse than lustre; the onely sight of it, refutes the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie you use in speaking of it: you are injurious Madam, to so excellent a thing; it deserves the most stately inscription, you could devise to give it, and if I were worth the having of a Cabinet, this should be the prime piece, I would make choice of to adorne it. Because vulgar people have nothing but eyes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they value nothing but Candlestickes of Crystall, and guilded vermillian dishes, but men of understanding, who see lesse with their eyes them with their spirits, they reflect upon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,

that are more simple and immateriall, and preferre not the peoples errour, and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers fingers, before the truth of things, and before the Master-pieces of the workes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Hee, to whom you did me the honour to send me, is farre above all the Encomiums I can give him: I have onely this to say Madam, that I have with me here, a famous Authour, who as soone as he hath once read him, is resolved instantly to shut up shop, and give over his Trade. He protests he will never more set hand to Penne, unlesse it be to signe his last Will; and therefore meanes to make you a sacrifice of all his Papers. I shewed him the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sonnet, <hi>De L'Amant qui meurt,</hi> at every verse, he called you Divine, and made such lowd Exclamations, that he might have beene heard to the great high way: which you know, how very farre it is from my Chamber. Hee sayth, he will maintaine it, even to the sheete Saint <hi>Jaques,</hi> that <hi>Parnassus</hi> is fallen upon the Distaffe, and that <hi>Racan</hi> hath given over the right he pretended in the succession of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>MAdam, you never heard speake of such a diligence, in two moneths your Letter hath gone twelve myles; so as a businesse that required hast, had been this way in a good case: and if therein you had given me advise for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my life: I might have had good leisure to dio, before your advise came.

                     <p>MAdam, I am of your opinion, and can by no meanes approve the ambition of your fayre neighbour: her head is full of state and soveraigntie, and aymes certainly at a Crowne. God loves her too well to second her bad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and to give her that shee askes: so rare a beautie ought to be the recompence of vertue, and not the prey of Greatnesse: It is fit, that he who possesseth her, should understand, when things be excellent, should know the value of this, and all his life be thankfull to his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune for it: it is fitter to make a Gentleman hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, than to give contentment to a tyrant; fhee might perhaps be some amusement to him, when he were cloyed with killing of men; but withall, shee might be sure to be the next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his crueltie, at the next fit of his wicked humour. You know the Story of <hi>Mariamne;</hi> our Theaters at this day sound forth nothing so much, as the cryes of this poore Princesse: hee that put her to death, loved her above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and after her death, kneeled downe a thousand times before her image, praying her to forgive him. <hi>Poppea</hi> was first the Mistris, afterwards the wife, and alwayes the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of <hi>Nero;</hi> shee had vanquished this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and made him tame, yet at last he slipt from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:3673:169"/>
her, and in an instant of his choler, gave her a kicke upon the belly, which was her death. His unkle <hi>Caius</hi> dealt not so roughly with <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonia,</hi> yet in the greatest heat of his fire, he made love to her in these termes: <hi>This fayre head shall be chopt off, as soone as I but speake the word:</hi> and told her sometimes, that he had a greater minde to put her on the racke, to make her tell him, why he loved her so much. The meaning Madam, of all this is, that the tamest of all Tygers is a cruell Beast, and that it is a most dangerous thing, to be woo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He is in truth, a great man in his profession; one might well trust him, and slip from hence to <hi>Paris:</hi> He glides by the brinke of <hi>Praecipices,</hi> and passeth broken brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with an admirable dexteritie, say what you can of his manners otherwise; Pardon mee, my Lord, if I maintaine that they be no vices, and that you doe him great wrong to reproach him with them in your Letter.

For my part, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, he spake not in earnest, when he made you this untoward answer, and that it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a tryall of your patience, than for an exercise: He hath the reputation of so honest and just a man, that I can make no doubt of that he hath promised to Monsieur <hi>de</hi>—and I am perswaded, he accounts himselfe more streightly tyed by his word, than by his bond.

                     <p>SIR, you are too just to desire such duties from a sicke friend, as you would exact from one that were in health. The reasons I can give of my silence, are much juster than I would they were, and me thinkes, three moneths continuing in a Feaver, may well dispense with any obligation whatsoever of a civill life. Yet seeing you will needs have me speake, I cannot but obey you, though I make use of a strangers hand to quarrell with you. I cannot endure the dissimulation you shew, in doubting of my affection, and of the truth of my words. I understand no jeasting on that side; these are Games that I am uncapable to learne, and in matter of friendship, I am of that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, that I am even wounded with that, which is perhaps intended but for a tickling. I perceive I have beene complained upon to you, but I entreat you to beleeve, it hath been upon very false grounds; and I require no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter justifier, than her owne conscience that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth mee.

                     <p>SIR, I am much bound unto you for your writing to me, and for sending me Newes that exceedingly pleaseth mee. You may well thinke, I have no mind to crosse my own good; and to refuse giving my consent to the Earle of <hi>Exceters</hi> request. To have so illustrious an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter in <hi>England,</hi> is morethan a full revenge upon all the petty Scribes that oppose mee in <hi>France:</hi> it is the crowning and triumph of my writings. I am not therefore so a Philosopher, that I place the honour he doth mee, amongst things indifferent, but rather to tell you plainly, I have perhaps received too sensible a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it; and upon the poynt of falling againe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3673:173"/>
into my old desire of glory; of which I thought my selfe to have been fully cured: I send you a word, which I entreat you to deliver to him, which shall witnesse for mee, how deare and glorious, the markes he gives mee of his love and account, are unto mee; Otherwise Sir, I doubt not, but I owe a great part of this good fortune to the good opinion you have of me, which is to be seene in every lyne of your Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and that you have confirmed the <hi>English</hi> in this Error, which is so much in my favour. Onely I entreat you, never to seeke to free them of this errour, but so to deale with them, that if you convert them from other, it may still be with reservation of this. The truth in question is of so small importance, that it deserves not any curious examination; and in which, to be in a wrong beliefe, makes not a man to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lesse honest, or more unfortunate: Never therefore, make scruple to oblige me, seeing you shall oblige a thankfull man, and one who is;</p>

                     <p>SIR, If I were onely blind, I would try to make some answer, to the good words of your Letter; but the paine, which my ill eyes put me to, makes mee uncapable of this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing contention: and I cannot draw from my head, in the state it now is, any thing else but Water and Waxe. And besides the unhappie blindnesse I speake of, I am in such sort over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with Rheumes; that if it were in the time of the old Metamorphoses, I thinke veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I should be turned into a Fountaine, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the subject of some new Fable. I have lost as well my smelling, as my taste; my Nose can make no difference betweene <hi>Spanish</hi> Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and an old Cowes hide: and I sneeze so continually; that all my conversation, is but to say, I thanke you; to them that say, God helpe you. Being in this estate, doe you not wonder, I write unto you, and have the boldnesse to be sending Letters? In truth, never complement cost me so deare as this, and if I would make use of the priviledge of sicke men, I might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry justly require a Dispensation; but I had not the power, to let your servant goe away, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out telling you, that you are a very honest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postour; and that the <hi>Perigurain</hi> you send, is the most refined <hi>Frenchman</hi> that ever ranne

                     <p>MAdam, I am alwayes of your minde; and like not Ladies that would be Cavaliers. There are certain bounds that part us, and ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> us out our several duties and conditions: which neither you nor we can lawfully passe. And the lawes of Decencie are so ancient, that they seem
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3673:174"/>
to be a part of the ancient religion. <hi>Moses</hi> hath extended the commandements of God, even to the distinction of your apparell, and ours: and you know hee expresly forbids to disguise our selves in one anothers cloathes. Women must be altogether women: the vertues of our sex, are not the vertues of theirs; and the more they seeke to imitate men, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from their owne kinde. We have had some women amongst us, that would ride <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi> horses would discharge Pistols, and would be parties in maintaining quarrels. M. the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall <hi>Scomberg</hi> shewed mee once a letter which he writ to a Gentleman of—at the end whereof were these words; <hi>I kisse the hands of this valiant and pleasing Lady, that is your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond in the day, and your wife at night.</hi> This La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might perhaps bee valiant, but to my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, she could not be pleasing. If she had had abeard, she could not have had a greater fault. Women that are valiant, are as much to blame, as men that are cowards. And it is as unseemly for Ladies to weare swords by their sides, as for Gentlemen to have glasses hanging at their girdles. I professe my selfe an enemy, Madam, to these usurpations of one sex upon another. It strikes me with a kinde of horrour, when I reade in historie of the ancient women Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whom the <hi>Romanes</hi> beheld with such plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in their Amphitheater; and I account not <hi>Amazons</hi> in the number of women, but of Monsters and Prodigies. Sweetnesse and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse are the qualities that belong to you
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3673:175"/>
and will your she Friend give over her claime to these, that is, to the succession of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the priviledges of her birth? will she not be as well content as you, with the partition which Nature herselfe hath made? I cannot conceive with what face she can goe a hunting amongst such violence &amp; tumults, and how she can run hallowing all day, till shee bee out of breath, after a kennell of Hounds, and a troope of Huntesmen. God made her for the Closet, and not for the Field: and in truth, it is a great sin to distend so handsome a mouth, and to disfigure so comely a face, with blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a horne. To expose such excellent things to all the boughes of the Forrest, and to all the injuries of the weather; and to endanger such pretious colours with winde and raine, with the sunne and dust. And yet, Madam, to see hunting, without being a partie, to goe in Coach, and in Parkes inclosed, where a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of beasts are kept prisoners, and come to dye at Ladies feet, such a recreation as this, I doe not condemne, being onely entertained with the eyes, and may passe either for a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle, or a walke; and is as farre from agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as from rest. But this serves not her turne, she calles these but lazie and sedentarie recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and takes no pleasure, but when it is with hazard of her life. But what would be thought Madam, if one should come and tell you, shee is slaine with a fall, by ranke riding, or that shee hath met with a wilde Boare, that was too hard for her? In such cases, ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3673:175"/>
onely be no excuse for her death, but it would bee a blot upon her memory for ever: and to save her honour, there must bee feigned some other accident in her Epitaph. As for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discoursing Lady you complaine of, and whom I know, she commits not, in truth, such extravagant faults as this doth; yet shee hath her faults too: and I can no more allow of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to bee Doctors, than of women to bee Cavaliers. She should take you for a pateme, and make profit of the good example you give. You know indeed, an infinite number of excellent things; but you make no open profession of your knowledge, as shee doth, and you shew, you have not learned them to keepe a schoole. You speake to her, when shee preacheth to you, and making po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular answeres to her riddles, and giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction to her confusion: you doe her at least, this good office, to expound her to her selfe. Neither in the tune of your voyce, nor in the manner of your expressing, is any thing seen in you, but that which is naturall and French: and although your spirit bee of an extreame high clevation, and farre above the ordinarie reach, yet you so accomodate it to the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of all that heare you, that whilest the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner sort doe understand you, the more able spirits doe admire you. It is a great matter, Madam, to have gotten the knowledge of such excellent things: but it is a greater matter so to hide them, as if they were stollen, and to call them, as you doe, by the name of your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

                     <p>MY most deare Sister, I send you the Book which you required of mee, for my Niece, and I beleeve, that this and her Prayer-Booke, make her whole Librarie: shee shall finde in it, a Devotion that is not too mysticall, nor too much refined; and which hath nothing but Morall and reasonable. I like this popular Divinitie, which meets us halfe way, and stoops a little, that we may not strayne our selves too much. It followes the example of its Authour, who made himselfe familiar with common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and put not backe so much as Courtisans and Publicans, farre from making division in families, and withdrawing women from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their mothers, and their husbands. It commends this obedience, as their principall verue, and calles it a second worship, and a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond religion. I shall be glad to see my Neece make profession of a pietie, so conformable to naturall reason, and so good a counsellour of all other duties. But let her not, I pray, climbe higher, and undertake Meditations of her owne head: <hi>Grenada</hi> whom I sent her, hath taken this paines for her, and hath meditated for her, and for all other that shall reade his Bookes. There is nothing more dangerous, than to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:3673:179"/>
mount up to Heaven without a helper and a guide; and it is a great confidence, one must have in his Spirit, to let it goe so farre, and be assured, it will ever come backe againe. It is not long agoe, there was in a Towne of <hi>Spaine,</hi> a Societie of devoted persons, who continued in meditation so many houres a day, leaving off all base works, to live, as they sayd, a more heavenly life; but what thinke you, became of it? even a thousand domesticall disorders, and a thousand publike extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. The lesse credulous, tooke the pricke of a pinne, for a Saints marke, the more humble, accounted their husbands prophane; the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser sort, spake what came in their heads, and made faces perpetually. In so much, that when in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> there did not past three or foure runne madde; it was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good yeare. It is fit to stay ones selfe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true vertue, and not to follow the vaine Phantasmes of holinesse. And it is farre safer, to ground ones selfe upon a solid and certaine reading, than to goe wandring in a hollow, and unsteady contemplation. If I had more time, you should have more words; but hee that brings you the letter, calls upon mee for it, and I can no more to it, but that I perfectly am</p>

                        </gap>, that my Niece is fayre, and you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, I will challenge no man, for saying so. Beautie is in Heaven a qualitie of those glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bodies, and in Earth the most visible marke that comes from Heaven. It is not fit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to slight these gifts of God, nor to make small account of this sparke of the life to come: It is not fit to be of so crosse an humour, to blame that which is generally praysed. Marke when a comely personage comes in place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but this advantage of her birth, you shall presently see all that were talking, to hold their peace; and what noyse soever there was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, you shall have all husht, and an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall calme upon a suddaine: you shall see a whole great multitude, all busie in different la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to make presently but one body, and that onely to stand to gaze and wonder: some leave to make up the reckoning they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, some curtoll their complements, and cut them off in the midst; every man puts off his conceits to some other time, onely to take a

full view, and to contemplate this divine thing that presents it selfe. If it be at a Sermon, they leave hearkening to the Preacher, and they are no longer the auditours of M. <hi>de Nantes,</hi> but the spectatours of <hi>Calista.</hi> The fayre can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be seene without respect, without prayses, without acclamations. They triumph, as often as they appeare, and their youth hath not mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap> dayes, than their beautie hath Festivalls. But the mischiefe is, my deere Sister, that the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stivals are short, the youth is not lasting, and the fayre at last come to be ill favoured. Queenes and Princesses grow old, and there is no old beautie, but that of God, of the Sunne, and of the Starres. These heads that now have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther skinne, nor flesh, nor hayre; These car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kasses and dry bones have beene in their time, the divinities and wonders of the world: and was heretofore called the Dutchesse of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinois,</hi> the Dutchesse of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of—: Besides there may happen dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, which will doe old ages worke before hand, and are oftentimes more gastly than death it selfe. Wee are frighted sometimes to see the spoyle and ruines of Faces, upon which the foote of sicknesse hath troaden, and there is nothing, in which wee may more observe the lamentable markes of the inconstancie of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things. From hence I conclude, that beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being a thing so frayle and tender, subject to so many accidents, and so hard to keepe; it is fit wee should seeke after another beautie,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3673:181"/>
that is more firme and permament, that can better withstand corruption, and better defend it selfe against the force of time. Above all, it is not fit, that women should be proud of a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that is infamous for the losses and wracks of many poore Consciences, and which as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and chast as it can be, will yet be a cause to rayse in others, a thousand fowle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and a thousand unhallowed and wicked thoughts. Say, my Niece hath some thing in her that is pleasing, some thing that is fayre and beautifull, as her friends conceive, yet shee ought alwayes to be afraid of such a good, that is so dangerous for doing hurt to others. I set before her eyes, the sad Picture of that which shee shall be hereafter; to the end, shee may not grow proud of that which shee is now. There is no hurt in meditating a little upon this poynt. But allow her the libertie wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now tooke from her; yet withall, put her alwayes in minde, that of the foure beauties I have shewed her in my <hi>Tasso;</hi> there is but one of them, that will be a fit example for her to follow. Shee must leave <hi>Armida</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minia,</hi> for the Gallants of the Court, <hi>Clorinda</hi> is for the valourous men of <hi>Gascoigne,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigord;</hi> but shee that I propose for her Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, is <hi>Sophronia.</hi> And if shee have not courage enough to say to the Tyrant, as shee sayd, It is I that am the Delinquent you looke for; let her at least, have the other conditions, that are necessary to the being her follower,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3673:181"/>
and imitate her in them. This fayre Saint made profession of modestie, and neglected her beautie; shee was alwayes, eyther hidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a veile, or shut up in her Chamber, and all the world might suspect her to be fayre; but there was scarce any at all that knew it but her mother. Shee had no designe to entrappe any mans libertie, and therefore layd not her snares in their way, nor went to Church to see and to be seene. My deare sister, I cannot choose, but take upon me here to be a reformer of corrupt manners, and make my complaint to you, of a Custome, which as well as many other naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie things, the Court hath cast upon us. What reason is there in the world, that women should enter into holy places, of purpose to draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, the view and attention of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? as much as to say, to trouble and disturbe the whole devotion of a Towne, and to doe as bad, or worse, as those buyers and sellers did, whom Christ whipped out of the Temple? By this meanes, good actions become evill, and Pietie comes to have no better odour before the Altaus, than Perfumes that are mustie and corrupted. Women now adayes, are bound to be seene to be at Church; and this very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of being seene there, is the ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the place where they are seene. And in truth, seeing this place is particularly called the House of God, what is it but to vilifie God, even in the highest degree, to come and offend at his owne doores, and as it were to his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3673:182"/>
face? It is even as great an Impudency, as that of the first Angells, who sinned in Paradise. Yet herein certainly, the <hi>Italian</hi> women are more pardonable than the <hi>French;</hi> for they indeed, have no other breathing time of their unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate libertie, being at all other times, kept up as slaves and prisoners: but in <hi>France,</hi> where women are not denyed the company and visits of honest men, they can have nothing to say, in justification of this incontinency of their eyes, and of this unsufferable vanitie, to seeke to part stakes with God, in mens vowes, and to share with him in his publike Adoration. You little thought this morning to heare a Preacher, and I as little thought to be one, but as you see, the zeale of Gods House, hath brought mee to it; and finding my selfe at leisure, I was desirous to bestow part of it upon you. The Text was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven mee yesterday, by the company that was here; where my Nieces beautie was so much extolled, that, sending you Newes, which are to her so glorious, I thought fit, to send her withall, a cooling, to keepe her glorying in some temper: and so my deare Sister, I take my leave, and am with all my soule,</p>

                     <head>Another to her. LETTER LV.</head>
                     <p>MY dearest sister, having both of us but one passion, it makes us alwayes talking of one thing. My Neece is the subject of all our Letters, as she is the object of all our cares. For my owne part, I see not a good or a bad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, which I make not use of, for her instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and endevour to imploy it to her profit. You remember a woman the other day, who values nothing, likes of nothing, excuses no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and let her be in the best &amp; most pleasing company that may be, yet she is sureto put them all into dumpes and melancholy. You can come on no side of her, but she pricks and bites: all her coasts are craggie and rockie. And it was not without cause my brother sayd, that if the man you wot of, had married her, there would certainly have nothing come of that marriage, but Teeth and Nayles. It is impossible to live in peace with such a savadge chastitie. I make no more reckoning of it, than of that of the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whom the ancient Poets call virgines, and wonder not, that women of this humour, love no man, seeing they hate the whole world.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3673:183"/>
This sad and sullen poyson taking up all the roome in their soules, leaves no place at all for other passions that are sweet and pleasing. They flye pleasures, rather by having their mouth out of taste, than by having their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in perfection: and are so continually fretting, that they have no leasure at any time to be merrie. As long as they bee chaste, they thinke they may lawfully bee discourteous, and scratch men, so they doe not kisse them. They have a conceit, that by wanting one vice, they have presently all vertues: and that for a little good fame they gaine to their husbands, they may keepe them under yoake, and affront all mankinde. It is true, the losse of a womans honour is the greatest disgrace she can possibly incurre; and which once lost, shee hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left her that is worth the keeping: But yet it followes not, that the preserving it, is any such royall act; and I doe not admire any, for not being willing to live in misery and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. I never heard, that a woman should bee praised, for not falling in the fire, or for not casting her selse downe a rock. We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the memorie of them that kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; but we give no reward to them that preserve themselves. And so indeed it is, a woman that magnifies her selfe for being chaste, magnifies herselfe for not being dead, and for having a qualitie, without which she were as good bee out of the world, seeing shee stayes not in it, but for a plague to her name, and to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:3673:183"/>
see her owne infamie. I say yet more, that shee ought not so much to consider the vice as an evill thing, as to consider it as an inpossible thing, and not to have it so much in detestation, as in ignorance. For indeed, if a woman bee truly vertuous. shee will sooner believe there are Meremaids and Centaures, than that there are any dishonest women: but will rather conceive that the world is given to slandering, and that Fame is a lyer, than that her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is false and disloyall to her husband: though with her owne eyes she should see the fault committed, yet it is her part to suspect her eyes mere mistaken, and that it was but an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion which she saw; at least, shee should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give sentence upon this sort of delinquents, seeing Christ himselfe would not doe it to the adulterous woman. When others wrong a woman, it is her part to be sorrie: and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers say, she hath beene unfaithfull, it may bee enough for her to say, she hath beene unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. And yet more than this too, I could wish, if it were possible, that where shee findes most weaknesse, there she should make report of most goodnesse: und I would no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, that vertue should beget this bad qualitie. It is an enemie to societie, and deserves not to have so good a mother: and one may well flie and blame the vice, so as the flying it, bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oftentation, and the blaming it be without choler. For otherwise, it would bee as much as to require a statue for doing nothing: and in
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3673:184"/>
the smart of the punishment, to seeke for the pleasure of revenge. An honest woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the world by the example of her life, and not by the violence of her spirit. She ought not to proclaime warre against any; not against the most indiscreet and insolent: and if there chance any licentious or uncivill word to be uttered in her hearing, she ought to checke it, either by giving no care, or by falling into some other discourse, or by casting upon the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker a beame of modestie, that may cover his confusion, and pierce his very soule: and thus she shall use a chastising without offending. There is as well a severitie in modestie, as a sweetnesse; and which keeps insolence it selfe in awe: and a woman that carries this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertue in her eyes, keepes men within the bounds of their dutie, without ever falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to out-rage, or into words of choler. Other vertues are hidden, and have nothing in them that is visible, or that falls under sence. This This vertue hath a body of light, and riseth up into the face, in those pretty straines, which bashfulnesse that is her usher, as <hi>Aurora</hi> is the Sunnes, sends up: into it. And in truth, the Purple, whereof the Poets speake, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares at the breake of day, is nothing so rich and glorious, as that which is disclosed in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie a little bashfull; the effect whereof in noble tempers is not an over-flowing of blood, but onely one single drop well husbanded. It is not a masse of red, which sets the face on fire.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:3673:184"/>
It is onely a first impression, and as it were, a shadow of tincture, that lightly colours it. This honest blush, which is so pleasing a thing in maydens faces, and which I distinguish from that, which is sottish and untoward, is a barre, and sufficient defence against the audacious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the most impudent; and when it is seen to shine in a womans looke, there is no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousnesse that is not dazeled with it, and is not stopt from daring to proceed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no necessitie of using any straining of the voyce, any churlishnesse of words, or any agitation of gestures, to doe that, which may better be done by silence, and with quietnesse. And indeed women are bound, if for nothing else, yet for the very interest of their beauty, to shunne a passion, that makes such villanous faces, and sets so many wrinkles upon their countenance. I have heard some of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, that the sent of a Rose was too strong, and that Muske made their heads ake, because it had not milde sweetnesse enough: and why then will they not take that sweetnesse into themselves, which they seek for so much in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things? and finde fault with the want of it, in that Art, which proposeth to it selfe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end? If without this sweetnesse, there grow from the most pretious odours, a certaine qualitie which offends them; and if there bee some Flowers, and some perfumes that please them not, what likelihood is there, that Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone and Salt-peter can please them, and that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3673:185"/>
their humour can have any thing common with these violent substances? It is true perhaps, that sweetnesse and mildnesse have their exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; but yet, even those excesses are more law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, than the justest temper of shrewishnesse and incivilitie; at least in a woman, they are much more commendable: and it becomes her better to dissemble that shee knowes, than to discover verities that are odious: and better she should be thought to come out of another world, than to carry to a man the first newes of her stinking breath; and teach another to know the infirmitio of her race, which perhaps hee knew not before. These liberties are not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the freest conversations, they draw on other more dangerous liberties; and though your sex be inviodable, and have the priviledge of sanctuarie, yet prophane persons stick not to lay hands on the Saints themselves, and on their Altars, and nothing is so sacred, that can escape the hand of sacriledge. Onely those persons that can revenge offences, may venture to give offences; and a man that will give the lye, must be of a condition to fight a Duell, &amp; maintain it by Armes. My Neece hath no great need of these precepts, nor indeed of any forraigne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; she cannot wander from the right, if she goe not astray from her owne inclination; nor can be troublesome to others, if she borrow not a vice which is none of her owne. I have therefore represented to her, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the other day: but after their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3673:185"/>

                        </gap>hy objects, and to make that hatefull to her, which is not in it selfe lovely; to confirme her in the principles which you have taught her, and to draw her out some rules from her own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: she is (I know) naturally good; but the best natures have need of some method to guide them, and direction doth never any hurt to vertue: she is able to keepe herselfe in termes extreamly obliging, without ever falling into the basenesse of flatterie: She is able to please without colloguing; and though shee call not every thingby the right name, nor bee so very curious to speake in proper termes, yet her stile shall not for that, bee the lesse liked, nor her companie the lesse desired. She may call them wise that want the reputation of beeing valiant; and women that are sad, she may say they are serious. If a man bee not of a quicke spirit, she may say, he is of a good judgement: and if one bee unfortunate in his actions she may say, he hath a good meaning in his counsails. But yet in this there is a measure to bee held, and a choyce must bee made, in laying her colours, that shee seeke not to disguise all sorts of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: for there are some indeed that are not capable: of disguising. Those that are pale, she may praise for their whitenesse: but those that have a dropsie, she must not praise for their fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: shee may say, that scruple is a bud of pietie. But shee must not say, that prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3673:186"/>
is an effect of Philosophie. Shee may make a favourable construction of things doubtfull, and sweeten the rigour of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular judgements; but shee must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend against common sence, nor bee oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to verities that are publicke and manifest. Shee must make a difference betweene er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and crimes, betweene a docible sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie and a presumptuous stupiditie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene sots that are honest, and those that are wicked. And if shee happen to bee in companie, where some weake spirit is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, as the world is full of such that will triumph over the weake, and take no pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any, shee must then, by all meanes, bee a protectresse of such a one, and make herselfe a Sanctuarie for all those, whom stronger adversaries would otherwise ruine. This onely is to bee observed, that shee so undertake the maintaining of weake causes, that it may appeare by the tune of her voyce, that it proceedes from excesse of goodnesse, and not from want of knowledge: and that shee compassionates humane infirmities by an act of charitie, makes not herselfe a partie by false perswasion. I am now at the end of my paper; and should have beene a good while since at the end of my letter: but I alwayes forget my selfe when I am with you, and never thinke howres shorter, than those I bestow upon your memorie.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, being stayed here by some occasions, I suffer this hard necessitie with a great deale of paine, and account my selfe banished from my Countrey, being so long a time deprived of your presence. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not, but the victorious and triumphant Newes, that comes continually from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, gives me some resentment of joy, and that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3673:188"/>
the brute of your Name in all quarters, toucheth me very sensibly; but it is no perfect satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me, to learne that by others relating, which I ought to know as an eye-witnesse, and I conceive so great a pleasure to consist, in the sight of your glory, that there is not a common Souldier under your Command, whose hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse and good fortune, I doe not envie. But my Lord, though I cannot serve you with my bodily actions, yet I revere you day and night, with the thoughts of my minde, and in this so worthy an imployment, I never thinke the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest part of my selfe, can doe service enough. Your Lordship, next to the King, is the eternall object of my spirit, I never turne my eyes from the course of your life; and if perhaps, you have Courtiers more officious than my selfe, and such as doe their duties with greater often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and shew, yet I am most sure, you have no servant that is more faithfull, and whose af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection comes more truely from his heart, and is fuller of life and vigour. But to the end, my words may not be thought vaine, and without ground, I send you now a proofe of that I say, by which, you shall perceive, that a man that is himselfe perswaded, hath a great disposition to perswade others, and that a Discourse, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the things themselves, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ated with the truth, both stirres mens spirits with greater force, and also begets a firmer beliefe, than that which is but feigned, and comes but in the nature of Declayming. This, my Lord,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3673:188"/>
is a part drawne out from the whole bodie, and a piece, which I have taken most paines to polysh; which, I freely vow unto you, that all the houres of a calmer leisure than mine, and all the powers of a more elevated spirit than ordinary, would have found worke enough, to bring to perfection. In it, there is handled, Of the vertue, and victories of the King; Of the Justice of his Armes; Of Royaltie and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; Of usurpers and lawfull Princes; Of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion chastened, and libertie mainteined; but because the Prince I speake of, is a stirrer, and makes no stay any where, and that in following him, I should imbarque my selfe in a world of severall subjects; I have therefore, prescribed to my selfe certaine bounds, which in his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I should never have met with: and after the example of <hi>Homer,</hi> who finished his <hi>Ilias</hi> with the death of <hi>Hector,</hi> though that were not the end of the warre; I have thought fit, not to goe further, than the taking of <hi>Suze,</hi> though this were but the beginning of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, wee have seene of his. You know my Lord, that this kinde of writing, which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to my selfe, is without comparison, the most painfull of all other; and that it is a hard matter, to continue long in an action that must be violent, and to be violent in an action that must continue long. This prayse belongs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to Oratours, I meane such as know how to perswade, how to please in profiting, and can make the people capable of the secrets of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:3673:189"/>
Governning a Common-wealth. For as for Philosophers, that have written of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their discourse is commonly so drie and meager, that it appeares, their intention was rather to instruct, than to reconcile; and besides, their style is so thornie and cumbersome, that it seemes they meant to teach none, but the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And in this, there is no more difficultie, than there is in healing of men that be in health. And for a man, to make himselfe obscure, there needs no more, but to stay upon the first notions wee have of truth, which are never, eyther wholly pure, or purely mingled, and which falling from the imagination upon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, leave upon it such a confusion, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles rather an informed abortion, than a perfect production. Besides, in the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Historie, especially where the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques have to doe, an Authour is carried, and borne out by his matter, and the things being all made to his hand, which case him of the paines of invention, as the order of the time caseth him of the care of disposing; he hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to doe for his part, but onely to contribute words, which is by some made so small a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that when <hi>Menander</hi> was pressed by some friends to publish a worke of his, that he had promised: He made answere, it shall present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come forth; for it is in a manner all finished and ready, there wants nothing, but to make the words. But in the perswasive kinde of writing, (besides, that there must be a better
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3673:189"/>
choice made, and a stricter order used, in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the words, than in simple Narrations, which for all their lustre and riches of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, require no more but plainnesse, and fit termes) they which desire to attaine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or indeed to doe any thing at all of worth, endeavour all they can, to put in use, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to action, the most subtle <hi>Idaea's</hi> of all Rhetoricke; to rayse up their understanding to the highest poynt of things; to search out, in every matter, the verities lesse exposed to view, and to make them so familiar, that they who perceived them not before, may by their relation come as it were to touch them. Their designe is, to joyne pleasure to profit, to mingle daintinesse and plentie together; and to fight with Armes, not onely firme and strong, but also fayre and glittering. They endeavour to civilize Learning; drawing it from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and freeing it from the hands of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, who marre and sully it in handling: and to say the truth, adulterate and corrupt it, abusing this excellent and delicate thing in the sight of all the world. They seeke not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyde Rockes by turning aside from them, but rather by slyding gently over them, and rather to escape places of danger, than to shunne them. And to make it appeare, that nothing is so sowre or bitter, but that it may be sweetned and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by Discourse. Finally, they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sometimes to be transported with that reasonable fury, which Rhetoricians have well
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:3673:190"/>
knowne, though it goe beyond their Rules and Precepts: which thrust an; Oratour into such strange and uncouth motions, that they seeme rather inspired, than to be naturall; and with which, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> were so pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, that the one of them sweares by those that dyed at <hi>Marathon,</hi> and of his owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie makes them Gods: the other, askes que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of the Hilles and Forrests of <hi>Alba,</hi> as if they had eares, and were able to heare him. But if I were one that did come any thing neere so noble an end, (which I neither will nor dare beleeve) and that I were able to make stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers see, that all things in <hi>France</hi> are changed for the better, since the happie Reigne of our King, who no lesse augmenteth our spirits, than he encreaseth our courage: yet it is not I that should merit the glory of this, but I must whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute it to the happinesse of my time, and to the force of my object. Howsoever, my Lord, if I cannot be taken into the List of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and able men, at least, I cannot be denyed a place amongst honest men, and loyall servants; and if my abilities be worthy of no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you, at least, my zeale and affection, are better worth, than to be rejected. With which meditation, I am sometimes so ravished, that I doubt not, but my resentments must needs content you; and that it is no unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing recreation to you, to cast your eye upon a Philosopher in choler. And though true love content it selfe with the testimony of its owne
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:3673:190"/>
Conscience; and that I give you many proofes of my most humble service, which I assure my selfe, will never come to your knowledge; yet for your satisfaction, I desire you might heare me sometimes in the place where you are, and might see, with what advantage, I maintaine the publike cause, in what manner I controll false Newes that runs about, and how I stop their mouthes that will be talking in disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our affayres. It is certaine, that it is not possible our State should be more flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than it is, or that the successe of the Kings Armes should be more glorious than it is, or that the Peace of the People should be more assured than it is, or that your Government should be more judicious than it is; and yet wee meete with certaine spirits, that are troubled with their owne quietnesse, are impatient of their owne felicitie, cannot be held in any good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but by prosperities that are supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; and longer than they see miracles, give no credit to any thing. If present affayres be in good termes, then they cast out feares of those to come; and when they see, the events prove happie, then they fall affrighting us with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages. They take an Oath, to esteeme of no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but forreyners; of no things, but farre fet. They admire <hi>Spinola,</hi> because he is an <hi>Italian,</hi> and their enemie; they cannot abide to prayse the King, because he is a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and their Master. They will hardly be drawne to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that the King hath overcome, though they
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3673:191"/>
see before their eyes, an infinite number of Townes taken; of Factions ruinated; eternall Monuments of his Victories: and more easily the King hath gotten the applause of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> than these mens approbation. They would perswade us, if they could, that he had raysed his Siege before <hi>Rochell;</hi> That he had made a shamefull Peace with the Protestants; and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made him run away. They doe all they can, to exterminate his History, and to extinguish the greatest light that shall ever shine to posteritie. I doubt not, but they cast a malicious eye upon my Booke; for presenting an image of those things which offend them so much. And they who beleeve Fables and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances,</hi> and are in passion, for an <hi>Hercules</hi> or an <hi>Achilles,</hi> who perhaps never were; They who reade with extasie of joy, the actions of <hi>Rowland</hi> and of <hi>Reinold,</hi> which were never done, but upon Paper: These men will finde no rellish in a true History, because it gives te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie to the vertue of their naturall King. They can like well enough, that against the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of all Antiquitie, <hi>Xenophon</hi> being a Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, and no <hi>Persian,</hi> should frame <hi>Cyrus</hi> a life after his owne fancie, and make him die in his bed, and amongst his Friends; when yet hee dyed in the warres, and overcome by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: and they can like well enough, that <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> should tell a lye in open Senate, and prayse <hi>Trajan</hi> for temperance and chastitie, who yet was given to wine, and to another vice so fowle
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3673:191"/>
that it cannot honestly be named; but they can by no meanes like, that I, who am the Kings subject born, should say that of him, which no man can deny to be most true, and that being to make a patern for Princes, I should rather make choyce of his life, than either of that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which is fabulous, or that of <hi>Trajan,</hi> which is not the purest, that I may not speake of that of <hi>Caesar Bogia,</hi> which is all blacke with licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and crimes. Heaven it selfe is not able to give this kinde of people a Governour to their minde. Hee that was according to Gods owne heart, should not be according to theirs: They would not thinke <hi>Salomon</hi> wise enough, nor <hi>Alexander</hi> valiant enough. They are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally enemies of all sorts of Masters; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers of all things the present time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords. They make our heads ake with crying out, that there was no necessitie to make a war in <hi>Italy;</hi> but if you had stayed still at <hi>Paris,</hi> they would have cryed out much lowder, that it had not been honest, to suffer our allyes to perish. Because some of our Kings have made unfortunate voyages beyond the mountaines, therefore they will needs have it, that our King, though he follow not their counsels, should yet fall into their misfortunes. They accuse your conduct with old proverbs, because they cannot with sound reasons. They say, <hi>Italy</hi> is the Church-yard of the <hi>French:</hi> and being not able to observe the least fault in all your carriage in that countrey, they lay upon you the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3673:192"/>
faults of our aunestors, and charge you with the errour of <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth. Yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that these mens sinne is rather of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie than of malice, that they are rather passionate for their opinions, than Pensioners of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and that they have more need of helpe by Physicke, than of restraint by law. But it is a grievous thing to see, how the busie-bodies of our time, speake the same language, which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels did in times past; and abuse the happinesse of libertie, even against him, who hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it unto us. They come continually, and tell me, wee are like to receive much prejudice by the discontent of such a Prince, that is gone from our side. And I answere them, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a weake enemie that cannot hurt us, than hold a troublesome friend, that would doe us no good. They will by all meanes, that the King at any price, should succour <hi>Cazall;</hi> and I tell them, that he hath succoured it alreadie, by his conquest of <hi>Savoy:</hi> and that in the state as things now stand, it cannot bee taken, but to be delivered backe. They are not contented that you performe actions that are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they looke you should performe some that are impossible: And though there arise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times such difficulties in things, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any possibilitie be encountred; I say not, by defect in the undertaker, but by reason of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancie in the subject; yet they will not take for payment, such reasons as wise men are satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied withall, but they would have the King doe
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3673:192"/>
that, which the Turke and Persian joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, were not able to doe. These things, my Lord, would put mee extreamly into passion, and I could never bee patient at such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of ungratefulnesse, if I did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that there hath sometimes beene a spirit, so sullen, and so sawcie, that it dared to finde fault with the workes of God himselfe, and was not afrayd to say, that if hee had been of his counsell, as well in the creation as in the government of the world, hee would have given him better advice than hee tooke at first, or than hee now followes. After so immense a folly, you must not thinke it strange, if there be some Extravagants; and the vulgar at all times hath beene found but an unjust Iudge of vertue; and yet for all that, it hath never beene without admirers: and now, if those that have but little instinct, and can doe nothing but murmure, and doe not favour him, it is for us, my Lord, to testifie unto you, that reasonable men, and such as know how to speake, are of the better side.</p>

For besides that to stand in suit with a man of his robe, were as much as to fight with a Master of Fence, and to put ones whole right in hazard.

                     <p>MY Lord, I am infinitely bound unto you for the honour you have done me, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3673:194"/>
me, and for the paines you have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, to write in my behalfe to Monsieur de——It is true, your paynes hath not had so good successe, as I verily hoped it would: for though hee had given out, that for his satisfaction hee required no more but some small signe, that it was your desire: yet having received that signe, hee continues still in the same termes, and holds the same rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous course he did. It makes mee thinke, my Lord, that hee knowes not of what worth your commendation is: certainly, if it had been imployed for any other but my selfe, it had found all the yeelding and respect it me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riteth: but indeed, I cast unfortunatenesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all matters I deale in: my evill Fortune suffers mee not to make benefit of your love; you have no sooner a thought to doe me good, but presently a thousand impediments arise to hinder it. You give mee presents, and I doe not receive them: You command I should be payd my pension, and your command is not obeyed. Not yours, my Lord, of which one might say, <hi>Est fatum quodeunque voles.</hi> You have read my booke with pleasure, and spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of it with commendation; and yet I suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer persecution for making it, as much as to say, for being a true Frenchman, and a lover of publick liberty. For as for the objections they make against mee, they certainly are but co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and pretences: If my words be not lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or eloquent, they are yet found, and full
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3673:194"/>
of truth. There is not one to bee found in all my worke, which a meane Advocate were not able to defend before the severest Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the world. The makers of libels, who condemne them, are the men of all other, that first corrupt them. I begin my Lord, to bee wearie of this long and obstinate injustice; my Philosophie beginnes to faile mee in this case: and I should bee cleane and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether out of heart, if I had not your good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to relye upon. For this, at this day, is the common refuge of all oppressed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents, and no man invocates it in vaine. I therefore make my selfe believe, that it will at last send mee also some faire dayes, after so many stormes and tempests raysed against mee by mine enemies: and that after you have saved Nations, and set Princes in their Thrones, it will bee no hard matter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a poore private man who adores you, and whom calumnie seekes to ruine. I know some my Lord, whom you have made happy, and yet scarce knew their names; when you did mee the honour to give mee your good word, and yet fare never the better for it. And some I have knowne advanced by you, that lay hidden in the throng, when your selfe drew mee out, and placed mee amongst the few, yet what get I by it? For in truth I could never make any use of this advantage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause indeed I could never serve you with
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3673:195"/>
such care and subjection, as the forwardnesse of your favours obliged me to doe. My indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath alwayes hindred my good designes; I have alwayes combated with weaknesse of body, and never durst venture to begin a life, which I was not assured I were able to hold out. This hath forced me, my Lord, to court you in a new fashion; and to seeke to doe you service by my absence and ease, and not trouble you with unseasonable officiousnesse, and with many low curtsies to no purpose. I am able to say, unworthy as I am, that I was the first man that preached the wonders of your life unto the people, exhorted all Frenchmen to doe their duties; have in mine owne person given good example in the Provinces, and have healed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny spirits that were sicke, and ill perswaded of the present government. I am not so well knowne by my name, as by my forwardnesse in your service. And when the spitefull rumour ran abroad of late, many persons of qualitie can tell, how generally I tooke it: and how I resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to follow you to the worlds end, if so bee the unfortunatenesse of France should remove you from the Court. Yet I am not troubled, that I make you not these proofes of my Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, though they would be lesse difficult to me, than to entertaine you, as now I doe, with my interests; which to say true, is a cruell torture I put my selfe to. It is not my desire, you should have misfortunes, to the end I might make use
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3673:195"/>
of my consolations: nor is it my wish, there should be disorders in my countrey, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to my master, to the end I might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shew my selse a good Frenchman, and a loyall servant. But yet my Lord, why may I not be of some use in a calme, and have a place as well in the joy, as in the sorrow? You alone are the authour of your victorie; but you alone cannot furnish your tryumph, but must have many Artificers to worke about it. I have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials enough to make many large Fabrickes; but to undertake the worke, I must entre at your Lordship I may have a little contentment, or at least, a little quiet. The splendor of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is so great, that it sends forth beams of light to your remotest servants: and the power which heaven hath given you, is so redoubtable to all sorts of tyrants, that to give a period to my persecution, there needs no more, but that you give some signe you meane to protect me; which favour I perswade my selfe you will not deny me: for besides the common cause of being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, you have knowne a long time, that I make a speciall profession to be</p>

                     <p>SIR, my curiofitie were undiscreet, if I should aske you newes of occurrents in the Armie; but you cannot take it ill, that I aske you newes of my Lord the Cardinals health. I learne the progresse of his glorious actions by the mouth of Fame: but I must learn from you how he fares in his continual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation; and whether the temper of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die feele no alteration by the violent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his spirit. I conceive that God doubles his force when there is need; and that hee hath regard to the necessitie of so many people that cannot misse him: but I know also, that hee makes use of the second causes, and that your cares and industrie concurre with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. The services you doe to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar man, are obligations to all the world. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Science a more worthie or more profitable imployment than yours hath: And if the Romanes erected a statue to <hi>Antonius Musa,</hi> for healing of him who oppressed their libertie, why may not you justly expect a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke

                     <p>SIR, it is great worke of memorie to bee mindfull of mee at the Court: but it is an
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3673:197"/>
effect of a divine goodnesse to make it raine dainties in the desart: Since Manna, there was never seene there, such a thing as you sent me; and if you were bound to furnish mee with such fare, fortie yeares of banishment at this diet, would be to me fortie yeares of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. To speake in plaine tearmes, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent is unvaluable: and to helpe my selfe in speaking of it, I have beene forced to fetch comparisons from heaven, because inferiour things are never able to expresse it. You doe it wrong to give it the name of a Preface: but what may we expect from the worke it selfe, before which such a preface is set? If the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side be so rich, and there bee so great magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence in the Gate-house, what will bee in the Galleries, and Cabinets? and what will the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace be that is worthie of such an entrance? I see indeed that it is a mark of greatnesse, but I feare withall, that it is a want of proportion, and being not possible the rest should equall the the beginning, you will bee accused for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbing the order of things, and for putting perfection out of its place, which should not come in but at the last. See here an accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is verie nice, and whereof it is a glorie to bee convinced. In this there is lesse account to be made of vertue than of vice; and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order which makes a magnificence, is more worth than the method which retaines a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie: Blame not sir, the event of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute: Beautie begets the prize in all causes

where the eyes are judges: and they who blame you for adorning too much your refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Bookes of <hi>Flanders,</hi> blame you for having your Armour too much guilded, and that in striking you dazle their eyes. It seemes they know not that the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> never tricked up themselves, but when they went to fight; and that <hi>Caesar</hi> made his vaunt, hee wanne battailes with perfumed Souldiers. The pompe of your stile arrests not the sight without profit: It is pleasing to the Reader; but withall it is fatall to slander. In it there is to bee seene the luster and braverie of Tournaments; but withall, there is to bee seene in it the force and terriblenesse of warre. The onely pittie is, you had not a competent Enemie to fight withall, and that so much force and valour should bee spent upon a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble furie, and which is now at the last drop of its poyson. The wretched man you pursue, and who dyes blaspheming; was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of so noble a Resentment as yours, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing considerable in him, but that you vouchsafe to speake of him: you make him of some worth by alledging him so often. In undoing him, you make him famous, and his objections will one day not be found, but in your answeres. It is five and twentie yeares since hee was a fugitive from his order, and should have had his triall before the Generall of the Iesuites. And if these good Fathers did not deale too gently with delinquents, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3673:198"/>
change imprisonment into banishment, hee had from that time beene suppressed, with all the filthy bookes hee hath made ever since. But it was necessarie, that (to crowne his inconstancie) after hee had abandoned above a dozen sides, hee should now for his last prize, become a parasite to the Spaniards, and a Secretarie to those bad French that are at their Court. Let it never trouble us Sir, that hee calles us Flatterers: Atheists call honest men su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious. <hi>Catiline</hi> called them all slaves that would not be parracides; and it hath alwayes been impossible, to be vertuous with approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked. They are delinquents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that find fault with our innocency, &amp; they are idle fellows, who prostrate themselves eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day before a <hi>Don Dego,</hi> or a <hi>Don Roderigo,</hi> and yet thinke much wee should doe any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to M. the Cardinall <hi>Richlieu.</hi> But it is fit they should be taught, that here is the true worship, at <hi>Bruxells</hi> but Idolatrie; and that to adore a forreigne Power, and such a one that doth mischiefe to the whole earth, is not, at least an action so truely <hi>French,</hi> as to revere a vertue, that is native of <hi>France,</hi> and that doth good to all the world. Seeing they abuse our tongue, in praysing their Tyrants, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying our Rebells; It cannot be denyed us, to bring it backe to its naturall and proper use, and in more honest subjects, to purifie and make cleane those words and phrases, which they have prostituted to the conceits of the Marquis

I thinke, I may boldly say, I was one of the first maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the truth, and he perhaps that layd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the field, where so many Oratours and Poets finde themselves exercise: It is time now, that I leave it to younger men, and such as are more able than I am. Yet I intreat you to remember Sir, that I give place without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away; and that it is the coldnesse of my bloud, and the abatement of my strength, that forceth mee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> not any want of courage or change of will. Never thinke I will ever fayle in these: I alwayes preserve in my heart, the principles of good actions, I meane, good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; and when I can no longer be a runner in the Race, yet I will be one of the most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Spectatours, and fight at Cuffes, when I can doe nothing else. In the meane time, to the end, that a good part of my ancient travaile may not be lost, and that I may not make that an unprofitable secret, betweene my Muses and mee, which may perhaps serve for some edification to the Publicke: I thinke fit, to make you account of certaine things I have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3673:199"/>
heretofore conceived; and to shew you, that in actions of my dutie, I oftentimes content my selfe with the testimony of my owne Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. These are Pieces that were wrought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the second voyage into <hi>Italie,</hi> and before the lamentable Divisions of the Royall Familie. In the puritic of publick joy, amidst the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses of all the Kings subjects; and even of those who have since lost their loyaltie, and now lye rayling upon us at <hi>Bruxells.</hi> I send you some sheets, as I first light upon them, and I send them Sir, rather to doe you Homage by laying my Compositions at your feete, than to make a Challenge, as opposing them to yours, rather to acknowledge the superioritie of your Eloquence, and to goe in your Lyve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, than to make my selfe your Competitor, and seeke to brave you, with so rash a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison. If you finde any rellish in Discourses so farre short of the force and merit of yours; and if you thinke they may give my Masters of the Universitie, any the least contentment, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly entreate you, to present them a Copie; and withall, my humble submission to their judgement. I know, this Societie is at this day the supreme Tribunall that Censures all workes of the Braine, and gives Rules to all other Tribunalls of <hi>France.</hi> I neither doubt of the susficiencie, nor suspect the integritie of the Judges that praeside there: Moreover, I confesse Sir, it could never have a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie Conception, seeing your selfe was the first
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3673:199"/>
that spake it, nor a more illustrious birth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing M. the Cardinall was a Patron to it; and therefore, borne in Purple, as were those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whom I would call, <hi>Porphyrogenetes,</hi> if the Academie had Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralised this Forreigne word. The honour it hath done me, to make me a member of their body, without binding me to part from hence, and the place it hath given mee, without taking away my libertie, are two singular favours I received from it, both at one time. And to say the truth, it is no small benefit to a man of the wildernesse, that turnes his face sometimes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the world, and is not altogether deve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of humane affections, that hee may injoy together, both the repose of solitude, and yet flatter his imagination with the glory of so pleasing a Societie. This I cannot doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thanking you for so great a favour; and if they understand not of my Resentment by your mouth, they may have just cause to condemne me for one of little Gratefulnesse. Lend mee therefore, I beseech you Sir, some five or six words, I would aske you more, but I know they are of that worth, and so high in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that these few will be enow, not onely to satisfie for the complement I owe; but for the Oration also, it is expected I should make them. You will not, I hope, denie mee the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of your love, and I require it of you by the memory of the other Obligations I owe

                     <p>SIR, your last Letters have exceedingly comforted mee, and you have such things for me, that they make me forgetfull of all my

It is true, that your absence is a perpetuall coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Card to my joy; and possessing you but in spirit, it requires a very strong imagination, to desire nothing else. Shall wee never come to be Citizens of one Citie? Never to be Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in the same Desart? Shall my Counsayle be alwayes twenty myles from me? and must I be alwayes forced to passe two Seas to fetch it when I need it? I hope your justice will doe me reason, and that Heaven will at last heare the most ardent of all my prayers; but in the meane time, whilst I stay waiting for so perfect a contentment, I would be glad to have of it, now and then, some little taste: which, if it be not in your power to give mee; at least lend it mee for some few dayes, and come and sit as supreme President, over both my <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> I promise you, I will never appeale from you to any other; onely for this once, give mee leave to tell you, that the word <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovix,</hi> which you blame as too new, seemes to me a more Poeticall and pleasing word, than either the <hi>Aloysius</hi> of the <hi>Italians,</hi> or our <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus;</hi> and besides, It savours of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of our Nation; and of the first language of the <hi>Gaules;</hi> witnesse these words, <hi>Ambio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rix, Eporedorix, Orgetorix, Vercingetorix,</hi> &amp;c.

I love all them that love France, and wish well to our great Prince, of whom in truth I have heard you speake so worthily, that as often as I remember it, it stirres mee up to doing my dutie, and to profit by so good an example. If hee had been seconded in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> wee should have seene all we could have hoped. But God himselfe saves none but such as contribute themselves to their salvation. <hi>Saguntum</hi> was taken while the Senatours were deliberating: and a wisedome that is too scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, commonly doth nothing for feare of doing ill.

                     <head>To my Lord the Bishop of Nantes. LETTER XI.</head>
                     <p>MY Lord, the joy I take in the recoverie of your health, is not yet so pure, but that it alwayes represents unto me a terrible Image of your last sicknesse. The imagination of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thogh past &amp; gone, yet makes my momorie afraid, I looke upon it rather in safetie, than with assurance. We missed the loosing you but very narrowly: and you were upon the poynt to leave us Orphans. I speake it seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and without any flattery at all, all the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories we have gotten, or shall get, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to make us amends for such a losse: you would have made our conquest turne to mourning: M. the Cardinall would have found something to complaine of in his great felicitie, and would have watred his triumph with his teares. Let it not be Gods will to lay this crosse upon our time: and if it be a crosse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable, yet let it be deferred to our posteritie. It is necessarie the <hi>Pho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

age, and that the world should be allowed time for enjoying the possession, and so profitable and sweet a life as yours. It is true, the world is not worthy of you; but, my Lord, the world hath need of you: your vertue indeed should long since have beene crowned, but that your example is still necessarie: and the more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie ones there be in heaven, the fewer honest ones will be left upon earth. Love therefore your selfe a little for our sakes; begin now at last to studie your health, which hitherto you have neglected, and make a difference here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after between cold and heate, betweene good and bad aire; between meates that are sweet, and those that are bitter. Though you take no care of your health for your owne sake, yet you must take care of it for the common good: For, I beseech you my Lord, tell me, what should become of the cause of the poore? what of the desolation of widowes? what of the innocencie of men oppressed? I speak not of the hope of such as hope for preferment by you: for though I write to you my Father, and call you Monsieur,——yet I am none of that number. I desire nothing from you at this time, but that which you may give me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking it of another; your love and good will is the onely object of my present passion. I renounce with all my heart, all other things in the world, so I may keepe but this, and shall never complaine of my shipwracke, if it leave me so solid a planke as this to rest upon.

                     <p>SIR, I have word sent mee from <hi>Paris,</hi> that you make complaints against me: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well assured, you have no just cause, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, it is not done in earnest, but that you take pleasure to give mee a false Alarum. Yet I must confesse, this cooling word, I heare spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, puts me to no little paine: for though it make me not doubt of the firmenesse of your affection, yet it makes me challenge the malice of my Fortune. I have beeue for some time so unfortunate in friendshippe; that it seemes there needes nothing but pretences to ridde me of them; the sweetest natures grow soure and bitter against mee; and if this sit hold, I shall have much adoe to keepe my owne brother of my side. I would like as well, to be a keeper of the Lyons, as of such harsh friends; for though I were more faithfull than <hi>Pylades</hi> and <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> put together; yet they would finde matter of discontentment; and my fidelitie should be called dissimulation. I cannot beleeve that you are of this number; but if you be, it is time for me to go hide my self in the desarts of <hi>Thebai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These sixe moneths, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from you, but onely one Letter; to which, I made no answer, because it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me, but in <hi>Aprill:</hi> at which time, you sent me word you should be in <hi>France.</hi> Since therefore by your owne account, you were gone from thence, before the time I could write unto you; would you, I should have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into <hi>Italy,</hi> to Mounsieu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Yet such is my unhappinesse, that few of them returne me the like, but seeme rather they would make a benefit, of my paines and sorrowes. Because they see I am persecuted, they will make every the least courtesie they doe me to be of great value, and set an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive price upon their friendshippe, because they know I stand in neede of it. But I desire them, and you also to take notice, that my friendship was never grounded upon any interest; but my love is ever without any mercenary designe, or hope of benefit. If they be not willing to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broile themselves in my affaires, I would have them know, I am as unwilling as they, they should: and if they be not strong enough, to defend the truth in publike; and when it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed; at least let them not disavow it, when they are in place of safety; let them not deny their friend when the storme is over, and that there is no longer any danger in confessing him. You saw my heart, the first time you saw my face; you were at that time my Confessour; and I have not a sinne that is hidden from you. I conceive you are too generous to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this excesse of freenesse you finde in me; and I doe not thinke you so subtle, that you would make a shew of discontent, for feare least I should beginne first. These are subtilties indeede of the country from whence you come: but in my opinion very remote from your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:3673:217"/>
disposition: and you neede not make complaints of me, to prevent the complaints I might else make of you. It is certaine, that if I had not equitie enough to excuse my friends for things they were not able to performe; I might then perhappes have colour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine they performed not their promise: but I am one, that know there happen a thousand impediments which hinder a man from keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his word, and that every thing that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and not done, is not presently a viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Some have laboured to perswade me, that—: but I never beleeved any such thing, and I could never imagine that you would goe about to build your reputation upon the ruines of the reputation of your friend. If any shall make use of such like artifices, to doe ill offices betweene you and me: I earnestly intreate you to make use of the like remedies, to preserve your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions sound, and not to suffer your judgement to be corrupted. I take God to witnesse, there is nothing in the world more deare unto mee then your friendship; I make publike and open profession of honouring you: I highly esteeme a number of eminent qualities in you, both Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and Intellectuall; I have oftentimes shedde teares, when I read in your Letters of your griefes; all this, me thinkes should deserve a little affection, and make the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that are my adversaries, not take it ill that you should love me; especially when they shall know, that I passionately am,</p>

I will doe all that possibly I can, to deserve this your favourable judgement, and not to make you sorry for being deceived to my advantage: but howsoever, if I be not able to preserve your good opinion by my merit; I hope at least to merit your favour by my affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to make you see that I truely am,</p>

                     <p>SIR, having taken the paines that I have done, I cannot altogether disvalue my worke; yet I am not a little glad to be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in my opinion by a man of your worth: and that my labour is not unpleasing to the soundest judgements. The second censure you make of it, assures me of the integritie of the first; seeing I should be too presumptuous to beleeve, you could be deceived twice toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But let us stay there, I beseech you; and thinke not, I will ever entertaine the vanitie you put upon me. I neither pretend to instruct the world, nor take upon me to teach you, in any thing: it is enough for me, that I can finde wisemen some recreation; &amp; can lay things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreyour eyes, which you know already better than my selfe.

                     <p>SIR, you do me too much good at once: your friendship is of great worth being alone; and you send it to me accompanied. It brings with it an infinite number of excellent things, and resembles that happy River which leaves plenty in all places where it passeth. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent I have received, comes from such a fruite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Vine: it is not a vaine shew of magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:3673:219"/>
which gives onely a light satisfaction to the eyes; but I finde it essentiall and solid; and any spirit that is capable of speculation, may well finde nourishment enough in the juyce onely of your Preface. I will not take upon me any more, though you sollicite mee to doe it; and instead of giving my advice, would have me, I should pronounce a Decree. Take heede my good Father, what you say; and consider what a goodly thing it would be to raise my Village into a Parliament, and make appeales, from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Balzac.</hi> Though you had humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie enough to submit to an unlawfull Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: yet I have not presumption enough to intrude upon an unlawfull charge: Remember your selfe besides, that your Booke is dated from Mount <hi>Carmell,</hi> which is to say, out of our jurisdiction, and that Decrees are of no force, where time out of minde, there have beene Oracles. You know what <hi>Suetonius</hi> saith of it, in the life of <hi>Uespatian,</hi> he makes no bones to make a God of a Mountaine. I like not the boldnesse of such Metamorphoses: yet I am not ignorant, how farre the force of pletie may reach; and knowing it hath right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move Mountaines, I doubt not but <hi>Carmell</hi> at this day may be in <hi>France;</hi> and that upon a place so holy and so high, there may descend more grace and light from heaven, than there ascends ignorance and vapours from the earth.

For the assurance you give me by your Letter of your friendship: I am infinitely beholding to you, and make account to reape no small bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it, for having a soule as you have, full of vertue, you make me a Present that is invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to bring mee in to so worthy a possession: and whilest you offer me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How profound soever my slumber be; yet I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake presently, assoone as I am once stirred; and specially when it is by so deare a name, and by so pleasing a voyce as yours is. Never there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require me to give it in charge to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to let you heare from me; such a request would be an offence to our friendshippe, an action fitter for a Tyrant than a Citizen: it were to take me for the great <hi>Mogull,</hi> who speakes to none but by an Interpreter. I like not this savage statelinesse; it is farre from me to use so little civilitie towards men of your worth: when it is I, that am beholding to you; I pray let it not be my groome that shall thanke you for it.

                     <p>SIR, if it had not beene for the indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my body; I had not stayed so many dayes from thanking you for your many cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies; but for these two moneths I have not stirred from my bed; so cruelly handled with the Sciatica, that it hath taken from me all the functions of my spirit, and made mee utterly uncapeable of any cenversation: otherwise you may be sure I should not voluntarily have deprived my selfe of the greatest contentment I can have, when I have not your companie: and that I should not have received three Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from you, without making you three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers. Now that I have gotten some quiet mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from the violence of my torture; and that my paine is turned into lamenesse: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but take you in hand, and tell you, in the first place, that you are an ungratefull man, to leave our Muses, and follow some of their sisters, that are neither so faire, nor so worthy of your affection. I intreate you to beleeve, it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3673:225"/>
is a temptation your evil Angell hath cast upon you; and that you ought to reject it, as the counsell of an enemie. Things are not now to beginne; it is no time now to deliberate; you are gone too farre in the good way to looke backe, and to be unwilling to finish that little which remaines. To leave eloquence for the Mathematickes; is to refuse a Mistris of eighteene yeare old, and to fall in love with an old woman. God keepe you from this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, and inspire you with better thoughts, than those that have carried you to this desire of change. It would be a disloyaltie, I should never pardon you; but should blame you for it as long as I live. For making that reckoning of you as I doe; and expecting great matters from you: it were an infinite wrong you should doe, to make me lose the most pleasing of all my hopes. I therefore by all meanes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate you to persevere in your first designe, and to resolve upon a voyage of 3. months, to come and be reconciled to her whom you have offended, and to make her a publike satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the edition of your writings, by which it will plainely enough be seene, the great favours she hath done you. And for my part, I promise you a chamber, where you shall have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of a garden twelve miles long; and so you shall be at once, both in the citie, and in the country. Besides, I binde my selfe to set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Booke an Advertisement to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to the end that no man may be ignorant of the part I beare, in that which concernes you.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:3673:226"/>
Consider whether you like of these conditions, and whether you have courage enough to come and lodge <hi>Au Pre aux Clerks:</hi> where I will waite for you, without any designe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either what you meane, or what you meane to doe. You shall be sure Sir, to have there ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable visions, and shall meditate nothing but with successe. And in truth, seeing the least motion of your spirit, puts mee into extasie; what will it be, when you shall employ your whole forces? And if your conceits be so just, and so well governed, in the midst of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and unseasonable disturbances: what a man will you be, when you shall be at leasure, and have the libertie which now you want? Take my word for it, you neede not feare the censure of the world; Ile undertake, you shall have the approbation of all honest peoples pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that you make a truce with your Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and never intricate your braines with that melancholicke and doting Science, which cost <hi>Archimedes</hi> his life; at least, before you cast your selfe upon such high and sublime specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it is fit you should get you credit by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises that are more sweete and popular.

                     <p>SIR, I doe but now receive your Letter of the twelfth of this Moneth, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes mee in the opinion I have alwayes had; that my interests are as deare unto you as your owne. To compliment with you for this, would be to thanke you for being good, as much as to say for being your selfe; It is much better to returne you friendship for friendship, then to pay you with unprofitable words. In a word Sir, I make profession to bee an honest man, and therefore all the thankefulnesse that can be desired from a person obliged you may expect from me. As concerning——I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you I wish him no ill, because I conceive he hath done me none; it is sufficient for mee that my friends have no good opinion of his opinions; and that his owne friends beginne to take notice of his false dealing. In all this there is nothing eyther new or strange; I am not the first innocent that have beene persecuted in the world, and if I could not beare detraction and slander, I should be more dainty then Princes, and their principall officers are, who forbeare not to doe well, though for their well doing they be evill spoken of; the best and soundest part is of my side, I want no protector eyther Males or Females, and if I would make use of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3673:227"/>

                     <p>SIR, it greeves me much that the first Letter you see of mine, should not be pure and free
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:3673:227"/>
from all my interests, &amp; that in stead of intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you with matters of weight &amp; proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to your spirit, I should bring it downe to the petty affaires of a private man; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beleeve that you being all gracious and all generous as you are, will thinke any occasion of doing good unworthy of you, but that your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in this doth imitate the supreme, which is never so busie in governing of heaven &amp; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nobler parts of the world, but that he takes care as wel for governing the meanest of all his creatures. I humbly beseech your Lordship to consider me in this last qualitie; and if it bee no incivilitie to make such a request, that you will undertake the businesse I present unto you, but as a disburthening you of some more weighty; if it be not that my unfortunatenesse makes the easiest that are become unpossible, I see no reason you neede to imploy your whole forces about this matter; there needs no more but onely the motion of your will, and a light impression of your credit, with——to give it all the soliditie and lustre I desire. I should not seeme to understand the tearmes of the last Letter he did mee the honour to write unto mee; if I had not yet some little hope left, and a kinde of satisfaction in my owne conscience. Yet I alledge to him no merit of my part, but much generousnesse of his, nor speake of any services of mine to recompense him, but of his goodnesse that prevents them, and subjects not it selfe to the rigours of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary justice; This my Lord is all the right I

alledge for my selfe, and all the title upon which I ground my pretensions; but now I leave following it my selfe, and put it wholly into your hands; a place perhaps to which my ill fortune her selfe will beare a respect; but if shee shall be opposite to your desire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile above your favour, yet at least I shal there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know the force of destinie to which all other forces give place, and which cannot be mastered by any force, nor corrected by any industrie; but yet it shall not hinder me from resting well satisfied, seeing I shall in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive much more from you then I am denied by him, if I hold any part in your grace and favour, which is already my comfort against whatsoever ill successe can happen. It suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me to bee happy with this kind of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is more deare to mee than all the happinesse the Court can give me, being a man no more ambitious then I am,</p>

It is a match for antiquitie in its greatest pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and severitie. When the <hi>Camilli</hi> and the <hi>Scipioes</hi> were not in imployment, they repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves and tooke their ease as you doe; and when I consider sometimes the sweete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> life you leade at <hi>Dissay,</hi> I conclude that all the imployments of the Pallace, and all the intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Court are not worth one moment of a wise mans idlenesse. It is well knowne that from your childhood you have despised vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie even in her kingdome, and that in an ayre where shee had attractives able to draw the oldest and most reluctant spirits. All the pompe of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not so much as given you one temptation; and you are so confirmed in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous contempt, that if good Fortune her selfe should come to looke you out, you would scarce goe out of your Closet to meete her in your Chamber. This is that I make such recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

of in your Lordship, and which I prefer before all your other qualities; for those how great soever they be, are yet but such as are common with many base and mercenarie Doctors, where as this force and courage are things that cannot bee acquired in the noyse and dust of Schooles. You found not these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent qualities in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Library, nor yet got them by reading of old Manuscripts; you owe them indeede to Mounsieur your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased father, that true Knight without spot or wrinckle; equally skilfull in the art of warre, and in affaires of peace, and that was the <hi>Heros</hi> of <hi>Muret,</hi> of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and of Saint <hi>Mart.</hi> I propose not a lesse object for my worship then they did, neither indeede is it lesse, or lesse religious then theirs was; and though you did not love mee as you doe, and though you should denounce warre against me, and become head of a faction to seeke my ruine, yet I should not for all that forbeare to revere so rare a vertue as yours is, but should stil remaine,</p>

                     <p>SIR, I feare not much to lose a thing I esteem but little, but holding your friendship in that account I doe, if I should not have it, I should never see day of comfort more; you must not therefore thinke it strange that I was mooved with the Alarum that was given mee, for though I know my selfe to be innocent, yet my unfortunatenesse is such that I conceive any bad newes to bee no more then my due. Now that Mounsieur <hi>de</hi>——hath qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted the agitation of my minde, and hath assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me of your love, I cannot forbeare to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie unto you the joy I take, telling you wit t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that so I may preserve a friend of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and worth, I doe not greatly care for lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him that will leave me. There is litle to be seene amongst men but malice &amp; weaknesse, and even of good men the greatest part is scarce sound; there is a cause why a firme and constant spirit as yours is, is of wonderfull use in societie, 'and it is no small benefit to them that are wearied &amp; overtoyled as I am, to have a person to rest upon, that cannot fall. There is neede of courage to maintaine a friendship, and indeede of prudence to performe the meanest duty of life; tis nothing worth to have a sound will, if the understanding bee

The knowledge I have hereof makes mee have compassion of him, and excuse in a Doctor of three score yeares old, those base shifting tricks that are not pardonable in a Schollar of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene. Any man but my selfe would call his action a cowardice and a treason; but I love to sweeten my griefe as much as I can.

I am therefore bold to let my Letter tell you thus much, that if my false Pearles, and my counterfeit Diamonds have heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you, I doe not thinke that the shew I shall make you of my new wares will use you any better. Yet my meaning is not to preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupate your judgement, who neither of my felfe not of my writings will have any other opinion then what you shall please to allow me. Since the time I have wanted the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of seeing you; I have made a great progresse in the vertue of humilitie, for I am now proud of nothing but of my friends affections; Let mee therefore never want

I would have beene glad I could have loved you all my life long without any kinde of interest, or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall consideration; yet it troubles me not to give honour to my friend, by giving him mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for his vertue to worke upon.

waite in the place where you are for a change to time, which in this kingdome is so adverse unto me. It is indeede my adversaries designe to make all sorts of governments my enemies, and not to suffer me to breath at liberty, either in Monarchie, Aristocracie, or Democracie. You have seene his manifests printed, which have flowne beyond the Alpes; you know the cunning he useth to draw the publike state upon me, and to make mee ill thought of, as well by the Kings Allies as by his Subjects. He goes about to banish mee out of all states, to shut all places against me that are open even to fugitives, and not to leave my innocencie one corner of the earth to be in safety; yet Sir let him doe his worst, and practise what hee can, I hope you will beare me out to say, that he shall never hinder me from having a place in your heart; nor be able to take from mee this pleasing refuge. And besides that Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors houses enjoy the priviledges of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sanctuaries, and that there is neither justice nor violence but hath respect unto them; I assure my selfe your onely affection will interesse it selfe for my safety, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other publique consideration, and that you will defend me as a thing deare unto you; though the defence of a man afflicted were not otherwise in it selfe, a thing worthy the dignitie of an Ambassadour, and wheresoever you shall have power to speake, I shall be sure of a strong protection, being as I am assured of your good word, and this eloquent mouth, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades

                     <p>SIR, my deare Cousin, the newes you sent me surprized me not, I am so accustomed to receive disgraces, that I finde in this nothing extraordinary; it is true I am a little more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of it then of the former, and the place from whence it comes makes mee take it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more to heart; yet seeing you seeme to compassionate my miserie, I finde my selfe comforted of one halfe of it; and having you for my Champion, I feare not what my perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors can doe against mee. Suffer mee to call them so, that sollicite your Colledge against me; and make it lesse favourable to me, then I had good right to hope for. It is not their zeale of Religion, nor interest of the publike that sets them on worke; it is an old spight they beare mee, which I could never master with all my long patience, it is the hate of a dead man which lives still in his Tombe; it is his rellicks that warre upon me; and whereof some ill disposed French doe serve themselves to disgrace a worke which hath no other end but the honour and service of the King. I never doubted of your good nature, and I know if neede were, your charitie would
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3673:238"/>
cover the multitude of my faults; but in this ease I thinke I have reason rather to aske ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice at your hands, and to tell you, that if you take the paines to consider my words as I meant them, and not as my enemies corrupt them, you will easily grant they containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the orthodox doctrine, or that is not maintaineable in all the Schooles of Christendome. This being so my deare Cousin, I doubt not but you will strongly defend my cause, at least my person, and will be pleased to assure my Masters of your fraternitie; that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving alwayes accounted their Colledge as the Oracle of true Doctrine, and as the interpretor of the Church in this kingdome; I could not wish a more sweet or glorious fruit of my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes then to see them entertained by so lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and holy personages, that my greatest am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is but to merit their good acceptance, and to deserve their favourable censure, and if for obtaining of this I have not either happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse enough, or not enough sufficiencie, I have at least Docible<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>SIR, I love you better than I thought, since you parted from hence, I have had a number of Alarums for you: and though I stand in convert yet that keepes mee not from the foule weather of your voyage. But I hope by this time you are upon returning; and that shortly, we shall sit by the fires side, and heare you tell your adventures of <hi>Beausse,</hi> and of <hi>Mantelan.</hi> Whatsoever Mounsieur <hi>de</hi>—have said unto you, when you tooke leave of him; I doe not thinke, that in all the whole Discourse, there can one passage be found, that is subject to any badde interpretation: if it be considered as a member depending upon the body, and not as a piece that is broken off. There may perhappes be found some propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a little bold, but never to goe so farre as rashnesse: the Antecedents and the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents so temper it, that if a man will not be too witty in another mans intentions, hee can never make any doubt of mine. It was never intended, you know, but onely to prove a Monarchie to be the best forme of governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Catholike Church to be the onely Spouse of Christ, Neither yet doe I write so negligently, but that I am ready to give a reason of that I write; and am able to
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:3673:242"/>
defend my opinions against those particular persons that oppugne them; for as for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne authority, you can witnesse for me with what humility I submit my selfe unto it. The day after your departure Mounsieur <hi>de</hi>——came to <hi>Balzac,</hi> whom I kept with me three whole dayes; I never saw man lesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed, lesse ambitions, lesse dazeled with the splendour of the Court; and to speake gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, better cured of all popular disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. By this I come to know the noblenesse, and even the soveraigntie of reason, when it is well schooled and instructed, we neede not mount up to heaven to finde cause of scorne in the littlenesse of the earth, the study of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome will teach it as well: A wise man counts all things to bee below him; Pallaces to him appeare but Cottages, and Scepters but baubles, it pitties him to see that which is called the greatnesse and fortune of Princes, and from the heighth of his spirit,</p>

                     <p>SIR, my Philosophy is not of so little huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but that I grieved exceedingly at the reading of your Letter, and was touched to the very quicke, for the death of—yet seeing he is happier then they that mourne for him; and that he hath left the world, in an age when he yet knew it not; I thinke it no wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to be obstinate in an ill grounded sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3673:244"/>
or to account that an evill to another, which is the greatest good, could have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my selfe. Christianity will not let me say, <hi>Optimum non nasci, Bonum vero quam citissime interire:</hi> but it hinders me not to believe, that one day of life, with Baptisme, is better then a whole age of iniquity. I write this letter to you from—whether I am come to lodge, after I had entertained my Lord—untill n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

I conceived, there was some ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, to deliver him your Letter with all speede; and therefore I exposed my person to all the injuries of an incensed sky; and ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make a voyage, that would have frighted a stouter man then my selfe. By this you may know that I count nothing difficult, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon any interest of yours; or which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes your contentment; and I love you so much, that I should not say so much, if I had more craft in me then I have. But my good Nature exceedes al other considerations of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Prudence; and I would not keepe you from knowing what great power you have over me, though I knew before hand, you would abuse this power. For other things, I am very glad to heare, you beginne to grow sensible of the charmes of musicke, and that Consorts are in reputation with you. Yet I have seene the time, when your eares were no learneder then mine, and when you made no great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the sound of Lutes, and the noyse of Bells.

I give you a thousand thankes for your newes; but specially for the last: it is certaine, that the choice of Mounsieur <hi>de Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieure</hi> to be Ambassadour for <hi>Italy,</hi> is a thing will be generally well liked; men talke won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders already of his beginnings: of the readinesse and Vivacitie of his Spirit, of the force and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And for my selfe, who am one, that love my Countrie exceedingly; I cannot but exceedingly rejoyce, in this new fruitefulnesse which comes upon him, at the latter end of his old age. It doth me good to see famous deceased men, to live againe in their excellent posteritie; and I doubt not of the good successe of a <hi>Negotiation,</hi> where a <hi>Belieure,</hi> a <hi>Thou,</hi> or a <hi>Sillery,</hi> is imployed. These were our <hi>Heroes</hi> of the long Robe; and the Princes of our Senate: and now their children (that I may continue to speake Latine, in French) are the Princes of our youth, at least they are names more happy, and that portend more good to <hi>France,</hi> then the name of—and no doubt, she will have cause to thanke <hi>M.</hi> the Cardinall, for respecting races, that are so deere unto her: and for stirring up in the Kings

I cannot say, that he is here, though it be true, that he is not in <hi>Gascognie;</hi> for we enjoy nothing of him here but his Image; he is so married, that he would thinke it a disloyalty to his wife, if hee should dare to laugh when shee is not by.

He is not contented to pitty you and me, and to lament our solitude; but he reproacheth us outragiously, and cals us unprofitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-wealth, and such as are fit to be cut off. As for me, I make no defence for my selfe, but your example; I tell him, let him perswade you to it first, and he shall soone finde me ready to follow his counsell. I hope we shall meete together ere long; and then we shall not neede to feare his being too strong for us, in our conferences, when we two shall be against him alone. Provide therefore Solutions for his Arguments; but withall deny me not your assistance in other encounters, where it may stand me instead.

Not that I was afraid, I should lose it, but because it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to heare ones selfe called happy; and that one cannot have too many titles for a possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which can never be too much valued. I take not upon me to contend with you in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments; or to dispute of civility with you, who live in the light of the world; and have whole <hi>Magasins</hi> of good words.

Pardon therefore a rudenesse which I cannot avoide, and seeing I am not able to answer you; give me leave to assaile you, and require you to give a reason of the present state of things: What can you say Sir, of these wretched <hi>Flemmins,</hi> who shut their Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst good Fortune when she would come in to them? and are in love with their Fetters, and their Keepers?

I account you so true of your word, that I cannot doubt of having your love, seeing you have done me the honour to let mee have your promise. It is to no purpose to sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licite Judges that cannot be corrupted; It is enough for procuring their favour, that the cause be good. You see therefore, I doe not much trouble my selfe to commend mine unto you, and I present my selfe so seldome before
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3673:247"/>
you; that if you had not an excellent memory, you had certainely forgot mee long agoe. I pray you not, to doe me good offices: for knowing that you let slippe no occasion of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: I may be sure to have my part of your good deedes, though you have none of my prayers. Your new Acquests at the Court; make you not leave that you have on this side the <hi>Loyre:</hi> your friends that are alwayes with you; take not up all your heart: there is some place left for your friends farther of: of which number I am one; and more in love Sir, with the comtemplative life, than ever. I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes under ground and buried with my trees; and they must be very strong cords, and very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements that should remove me: yet I am contented to give my thoughts a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and my spirit is often in the place where you are; and my absence is not so idly bestowed, but that I can make you a reckoning of it. I speake to you in this manner, because I know you are no hater of delightfull knowledges, and have an excellent taste to judge of things. Though by profession you be a Souldier; yet I refuse you not for a judge, in our peaceable difference; being well assured, there are not many Doctours, more accomplisht, or of a founder judgement than your selfe. This qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie is no opposite to true valour; the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whose discipline you seeke to reestablish; used to leade with them the Muses to warre; and in the tumult of their Armies, left alwayes place for these quiet exercises. <hi>Brutus</hi> read <hi>Polybius,</hi>

the night before the battell at <hi>Philippi;</hi> and his Vncle was at his Booke the very houre before he meant to die. Never therefore feare doing ill, when you follow the example of such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Authours: none will ever blame you for imitating the <hi>Romanes,</hi> unlesse perhappes the <hi>Crabates</hi> or other enemies, as well of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie as of <hi>France.</hi> But to be thus blamed by <hi>Barbarians,</hi> is an infallible marke of merit; for they know no points of vertue, but such as are wilde and savage; and imagine, that roaring and being furious, are farre more noble things, than speaking and reasoning. I leave them to their goodly imaginations; and come to tell you, that though your Letter to my Sister, be dated from the Army in <hi>Germany;</hi> yet it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent enough to come from the Academy of M. the Cardinall; it neither smells of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder, nor of <hi>Le pais de adieu pas;</hi> I know by certain markes, I have observed in it, that your Bookes, are part of your Baggage; and I finde nothing in it, that is worthy of blame, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the excessive praises you bestow upon mee; and if you were not a stout champion, and able to maintaine it with your sword, you would certainely ere this, have had the lie given you a thousand times for praising me so. I should be verry sorry to be a cause of so many petty quarrells; and so unworthy of your courage; a forraigne warre hath neede of your spirit; make not therefore any Civill, for my sake; I desire no such violent proofes of your affection: it serves my turne, that you love me quietly; and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3673:248"/>
if you so please secretly too; to the end, that our friendshippe being hidden, may lie in covert from; injuries; and that possessing it without pompe, I may enjoy it without envie. I reckon it alwayes amongst my solidest goods, and will be sure never to lose it, if perfit faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse will serve to keepe it; and if it will suffice to be; as I most passionately am,</p>

But you never yet heard, of such a gravitie as I haue, nor of a mind that could take such rest in the midst of stormes and tempests as I do, and this I owe to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, under whose covert I shelter my selfe: it is not onely, higher than mountaines, where we see it raine and haile below us: but it is stronger also than a Fortresse, where wee may stand out of danger, and make mouthes at our enemies. All that hurts me in the warre of——; is that, which concernes the interest of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: it grieves me extremely, that his crueltie should leave me, and fall upon my friends. I wish I could have bought out the three lives, that touch the honour of—with a third Volume of injuries done to my selfe, and where no body else, should have any part: and I may truely say, that this is the onely blow, which that perfidious enemie hath given mee, that goes to my heart; and the onely of all his offenses that I have felt.

When time and place serves we will handle him as hee deserves, and doubt not but his lightnesse shall light heavily upon him; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe you collect some common places upon this matter, and remember your selfe of all that hath passed betweene—to the end the history may not be lost. I have had speech with the man whose whole life is nothing but a continuall meditation of death; I never found him so austere, nor so great an enemy of bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very as now; his devotion respects neither right of nations, nor lawes of civillitie.

                     <head>To Mounsieur <hi>de Gues.</hi> LETTER L.</head>
                     <p>SIR, my most deare Father, you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged me exceedingly unto you; for impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto me the good newes that is come, and for communicating with me, the joy you take, in the happy successe of the Kings Army. I doe not thinke he hath a better subject in all his kingdome, then your selfe; never servant was more zealous for his Masters greatnesse; never <hi>Persian</hi> more religiously adored Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. You love your children, I know infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet this is but your second love; that of the State, and of the Publicke, goes farre before it, and I feare me, you would give us all for the poorest Frontier Towne of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or for any paltry Fort of <hi>Millan.</hi> That which I read in the Postscript of your Letter, did not so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well please me, the good opinion, which Mounsieur <hi>de</hi>—hath of me, is more a burthen to me, then an honour: and I could wish, he would make lesse reckoning of me, so he would let me be more at quiet. You have a strange friend of him; to take me for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places, and to thinke that I am an Index. for finding out conceits and figures. In the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you propounded to me on his behalfe; I can say no more then what I have said already,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3673:256"/>
but if he please to take the paines to Translate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Latine,</hi> he may easily doe it in such sort, that he shall be taken for the Author, and I but for the Translatour. I have told you, of the Dignity of the Language, in which he meanes to write, and what great advantage it hath over ours; it is certaine, that it elevates and raiseth up the low thoughts of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; and gives much more to them, then it receives from them. Whereas ours contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, hath no beauty, but as the Authours em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellish it and set it out; It hath no subsistence: but by the matter, no force, but from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are handled. I have made choice of some, which I thought fittest for his purpose; if he finde them for his turne, hee may make use of them: and better them much, by putting them into <hi>Ciceroes</hi> stile and phrase: and these are they. Good men ought to desire great Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as a necessary meanes to performe great atchievements; which if they performe not; both God will call them to account, for his graces, no better employed, and the world will justly complaine, it is left a prey to the wicked; and that the desire of their owne private quiet, makes them abandon all care of the publike. This is to tell you my Lord, that you ought to reserve your humility, for actions that passe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and you; but that for other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, you cannot have too much credit, nor too much greatnesse, seeing it is fit that wisedome should be obeyed, and that there are some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which cannot be acted by those that are
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3673:256"/>
poore, &amp;c. Though we be not so out of the world, but that we heare newes of it; yet it passeth through so many places, that it cannot chuse but receive divers impressions; and can never come to us in purity, seeing it gathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>dde, in comming but from the <hi>Louure.</hi> Yet I have come to know, and fame hath sounded in our desart, the great battles that have beene fought for the honour of <hi>Fance,</hi> and how you have vanquished the spirits of strangers; which is a greater victory, then to vanquish their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I have come to know, that <hi>Italy</hi> hath rigged up all subtilties, and imployed them to deceive us, and yet could not, and that these Spirits which thought to raigne in all assemblies, and to be the Masters of reason, have not beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend themselves against you, but with spight and choller, Nor to complaine of any thing, but that you perswaded them to that, which they came resolved never to doe, so as they which called us Barbarians; and got al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies as much by their Treaties, as they lost by our Victories, have found at last, that there is wisdome on this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> as well as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond: and are driven to acknowledge, that we had a man amongst us now, able to hinder them from deceiving us as they had done. They wondred to see a servant, that could not endure there should be a greater Master then his owne, that felt the least evils of his Country, as if they were his proper wounds, and thought it a hurt to himselfe, if there were but an offer made, to touch the Dignity of this Crowne, but when
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3673:257"/>
they saw that you: applyed remedies upon the suddaine, to all inconveniencies which they thought you could never have avoyded, that you not onely answered all objections they made, but prevented all they intended to make, that you dived into their soules, and tooke hold of their intentions there, and at the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, made answer to that which they reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the second, then in truth their fleame turned into choller, and then you quite rooted all their humane Prudence, and all their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke Maximes, &amp;c. I am not able to dissemble the joy I take, to heare that your good servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are acknowledged, that when divers coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels had beene tryed, yet yours at last was still faine to be followed, and that in guiding the fortune of <hi>France,</hi> you are no lesse President of all affaires of <hi>Europe.</hi> It is true, that of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall contentments, I have none so sensible to me as this, but on the other side, when I heare that your health, is continually assaulted, or at least threatned by some accident or other; that the rest which the quietnes of your Conscience ought to afford you, keepes you not from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unquiet Nights, and that in the midst of all your glory, and good successes, yet you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are as it were weary of your life, then in deede, &amp;c. And can it not be, that you should come to heare the publicke acclamations, but in the unquietnesse of your watchings? nor of your praises, but in your paines: Must the Sense suffer, and the Spirit rejoyce? Must you be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rocke, when you are in your Triumphs?
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:3673:257"/>
Must you doe two contrary workes at once, and at the same time, have neede both of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and of Patience: if vertue could be miserable, and that the sect which accounts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing evill but paine, nothing good but pleasure, were not universally condemned. Certainely the divine Providence, would at this day be complained upon, by all places of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and all honest men, would in your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe finde something amisse, in the worlds go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement. But my Lord, you know better then I, that it is the happinesse of beasts onely, of which we must beleeve the body, for as for ours, which resides in our highest part, it is as little sensible of disorders that are below her, as they which are in Heaven are uncapable of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences by stormes of the aire, or by vapours of the earth. And this being so, God forbid, that I should judge of your condition, by the state of your health; and not thinke him perfectly happy, whosoever is perfectly wise. Doe but imagine with your selfe, that you have made a division of the infirmities of humane nature, with other men, and then you shall finde the advantage is on your side, seeing there is in you, but a small portion of paine, for infinite passions and defects that are in others. Yet I cannot but thinke, that the tearme of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is neere expired, and that the time to come, is preparing contentments for you that are wholy pure, and wil make you young again after the time, as before the time you have made your selfe old. The King that hath need
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3673:258"/>
of your long life makes no wishes in vaine, and heaven heares not the prayers of the enemies of our state. Wee know of no successour fit to undertake what you leave unfinished, and if it be true that our Armies are but the armes of your head, and that God hath chosen your counsaile for establishing the affaires of this age; why should we feare a losse which hath no right to come but to our posteritie? he will not in this only point leave imperfect the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse he hath promised us; he loves men too well to deprive them of that good which you are borne to doe them. When Armies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated there may new be levied, and a second Fleet may be set forth when the first is lost; but if you my Lord should faile us, &amp;c. It shall be in your time that people oppressed shall come from the worlds end to seeke the protection of this crowne; that by your meanes our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies shall bee well payed for their losses, that the <hi>Spanyards</hi> shall be no conquerours, but the <hi>Fronch</hi> shall be the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>rs of all the earth. It shall be in your time that the holy seate shall have her opinions free; that the inspirations of the holy Ghost shall be no more oppugned by the cunning of our adversaries, and that there shall be raised up couragious hearts, worthy of the antient <hi>Italia,</hi> and able to defend the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause. Finally my Lord it shall be by your wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>dome that there shall be no more tyrannie in Christendome, nor rebellion in this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: That the people shall leave in their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours hands both liberty and religion; and
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:3673:258"/>
that from this legall government, and from this perfect obedience there shal arise that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse which Polititians seeke for, and which is the end of all civill societies. My hope is that all these things shall come to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough your wise government, and that after you have made sure our peace and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, you shall your selfe enjoy the benefit of your good deeds with pleasure and at your case, and shall see the state of things continue flourishing, whereof none but your selfe have beene the Author. I earnestly entreate you so to deale with Mounsieur <hi>de</hi>—that he may rest contented with this; and dispense with me for any new meditation which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more leasure then I am like to have. This bearer will deliver you the History of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which may serve you for a recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion till the end of the weeke, and then I shall come and aske your opinion, and desire you to give me some light of that time out, of the great experience you have of many things. I desire of God with all my heart that he will be pleased to afford you yet some great matter to exercise your selfe in, and that this wise old age of yours which wee so much admire may long continue to be a strength and ornament to your family. These are my earnest wishes, and withall, to make you by a perfect acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of your favours, a perfect proofe that I am,</p>

It is no small advantage to finde that solitude in ones selfe, which others seeke for in the Desart, and not to bee bound to goe out of the world for setching in of sound opinions and perswasive words. If the merit of yours take place, we shall shortly see at <hi>Comaedies</hi> as many long Cassocks as short robes, and the most austere Philosophers will have their hands and eyes in the recreations of the people, and so Sir of a mischiefe you shall make a remedy; you shall set timourous spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at liberty, and shall free us from two ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible monsters, scrupulousnesse, and vitious bashfulnesse. You make mee long to beare a part in this action, and in this sort to defend the Theater; to take the field after you is not so much to fight as to pursue the victory, and I thinke it no wrong to vertue to justifie an innocent pleasure, and that which is onely worthy of her; this we owe to <hi>Iason,</hi> to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinissa,</hi>

to <hi>Brutus,</hi> and to other worthy men, who live at this day in the person of the man you so much commend, and whom I admire as often as I heare. It is certaine that the grace with which he pronounceth verses gives them a degree of goodnesse which the Poets could not. They are more beholding to him that pronounceth them, then to him that made them, and this second father (if I may so speake) purgeth by his adoption all the vices of their birth; the tune of his voyce accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the dignitie of his gestures gives a kind of noblenesse to the most vulgar and base conceits. No soule is so strongly fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the objects of sence which he forcethnot; No judgement so wary and so well prepared, which is not caught with the imposture of his words in such sort, that if in this world there be any happinesse for verses, it is certainly in his mouth, and in his pronouncing, by which as evill things get the colour of good; so good things get the uttermost of their perfection. Let me know Sir whither I hit right upon your inclinations, and in the meane time I give you many thankes for your many favours, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the Letter of my Lord you tooke the paines to send me. Hee writes indeede in the stile of a Conquerour, and these words <hi>Accepi, legi, probavi,</hi> savour much of these, <hi>Veni, vidi, vici,</hi> of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> and of these <gap reason="foreign">

I could never hitherto satisfie my selfe herein, and what bad answer soever I receive from men yet still I relie upon this word of God, who commands me to hope well, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I waite still for the accomplishment of the Oracle.
