            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

vitall sermon, sweetly consonant to the tenour of his teaching, made him amiable living, and honourable dead in the opinion of as many as well knew him: This was the thing (I suppose) which wrought unto him from you (as well as from many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of your Noble Stock and Ranke) more then an ordinary esteeme: and this is that which maketh me in nothing to doubt, but that his labours made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique under your names, shall be very welcome unto you: the worke is answering unto the man; and therefore worthy you, and your acceptance: onely this is the disadvantage; that though these Sermons had his owne toung to preach them; yet they

want his owne pen to commend them unto your Honours: I well know that the expressions of holy truthes from a gratious heart by lively voice doe breed deeper impressions in thirsting and reverent hearers, then any publishing of them in dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters can doe; yet this we finde in experience, that holy and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary truths, this way com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming abroad into the Churches of God, doe get the advantage to continue longer, and to become a more generall good; they may stirre up the affections, and set on-wards in the course of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse where the comforts are sure, and the honours honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring everlasting.</p>

                     <hi>That it might bee fullfilled.</hi> Now the occasion of bringing them in here in this verse, it is a charge that Christ gives verse. 16. That they should not discover and make him knowne for the miracles he did, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17819:8"/>
himselfe, he was desirous to be concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, he would not live to the view overmuch: for he knew the rebellious disposition of the Jewes, that were willing to change their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, and to make him King, therefore he laboured to conceale himselfe all kinde of wayes, now upon this charge that they should tell no body, hee brings in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> prophesying of him, <hi>Behold my servant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hee shall not strive nor crie, neither shall any man heare his voice in the streetes.</hi> Other Kings labour that their pomp and magnificence may be seene, but he shall not mind ostentation, he shall not be contentious nor clamarous, for these 3. things are meant when he saith, <hi>he shall not strive, nor crie, neither shall his voice be heard in the streetes,</hi> he shall not yeeld to any ostentation: for hee came in an abased state to worke our salvation, hee shall not be contentious, nor yet clamarous in matter of wrong, there shall be no boasting any kinde of way, as wee shall see when wee come to the words, you see then the inference here.</p>
                  <p>The inference in the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the people, and to direct them how to come to worship the true God, after he had declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med against their Idolatry, as we see in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chapter, <hi>Behold my servant,</hi> &amp;c. Great Princes have their Embassadours, and the great God of Heaven hath his Son, his servant in whom hee delights, through whom, and by whom, all intercourse betweene God and man is.</p>

                        <hi>To stablish faith in other promises.</hi>
                     </note> by adding thereto a prophesie, and promise of Christ the Messias, to insinuate thus much, I will send you the Messias that is a greater gift then this that I have promised you, therefore you may be sure of the lesse, as the Apostle reasons excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>If hee spared not his owne sonne but delivered him to death for us all, how shall hee not with him give us all things?</hi> So here, I have promised you deliverance out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and this and that, doe you doubt of the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance? alas what is that in comparison of a greater favour I intend you in Christ, that shall deliver you out of another manner of <hi>Babylon, Behold my servant whom I have chosen,</hi> and in <hi>Isa.</hi> 7. <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive, and bare a sonne,</hi> &amp;c. I will send you the Messias, God shall become man, therefore I will not stand for any outward favour or deliverance what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. So he goes to the grand promise, that they might reason from the greater to the lesse.</p>
                  <p>There is another end why in other promises,<note n="2" place="margin">
                        <hi>To comfort them against their owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse.</hi>
                     </note> there is mention of the promise of the Messias, to uphold their faith. Alas wee are unworthy of these promises, wee are laden with sin and iniquity.

I am well pleased with you, because I am well pleased in him, therefore be not discouraged, <hi>All the Promises are yea and Amen in Iesus Christ</hi>:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.19.</note> For all the promises that be, (though they bee for the things of this life) they are made for Christ, they are yea in him, and they are performed for his sake, they are Amen in him; So much for the occasion of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Evangelist Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> and likewise in the Prophet <hi>Isay.</hi>

                        </note> The use of it in the Prophet, especially out of which these words are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, was to present Christ to the hearts of the people of God then, therefore he saith <hi>Behold</hi>; for Christ was present to the Beleevers then, he did profit before hee was, hee did good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was exhibited, because he was <hi>the Lambe of God slaine from the beginning of the world,</hi> he was yesterday as well as to day, and to morrow as well as to day, <hi>yesterday, to day, and the same for ever:</hi> he was present to their Faith, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to them in Types and Sacrifices, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Gods acceptation of him for them; therefore the Prophets mount up with the wing of Prophesie, and in regard of the certainty of the things to come, they speake as if they were present, as if they had looked on Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <hi>Behold my servant,</hi> and <hi>Behold a Virgin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

and indeed in Christ there are a world of wonders, every thing is wonderfull in him.

when the Father loves him, he loves himselfe in him, so he loves him as God, as the second person, as his owne image and character.</p>

                           <hi>As Man.</hi>
                        </note> for as man he was the most excellent creature in the world, he was conceived, fashioned, and framed in his mothers wombe by the Holy Ghost. It is said, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. God gave him a body, God the Father by the Holy Ghost fashioned and framed, and fitted him with a body, therefore God must needs love his owne workmanship.</p>
                     <p>Againe, there was nothing in him displeasing to God, there was no sinne found in his life any way, therefore as man he was well-pleasing to God, he took the man-hood, and ingrafted it into the second person, and inriched it there, therefore he must needs love the Man-hood of Christ being taken into so neare a union with the God-head.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17819:19"/>
whatsoever he did was well done. And for his suffering God delighted in him for that, as it is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.17. <hi>My Father loves me, because I lay downe my life,</hi> and so in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 53. <hi>He shall divide him a portion with the great, because hee powred out his soule unto death,</hi> and in <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. <hi>Because he abased himselfe to the death of the Crosse, God gave him a name above all names,</hi> therefore God loves and delights in him for his suffering and abasement.</p>
                     <p>It is said of <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 8.21. that he offered a sacrifice after the flood, and <hi>the Lord smelled a sweet savour of his sacrifice,</hi> and thereupon hee saith, <hi>I will not curse the earth againe,</hi> so God loves and delights in Christ as he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savour wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God rests, he felt such a sweet savour in the sacrifice of Christ, he is so delighted in it, that he will never destroy mankind, hee will never destroy any that beleeve in Christ, the sacrifice of <hi>Noah</hi> was a Type of Christs sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>Now that Christs sacrifice was so accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, there is a direct place for it in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. <hi>Walke in love as Christ hath loved us and hath given himselfe an offering and a sacrifice to God of a sweet smell.</hi> And indeed how many sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were there in the sacrifice of Christ offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the Crosse? was there not the sweet sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of obedience? he was <hi>obedient to the death of the Crosse,</hi> there was the sweet savour of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, and of love to mankind, therefore God delighted in him, as God, as Man, as Mediator

                     <p>Now Christ performes these three offices in this order.</p>
                     <p>First of all he is a Prophet, when he was baptised the Spirit was put upon him, as in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 61. <hi>To preach deliverance to the captives.</hi> First he preached wherefore he came into the world, why God sent him, and discovered to the world the state they were in, and when he had preached as a Prophet, then as a Preist he dyed, and offered himselfe a Sacrifice.</p>
                     <p>After death his Kingly office was most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.

ruler, and commander of Earth, and Sea, and Divels, and all, he wrought miracles, but the glorious manifestation of his kingly office it was after his resurrection.</p>

                        </note> the chiefe office to which he was annoynted by the Spirit (upon which the rest depends) it was his Priestly office: for wherefore was his teaching, but to instruct us what he must doe and suffer for us, and what benefit we have by his Sacrifice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God and freedome from the wrath of God, and right unto life everlasting by his obedience to the cursed death of the crosse. And how comes he to be a King to rule over us by his holy Spirit, and to have a right unto us? But because as a Priest hee dyed for us first, <hi>He washed us with his blood, he purged us with his blood, and then he made us Kings and Priests, Rev</hi> 1. All other benefits came from this, <hi>he washed our soules in his blood first,</hi> whatsoever wee have from God, is especially from the great worke of Christ as a Priest abasing himselfe, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, and thereupon hee comes to bee a Prophet and a King, thus we see the order of Christs offices, how they come to be fruitfull to us, the rest especially by vertue of his priestly office.</p>
                     <p>Note this by the way, Christs priestly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice includes two branches, his sacrificing himselfe for us, a Priest was to offer Sacrifice, and to pray for the people, our Saviour Christ did both in the daies of his humiliation; in his

prayer in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. there as a Priest, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his sacrifice to God before he died, and now he is in Heaven making intercession for us to the end of the world, he appeares for us there. We see then to what purpose God put the Spirit upon Christ, to enable him to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a Priest and a King, and thereupon to take away those mischiefes and evills that wee were subject and inthralled too, so that we have a supply for all that may any way abase us and cast us downe, in the all sufficiency that is in Christ Jesus, who was annoynt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And this is the reason of it, next under the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, Christ the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator was to be the spring, and originall of all

Christ for, that we are those that Christ makes intercession for in Heaven, the Holy Ghost witnesseth to us the love of the Father, and the Sonne, and so hee fetcheth from Christ whatsoever he works.</p>
                     <p>And hence the worke of the Holy Ghost is distinguished from illusions, and delusions that are nothing but franticke conceits of comfort that are groundlesse. The Holy Ghost fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all from Christ in his working and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and he makes Christ the patterne of all, for whatsoever is in Christ, the Holy Ghost (which is the Spirit of Christ) workes in us, as it is in Christ. Therefore in <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13. it is said of <hi>his fullnesse we receive grace for grace,</hi> that is, grace answerable to his grace.

                     </p>
                     <p>We receive grace, that is, the favour of God answerable to the favour God shewes his Son, he loves his Son, he is gratiously disposed to him, and he loves us.</p>

                     <p>Likewise in the third place, the Spirit assures us of the same priviledges that issue from grace: Christ is a Son, the Spirit tells us wee are

sons, Christ is an heire, the Spirit tells us wee are heires with Christ; Christ is the King of Heaven, and Earth, the Spirit tells us that wee are Kings, that his riches are ours, <hi>thus wee have grace for grace,</hi> both favour and grace in us, and priviledges issuing from grace, we have all as they are in Christ. Even as in the first <hi>Adam</hi> we receive of his emptinesse, curse for curse, ill for ill, for his blindnesse and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion wee are answerable, wee are borne as hee was after his fall, so in the second <hi>Adam</hi> by his Spirit, we receive <hi>grace for grace.</hi>

So the favour that God beares us, it is not first in us, but it is first in Christ, God loves him, and then he loves us, he gives him the Spirit, and us in him. Now Christ is the keeper both of the love of God towards us and the grace of God, &amp; whatsoever is good, he keeps all for us, he receives all for himselfe and for us, he receives not only the Spirit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but he receives it as Mediator, as Head, <hi>for we all of his fullnesse receive grace for grace,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it as a fountaine to diffuse it (I say) this shewes us our happy and blessed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Jesus Christ, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I might observe this, that none should take that office upon them to which they are not called of God, nor qualified by his Spirit, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially Ministers, because Christ did not set upon his office, till the Spirit was put upon him, the Spirit must inable us, and fit us for every thing, but I leave that, and come to that which concernes us all.</p>
                     <p>First then hath God put the Spirit upon Christ, as the Evangelist saith in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.34. <hi>Hee whom God hath sent,</hi> that is <hi>Christ, hee speaketh the word of God: For God gives him not the Spirit by measure,</hi> God doth not stand measuring grace out to Christ, but hee powers it out upon him full measure, running over, because he receives it not for himselfe alone but for us, we receive the Spirit by measure, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7. <hi>According to the measure of the gift of Christ,</hi> Christ gives us all a measure of sanctifying knowledge and of every grace, <hi>till wee grow to be a perfect man in Christ.</hi> Therefore it is called the <hi>first fruits of the Spirit, as much as shall fit us for Heaven, and grace sufficient, though it be not that measure wee shall have hereafter, or that wee would have here.</hi> Christ had a full measure, the fullnesse of a fountaine, diffusive, not onely abundance for himselfe, but redundance, and overflowing for the good of others, hee being the head of the Church, not onely a head of eminence, but of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17819:30"/>
influence to bestow, and convey all grace in him to all his members, proportionable to the service of every member, therefore he received not the Spirit according to measure, that is, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, but it was showred upon him, hee was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and cloathed with the Holy Ghost. Is it so?</p>

That which I said before will give light to this, we must partake of the same Spirit that Christ hath, or else wee are none of his members, as we partake of his name, so we must also of his annoynting, thereupon we are called Christians, because we partake of the annoynting and Spirit of Christ, and if we have the Spirit of Christ, it will worke the same in us as it did in Christ, it will convince us of our owne ill, of our rebellions, and cursed estate, and it will convince us likewise of the good we have in him.

Let us therefore examine our selves, what the Spirit doth in us, if Christ bee set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to redeeme us, as a Priest? (Surely all his offices goe together) he doth by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit rule us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. <hi>He hath washed us in his blood, and made us Kings and Priests.</hi> Whosoever he washeth in his blood he maketh him a King, and a Priest, he makes him by the power of his Spirit able to rule over his base corruptions, we may know then, whether we have benefit by Christ by his Spirit, not onely by the Spirit witnessing that we are the Sonnes of God, but by some arguments whereby the Spirit may witnesse without delusion, for though the Spirit of Christ tells us that we are Christs, yet the proofe must bee from guiding and leading, and comforting, and conforming us to Jesus Christ, in making us Kings, and Prophets, enlightning our understandings to know his will, and conforming us to be like him. The Spirit of Christ is a Spirit of power and strength, it will enable us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme duties above nature, to overcome our selves and injuries, it vvill make us to vvant and to abound, it vvill make us able to live and to dye, as it enabled Christ to doe things that another man could not doe. So a Christian
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17819:33"/>
can doe that, and suffer that that another man cannot doe and suffer, because he hath the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ.</p>
                     <p>At the least whosoever hath the Spirit of Christ, he shall finde that Spirit in him striving against that which is contrary, and by little and little getting ground, where there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, there is no Spirit of Christ at all, I will not be large in the point, onely I speake this by way of tryall to know whether wee have the Spirit of Christ in us or no, if not we have nothing to doe with Christ: For Christ saves us not as he is out of us onely, Christ was to doe something of himselfe that wee have no share in, onely the good of it is ours, hee was to redeeme us by his blood, to bee a Sacrifice, the title to Heaven and salvation was wrought by Christ out of us, but there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what that he doth not onely for us, but hee works in us by his Spirit, that is, the fitting of us for that he hath given us title too, and the applying of that that he hath done for us. Whosoever therefore hath any benefit by Christ, he hath the Spirit to apply that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and to fit and qualifie him to be a member of such a Head, and an heire of such a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whosoever Christ works any thing for, he doth also worke in them, there is a Spirit of application and that spirit of application if it be true it is a Spirit of sanctification and reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation fitting us every way for our condition,</p>
                     <p>Let us not abuse our selves, as the world
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17819:33"/>
commonly doth, concerning Christ, they thinke God is mercifull and Christ is a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Jt is true, but what hath he wrought in thee by his Spirit, hast thou the Spirit of Christ? or <hi>else thou art none of his, Romans</hi> 8. Where ever Christ is he goes with his Spirit, to teach us to apply what Christ hath done for us, and to fit us to bee like him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let those that live in any sinnes against con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, thinke it a diabollicall illusion to thinke God and Christ is mercifull, I but where is the worke of the Spirit? All the hope thou hast is onely that thou art not in Hell as yet for the time to come, but for the present I dare not say thou hast any thing to doe with Christ, when there is nothing of the Spirit in thee, the Spirit of Christ conformes the Spouse to bee like the husband, and the members to be like the Head, therefore begg of Christ that hee would annoint himselfe King in our hearts, and Prophet, and Priest in our hearts, to doe that that he did, to know his will as a Prophet, to rule in us as a King, and to stirre up prayers in us as a Priest, to doe in some proportion that that he doth, though it bee in never so little a measure, for wee receive it in measure, but Christ beyond measure, wee must labour for so much as may manifest to us the truth of our estate in Christ, that we are not dead but living branches.<note place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17819:34"/>
and sitting at the right hand of God, for after his resurrection he declared his victory over all his enemies, and therefore was able to give the Spirit without opposition, and upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, death and hell, and the anger of God were overcome, and our sinnes were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied for, now Christ was Head indeed ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving trod all his enemies under his feete, now he was enabled to give the Spirit, but upon his ascention into Heaven, and his sitting there, he was more enabled, for even as the Sunne, being so high above the Earth, doth convey his light and heate and influence upon the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our bodies, So Christ being so highly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced is fitter to infuse his Spirit and grace heere below since his exaltation, therefore the Church is fuller of grace, and grace hath beene more spread and diffused since the ascention of Christ then before, and the <hi>Evangelist</hi> gives it as a reason, <hi>The Spirit was not yet given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ was not ascended,</hi> intimating that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his ascention, there was a more full portion of the Spirit given, God being fully appeased by the death of Christ, and Christ staying the advantage that was fittest to give the Spirit, now God the Father gives the Spirit with the Sonne, so in both regards there was a greater fullnesse of the Spirit. Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets speaking of the times of Christ, especially of his exaltation, shew that then they should be filled with the Spirit, that the Spirit should be povvred out upon all flesh more aboundantly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17819:34"/>
then before. And that is the reason that the Apostles so differed from themselves, before and after Christs ascention, what a wondrous alteration was there? <hi>Peter</hi> before, hee flies even at the voice of a maide, and they were full of contention, and vaine glory, but after we see when the Spirit, the Holy Ghost came downe after Christs ascention into Heaven, how cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious, and valarous they were that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it a matter of glory to suffer any thing, and indeed we have more or lesse valour and courage, the more of lesse Spirit we have, now they having received more abundance of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, hereupon they were more couragious and undaunted at one time then another, and this abundance of the Spirit comes especially since Christs advancement.</p>

Now God in Christ would save us by a triumphant and abundant love and mercy, and the Spirit of God never goes but where there is a magnifying of the love and mercy of God in Christ, therefore the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Gospell, which onely discovers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:17819:35"/>
the amity and love of God to man-kinde being now reconciled in Christ, it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with the Spirit, to assure us of our part and portion in those benefits: for the Spirit is the fruit of Gods love as well as Christ, Christ is the first gift, and the Spirit is the second, therefore that part of the word that discovers Gods exceeding love to man-kinde, leaving Angells (when they were fallen) in their cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed estate: and yet giving his Sonne to become man, and <hi>a curse for us,</hi> the discovery of this love and mercy of God, and of his Son Christ to us, is joyned with the Spirit: for by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we see our cursed estate without the love and mercy of God in Christ, and likewise we are convinced of the love of God in Christ, and thereupon we love God againe, and trust to his mercy, and out of love to him performe all chearfull obedience, whatsoever we doe else if it be not stirred by the Spirit, apprehending the love of God in Christ, it is but morallity. A man shall never goe to Heaven but by such a disposition, and frame and temper of soule as is wrought by the Holy Ghost, perswading the soule first of the love and favour of God in Christ. What are all our performances if they be not out of love to God? and how shall we love God except we be perswaded that hee loves us first? therefore the Gospell breeds love in us to God, and hath the Spirit together with it, working a blessed frame of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we are disposed to every good
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17819:35"/>
duty. Therefore if we would have the Spirit of God let us attend upon the sweete promises of salvation, upon the doctrine of Christ: for together with the knowledge of these things the Holy Ghost slides, and insinuates, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth himselfe into our soules.</p>
                     <p>Therfore the Ministers of the Gospell should be much in laying open the riches of God in Christ; in unfolding Christ all other things will follow, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> in 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 12. <hi>The grace of God hath shined, hath appeared gloriously, teaching us to deny all ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, and to live holily and soberly in this present world,</hi> where the grace and love of God is perswaded and shed into the soule all will follow.</p>
                     <p>What is the reason that former times were called darke times, and so they were, the times of Popery, a darke age? Christ was vailed, the Gospell was vailed, there was no preaching of salvation by Christ alone, people were sent to stocks and stones, and to Saints, and instead of the word, they were sent to legends and such things, Christ was obscured, thereupon they were darke ages, those ages wherein the Spirit of God is most, is where Christ is most prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and people are best alway where there is most Spirit, and they are most joyfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and holy, where Christ is truly layd open to the hearts of people; the peaching of meere morallity, (if men be not carefull to open Christ, to know how salvation is wrought by Christ, and how all good comes by Christ)

it will never make a man perfectly good, and fit him for Heaven, it may make a man reforme many abuses, like a Phylosopher, which hath its reward, and respect amongst men, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give comfort at the houre of death, and the day of judgement, onely that whereby the Spirit is conveyed is the knowledge and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Christ in his state and offices.</p>

And there is a quenching of the Spirit, that is, when men have sweet motions of the Spirit, and presently by some ill language or

course of life they defile their vessels and quench the sweet motions of the Spirit. Let us take heed of all these, of <hi>tempting,</hi> of <hi>resisting,</hi> and <hi>quenching the Spirit:</hi> For undoubtedly (living in the bosome of the Church) we have many heavenly motions, especially those that have so much goodnesse in them as to attend upon Gods ordinances, they have those moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at those times, that they never have after perhaps, but they either resist them, or quench them, and wrong and grieve the Spirit, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Greive not the Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption, Ephes.</hi> 5. Men speake or doe somewhat that grieves the Spirit of God in them, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science being enlightned by the Spirit tels them that they have done that which is naught, yet notwithstanding for this or that advantage, to please this or that company, they will speake or doe that which is ill, and then the Spirit that was given in some measure before is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at this carnall and sinnefull liberty.

were all affraid, thus came <hi>Moses:</hi> now did Christ come as <hi>Moses?</hi> was the Gospell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Christ as the law was, in terrors and feares?

in another manner, he came not to make men quake and tremble that came to speake and deale with him, he came not with clamour and fiercenesse: for who would have come to Christ then? But he came in a mild, and sweete, and amiable manner; wee see a little before the text, upon occasion of the inference of these wordes, he commands and chargeth them that they should not discover him and make him knowne, when he had done a good worke hee would not have it knowne.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>But here wee must know that Christ was a wise discerner of the fitnesse of times: for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would have things published, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would not, sometimes hee vvould be knovvne, sometimes he would not.

mans salvation) that he must hide and conceale himselfe, and so hee ordered all his courses by discretion, every Sacrifice must be salted with salt, every thing should be seasoned with the salt of discretion, this is the steward of all our actions, to know what is fit, Christ knew it was fittest to conceale himselfe now at this time.</p>

So let us looke through good report and bad report to Heaven, let us doe the duties that are pleasing to God and our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and God will be carefull enough to get us applause; Was it not sufficient for <hi>Abell,</hi> that though there was no great notice taken what faith he had, and how good a man he was, yet that God knew it, and discovered it? God sees our sincerity and the truth of our hearts, and the graces of our inward man, he sees all these, and he values us by these, as he did <hi>Abell</hi>; As for outward things, there may bee a great deale of deceit in them, and the more a man growes in grace, the lesse he cares for them; as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation as is fit for a man will follow him in being and doing what hee should, God will looke to that. Therefore we should not set up sailes to our owne meditations, that unlesse wee bee carried with the winde of applause, to bee becalmed and not goe a whit forward, but we should be carried with the Spirit of God and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17819:44"/>
with a holy desire to serve God, and our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and to doe all the good we can, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver care for the speeches of the world, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, <hi>I care not what ye judge of me, I care not what the world judgeth, I care not for mans judgement, this is mans day</hi>; Wee should from the example of Christ, labour to subdue this infirmity which wee are sicke of naturally. Christ concealed himselfe till hee saw a fitter time. We shall have glory enough, and be knowne enough to Divells, to Angels and men ere long, therefore as Christ lived a hidden life, that is, he was not knowne what hee was, that so hee might worke our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so let us bee content to bee hidden men. A true Christian is hidden to the world till the time of manifestation comes; when the time came, Christ then gloriously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what hee was; so wee shall bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered what wee are, in the meane time let us be carefull to doe our duty that may please the Spirit of God, and satisfie our owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and leave all the rest to God; Let us meditate, in the feare of God, upon these directions for the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of our lives in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>

                     <hi>I hearkened and heard.</hi> Ere <hi>Sodome</hi> was destroyed, <hi>The Lord came downe to see whether there were such cause or no.</hi> God is most just, he will see cause for his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: He hath no delight in punishing. When hee judgeth it is not out of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; but out of his justice; he doth it not as a Soveraigne Lord, but as a just judge. Now a judge must doe all upon inquisition and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, therefore saith he, <hi>I hearkened and heard.</hi> Where by the way the gods of the earth to whom he hath communicated his name should learne hence, not to be rash in their judgements, but to have sound evidence, before they passe sentence. <hi>I hearkened and heard,</hi> To <hi>hearken</hi> is more then to heare, to apply ones selfe with some affection to heare a thing.</p>
                  <p>God is all eare, as he is all eye, hee hath an eare every where, he hath an eare in our hearts, he heares what wee thinke, what we desire, hee sees all the secret corners of our hearts, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when he saith here, <hi>I hearkened and heard,</hi>

it is by way of condescending to our capacity.</p>
                  <p>We may learne hence briefly, <hi>That God hath an eare, and an eye to our carriage and dispositions, to our speeches and courses.</hi> If we had one alway at our backs that would enforme such a man and such a man what we say; one that should booke our words and after lay them to our charge, it would make us carefull of our words.

As God hath a book wherein he wrote us before all worlds, and the booke of his providence for our bones, and all things that concerne us; So he hath a booke for our workes and words. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>They that feared the Lord spake often one to another, and the Lord hearkened and heard it, and a booke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance was written before him,</hi> &amp;c.

It is from the horrible prophanenesse of the poysonfull rebellious heart of man that men doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider these things, <hi>God hearkens and heares,</hi> hee is at our studies, hee is at our windowes, hee heares us in our chambers, when wee are in company, when we meete together, when we take liberty to censure and detract, when wee sweare and revile.

The Prophet tells, <hi>Psal,</hi> 94.7. they say, <hi>the Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob regard it.</hi> Or as it is, <hi>Iob.</hi> 22.12. &amp;c. <hi>Is not God in the height of Heaven? How doth God know, can he judge through the darke cloud, thicke cloudes are a covering to him that hee sees not, and hee walketh in the circuit of the Heavens.</hi> Tush he regardeth not, he is immured and shut up there: but to such Atheists wee see what the Prophet answers, <hi>Psal.</hi> 64.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yee brutish foolish people, shall he that makes others heare not heare himselfe? <hi>he that planted the eare,</hi> he that is all eare, <hi>shall not hee heare?</hi> As it makes good men walke holily and reverently, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of this, that God is present, and present as an observer, and a judge, so the want of taking this to heart makes wicked and carnall persons doe as they doe.

of heart. As in the the humility of wretched persons, a little before the judge comes, though they haue carried themselves as rebels before; yet then they will humble themselves: not out of any hatred to their courses, but out of feare of the judge. So it may be, now thou art arraigned by Gods judgements, thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakest thy sinnefull courses, not out of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of thy sinnes (for if thou couldest thou wouldest sinne eternally, and that is the reason sinners are punished eternally: Because they would sinne everlastingly) but thou seest thou art in danger to be pulled away by Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is not out of love to grace, it is not from any change of nature, that thou desirest to be a new creature, that thou admirest grace to be the best state: but it is to avoid danger; not that thou carest for the face of God, to be reconciled to him: but to avoid the present judgement.</p>
                     <p>And what a staggering will this be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, when a man shall deferre his repentance till Gods judgements seaze upon him?

Therfore an Ancient saith well. <hi>He that is good onely under the crosse, it never good,</hi> it comes not from any change that God works; but meerely from selfe-love.

In the 10. verse of this Chapter, he cryes out against the covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and false-dealing of the Priests and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and men of all estates: And so also Chap. 5. verse 4. <hi>The poore they were naught, they were poore in grace and goodnesse as well as in condition,</hi> Then saith he, <hi>I will see if there bee any goodnesse in the great ones, I will get me to the

                        </note>Againe, another particular sinne foreshewing judgement, is persecution of Religion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious men. When God is worshipped with conscience as he should be, what imputations are laid on it. I neede not speake, the world knowes vvell enough; Can God indure this, when conscience of his service shall goe under the brand of opposition? God is much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the times, vvhen there is nothing so heartily hated as that. There are many things loathsome, as deboishnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But vvhat is so eagerly, and heartily hated as the povver of godlinesse? that vvhich they have beene knowne to doe for conscience, hath beene matter of reproach, and ruine almost to many men. If a man vvill not prostitute his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to a creature, to make an Idoll of him, to set him highest, if he will not be buxome, and cracke his conscience for a creature, he is scarce thought fit to live in the world; vvill God suffer this, if these things be not amended? If any thing be good in Religion, the more the better, the more exact Christian the better. Exactnesse in other things is best: Is to be best in the best naught, when to be best in that which is not so good carries away the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations? In 1. <hi>Thessa.</hi> 2. <hi>The wrath of God is come on them to the utmost; God they hate and they are contrary to all men.</hi> This is a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of destruction, the spitefull oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of goodnesse: God will not endure it long.</p>

                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:17819:70"/>And so when men will goe on incorrigibly in sinne (as these here, <hi>They rush as the horse into the battell</hi>) when they will not be reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it is a fore-runner of destruction. Alas! the Ministers of God strive with men, <hi>but they breake off the cords,</hi> and cry, tush they are silly men shall we yeeld to them? Wee know what is for our gaine and profit and credit in the world better then so; Let us looke to that, and not be hampered in these religious bonds; No, we are wiser then so. Thus when men are incorrigible and account the wisedome of God starke folly, it is a signe of destruction. There is an excellent place for this, <hi>Ezekiell</hi> 24.12, 13, 14. <hi>She hath wearied her selfe with lies, and her great scum went not out of her, shee would not have her filthinesse taken from her. In thy filthinesse is lewdnesse: because I would have purged thee,</hi> with the Word and the preaching of judgements, <hi>and thou wouldest not be purged; therefore thou shalt not be purged til thou die, untill I cause my fury to rest upon thee, I the Lord have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it, it shall come to passe, I will do it.</hi> When God goes about to purge us by his word, and we wil not amend our waies, we vvill not stoope, but <hi>strengthen an Iron sinnew, and a whores forehead.</hi> We will not be purged, nay (saith God) thou shalt not be purged til J purge thee out of the vvorld to hell, till my fury rest on thee, <hi>Ithe Lord have spoken it, it shal come to passe.</hi> There is another notable place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that is a man of reproofe,</hi> that is, a man that is sermon proofe,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17819:71"/>
that is often reprooved and yet carryes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe impudently and hardens his heart, and stiffens his necke, <hi>he shall suddenly be destroyed,</hi> he doth not meane but that he had warning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: but because after long warning he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens his necke, he shall suddenly be destroyed, when he lookes not for it, <hi>and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi> There is the same phrase in 2. <hi>Chron. ult.</hi> 16. <hi>There was no remedy,</hi> when they did not regard Gods Ministers, that directed them the way to Heaven, but would live in rebellion against the meanes of salvation, then saith God, <hi>there was no remedy.</hi> God sent his messengers betimes, and had compassion on his people, he would not have had them perish: <hi>They tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with him and mocked his messengers,</hi> accounted them weake men, they despised his Word, and misused his Prophets, and then the Lords wrath rose against his people, and <hi>there was no</hi> remedy. So when people are as those here in the text, that <hi>they rush as the horse into the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,</hi> that they are Sermon-proofe, that when every Sermon they heare, as the hammer on the Smiths anvile, makes them harder and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (as <hi>Moses</hi> speaking to <hi>Pharoah</hi> increased the hardnesse of his heart) it is a signe of destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Now whether it be so or no, I leave it to your particular consciences, we that are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters tell you of your filthinesse, of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning the Name of God, and contempt of Gods Word; Whether have we gained upon

Blessed is that man; It is a signe God will not destroy him; it is a signe that in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall visitation God will regard that man. But alas we may almost complaine with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> in this Prophesie, <hi>Iere.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Where he runnes up and downe to seeke a man.</hi> Alas!

It is some comfort that men will submit to the ordinance, that they will come to heare, some good may be learned, it is better then to keepe out of the compasse of Gods law (as those men doe that pretend they can reade Sermons at home, and so will teach God a course to bring men to Heaven) there is hope of men when they submit to Gods ordinance: But I beseech you, how are you affected now for the present?

The heart must be mooved, but the braine must be instructed first: there is a simpathy betweene those two parts, as in nature, so in grace. The doctrinall part of the Epistle sets out the riches of Christ, (chiefly in the first Chapter) in regard of the spring of them, Gods eternall
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17819:78"/>
election. Then in this Chapter by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; by comparing the state of grace to the state of nature. <hi>You hath hee quickned, who were dead in trespasses and sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dependance of the words.</hi>
                     </note>The dependance of this Verse, I take it to be from the 19. Verse of the first Chapter. The Apostle there prayes that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> might have <hi>the eye of their understandings opened and enlightned,</hi> that they might know (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things,) what the exceeding great power of God is towards us that beleeve, <hi>According to the working of his mighty power that he wrought in Christ, when hee raised him from the dead:</hi> that they might have experience of that mighty power that raised Christ from the dead. Now here in this Chapter he saith, <hi>They were raised together with Christ, and set together with him in heavenly places.</hi> His reason is in this manner. Those that are raised up and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Christ to sit in heavenly places with him, have experience of a mighty power: But you are raised up and quickned with Christ to sit in heavenly places with him: therefore you have experience of a mighty power that raised Christ: for those that are raised and quickned with Christ have experience of that power that Christ had when he was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up.</p>
                  <p>The second thing that he intends especially in this Chapter, is to shew that <hi>being raised with Christ, they are brought nearer to God, both Iewes and Gentiles, that of themselves were farre off.</hi>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:17819:78"/>
Now he shewes that they <hi>were raised and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Christ, and brought neare to God in Christ,</hi> that they might magnifie <hi>the free grace of God in Christ</hi>; (all is by grace) and thereupon to be stirred up to a suteable, comfortable and gracious life. To come to the words, <hi>And you hath he quickned,</hi> &amp;c. They are an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former comfortable truths to them, <hi>you hath he quickned,</hi> &amp;c. These words, <hi>hath he quickned,</hi> are not in the originall in this place: they are after in verse 5. <hi>When we were dead in sinnes, he quickned us:</hi> but they are put in, in the translation; because they must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to make the full sence.</p>
                  <p>In the words consider these things</p>
                  <p>First of all, heere the Apostle puts them in mind of their former condition.</p>
                  <p>And then he sets downe in particular what it was, <hi>They were dead in trespasses and sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he tells them wherein they were dead, what was the cause of their death, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement wherein they were dead, <hi>in trespasses and sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, not in one trespasse and in one sin; but <hi>in trespasses and sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then to speake a little of <hi>quickning,</hi> to take it out of the 5. verse. <hi>You hath he quickned.</hi> There is the benefit with the condition. That which Jaime at is especially to shew our estate by nature, and how we are raised out of that. I shall touch the points briefly as I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded them.</p>

                        <hi>Hee minds them of their former condition.</hi>
                     </note>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> here first minds them of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition, <hi>you were dead in trespasses and sinnes:</hi> For contraries give lustre one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and it magnifies grace mervailously to consider the opposite condition. Hee that never knew the <hi>height and bredth and depth</hi> of his naturall corruption, will never be able to conceive <hi>the height and breadth and depth of Gods infinite love in Iesus Christ.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had deepe thoughts of both as ever man had; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could never enter into the argument, of abasing man, and extolling the love of God in Christ, that he could satisfie himselfe: but his spirit carries him from one thing to another, till he set it out to the full. And every one of us should be skilfull in this double mystery, the mystery of the corruption of nature that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable, there is corruption in the heart that none knows but God only: and we must plow with his heifer that carries a light into the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den parts of the soule, and discovers corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: there is a mystery of that as well as of the Gospell, of our deliverance out of that cursed estate from the guilt and thraldome of it. I doe but touch it onely, to shew the scope of the Apostle.</p>

                     </note>Now besides the consideration of it for this end; to magnifie the grace of God, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what our former estate was the better: there are many other ends.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:17819:79"/>
There is no soule so enlarged to glorifie God as that soule that hath large thoughts of its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state by nature, and that estate by nature made worse by custome, our second ill nature and bondage voluntary: considering Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in delivering and freeing us from all sinnes and trespasses, this will make us thankefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.

                           <hi>Spirituall life whence?</hi>
                        </note> The spirituall life of the soule is by the Spirit of Christ, when our soule hath union with the quickning Spirit of Christ, and by Christs Spirit is joyned to Christ, and by Christ to God, who is life it selfe and the first fountaine of all life: then we have a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life. The Spirit is the soule of our soules, and this spiritual soule, this Spirit in us is not idle wherever life is there is motion and operation inward and outward suteable and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the fountaine of life, the Spirit of God himselfe.</p>
                     <p>So on the contrary it is with death; what is death? Death is nothing else but a seperation from the cause of life, from that from whence life springs. The body having a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated life from the soule, when the soule is departed it must needs be dead.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Spiritual death</hi>
                        </note> Now death (take it in a spirituall sence) it is either the death of law our sentence: as we say of a man when he is condemned, he is a dead man. Or death in regard of disposition; and then the execution of that death of sentence in bodily death, and in eternall death afterward. Now naturally we are dead in all these sences.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note n="1" place="margin">
                           <hi>In disposition.</hi>
                        </note>First by the sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> in whose loynes we were, we were all damned; there was a sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon all <hi>Adams</hi> rotten race,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17819:81"/>
as we say <hi>damnati antequam nati,</hi> we were dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before we were borne, as soone as we had a being in our mothers wombe, by reason of our communion with <hi>Adam</hi> in that first sinne.</p>
                     <p>And then there is corruption of nature as a punishment of that first sinne, that is a death (as we shall see afterward) a death of al the powers, we cannot act and moove according to that life that we had at the first; we cannot thinke, we cannot will, we cannot affect, we cannot doe any thing that savours of spirituall life.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon comes a death of sentence upon us,<note n="2" place="margin">
                           <hi>Sentence.</hi>
                        </note> being damned both in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes and in originall sinne, and likewise adding actuall sinnes of our owne: if we had no actuall sinne it were enough for the sentence of death to passe upon us, but this aggravates the sentence. We are dead in law as well as in disposition.<note n="3" place="margin">
                           <hi>Execution.</hi>
                        </note> This death in law is called guilt, a binding over to eternall death: it breeds horrour and terrours in the soule for the present, which are the flashes of Hell-fire, and expectation of worse (even of the second death) for the time to come, which is an eternall seperation from God for ever, an eternall lying under the wrath and curse of God in body and soule (after they are united at the resurrection) because wee would sinne eternally if we did live eternally here: and no satisfaction being made for man after death, there must be an eternall sentence and punishment upon him, a terrible condition: if we were not afraid of the first death we should
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:17819:82"/>
be afraid of the second death that followes, <hi>wee are all dead in trespasses and sins.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now what is the reason of it why we are dead?</p>
                     <p>First of all, the ground of it is; by sin we are seperated from the fountaine of life, therfore we are all dead.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by sinne we lost that first originall righteousnesse which was comproduced with <hi>Adams</hi> soule: when <hi>Adams</hi> soule was infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it was cloathed with all graces, with ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall righteousnesse: the stampe of God was on his soule, it was connaturall to that estate and condition, to have that excellent gratious disposition that he had. Now because we all lost that primative Image and glory of our soules we are dead.</p>
                     <p>We are dead likewise not onely in regard of the time past, but for the time to come: No man by nature hath fellowship with the second <hi>Adam,</hi> till he be grafted into him by Faith, which is a meere supernaturall thing. In these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards every man naturally is dead.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sinne it selfe a death.</hi>
                        </note>Nay sinne it selfe, it is not onely a cause of death, of temporall death, as it is a curse; and so of eternall death: of that bitter sentence, and adjudging of us to, both that we feele in terrours of conscience, and expect after. But sinne it selfe is an intrinsicall death: Why? Because it is nothing but a seperation of the soule from the chiefe good, (which is God) and a cleaving to some creature. For there is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:17819:82"/>
no sin but it carries the soule to the changeable creature, in delight, and affection to its pride, and vanity, one thing or other. Sinne is a turning from God to the creature, and that very turning of the soule is death, every sinfull soule is dead. In these and the like conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, you may conceave we are all dead.</p>

The Image of God stamped upon the soule of man by the Spirit, it is the glory of a man: after sin it is an unlovely soule. <hi>We are all deprived of the glory of God,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith.</p>

                        </note>And not onely so; but there is a loathsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse contrary to that honour that was in it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Though all art and skill be used that may be to set out a dead body, (with flowers, or whatsoever you will) to please the fancy of the living: yet it is but a dead body, and the stench will be above all other sweete smells. So let any naturall man be as witty, and as learned, and as great, and as rich as you will; or as he can be set out with all these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and flowers: yet hee is but a carrion, a loathsome creature to God, if his soule be seperated from God, and inwardly cleave to the creature. If he have not a new heart, he is abhominable and loathsome to God, and to all that have the Spirit of God. A dead soule is abhominable to all Gods sences, (the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thus familiarly condescends unto us,) hee
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:17819:83"/>
will not behold him, <hi>hee lookes upon the proud afarre off.</hi> And hee smells no savour from their performances, <hi>the very sacrifice of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked is abhominable,</hi> he lookes upon them as wee doe upon a dunghill, as a loathsome thing. <hi>The prayers of the wicked are an abhomination to God,</hi> he turnes away his face from them, hee cannot indure them. And for his eares, <hi>hee will not heare the prayers of the wicked.</hi> And for feeling, he is wearied with their sinnes, <hi>as a cart is with sheaves.</hi> Nay, he is wearied with their very good actions, as it is <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.8. Whatsoever wicked men performe it is abhominable to God, hee cannot behold them, hee cannot indure them, hee is burdened with their sinnes; and those also that have the Spirit of God in them, as farre as they see the foulenesse of their sins they loath them.</p>
                     <p>But herein a wicked man agrees with a dead body, a dead body is not loathsome to its selfe. So take a carnall man, hee pranks up himselfe, hee thinkes himselfe a jolly man, especially when hee is set out in his flowers, those things that hee beggs of the creatures, he sees not his loathsomenesse; hee thinkes himselfe a brave man in the world, in the place he lives in: and hee hath base conceits of others, of God, and all things of God. Dead men are not loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to themselves, because they want sences. As in a prison, the noisome savour is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to them, because they are all acquainted with it; it hath ceazed upon and possessed their

The Word of God in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is an operative working Word. As it was in the creation, God said, <hi>Let there bee light and there was light:</hi> So in the Ministery it exhorts and stirres up to duty, and there is a cloathing of the ministeriall word with an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, it is a working word. As when Christ spake to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when hee stanke in his grave, he said <hi>Lazarus come foorth,</hi> it was an operative working word, there went an almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power to raise <hi>Lazarus.</hi> Therefore though we finde our selves dead and have no worke of grace: yet let us present our selves more and more to the Ordinance of God.

Therefore though there be nothing but actuall present resistance in the soule to that that is good and a slavery to the bondage of sin: yet attend meekly upon the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, God can make of Lions Lambs, he can take away that actual resistance. As Christ when he was raised, the stone that lay upon the grave was remooved: So when God will quicken a man, he will remoove the stone of long custome that is upon him; though he have beene dead so many yeares, yet God can rowle away the stone and bid him rise up.

We are begotten againe to this inheritance by the resurrection of Christ, who is risen againe to quicken himselfe and all his. The consideration of this should affect us as it did Saint <hi>Peter, to blesse God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now all this quickning power ariseth from our union with Christ, we must have a beeing in Christ before we can have comfort by death with him, or by rising with him. Our union with Christ springs from faith: faith is cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the Sacrament: the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beget faith: faith unites us to Christ: u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ makes us partake of his death, and the benefits of it, and of his resurrection and ascention to glory: therefore the more we attend upon this ordinance of the Word, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17819:90"/>
the seale of the Word, the Sacrament, the more our faith is increased: for God invites us to communion and fellowship with Christ, and all his benefits and favours: and the more wee find faith assured of Christ, the more union and fellowship wee have with Christ, and the more wee seele that, the more Christ is a quickning Spirit: quickning us with the life of grace here, and the hope of Glory afterward. Therefore let us comfortably attend upon the ordinance of God san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified for this purpose, to strengthen this our union with Christ.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur blessed Saviour was mighty in word and deed, witnesse what he did, what he taught, and both in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>What he did, hee fed many with a few loaves, he came over the water without any helpe.</p>
                  <p>What he taught, witnesse from this part of the Chapter to the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:17819:92"/>The words are part of an Answer of our blessed Saviour to his hypocriticall followers, that followed him for the Loaves, and not for any confirmation of their faith by his miracles: for upon occasion of those two miracles (men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former part of the Chapter) they followed him, and perceiving that hee was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously come over the water, they began to aske him, <hi>Rabbi, how camest thou heere?</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour perceives that they meant to complement with him, he sees with what hearts they came after him, therefore as most befitting the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their state, because they were hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, he answers, not to their question, but to their persons, <hi>Verily, verily, yee seeke mee not because of the miracles, but because yee eate of the loaves and were filled. Labour not for the meate that perisheth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Verses together containe a Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an Injunction, or direction.</p>
                  <p>A Conviction, and that is serious and loving. Serious, <hi>Verily, verily I say unto you, you seeke mee not because of the miracles, but because yee eate of the loaves,</hi> &amp;c. Hee convinceth them of their fault, of their hypocrisie, of their wicked and carnall aimes in holy businesse, they come flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Christ, but as hee was too holy to flatter, so he was too wise to be flattered, hee deales therefore directly with them, thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinceth them of their hypocrisie and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt aimes in following after him. We are all naturally prone to these carnall ends in holy
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17819:92"/>
actions; we must take heed with what mindes, with what hearts we come before God, whose eyes are brighter then the Sun, who regards not so much what we doe, as with what mindes we doe it.</p>
                  <p>As his conviction is Serious, so it is Loving, for with the conviction or reproofe followes the injunction or direction, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Injunction there are two things.
<list>
                        <item>First, he shewes them what they should not follow, he takes them off from labouring after <hi>the meate that perisheth.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>And then secondly, hee instructs them in what they should follow, what they should seeke after, <hi>But labour for the meate that indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to everlasting life,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are Arguments in both. In the first, there is an Argument disswasive, and that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth,</hi> because it is meate that perisheth.</p>
                  <p>In the second, there are Arguments prerswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, or inforcing to the duty, and they are three,
<list>
                        <item>The necessity.</item>
                        <item>The excellencie.</item>
                        <item>The possibility of attaining.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The necessity, it is <hi>meate,</hi> and what so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as meate?</p>
                  <p>The excellency, and that is set forth, first by the continuance, it is <hi>meate that endures.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the fruit or effect of it, it is <hi>meate that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17819:93"/>
endures to everlasting life,</hi> it is meate to life, and it is meate that tends to an everlasting, to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious life.</p>
                  <p>The possibility of attaining it, <hi>The Sonne of man shall give it you, for him hath the Father Sealed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three things that must concurre to make a thing attaineable, and to be had,
<list>
                        <item>A willingnesse in the giver.</item>
                        <item>Power and strength to give it.</item>
                        <item>And then Authority with power.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heere are all these; heere is will to bestow it, he will give it, what freer then a gift? the Sonne of God became the Sonne of man upon purpose to give it, hee will give it, and he will give it freely.</p>
                  <p>Heere is power and strength to give it, for he is the Sonne of God as well as the Sonne of man.</p>
                  <p>And then heere is Authority joyned with that power, for <hi>the Father hath Sealed him.</hi> The Father that created Heaven and Earth, that hath all power in his hands, that is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>He hath Sealed him,</hi> Hee hath given him full Commission to bee the Saviour of all that trust in him, Christ came not without Authority from God the Father, hee came out with Gods broad Seale as his Commission.</p>
                  <p>So you see the Arguments, both disswasive, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasive, <hi>But for the meate that endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17819:93"/>
life.</hi> I shall but touch the former, and principally insist upon the latter Branch.</p>
                  <p>To speake a little for the explication of the words. What is heere meant by the <hi>meate that perisheth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must enlarge the sense according to our Saviours meaning; By <hi>the meate that perisheth,</hi> hee doth not intend onely outward food, but all outward things whatsoever, they are the <hi>meate that perisheth,</hi> all earthly and outward things are the foode that the soule of a naturall man feedes upon. The soule of a Covetous man feeds upon his money, applauding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that he is worth so much and so much. The Ambitious man <hi>Camelion</hi> like feeds upon the ayre, upon the ayrie applause of the people. The Sensuall man feeds upon base and sensuall pleasures, in a word, all carnall men, naturall men are condemned to that sentence of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>to eate dust,</hi> to feede upon outward, earthly, perishing things. So that every thing that is not grace and glory or the meanes that leade to it, is a perishing thing.</p>
                  <p>Nay (to raise it a little higher) Learning and Knowledge, if it be onely of perishing things, is food that perisheth, for as the frame of nature and the civill frame of the world must have an end and perish, so the knowledge of naturall and civill things must needs be perishing also.</p>
                  <p>And to say no more, the very knowledge, the speculative and contemplative knowledge of religious things, if we have onely the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17819:94"/>
of the things in us and are not turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the things we know, is a perishing thing. The truthes of God indeed are the food of the soule, but unlesse the goodnesse of those truths be the food of the will and affections, unlesse we are molded and fashioned into the very forme of those truthes, unlesse we are framed to a love and liking of that which we know, that those truths be rooted and planted in us, it is food that perisheth.</p>
                  <p>In a religious discourse, in preaching, all your ornaments, besides that which quickneth and strengtheneth the soule to holy duties, is food that perisheth. And your hearing, if it be only to heare wittie sentences and turnings of speech without regard to the truth it selfe, is food that perisheth. Thus you see what a great latitude this food that perisheth hath in Christs meaning.</p>
                  <p>Now our blessed Saviour takes them off from labouring for this by a strong Argument: Would you have a greater argument? <hi>It is food that perisheth,</hi> we doe not regard the lustre of things, but their continuance. Why do we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of Chrystall more then glasse? Because it continues: Flowers have a goodly glosse, but wee regard them little, because they are fresh in the morning and cast away at evening. And so it is with all excellencies, unlesse it be grace or glory. All flesh is grasse, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentest things of nature, wit and honour and learning and all, though they be not as grasse
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17819:94"/>
so common, yet they are as <hi>the flower of the grasse, they are all fading and withering, but the Word of God endureth for ever,</hi> that is, the grace and comfort that we get by the blessed truthes of God, <hi>that endures for ever,</hi> and it makes us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, but all other things are food that perisheth, and we perish in the use of them, <hi>The world passeth away and the concupisence of it,</hi> the world, the things lusted after perish, and in lusting after the world the lust perisheth, and we perish to in the pursute of them, nay which is worse, the immoderate seeking after these things destroy us, wee eternally perish, for by placing our affections on earthly things we turne earthly. Therefore in Divinity wee have our denomination from our affections, we are called good or ill not from our knowledge but from our affections. The Divell knowes good, but he is not good, it is loving and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and delighting in good or ill that makes us good or ill, we have our forme and being in religion from our affections.</p>
                  <p>Now by seeking after and placing our affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions that are ordained to close with better things, which shall make us happy in another world, by planting them on earthly things we become like the things earthly, by placing them on the world we become the world, we become earthly, therefore they are not onely perishing in themselves, but we perish in the pursute of them. It is a strong argument that is here used, all earthly things are food that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:17819:95"/>
for alas he that is rich to day may bee poore to morrow, he may be as rich as <hi>Iob</hi> in the morning, and as poore as <hi>Iob</hi> at night, hee may be in credit now with <hi>Haman,</hi> and bee in discredit ere soone, he may be in health now, and sicke ere long; we need not Scripture for this, experience reads us this lecture enough, but we are so desperately set on earthly things, that neither Faith, nor experience, nor the strength of discourse, nor reason is sufficient to take us off till God by his Spirit convince us throughly of this, therefore <hi>Moses</hi> prayes <hi>that God would teach them to number their daies,</hi> so though there is a sufficient argument in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of these earthly things to be perishing things to inforce a disswasion, yet we cannot loosen our affections to them, nor know the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of them till God teach us.</p>
                  <p>To make some use of this, in a word, and so to goe on to that which J more intend. If all things here below be grasse and as the flower of the grasse, perishing and fading things, why then we should take heede that we doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme any perishing thing with the losse of that which doth not perish, with the losse of this soule of ours, which is an eternall spirituall substance, breathed in by God in the creation, and redeemed by Christ, which is capable of immortality, capable of happinesse, capable of the blessed impression of the Image of God, <hi>What if one should gaine the whole world</hi> (saith Christ that knowes the price of a soule best)
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17819:95"/>
                     <hi>and should loose his owne soule.</hi> It is an argument sufficient even to a man that is led but with the strength of naturall reason, not to labour for that which will perish, when he hath a soule that will not perish; to labour after that thing as his maine chiefe good, that is of shorter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance then himselfe is extreamity of folly: therefore no carnall man that seeks after these perishing things can ever be a wise man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath an end inferiour to himselfe, hee may be wise for particular ends, to be rich, to have great places, to get his pleasure, this is to be wise for particular ends; but he cannot be wise for the chiefe and last and best end, for his soule, for eternity, hee cannot direct his course that way, that labours for the food that perisheth.</p>
                  <p>And againe, we should not passe to neglect any earthly thing to gaine advantage to our soules, because they are perishing things, wee should force our selves to contentment in the losse of earthly things for the gaine of spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; the losse of things perishing is an easie matter, we loose things that will perish whether we loose them or no; All earthly things perish either in our time or after us; we should not therefore be over eager in getting of these earthly things, let us leave things that perish to men that perish: you see therefore how strong a reason our Saviour Christ alleadgeth here, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>th, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it perisheth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="172" facs="tcp:17819:96"/>And learne heere from our blessed Saviour a point of heavenly wisedome, you see when hee would take us off and disswade us from the pursuit of earthly things, he takes an argument from the nature of them, they are perishing things, and therefore when wee looke upon the outward luster of earthly things, wee should withall consider the perishing nature of them; when we are tempted to too much delight in the creature, we should present to our selves the perishing and fading nature of outward things; when wee are tempted to sinne either to commit, or to leave that which is good for any thing that is outward, we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what doe I now, I staine my soule, I crack my conscience, I contract guilt and grounds of terror for the time to come, for that which is perishing: it is alwaies good to have present to our soules and to our fancies the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of earthly things, that they may be as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent as the temptation, that Satan from them urgeth and forceth upon the soule; it is good alwaies to remember that they are perishing things, and that as they are perishing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, so they will destroy us, cause us to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish in the pursuite of them. But my meaning is not to dwell long upon this.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>Labour not for the meate that perisheth.</head>
                     <p>What? doth Christ meane that wee should not labour at all for earthly things? doth hee
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17819:96"/>
reade a Lecture of ill husbandry and unthrifti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and negligence?</p>
                     <p>No, he doth as we doe, when we would set a crooked thing straight we bend it as much the contrary way, our Saviour saw that they were desperately addicted to earthly things, that they followed him for their bellies, sought him for the loaves, therefore hee bends the sticke the contrary way, <hi>Labour not for the meate that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi> that is, labour not for it in comparison of better things, labour not so inordinately, so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately, labour not so unseasonably. It is said of the <hi>Israelites</hi> that they brought Aegypt into the Wildernesse, because they brought the love of the Garlicke and Onyons of Aegypt with them: wee have many come to the Church, to these holy exercises, to this holy place, but they bring the world with them, they come with carnall affections: labour not so unseasonably; it should be our heavenly wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to lay aside importunate earthly thoughts of earthly things, to drive them away as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did the Birds from the Sacrifice, we should leave them as he did the Beasts and his Servants at the bottome of the Mount when hee went up to sacrifice unto God: thus labour not, labour not immoderately, labour not inordinately, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour not unseasonably.</p>
                     <p>But how shall wee know when our labour is immoderate, unseasonable, and inordinate after earthly things?</p>
                     <p>I answer (in a word) when they either hinder
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17819:97"/>
us from, or hinder us in holy things, when they keepe us from holy duties, as from the santi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the Lords day, or from any other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, or when they hinder us in them, when they fill us full of distractions, when they turne the soule from the businesse in hand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus when they doe either hinder us from or hinder us in better things, we may know wee offend against this disswasion of Christ, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But why doth our Saviour begin first with his disswasion, <hi>Labour not for the meate that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth,</hi> and then injoyne what they should seeke after, but <hi>for the meate that endureth to everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting life?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Because he saw that their soules were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and desperately set upon the seeking after earthly things, and when the soule is invested to any thing, there must first be a remoovall of that; as in ground, the thornes must first bee rooted out, before there bee any sowing of seeds, and in bodily distempers, there must first bee a purge of the malignant humour, before there be any Cordialls given; so Christ, he first takes them off from an immoderate and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate seeking after the world and earthly things, and then he directs them what they should do, what they should seeke after, seeke the foode that endures to everlasting life.</p>
                     <p>Heere is the prerogative of Christianity, a Heathen man out of the strength of morrall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and outward experience can teach the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17819:97"/>
negative part, can tell you that all earthly things are vaine and perishing. A Stoick will declaime wittily and gravely from morrall principels and daily experience upon these things, that these earthly things of themselves are all vaine and fading, and that it is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of them onely that bewitcheth us to them, it is that onely that renders them to us greene and fresh: But now for the affirmative part, what we should seeke after, heere Paganisme is blinde, that is onely to bee learned in the Church of Christ, it is proper to Christianity to direct us heere, as I shall discover better to you when I come to speake of the duty injoyned, which is that I especially aime at.</p>
                     <p>But before I come to inforce the act or duty which our Saviour heere exhorts unto, I must unfold the object of that act, what is meant heere by the <hi>meate that endures to everlasting life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>meate that endures to everlasting life</hi> is our blessed Saviour Christ Jesus, as he is con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained and wrapped up in the meanes of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all the blessed liberties, priviledges, and prerogatives, graces and comforts that we have by him and in him: for our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour never goes alone, hee is never imbraced naked, but with him goes his graces, comforts, prerogatives and liberties; wee have him not now as we shall see him face to face hereafter in Heaven, but he is to be considered as wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in the Word and Sacraments, so is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17819:98"/>
Christ the foode that lasts to everlasting life, and in this latitude we must take it, or else wee mistake and straiten the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>But why is our blessed Saviour so conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the comforts, and prerogatives, and good things we have by him termed food?</p>
                     <p>In divers respects. To instance in a few: but first, you must know that as the soule hath a life as well as the body, so it hath a taste as well as the body, and as God (least the body should pine away) hath planted in it an appetite, which is the bodies longing after that which refresheth it, for if it were not for appetite, if it were not for hunger and thirst who would care for meate and drinke; so God hath planted in the soule, (least it should pine away) a spirituall appetite, an earnest longing and desiring after that which is the most necessary good of the soule; for the soule hath that which the body hath, taste, and smell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though in a more sublime and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine sense, but as really and truly, as we shall see afterwards. Now our blessed Saviour is this spirituall food of the soule, He is the bread of life that came downe from Heaven, He is the true Manna, He is the true Tree of life in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, in the Church of God the true Paradice, He is the true Shewbread, He is the true Lambe of God, He, considered with all the blessed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives and priviledges and comforts we have by him, is called meate or food for divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
                     <p>First, whatsoever sweetnesse, or comfort, or
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17819:98"/>
strength there is in meate, it is for the comfort and strength and good of the body; so what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is comfortable and cherishing in Christ (as indeed all comfort and cherishing is in him) it is for our good; to us He is given, for us Hee was borne, <hi>to us a Childe is borne, to us a Sonne is given,</hi> all is for us, for us men, for us sinners; there is nothing in his natures, in his state and condition both of abasement and exaltation, nothing in his Offices but it is all for our good. Consider him in his humane nature, and joyne with his nature, his abasement, that hee was man, that he tooke upon him our nature, that he was abased in it, that he humbled himselfe to death, even to the death of the Crosse, to bee a sacrifice for our sinnes, how doth the soule feed on this, on the wonderfull love of God in giving Christ to be incarnate, and then to die for us, how doth the soule feed upon the death of Christ, because by that Gods wrath is appeased and he reconciled, <hi>where the dead body is there the Eagles resort,</hi> so doth the soule prey and feed upon the dead body of Christ, Christ crucified is the speciall food of the soule.</p>
                     <p>Consider him in his Exaltation, in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Resurrection and Ascension into Heaven, how doth the soule feed upon that, Christ our Surety is risen againe, therfore our debt is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, the justice of God is satisfied to the full; so for his Ascension, when the soule is basely minded on earthly things, it ascends to Christ who is taken up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17819:99"/>
for us: so his sitting at the right hand of God, the soule feedes on that, because he sits there till hee have triumphed over all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till he have trod them all under foot.</p>
                     <p>Consider him in his Offices. In ignorance the soule feeds on him as a Prophet to instruct it; in the sense of wrath and anger the soule feeds on him as a Priest to make peace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation: in want of righteousnesse, the soule feeds on his righteousnesse, he is our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: In the sense of corruption, the soule feeds on him as a King, that by his Spirit will ere long worke out all corruption, that as hee will tread downe all our enemies without, so he will tread downe all corruption within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will never leave the soule till he have made it a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious house fit for himselfe.</p>
                     <p>So the prerogatives wee have by him, the soule feeds on them, feeds on his Redemption, that by his Redemption wee are freed from our enemies and all that hate us, and all that we fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that wee are set at liberty from the Law, from sinne and from death, and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the debasements of this world, wee are the sons of God and heires of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>In a word, whatsoever is in Christ is for our good, Hee is all mine, his Life is mine, his Death is mine, his Resurrection is mine, his Ascension is mine, all is mine, he is expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and laid open for my good, that's the first.</p>
                     <p>Againe, as in the bodily life, there is a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, a power to worke out of the meate that
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17819:99"/>
which is for strength and nourishment: so in the soule, there is faith the spirituall mouth and stomack of the soule to worke and draw out of Christ whatsoever is for the comfort and nourishment of it; as there is comfort in Christ, so the Spirit of God gives a man a hand, a mouth as it were, gives a man faith to worke out of Christ somewhat for comfort; what were food if there were not a stomack to digest it, to make it a mans owne? so what were Christ if wee had not faith to lay hold on him?</p>
                     <p>Againe thirdly, as our life is nourished and maintained with that which is dead, with dead things, so the chiefe dish that maintaineth and nourisheth the life of the soule (as I said before) is Christ crucified, <hi>God forbid</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>that I should rejoyce in any thing but in Christ crucified,</hi> when the soule of a poore sinner is pursued with accusations from Satan and his owne conscience, when they take part with God against him, whether runs it? to the city of refuge, it runs to Christ, to Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, thither the soule flies being pursued with the guilt of sinne, to the hornes of the Altar, as <hi>Ioab</hi> did when hee was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, but with better successe, for hee was pulled from thence, but the soule that flies to Christ crucified, to the death of Christ, to Christ abased, to his satisfying the wrath of God by his death, and making of us friends with God, there it holds, there it lives, and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17819:100"/>
there it will continue for ever; this keepes the soule alive.</p>
                     <p>And then againe, as in meate, before it can nourish us, there must be an union, an assimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a turning of it into us; so Christ, except hee be made one with us by faith, unlesse there bee an union betweene him and us, hee can never nourish and comfort us savingly.</p>
                     <p>Againe, as wee oft eate, and after we have received food once, yet we eate againe every day, because there is a decay of strength, and there are still new businesses, new occasions that require new strength, and therefore there is need of a continuall repairing of our strength by food: Even so there is a perpetuall exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, a continuall need that the soule hath to feed upon Christ, upon the promises of Christ, and the prerogatives by Christ, because every day we have fresh impediments, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>esh assaults, and therefore we have need to fetch fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies and refreshment from Christ, to have meate from Christ every day, to live on Christ not onely at the first, but continually, that as our corruptions, and temptations, and infirmities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne every day, so every day to feed on Christ for the repairing of our spirituall strength; especially wee are to make daily use of the death of Christ, for howsoever the death of Christ be transient in respect of the act of it (as one of the Antients saith) yet the fruit of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines for our daily comfort and refreshment, his bloud runs every day in the Church afresh,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:17819:100"/>
like a fountaine alwaies powred out for <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to wash in, it alwaies runs, that is, in regard of Gods imputation, in regard of the fruit that comes to the soule, and therefore we should make daily use of it for the comfort and strength of our soules upon all occasions, <hi>Wee have an Advocate with the Father Iesus Christ the righteous, and hee is the propitiation for our sinnes,</hi> he is now an Intercessour in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hee continually applies the fruit of his death now by his intercession in Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Againe, as after meate received and eaten, there is strength and comfort gotten for the affaires of this life; so likewise after the soule hath digested and relished Christ, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and prerogatives that come by him, after we have made the heavenly truths of Christ our owne, the soule is strengthened to holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is fit to doe, it is fit to suffer, it is fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist temptations, it is fit to performe all the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>In these and divers other respects Christ is the blessed meate heere mentioned, not himself alone, but considered with all the blessed good things which we have by him: for Christ (as I said before) is never alone, if wee have him, we are sonnes in him, we are heires in him, we are free in him, we are redeemed in him, wee are Kings in him, Priests in him, Prophets in him, we are all in him, we have with him all the good things that he hath, for as we have not them without him, so we have not him without
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17819:101"/>
them, those that have the field, have the pearle in the field, and they that have the pearle in the field, have the field, they that have Christ, have Christ cloathed with all his blessed prerogatives, and priviledges, and comforts.</p>
                     <p>But wherein lieth the difference betweene this meate, this foode of the soule and other meate?</p>
                     <p>In these things. First of all, Christ as he is from Heaven, so all the graces and comforts that we have by him are all from Heaven, and they carry us to Heaven, all the other things are earthly.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, all earthly food doth not give but maintaine life where it is, but Christ hee is such a food as gives life, he is as well life as food, I am the life.</p>
                     <p>Againe thirdly, the nourishment wee have from this outward food, we turne to our selves, but Christ this spirituall meate, turnes us into himselfe, transformes us into his owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for Christ offered to us in the Gospell being digested by Faith, doth by his Spirit change us every way into his owne like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, all other meats are consumed in the spending, and there will a time come when wee shall not be able to relish any worldly thing, our mouth will be out of taste with these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things; But Christ the food of the soule is never consumed, but growes more and more,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17819:101"/>
and when wee can relish no other, wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this food that indures to everlasting life, it alwaies satisfies the soule: all earthly things are as salt water that increase the appetite but satisfie not, onely Christ and grace and the comforts we have by him satisfie and that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly, they are as a spring that never dyes: As he himselfe in his owne person endures to everlasting life, so all that we have by him is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting, grace is everlasting, grace ends in glory: Christ alwayes satisfies, though not wholy here, because there must be a continuall recourse to him, yet hee will satisfie hereafter, <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, for they shall be satisfied.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you see what is meant by the food that endures to everlasting life, and the reason of the resemblance, and the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene this and other meate.</p>
                     <p>Here are arguments enough then to enforce us to a labouring after this meate that endures to everlasting life, that is so agreeable to the best part of us, that is able to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, to labour by Faith to get them to bee our owne.</p>
                     <p>Now the labour required is especially to get a stomacke to this meate, God requires nothing of us when we come to his delicacies but that we bring a good stomacke with us, J will ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore speake a little of that, what wee must doe to get an appetite to this spirituall meate.</p>
                     <p>A good stomacke we know is procured by
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17819:102"/>
sharpe things, <hi>the Paschall Lamb was to be eaten with sowre hearbs,</hi> if we would have an appetite after Christ, labour daily to consider what a cursed estate we are in without Christ: God hath left the Law as for other purposes so for this, that we should feed upon the threatnings of it, that it should drive us to Christ; A le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall faith is the way to evangelicall. Labour therefore thorowly to bee convinced of the need thou standest in of Christ, and then I need not bid thee to labour for the food that endures to everlasting life, that will sharpen thy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite after it: And beg of God illumination to see the ill that is in thee, and the ill that belongs to thee: God hath left infirmities and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in us on purpose for this end, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we have tentations without us, we carry not onely a Hell within us (which if God should not keepe in would carry us to despaire) but there is a hell without us, the tentations of Satan, the accusations of the Law, the anger and wrath of God; thus we should labour to be convinced of our wretched estate without Christ, the danger we are in if God should take us hence on a suddaine, this will force every day a fresh appetite and stomacke in the soule to feed on Christ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly if we would sharpen our appetites to this foode, wee must purge our stomackes which naturally surfet of earthly things, purge the soule by a consideration of the vanity of all other things that draw us from Christ: the
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17819:102"/>
reason why we have no better relish of Christ and heavenly things is, because we cleave in our affections so much to earthly things, we set up Idols in our hearts instead of Christ, and wee cleave in an adulterous and false affection unto them. Let us set before us arguments of the vanity of all things but Christ, and there can be no better argument then here is set downe, they are all perishing things: that which the soule neglects Christ and Heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for, and is so madly set upon, alas they are all base in respect of the soule, the whole world is not worth a soule, they are all perishing things, of lesse continuance then the soule is; we should purge our soules by such considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as these.</p>
                     <p>Then againe thirdly: Exercise getteth a sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, let us every day spend our spirituall strength in spirituall exercises, in resisting ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, in withstanding the snares of Satan, in bearing those daily crosses that God laies upon us, live as Christians should live, and the exercise of a Christian life will inforce us to goe unto Christ to feed on him, to fetch from him spirituall strength; when in our daily exercise we shall see the continuall neede wee have of pardon for daily sinnes, of comfort and strength against daily corruptions and infirmities, this will make us feede on Christ and on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made in him, not onely on the promise of forgivenesse, but on the promise of a supply of necessary grace, on that sweet promise, <hi>that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17819:103"/>
he will not quench the smoaking flax nor breake the bruised reede,</hi> feede on him as a King to subdue our corruptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of a Christian life will force us unto Christ.</p>
                     <p>Againe, to whet our appetite after Christ, consider the necessity wee have of spirituall strength and comfort: when a man considers that he hath a journey to take, hee will eate to enable him to his journey, as <hi>Elias</hi> was bid to rise up and eate because he had a journey to go, we are all to take a journey as farre as Heaven, and we are to travell through the wildernesse of this world, and wee shall be daily assaulted (besides our inward corruptions) with divers tentations, and therefore we had need every day to fetch strength from Christ: and consider that sicknesse will come, and death will surprize us, and if we have not Christ we are wretched creatures without him: and though we have applied Christ to our selves and made him our owne, yet a time of deseition, a time of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all will come: Thus the necessity of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall strength will force us to feede upon Christ.</p>
                     <p>Againe to get us a stomacke to these things, let us converse with those that are spirituall, with those that are heavenly minded, that have tasted of heavenly things, when we see them delight in reading, delight in hearing, when we see them contemplate of Heaven and heavenly things, on Christ and the benefits wee have
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17819:103"/>
by Christ, on the blessed condition of a better life and of the world to come, when wee see these persons that are better then our selves, that have lesse cause then we, take such paines for their soules, we will be ashamed of our own neglect, and it will be the discourse of a soule presently with it selfe, surely there is some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent streng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h and comfort in these things, some extraordinary sweetnesse and refreshment that these men find, that they so fall to them: it is a great advantage to converse with those that are spir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tuall.</p>
                     <p>And lastly, to put an edge to our dull appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites after this food, consider we know not how soone this table that Christ hath spread, these dainties that wisedome hath provided for us in the Ministry of the Word may bee taken from us, therefore let us fall too while we have them; We should doe as those doe that being at a feast and have neglected feeding, at the latter end when they see all ready to be taken away fall too a fresh: we know not how long we may enjoy these blessed opportunities, therefore now with <hi>Ioseph,</hi> let us lay up against a time of scarcity, there will a hard winter come, therefore let us imitate the wisedome of that poore creature the <hi>Ant,</hi> to provide against winter: Now while the <hi>Iubile</hi> is let us take out a pardon: there is a time of spending to come, now <hi>let us get oyle in our Lamps</hi>: Now is the seed time, now are the waters stirred in the poole of <hi>Bethesda:</hi> Now is the acceptable
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17819:104"/>
time of grace, wee know not how long it shall continue, therefore now let us labour for the food that endureth to everlasting life. I never knew any repent of the paines they had taken for their soules, but many that have lamented and bewailed the precious time they have spent, and that they have not beene good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands for their soules: It is one speciall point of heavenly wisedome to take advantage of our precious time, to fill it up with holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises; let us often offer this consideration to our soules, wherefore was I sent hither into this world, what is the end why I live heere? is it to scrape together perishing things and so to perish with them, or am I not rather sent hither to get out of the state of corruption wherein we all are by nature? to get into Christ, to make him mine own, to be turned into him, to feed on him, to get joy and comfort, and strength from him? is not this the end why I live heere?</p>
                     <p>But to goe on, and to make an use of triall, whether we have as wee should doe relished and tasted Christ, whether wee have fed on this meate or no. How shall we know that?</p>
                     <p>I answer, we may easily know it: For first of all, if wee have relished Christ and the good things by him, we disrelish all other things, we begin to have a baser esteeme of all earthly things. It is with the soule as it is with a Ballance, when Christ is high in the soule, other things are low, and when other things are high, Christ is low in the soule: Christ was high in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17819:104"/>
                        <hi>Pauls</hi> soule, therefore he esteemed all as dung in comparison of the excellent knowledge of Christ. The poore Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> when shee had heard Christ, and tasted the sweetnesse that was in him, downe goes her water-pot, and shee runs to the City and tells them, <hi>I have seene a man that hath told mee all things, is not this the Messiah? Zaccheus,</hi> when he had tasted of grace, and had the pardon of his sinnes by Christ, <hi>halfe my goods I give to the poore,</hi> &amp;c. when grace is planted in the soule, when the soule hath tasted once of better things, there will be a meane and base esteeme of earthly things: the more the soule feeds on heavenly things, the lesse respect it hath to temporall things. The soule is a finite Essence, and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not spend it selfe on all things, the more it runs into severalls, the more shallow it is to others; as in a streame, when it is cut into many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels it runs weakely in the severall, whereas it runs strongly in the maine; so it is with the soule, when it is scattered, as the poore <hi>Israelites</hi> were about the land of Aegypt to gather straw, to gather these perishing earthly things, it is weake to heavenly things, it hath little strength to those, but when the course of it is wholy bent to those, there are but weake or no desires run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to these earthly things, when once the soule of a Christian hath had a true taste and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish of the things of Heaven, it lookes with a despising eye upon whatsoever is heere below; when once it hath tasted of Christ, then espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17819:105"/>
it growes out of relish with poyson, then away with Popery, away with false doctrine, away with hypocrisie, and formality in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Againe secondly, wee may know that wee have tasted Christ and fed on him, and on the good things that are by him, when wee are strengthened by our feeding, when wee are strengthened to duties, strengthened against tentations and against corruptions. Thou saist thou beleevest on Christ and hast made him thine own, what comfort and strength feelest thou by Christ? art thou able to encounter a tentation? art thou able to resist a lust? art thou able to performe holy services? If there be no strength in thee, but every tentation turnes thee over, and thou yeeldest to every base lust, where is Christ? canst thou beleeve Christ to be thy King, and yet suffer thy lusts to beare sway in thee? canst thou beleeve that Christ is a Priest that died forthy sinnes, and yet cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shest and lovest sinne? canst thou beleeve that Christ is in Heaven and that thou art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly places with Christ, and yet hast no minde of heavenly things, but art carried away with every earthly thing? No, thou hast not yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted how good and gracious the Lord is, thou hast not yet relished the heavenly Manna: the soule that feeds on Christ is strengthened from spirituall reasons and supernaturall grounds and divine principles drawne from Christ to duty, so that it is enabled even with a holy vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17819:105"/>
to doe any thing for Christs sake; for the soule reasons thus, Christ gave himselfe to death for mee, I will therefore (if need be) give my selfe to death for him, Christ thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too deare for mee, I will thinke nothing too deare for him, this pride, this vanity that I am tempted to, these were the speares that were the death of my Saviour; thus the soule fetches reasons from the death of Christ to strengthen it against temptations, to strengthen it to du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and so for the matter of comfort, after meate hath beene received wee are refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, if the soule be sweetly refreshed with the comforts that are to be had in Christ, and in the Word of Christ, it is a signe wee have tasted Christ: those that have trembling and discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging hearts and soules, that cannot rest nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive comfort, it is a signe they have not rightly tasted Christ, <hi>Come unto mee</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>all yee that are weary and heavie laden, and yee shall finde rest to your soules</hi>; in Christ there is rest, out of Christ there is no rest; and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise those that have corruptions bearing sway in them, it is a signe they have not so much as touched Christ, for if they had but touched Christ hee would stop the issue of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions; the poore woman in the Gospell as soon as she had touched Christ, her bloudy issue was stayed, so upon the least touch of Christ by faith, there will be an abating of corruption.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, in the bodily life we know, after a good meale, the desire and appetite is satisfied;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17819:106"/>
so the soule that tastes of Christ, it hath sweet satisfaction and contentment: O the sweet satisfaction that a Christian soule hath above a Heathen. A Christian that hath Christ need not goe out of him for any thing, it hath full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and satisfaction in him in all estates, both in life and in death; dost thou finde Christ, and the priviledges and prerogatives we have by him, dost thou finde the Word of Christ and the promises of the Word fully and sufficiently satisfie thee, then it argues that thou hast fed on Christ, for Christ being received by faith into the soule, gives it fullnesse and contentment.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, to name no more, as men (if they have the grace of God in their hearts) will give thankes for their bodily food; so it is an evidence that we have fed on Christ when our hearts and tongues are enlarged to praise God for Christ, for the comforts and contentment and satisfaction that we finde in him and in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> begins his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> with <hi>Blessed bee God the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spirituall blessings in heavenly place; in Christ.</hi> And Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17819:106"/>
the soule that tasts the sweet comforts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in Christ will be much in sweet inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heart in thanksgiving, it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwaise, it is an universall reason, the more beleeving a soule is, the more thankefull a soul is, where there is no praise, there is no faith.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see how we may try whether we have tasted and relished, whether <hi>wee have fed upon the food that endures to everlasting life or no.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Taste is the most necessary sense of all (saith a wise searcher of the mysteries of Nature) our life is maintained by taste: Every creature sees not, every creature heares not, but every creature hath taste: you may judge of your selves by your taste and relish, and if once you have tasted and relished Christ, all the world cannot perswade you to fall from him, if all should say there were no sweetnesse in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that it were better to be a worldling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you would defie it, you would never beleeve it, there is no disputing against what a man tasts, if all men should say sugar were sharpe, if J once tasted it I would say otherwise.</p>

                     <p>With the necessity our blessed Saviour joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the excellency of this food, <hi>It is foode that endures to everlasting life:</hi> Christ and the good things we have by him are of equall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and of equall time with our soules, if wee labour for earthly things, we labour after that which is of shorter continuance then our soules, we may out-live our happinesse, and what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable state is that? But if we labour for the food that endures to everlasting life, our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is of the same continuance with our soules, and that is onely true happinesse.</p>
                     <p>If there were such a Tree upon the Earth now as there was in Paradice, a Tree of life,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17819:108"/>
that whosoever should taste of the fruit of it should live, though but on the Earth here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his sensuall pleasures.

Now blessed be God that since we are cast out of the first Paradice by sinne, that now in our relapsed estate God is so mercifull to us as to provide another manner of Tree of life, that in Paradice was but a typicall Tree, the true Tree of life is Christ, and whosoever feeds on him shall not perish but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life; certainely if we beleeved this, it could not be, but it would wondrously see us on to labour after this meate, because it is not onely food that tends to the preservation of life, but to life everlasting, to a life that endures as long as our soules.</p>

                     <p>This should inforce us to labour after this food in the use of all good meanes: and before J leave the point, consider the reality, the truth of these heavenly things, of these things wee have by Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> all things else are shadowes: The food that nourisheth the body it is not food in comparison of that, earthly kingdomes are not kingdomes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of that, earthly sonneship is not sonneship to that, earthly riches they are nothing, they are vanity in comparison of that, earthly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance is no inheritance in comparison of the inheritance we have by Christ, all other things are but titles of things, they are but empty things, there is a reality in Christ, a truth in the

Alas what is riches, what are pleasures, what are honours, what is sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, what are all earthly things in comparison of the soule which is an immortall, a spirituall, an eternall substance, they are but shadowes, those things that are of equall extent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance with the soule, and not onely of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall extent, but that raise the soule to have communion with God in Heaven, with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne and Holy Ghost, there is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, there is the truth, if we will have the truth of things: <hi>I am that bread</hi> (saith Christ after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in this Chapter) <hi>and my flesh is meate indeed and my blood is drinke indeed,</hi> as if other meat and other drinke refreshed not indeed, but were onely shadowes of things.</p>

Now heere is hope, and hope on a better ground a great deale, for hee that makes other things successefull, he hath given Christ for this purpose, and Christ (you see heere) hee gives himselfe, <hi>which the Sonne of man shall give you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heere is all that we may ground and found our hope upon, heere is will, heere is power, and here is authority to give it.</p>
                     <p>Heere is will, Christ will give it, why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the Sonne of man. What use is there of these words in this place? why doth he not say which the Sonne of God shall give you?</p>
                     <p>O the Sonne of God without the Sonne of man is indeed a Fountaine of good things, but he is a sealed Fountaine, alas of no comfort, our comfort is in Emanuell God-Man, all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is to be brought back to God from whom we fell in Paradise, and we must bee brought backe againe to God by God, but unlesse God had become man, man had never come backe againe to God, therefore all the union and communion we have with God it depends on
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17819:110"/>
this first union of Christ with our nature, that the Sonne of God became the Sonne of man (as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> saith) for now the next uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that we become the Sons of God it comes from this, that God became man: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he saith heere, <hi>the Sonne of man shall give it you,</hi> you need not climbe up to Heaven to fetch this food that endures to everlasting life, for the Sonne of God is come downe from Heaven to Earth, to take the nature of man, and in that to die, in that to satisfie Gods wrath, and so to become this blessed and everlasting food. The Sonne of man, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as by one man we all come to misery, so by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> (by man) wee are restored to a blessed condition againe: therefore he saith heere <hi>the Sonne of man,</hi> because in the humane nature all our salvation was wrought: indeed the worth and efficacie of our salvation comes from the divine nature, but it was wrought in mans nature, the divine nature could not worke it alone. But I will not dwell on this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Sonne of man shall give it you,</hi> you neede not feare it, God is become man on purpose to give it you, we may now boldly go to a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor which is made bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh, wee should have feared and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled if hee had onely beene God, but now all grace and comfort is hid in this nature of ours in Christ: if Christ had not tooke this poore wretched nature of ours upon him, it had beene a hatefull nature to God, God hated the nature
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17819:110"/>
of man, but now because the Sonne of God is become the Sonne of man, our nature is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come lovely in the eyes of God, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lovely, but it is filled in him with all grace, and of his <hi>fullnesse wee receive grace for grace.</hi> Hee will give it therefore, because he is <hi>the Sonne of man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Heere is will, I but what power and strength hath he to give it?</p>
                     <p>He is so the Sonne of man as that hee is also the Sonne of God, therefore we are said (<hi>Acts</hi> 20.) <hi>to bee redeemed with the blood of God,</hi> Christ by his eternall Spirit, by his God-head offered himselfe a Sacrifice for sinne; so that he can give it because he is God.</p>
                     <p>But what authority hath he?</p>
                     <p>He is <hi>Sealed</hi> to doe it, that's the third, that is, he hath authority, for authority is here expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Sealing. Now Christ is said to be <hi>Sealed,</hi> first, because there is the impression of God upon him, even as the seale imprints in the wax the likenesse of that which is in it, so God hath imprinted in Christ his owne likenesse, he is the Image of God, for Christ as he is God, is the character of his Father, and his humane nature is likewise as like God as nature can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse, <hi>we saw</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>his glory, the glory as of the onely begotten Sonne of God,</hi> we saw a kinde of divinity in him as much as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature could receive, the likenesse of God sparkeled in him; therefore hee is said to be <hi>Sealed,</hi> but that is not all nor the principall here meant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="202" facs="tcp:17819:111"/>Againe secondly, the use of a seale is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate and distinguish from other things, so Christ is <hi>Sealed,</hi> that is, God hath appropriated him to be his owne Sonne, and to be a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of his owne appointing, and hath distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished him from all others by a blessed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing and qualification of him above all, he is as <hi>Saul</hi> amongst the rest, higher then all, he is as <hi>Aaron,</hi> annointed with the oyle of gladnesse, but above his fellowes, and yet for his fellowes, from him distills the blessed oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of grace, it is powred on his head first, and descends from him downe to all the skirts of his garment, to all his members. So heere is in this Sealing, likenesse, distinction, and appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>But especially by Sealing heere is meant authority, for a thing sealed is not onely to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish and appropriate to a mans use, but to authorize also, as a Magistrate that hath the Kings broad Seale, he is authorized: so Christ he hath Gods Seale, God hath authorized him to be a Mediator, and as hee was fore-ordained before all worlds (as the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> saith) to be the head of them that should be saved,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.</note> and to be their Mediator, so when the fullnesse of time was come, when he came in the flesh, hee was authorized by the greatest testimony that ever was, by the blessed Trinity, God the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, heare him,</hi> saith a voice from Heaven, there was the Father, the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:17819:111"/>
Sonne in the voice, the Holy Ghost in the Dove, there was the whole Trinity, so he was authorized from Heaven.</p>
                     <p>And then he was authorized by his miracles, God gave him power to worke those workes which none could doe but a Mediator, therefore he saith, <hi>if you beleeve not me, yet beleeve me for my workes sake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was authorized also by his Resurrection, as the Apostle saith, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himselfe to be the Sonne of God by the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead:</hi> the Angells from Heaven brought witnesse of him, he was witnessed by all kinde of persons on earth, yea by the divels themselves: so hee is <hi>Sealed</hi> and authorized every way by all kinde of witnesses to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.</p>
                     <p>This is set out in other phrases in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>This my Son have I set upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. toward the latter end, <hi>Whom God hath set forth to bee a propitiation, God hath set him forth as the Shew-bread</hi> was set out under the Law. And then againe in another place, <hi>Whom hee hath sent,</hi> and in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Hee is made of God unto us Wisedome,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Hee is made of God,</hi> that is, he is <hi>Sealed,</hi> appointed, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by God for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>So you see, why Christ is said to be <hi>Sealed,</hi> especially because hee is authorized by God the Father, <hi>made, sent, set forth, whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath Sealed,</hi> that is, the party offended by our sinnes, he hath <hi>Sealed</hi> and authorized Christ to be a Mediator.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:17819:112"/>If this be so, let us learne this use of it, to blesse God the Father as well as Christ, <hi>Blessed bee the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> and <hi>Blessed bee Christ,</hi> for him hath the Father <hi>Sealed</hi> by the Spirit. The blessed Trinity have all a hand in our salvation.</p>
                     <p>And then againe consider, if wee despise Christ, whom we despise, we despise the Father that hath <hi>Sealed</hi> him, it is a weighty matter, Reade the second Psalme and you shall see there what it is to despise Christ, not to kisse the Sonne, that is, when God hath annointed and set forth a Saviour, and <hi>Sealed</hi> him and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized him by all the testimonies that can be to be a Mediator, not to receive him for our King, for our Priest and Prophet, it is a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not against Christ onely, but against the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who hath <hi>Sealed</hi> him.</p>
                     <p>And likewise it serveth wonderfully to strengthen our faith when we goe to God for forgivenesse of sinnes: offer him his owne broad Seale, offer to him Christ a Mediator authorized by himselfe: Lord I am thus and thus a sinner, but notwithstanding thou hast sent thy blessed Sonne and set him forth to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for mee, and him I offer to thee, thou canst not deny or refuse thy owne <hi>Sealed</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator and Redeemer, if hee had beene a Mediator of my owne appointing and of my owne sealing it were another matter, but I offer thy owne Mediator, looke on the death of him whom thou hast <hi>Sealed</hi> to bee
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:17819:112"/>
my intercessour. It is a wondrous prevailing argument with God, hee cannot denie that which he hath devised himselfe, him whom hee chose before all worlds for this great office.</p>
                     <p>But how shall I know whether hee be <hi>Sealed</hi> for my good or no? saith the soule that heares this, we heare much of an authorized Saviour, of an authorized Mediator to be All-sufficient, but what is that to mee?</p>
                     <p>Why? for whom is he <hi>Sealed?</hi> is he <hi>Sealed</hi> for Angels or for men? and amongst men, is he <hi>Sealed</hi> for holy men or sinners? <hi>I come not to seeke or to save</hi> whole men, or men that never were lost, no, he came to seeke and to save men, but they are lost men, sick men: and it is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full saying, and worthy of all meanes to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, <hi>that Christ came into the world to save sinners,</hi> saith blessed <hi>Paul,</hi> therefore he is <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> to save thee if thou art a sinner, to save thee if thou wilt receive him, and thou art bound to receive him under paine of the punishment of rebellion. Is it not rebellion not to receive a Magistrate whom the Prince hath authorized under his broad Seale? it is another manner of matter not to receive Christ, it is a greater sinne, then to sinne against the Law, for if a man sinne against the Law there is the Gospell to helpe him, but if a man sinne against the Gospell there is not another Gospell to helpe him, now to refuse Christ offered in the Gospell is a sinne against the Gospell, where
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:17819:113"/>
then can there bee hope of salvation? salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it selfe cannot save him that will not bee saved, that refuses the remedy <hi>Sealed</hi> by God the Father the party offended, who can heale him that casts downe the Potion that is brought to heale him, that refuseth the Physitian that comes to cure him? I say hee is <hi>Sealed</hi> to save thee if thou wilt be saved, if thou wilt receive him, receive him not onely to be thy Saviour, but to be thy King to rule thee, and thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to teach and instruct thee, as we shall see afterwards.</p>
                     <p>But to cleare this a little better, we must know that there are three distinct sealings.</p>
                     <p>There is God sealing of Christ, which I have unfolded to you.</p>
                     <p>And there is our sealing of God, that is, our sealing of Gods truth.</p>
                     <p>And then againe, there is Gods sealing of us by his Spirit: And these follow one the other.</p>
                     <p>Why hath God sealed Christ; but that wee hereupon should be stirred up to believe, and to receive Christ, and so by consequence to seale that God is true in sending such a blessed Mediator, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.33.</note> 
                        <hi>He that believes in the Sonne hath set to his seale that God is true.</hi> God hath sealed him that we by receiving him should seale Gods truth.</p>
                     <p>Beloved, God comes to us for our testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialls, for our hands and seals, Oh how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drously doth God condescend to weake man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:17819:113"/>
He hath sealed Christ for the office of a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and he offers him unto us, and he comes to us likewise that we would set to our seales too, that Christ is the Sonne of God, he counts it not sufficient that he hath sealed him him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but he will have us seale too, and we seale him when we receive him, he that receives him hath set to his seale that God is true, he that doth not receive him, <hi>he makes God a lyar,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what comes of this when wee receive Christ and set to our seale that God in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of salvation by Christ is true? Then we having honoured him, he honours us by sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us by his Spirit, as the Apostle saith: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes.</hi> 1. <hi>In whom after ye beleeved yee were sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> So when we beleeve and set to our seale that God is true, God seales us by his Spirit, <hi>after yee beleeved you were sealed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what is this seale of the Spirit whereby God seals us after we beleeve?</p>
                     <p>I answer, God seales us when hee sets the stampe of his Spirit upon us, when the worke and witnesse of his Spirit is wrought in us: For as in a seale, the wax hath all in it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he whole likenesse of the Jmage that is in the seale: So the soule that is sealed by the Spirit hath the likenesse of the Spirit of Christ stamped on it, God imprints in their spirits the likenesse of his Sonne, that is to say, he makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hem loving soules, humble soules, obedient as Christ was in all things, patient, meeke, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:17819:114"/>
see in the spirit of a beleeving man an expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Spirit of Christ, so that if you would see Christ in his excellencies, looke on the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a true Christian, there you shall see a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of Christ Jesus, not perfectly but in some comfortable measure, you shall see the very Image of Christ, you shall see how full of love he is, how patient in crosses, how humble, how meeke, how obedient to God in all things both in a passive and active obedience. This is the stampe of the Spirit, when a man beleeves God honours him by setting his Image on him.</p>
                     <p>And yet this is not all, besides this wee are sealed with the witnesse and comfort of the Spirit as well as with the worke of the Spirit, the Spirit of God sweetly witnessing that we are the sons of God: and this sweet witnesse of the Spirit especially comes after wee have honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God by beleeving in temptation, when we are able to hold out and say as <hi>Iob</hi> said, <hi>Though he kill me yet wil I trust in him,</hi> so when we can after conflicts of doubting and dispaire, say, <hi>though he kill me yet will I trust in him,</hi> I will set to my seale that he is true, well will you so? God to honour such a soule seales him to the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, that is, he gives to the soule of such a one a sweet evidence and testimony that hee is the Son of God.</p>
                     <p>And this seale of the Spirit is double, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done by the witnesse and worke of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inwardly (which I have shewed) but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:17819:114"/>
the Spirit doth seale them outwardly, ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them to make an outward confession of Christ and his Truth, and therefore in <hi>Reve.</hi> 14. Christians are said to be <hi>Sealed in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> that is, as they are marked and singled out in ill times to be such as God hath set his speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all favour upon, so they are <hi>Sealed</hi> with a spirit of boldnesse willingly and with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnesse to confesse the truth of Christ in ill times.</p>
                     <p>Now (to apply it to our purpose) would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou know whether thou be such a one for the present as for whom Christ is <hi>Sealed</hi> a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator? Examine first of all whether thou hast put to thy Seale that God is true by receiving and beleeving Christ and the promise of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through him, if thou hast done so then thou wilt finde another Seale from God, even the worke of the Spirit in sanctifying of thee and conforming of thee to the Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ, and thou wilt finde the witnesse and comfortable testimony of the Spirit in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee that thou art the Sonne of God: and withall thou wilt have a spirit of boldnesse and readinesse and forwardnesse to confesse Christ, thou wilt not care for al that the world saith, but wilt if (neede be) stand to the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to the death.</p>
                     <p>If thou canst finde this in thy selfe, undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly thou art not onely such a one as Christ came to Seale, but for the present, thou mayest be assured that thou hast interest in this Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17819:115"/>
Sealed by God for that purpose.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see that here <hi>is food that endures to everlasting life,</hi> which is Christ and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits wee have by him, you see that that blessed meate is attaineable, because he is willing to give it, for he is become Man for that purpose, he is able to give it, for he is God as well as Man, and he hath aurhority to give it, for God the Father hath <hi>Sealed</hi> him and fitted him for that office. If we receive him he will <hi>Seale</hi> us with his blessed Spirit, that is, the same Spirit that furnished Christ with grace, that sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him in the wombe, will sanctifie all those that are his members, will worke a likenesse and conformity in them to his blessed Image, for the same Spirit that was in the naturall Sonne is in all the adopted Sonnes of God. And he will likewise give us the comfortable evidence and assurance that we are the Sons of God, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish us with boldnesse and resolution to professe Christ in all times.</p>
                     <p>Let me then I beseech you come againe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enforce this exhortation: Take heed you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse not Christ, consider with what authority he comes, <hi>he is Sealed,</hi> it is no presumption therefore to receive him, though you be never such sinners, to receive him (I meane) not onely to be a Priest to reconcile you to God, but to be a King to rule you, and a Prophet to instruct you by his Spirit, to receive him on this manner is no presumption; to receive him indeed as a Saviour, but to neglect him as King,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:17819:115"/>
to refuse to come under his government is great presumption, but to receive whole Christ is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and faith and no presumption, nay if you doe not receive him you sinne damnably, you commit the greatest sinne that can be: He came to save all that will come under his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed government, that will kisse the Sonne,<note place="margin">Reve. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If you pretend you have sinned since your calling, and that you have sinned against conscience, and knowledge, and therefore now you have no further hope of Christ: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. speakes to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians that were in the state of grace, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to be reconciled to God,</hi> and in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 3. <hi>Returne againe you Backesliding Israel, and I will heale your Backeslidings,</hi> and againe, <hi>will

a man receive a wife that hath played the harlot and broken the band of marriage? Yet returne O house of Israel and I will receive you,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore runne not away from God, though thou hast sinned after thou art in the state of grace, come againe J beseech you still Christ is to be received, the doore of grace is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes held open, and the golden scepter continually held out as long as we live in this world.</p>
                     <p>But yet it is not good to neglect the time of grace, receive Christ presently, deferre not to come under his governement, and receive him wholy, or else there is no receiving of him at all.</p>
                     <p>And (to presse this a little further) I beseech you consider, that if you leave not your sinfull courses and come under the blessed governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, if you receive not this <hi>Sealed</hi> King, this <hi>Sealed</hi> Priest and Prophet, this <hi>Sealed</hi> Mediator whom God hath <hi>Sealed</hi> and sent unto you for salvation, there is not any thing in the world that will one day more torment you then your refusall of him; O that we should ever live to heare of salvation so freely offered and of a Saviour so authorized, yet notwithstanding that we should respect our sinnes more then our soules, and because we could not have him to bee our Saviour except wee came under his governement, and bee ruled by him as a King, we refused him wholy altogether: Indeed if we might have had salvation by him and the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17819:116"/>
forgivenesse of sinnes, and withall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the rule and sway of our owne lusts and beene led by them, we would have beeene contented to have had him, but rather then we would leave our blasphemous, our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, inujurious and covetous courses of life, wee were content to let Christ goe if hee would; O that we should reject this <hi>Sealed</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, O that we should refuse salvation offered on such loving termes, when God was so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as to Seale and authorize his Sonne, when the Sonne was so loving as to give himselfe when he was <hi>Sealed,</hi> to refuse this and that for such base respects, will certainely one day when the conscience is wakened, proove the greatest torment that can be.</p>
                     <p>See how the Apostle notably enforceth this in the second of the <hi>Hebrewes, if so be they did not escape that despised</hi> Moses <hi>Law, How shall we escape if wee neglect so great salvation?</hi> hee doth not say how shall we escape if we oppose Christ, if we raile on him, if wee despise his Image in his children, as many cursed wretches doe, but how shall we escape if we doe but neglect so great salvation, so witnessed and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized with all the signes, so offered and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with all the termes of love that may be.</p>
                     <p>And therfore if there be any heere that have lived in sinfull courses, and have a purpose to breake them off, that are weary of the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their lusts and of Satan that rules them by their lusts (for all are under one governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17819:117"/>
or other, either under the <hi>Sealed</hi> governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christ, or under the base governement of Satan that tends to damnation) O leave it, and come under this Governour <hi>Sealed</hi> by God the Father, authorized from Heaven by the blessed Trinity, by miracles, and by all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that can be, come under his blessed governement, and you shall doe well, God the Father, the partie offended with your sinnes, he hath <hi>Sealed</hi> him, and he cannot refuse a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of his owne Sealing.</p>
                     <p>And doe not say your sinnes have beene thus and thus, for consider what were these parties that he offers himselfe to heere, that he saith to, <hi>Labour for the meate that endures to everlasting life,</hi> were they not cursed Hypocrites that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him for the loaves, and yet he saith to them, <hi>Labour for the meate that endures,</hi> &amp;c. I am <hi>Sealed</hi> even for your salvation, if you will come out of your hypocrisie and be ruled by me; therefore let none stand out from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming under the governement of Christ, for hee offers mercy (you see heere) to the worst of men, even to cursed hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>And (to conclude with a word of comfort) if there be any poore distressed soule frighted in conscience with the sight of his sinnes and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations, O let such consider the love of God in Christ: Satan pictures out God as a terrible Judge, and so he is indeed to men that goe on in their sinnes, a consuming fire: but art thou weary of thy courses, art thou willing to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:17819:117"/>
come under a better covenant, let not Satan abuse thee by setting God before thee as a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Judge, and Christ as one that would not save thee; no, come in, kisse the Son, <hi>for him hath the Father Sealed, Sealed</hi> for thee if thou bee weary of thy sinnes, inforce not upon thy soule any unwillingnesse to be in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God stoope so low, and labour by all these arguments heere, as that Christ is the Sonne of man, and that hee shall give it you, and that the Father hath <hi>Sealed</hi> him for that end, wherefore is all this, but to shew his willingnesse to receive thee? wherefore hath the Father <hi>Sealed</hi> Christ but in love to thee? Come in therefore, and then if you will seale to this truth, if you will beleeve, and cast your selves on Gods gratious promise even against doubting and distrust, you shall finde God sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you by his Spirit, you shall finde his Spirit witnessing to your spirits that you are the sonnes of God.</p>
                     <p>Heere then you see is sure footing for poore doubting soules to fasten upon, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the party offended, hath <hi>Sealed</hi> his Sonne, hath authorized him to save thee, if thou repent and come in; what are all thy sins and unworthinesse to Christ, God-man, <hi>Sealed</hi> and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Father who is the partie offended? if thou art willing to come in, bring all thy sins and oppose them to Christ God-man <hi>Sealed</hi> by the Father and they will vanish as a cloud. But (as I said before) if thou wilt not come in and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:17819:118"/>
accept of this Saviour, if thou wilt not submit thy selfe to his governement, thou sealest thy damnation.</p>
                     <p>Thus you see I have unfolded this blessed portion of Scripture, Christ Jesus and all the prerogatives and benefits that come by him, is the food that endureth to everlasting life: you see the arguments our blessed Saviour useth to enforce us to Labour after this food, it is food, it is food that endures, &amp; it is food that endures to everlasting life, and he will give it, for him the Father hath <hi>Sealed</hi> and authorized so to do, he is both the gift and the giver, both the food and the inviter to the food, both the Priest and the Sacrifice. Labour therefore after this food.</p>
                     <p>There is an objection which I will briefely answer and so end.</p>
                     <p>Labour after it, why? Christ will give it, if he will give it why must wee labour after it? and if we must labour for it, how doth he give it? how can these two, guift, and labour stand together?</p>
                     <p>I answer, very well, Christ will give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and forgivenesse of sinnes, and life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, and yet we must labour too: But wee must know for what we must labour, we must not labour for any merit to the title unto Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and happinesse, Christ indeed gives that; But labour in the use of all good meanes to get knowledge and faith to receive this gift, to get the knowledge of Christ, what he is in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and offices, what he hath promised, what
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:17819:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he hath done and what he hath suffered, what the intent of the Gospell is, what the Giver is, and what the authority is that his Father hath given him, this requires labour, it is a labour to crack the shell, to understand the letter of the Scripture, to know what the gift and what the giver is. And it is likewise a labour to get faith to receive this gift, to get the soule emptied of all selfe-confidence, of all worth in it selfe and in the creature, for Christ must bee received with a beggars hand, and it will aske much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to deny a mans selfe, for proud flesh will alwaies have somewhat to trust to either in it selfe or in the creature.</p>
                     <p>So that these two may well stand together, labour and gift: we are taught to pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> God will give us our daily bread, we must not therefore stand still and doe nothing, but though God will give it, yet he will give it in the use of meanes, in the use of our lawfull callings, so heere, God will give us this spirituall food, yet he will give it in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, it is his ordinance, and whatsoever hee gives, he gives not in idlenesse but in obedience to his ordinance, he will have us to labour in the use of the meanes, in reading, hearing, receiving the Sacrament, praying, meditating and the like, to have a part in Christ this blessed gift Nay, because he will give Christ, therefore la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

No, spirituall things are against the streame, Heaven is up the hill, there must be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, there must be striving against corruptions within and against temptations without, and our labour it is a happy labour, it is not a barren labour,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.58</note> 
                        <hi>our labour is not in vaine in the Lord,</hi> as the Apostle saith, wee that labour for the food that endures to everlasting life, we labour for somewhat, but worldlings that beate their braines, and tire their spirits, and rack their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, and weare out their bodies, it is all for nothing, it is for that which is <hi>vanity and vexation of spirit,</hi> for that which they must leave behind them. A true Christian (to encourage him to take all the paines that may be) hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for something, it is a hopefull and not a barren labour: And (beloved) blessed are we that we can have this food for our labour, that
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:17819:119"/>
since the fall wee can recover by the second <hi>Adam</hi> a better estate then wee had by the first.</p>
                     <p>And our blessed Saviour to the end he might distinguish true Christians from Hypocrites, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes this duty of labouring so much the more, for we have many in the Church that thinke to have Christ and his benefits without labour, as if Heaven would drop into their mouthes, they can say that God is mercifull, and Christ died for us, but you shall in the meane time finde them carelesse of reading, of hearing, of praying, of the Communion of Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are idle in working out their salvation with feare and trembling, negligent in selling all that they have for the Pearle, will part with nothing for Christ, I say to distinguish these Hypocrites from true Christians, therefore he saith, <hi>Labour,</hi> to shew to us that onely they that labour for Christ in the use of all good meanes, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the true knowledge of him and for faith to receive him, that sell all for him, that take paines to grow in grace and in union with Christ, that make him their best portion in the world, and delight in him, it is they onely that have interest in Christ, onely the painefull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is the true Christian.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I beseech you, as you would have it discerned that you are not Hypocrites in the Church, bee stirred up to use all sanctified meanes to know Christ, to beleeve in him, to know that you are in a communion with him,

that you belong unto him. Be not discouraged, you shall have rest ere long, <hi>There is a rest for the people of God,</hi>

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> being in prison sends two of his Disciples to Christ, to know whether he were the Christ or no; not that <hi>Iohn</hi> did doubt, but to confirme his Disciples. Christ returnes a reall and a verball answer, <hi>Tell Iohn</hi> (saith he) <hi>what ye have seene and heard,</hi> &amp;c. and then he
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17819:122"/>
closeth up all, <hi>Blessed is he that is not offended with me.</hi> Upon this occasion Christ enters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a commendation of blessed S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> even unto a comparative commendation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them that were borne of woemen there had not yet risen a greater then <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi>

                     </note> not so much in eminency of grace (though that may have a truth) as in regard of the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of his Ministery, <hi>Iohn</hi> living in more glorious times: For the excellency of the Church is from Christ: he doth ennoble and advance times and places and persons, <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> a little Citty, yet not a little Citty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Christ was borne there, and saith Christ,<note place="margin">Luk. 10 23.</note> 
                     <hi>Happy are the eyes that see that which your eyes see,</hi> every thing is advanced by Christ.

                     </hi> not in grace, but in prerogative, in regard of the revelation and manifestation of more things. For <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> died before he saw the death and resurrection and ascention of Christ accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, before he was glorified. Therefore in regard of these prerogatives, the least in the Kingdome of Heaven, that is, in the Church of the New Testament is greater then he. It is a rule that the least of the greater, is greater then the greatest of the lesse. <hi>Iohn</hi> was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the greatest of them that were before him; but lesser then the least of those that were after him.</p>

                     <hi>From the daies of Iohn Baptist untill now the Kingdome of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force</hi>; so you see how the words depend upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For the points wee are to consider in them.</p>
                  <p>First, here you have the state of the Church in the New Testament, (It is a Kingdome, and the Kingdome of Heaven) together with the quality of the meanes whereby it comes to be a Kingdome, the meanes of grace, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. The Gospell and the people that are wrought on by the Gospell in the New Testament, they are both called the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Then secondly, here is set downe the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those people that seeke this Kingdome at that time, and so forward to the end of the world; the disposition of the persons is, <hi>they are violent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, the issue or successe of this eagernesse and violence; though the manner be violent, yet the successe is good, <hi>the violent take it by force.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth is, the date or time when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, and how long it continues; it beares date from the preaching of Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to the end of the world; <hi>untill now,</hi> that is, to the end of the world, as it was said, <hi>till now,</hi> in the Evangelists time, so posterity may say <hi>untill now,</hi> from the first comming of Christ, till his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:17819:123"/>
second comming, while there is a Gospell preached, which is the Ministerie of the Spirit, the Spirit will bee working, and there are such glorious things in the Gospell, that there will bee violence offered, so while there is a people to bee gathered, and a Gospell to be preached to gather them, and a Spirit that workes by that Gospell, there will be violence in the Church offered to the meanes of salvation.</p>

                  <p>Besides others, there are three maine signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of these words, <hi>The Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>

                        <hi>Threefold signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>
                     </note>First, the famous, leading, proper significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the state, and place where God himselfe, and his people are most glorious, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven</hi>;<note n="1" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heaven.</hi>
                     </note> all the other significations end in that. But secondly, because all that shall come into that glorious Kingdome, they must bee Kings here first in the state of the kingdome of grace,<note n="2" place="margin">
                        <hi>State of grace.</hi>
                     </note> which consists <hi>in righteousnesse, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, therefore the state of grace comes to have the name too of <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thirdly,<note n="3" place="margin">
                        <hi>Meanes of grace</hi>
                     </note> because grace in this world cannot be attained without an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and meanes, and dispensation from God; hereupon, the dispensation of the meanes whereby we come to have grace is also called <hi>The Kingdome.</hi> The unfolding the mysteries of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:17819:123"/>
salvation in the Gospell, is called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. As Christ saith, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God shall bee taken from you,</hi> that is, the preaching of the Gospell, therefore <hi>the Gospell</hi> is called <hi>the Gospell of the Kingdome,</hi> and <hi>the Word of the Kingdome,</hi> because by this Word wee come to have grace, and by grace, glory; there is no glory without grace, and no grace without the Word, one makes way for another. The preaching of the Gospell doth cause a Church (which is the Kingdome of Christ) wherein hee rules by the Scepter of his Word, by which Word, Christ and all his riches, and glory, and prerogatives are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, and thereby grace is wrought, and grace leades to glory. This connexion and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to bee observed.</p>
                  <p>First,<note n="1" place="margin">
                        <hi>A ground of conviction.</hi>
                     </note> for the conviction of those who doe not indeed belong to the Kingdome of Heaven; every man is ready to talke of the Kingdome of Heaven, and the glory there; I but there is a subordination of grace, and of the meanes of grace; how standest thou affected to the meanes of salvation, to the <hi>Word of the Kingdome, the Word of life, The Word of reconciliation?</hi> for it hath the name from all the excellencies to which it brings us, to shew, that as we valew life, a Kingdome, reconciliation, and all that is good, so we must valew this Gospell, or else it is a presumptuous confidence; if the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of grace and glory belong to us, wee must come to them by these steps; those that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:17819:124"/>
regard not the Gospell and meanes of salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have nothing to do with grace nor glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are hereby convinced of arrogant folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="2" place="margin">
                        <hi>Of comfort.</hi>
                     </note>Againe, it is a ground to comfort weake Christians that regard the meanes of salvation, and yet feare their falling away; be of good comfort whosoever thou art, God hath knit and linked these together, all the power of earth and hell cannot breake one linke of this chaine; conscionable attending upon the meanes and grace and glory will go together. Therefore hold on, attend upon the meanes of salvation, and waite with comfort; The Gospell of the Kingdome will bring thee to grace, and grace (though it be but <hi>an earnest,</hi> but a little measure) will bring thee to glory. Where God hath begun a good worke he will finish it, he will second one benefit with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, diligent attending on the meanes with grace, and grace with glory.</p>
                  <p>In Scripture, works have their denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from that they aime at, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Yee have crucified the old man,</hi> and <hi>yee are crucified with Christ,</hi> because yee are in doing it, and ye shall do it perfectly; so we are Saints, because wee shall be so; we are Kings now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are in part so, and we shall be so fully hereafter; so grace is called the Kingdome of Heaven, because it is the undoubted way to the Kingdome of Heaven and glory. God would helpe our faith by the very title, for wee are not elected to the beginnings onely of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:17819:124"/>
glory, but to the perfection, as it is excellently set downe, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. <hi>We are elected to glory by meanes and beginnings</hi>; therefore undoubtedly we may hope for the accomplishment when we see the beginnings.</p>
                  <p>Why is the state of grace and the meanes of grace and glory it selfe called <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven?</hi>

                        <hi>Answ.</hi>
                     </note>J answer, it is the manner of the Scripture to give titles to things from the glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of them, things are said to bee when they are gloriously manifested. The Mystery of Christ is said to be revealed now in the time of the Gospell, it was knowne before to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> and the rest: but now there was a more apparent glorious manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, therefore now the manifestation of Christ and the good things by him, they are called a <hi>Kingdome</hi>; before it was kept inclosed in the pale of the Iewish Church, it was vailed under Types, it was hid in promises that were darke and obscure, but when Christ came, all was taken off and Christ was unvailed. It is said in the Gospell, <hi>The Holy Ghost was not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 7.39.</note> 
                     <hi>because Iesus was not yet glorified.</hi> The Holy Ghost was given before, but not so fully
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:17819:125"/>
and plentifully: So there was a state of Heaven before men were saved, before the comming of Christ: But it was not called <hi>the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> it was not a state of liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from the bondage of ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And there is reason that there should be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence offred to this state and meanes, and grace wrought by it, it is a Kingdome: it is no great wonder that a Kingdome should suffer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, especially such a Kingdome as the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven.</hi>

If a man be to give to others, the flesh suggests, I may want my selfe. If he be to reforme abuses in others, he is ready to thinke, others will have somewhat to say to me, and I shall be offencive to such and such men. And then the affection to earthly things chaines us to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and selfe-love prompts a man to sleepe in a whole skinne; we love our wealth, and peace, and favour with men, so that a man cannot come to the state of grace without breaking through these, and hereupon comes the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of violence from the opposition from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, wee must offer violence to our selves, to our owne reason, to our owne wills and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>You have not yet resisted unto blood,</hi>

If there be hope of preferment, the doores of great men are sure to suffer violence with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites. The Courts of justice suffer violence, to have our right in earthly things. The stages, and such places are thronged, and suffer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

Alas, it is sleighted, and men will regard that when they can spare time, &amp;c.

A man cannot be violent and wise in the things of this world, because the things are meane, and eagernesse is above the proportion of them. A man cannot be violent after honour, or riches, and be as he should be; these are things that he must leave behind him and they are worse then himselfe: much lesse after filthy pleasures can a man be violent and wise, a man <hi>must become a foole in this respect,</hi>

                        <hi>The Spirit of God descended in the shape of a Dove</hi> upon Christ, as well as <hi>in fiery tongues</hi> upon the Apostles. But in the cause of Christ, in the cause of Religion, he must be fiery and fervent. No man more mild in his owne cause then <hi>Moses,</hi>

                        </note> hence we see that Religion takes not away the earnestnesse of the affections, it doth direct them to better things, it changeth them in regard of the object, It takes not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any thing in us, but turnes the streame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother way; Violence requires the height and strength of the affections: Religion taketh them not away, but turnes them that way that they should goe. If a streame runne violently one way, if it be derived by skill and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning another way, it will runne as fast that way when it is turned as it did before. So it is with the heart of man: Religion takes nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17819:135"/>
that is good, but lifts it up, it elevateth and advanceth it to better objects. There are riches and honours and pleasures when a man is in Christ: but they are in a higher kinde, therefore they draw affections and greater affections then other things: but these affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are purified, they runne in a better, in a cleaner channell: whereas before they ran amaine to earthly, dirty things below, the same affections (of love, of desire and zeale) doe remaine still, he that was violent before is as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent still, onely the streame is turned: For example take St. <hi>Paul</hi> for an instance, he was as earnest when he was a Christian as before, he was never more eager after the shedding of the blood of Christians and breathing out slaughter against them, as he was afterwards in breathing after the Salvation of Gods people and a desire to enlarge the Gospell. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was never so covetous of the world before, as he was covetous of Heaven when he became a Christian. I say Religion takes not away any thing, onely it turnes the streame: But it is a miracle for the streame to be turned, it was God that turned <hi>Iordan:</hi> so it is a greater work then man can doe to turne the streames of mans affections that runne amaine to earthly things, to make them runne upward, it is onely Gods worke. This is the excellency of Religion, it ennobles our nature, that which is naturall it makes it heavenly and spirituall, that a man shall be as earnest for God and good things as

A man that hath

                     <p>The reason and ground of it is in nature, the affections follow the discovery of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of things. When first the necessity of being in Christ is laid open; that there are but two Kingdomes, the Kingdome of Christ, and the kingdome of the divell, and that a man

When it is propounded thus hopefully, who would not offer violence to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?

                     <p>And this is another reason why in the latter, the second spring of the Gospell, (for there was a Winter in the time of Popery, it being a Kingdome of darknesse, keeping people in ignorance) so many nations so suddenly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the truth; <hi>Luther</hi> was a man that was won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drously exercised and afflicted in conscience, this made him relish the doctrine of justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by grace in Christ, and thereupon to lay open the mysteries of Christ, and the bondage of Poperie; and this being once a foot, the peoples mindes being prepared out of the sence of their former bondage, whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes came in presently.

So let us search our false hearts which way they runne: and now in the day of our abasement, let us thinke what would lie heaviest on our conscience, if God should take us now with sicknesse or sudden death; let us thinke with our selves what is the sinne
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:17819:152"/>
that would afflict me most? that would stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger me most, that would shake my Faith most? whether it be filthinesse, or profanenesse, or swearing, or injustice, and whether have I made satisfaction or no? Let me examine, if God should strike me with his Arrow now, what sinne would rob me of my comfort and make me affraid to yeeld my soule to God. Now thinke of it, his is the way to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: you may now bring your selves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of that that at other times you will not give your selves leasure to doe. What are daies of fasting for, but to give our selves leisure, that we may not thinke of meate and drinke and businesse? These daies should be daies of rest, that we may thinke of that that concernes our soules: take the advantage when thou rests from thinking of other businesse, thinke with thine owne soule what will lie heaviest upon thy soule. This is required to Humiliation; this reall Humiliation that is outward, it is a protestation of the inward, and verbal Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but an expression of what we do inwardly.</p>
                     <p>There are two things wondrous necessary before the soule can be in the right frame it should be in.</p>
                     <p>First the soule must apprehend deepely what distance it hath from God, what alienates it from God before it can be wise: and it must be estranged from that before ever it can come to couple and joyne with God; when the soule apprehends what seperates it from
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:17819:153"/>
God and conceives as it should doe of that, then it will be the readier to apprehend God and then all duties will come off easily. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us first of all worke upon our owne soules to be humbled and by all the helps that can be.</p>

                        </note>And to helpe it, consider now at this time, how uncertaine our life is, we know not who may be stricken next; and consider what the dangerous issue is, if we humble not our selves here before God humble us in our graves. Let us helpe Humiliation by all that may be: For where this is all will follow easily: a man will goe out of himselfe to God, when he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based in himselfe, and sees no comfort in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Earth but in God; that there is nothing to be stucke to in the world, but all is vanity and he may be stripped of life and of all these comforts ere long; when a man is abased Faith and Obedience will come off easily. What is the reason that Christ is not relished more? and that many fall off? They were never deepely humbled: according to the depth of Humiliation is the growth of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life and the height of Faith. All graces rise higher as the soule is more deeply hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled: The more we descend deeply in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and rending up our hearts, the more the Word of God sinks into the good ground that suffers the plow to rend it up and to cut off the weeds. The more deeply we are humbled, the more the fruits of Gods Word appeare in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:17819:153"/>
our hearts and lives, the more fruitfull is our conversation: all comes indeed upon the truth of our Humiliation, and when that is not deep and true all the rest is shallow and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfit: there we should worke it upon our owne hearts.</p>
                     <p>And labour to be humble and low in all the powers of our soules;<note n="5" place="margin">

                     <p>And this will breed poverty of spirit in our judgements.

                        </note> therefore we should take heed that now we are to deale with God, we lay open the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of our soules to him: let not the Iron be in the wound. You know a Chyrurgeon can heale nothing if the Iron or poisoned arrow sticke there. If there be corruption in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke it must up, if it be ill gotten goods, it will not digest, up it must all to God: For men except there be scruples that a man cannot free his conscience, there is no necessity, though great conveniency: but betweene God and thy soule open all by confession, and give not over till thou hast brought pardon to thy heart of that sinne thou hast confessed. Every sleight confession is not enough, but it must be a resolved downe right confession without guile of spirit, as it is in <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. this is the course that <hi>David</hi> takes there; untill he dealt roundly with his soule without guile, <hi>His moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture was as the drought of Summer</hi>: he was in some dangerous disease that could not be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And doe we looke to be preserved from falling into sicknesse, or if we be sicke, to be cured? We must beginne the cure in our soules, lay open the wound to God, <hi>I said I will confesse my sinne, and thou forgavest me,</hi> he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with confession. So all persons that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare or are under any judgement, let them beginne with laying open their soules to God: when the soule is healed he will heale the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy presently after: for he laies sicknesse up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body for the soule, and when the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:17819:154"/>
wound is healed, the plaister will fall off of it selfe; therefore let us lay open our sinnes by confession and shame our soules all that wee can.</p>
                     <p>This is the way to give glory to God,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Confession of sin gives glory to God.</hi>
                        </note> let us joyne both together, our owne ease and glory to God. When we have laid open our soules to God, and laid as much against our selves as the Divell could doe that way: for let us think what the Divell would lay to our charge at the houre of death, and the day of judgement; he would lay hard to our charge this and that, let us accuse our selves as he would, and as he will ere long: The more we accuse and judge our selves and set up a tribunall in our hearts, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely there will follow an incredible ease. <hi>Ionah</hi> was cast into the Sea, and there was ease in the Ship, <hi>Achan</hi> was stoned, and the Plague was stayed: out with <hi>Ionah,</hi> out with <hi>Achan</hi> and there will follow ease and quiet in the soule presently; conscience will receive wonderfull ease. It must needs be so, for when God is honoured conscience is purified. God is honoured by confession of sinne every way. It honours his omniscience, that he is al-seeing, that he sees our sinnes and searcheth the hearts, our secrets are not hid from him. It honours his power, what makes us confesse our sinnes, but that we are afraid of his power least he should execute it? And what makes us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our sinnes? But that we know there is <hi>mercy with him that he may be feared?</hi> And
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:17819:155"/>
that there is pardon for sinne, we would not confesse our sinnes else, with men it is confesse and have execution, but with God confesse and have mercy, it is his owne protestation; we would never lay open our sinnes but for mercy. So it honours God, and when he is honoured, he honours the soule with inward peace and tranquility. We can never have peace in our soules, till we have dealt roundly with our sins and favour them not a whit; till we have ripened our confession to be a thorow confession. What is the difference betweene a Christian &amp; another man? Another person slubbers over his sins, God is mercifull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he thinkes if he come to the Congregation and follow the Minister, it will serve the turne. But a Christian knowes that Religion is another manner of matter, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinde of worke then so: he must deale throughly and seriously, and lay open his sinne as the chiefe enemy in the world, and labour to raise all the hatred he can against it, and make it the object of his bitter displeasure, as being that that hath done him more hurt then all the world besides, and so he confesseth it with all the aggravations of hatred and envy that he can.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:17819:163"/>
though our good actions be ill: yet for their kinde and matter and stuffe they are good, they are commanded of God: For their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and spring they are wrought by the Spirit of God: for the person the worke-man it is one in the state of grace, and for acceptance God rewards them: But it is another thing when we come before God to humble our selves, then we must see what staines and sinnes are in them. There is no good action so good, but there are wants and weakenesses and staines and blemishes in it as it comes from us. The Spirit of God indeed is effectuall to stirre us up to good actions: but we hinder the worke of the Holy Ghost and doe not doe them so throughly as we should: therefore besides our wants and weakenesses, there is a tainture of them, either we have false aimes, they are not so direct, or our resolutions are not so strong; false aimes creepe in for a while, though we doe not allow them: and then there are some coolers of our devotion; our love is cold, our hatred of sinne is not so strong; our prayers are not so fervent, our actions are not so carried without interruption, but are hindred with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bie thoughts; who cannot complaine of these things?

Let us take notice now of the hand of God upon us; what is the meanes to stop his hand that he come not among us with his publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? It is prayer. The way to stop God and the Angell that hath his sword now drawn over our heads, it is prayer.

The cry of the child prevailes with the mother, though it cannot speak oft-times: So when in the sence of sin and misery we cry to God, we move his bowels with crying. There is no question but the serious apprehension of danger felt, doth awaken the soule and stirre it up. It is so also in danger feared, a danger feared with beliefe will worke as if it were present: for a man that hath a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of faith to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:17819:167"/>
if the judgement were upon him. Faith makes things present, both good and ill, and it makes a man sensible of things that are not yet upon him. This is the difference betweene a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and another man, another man <hi>puts the evill day farre off from him:</hi> but a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving Christian by a spirit of faith sees God (except he be turned away by hearty and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repentance) ready to ceaze upon him, and so he walks humbly in all his courses. So that danger felt or feared by a spirit of faith awakens and stirrs up the soule to lay hold on God.</p>
                     <p>Therefore in spirituall dangers we should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially waken our soules to see in what need we stand of Christ, and the pardoning mercy of God in Christ, that we may waken him, and give him no rest till we find peace in our consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>

to beare ill, and large to doe good, and strength against temptations; he would rather have this gratious disposition then any thing in the world, he had rather have the pardon of sinne with the sense of Gods favour then any thing in the world. This will stirre up a man, as we see in <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 51. <hi>Mercy, mercy,</hi> it binds God, and laies hold on him, together with pardoning mercy to have a heart enlarged with spirituall joy.

beseech you let us labour to amend it as wee tender our owne salvation (perhaps that wee doe not regard so much, we shall ere long, but then) as wee tender the health of our bodies which wee preferre before our soules, let us humble our selves more then ordinarie now.</p>

                           <hi>Extraordinarie humiliation re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quired some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi>
                        </note>Some divells are not driven out but by prayer and fasting; so some judgements they will not away without prayer and fasting, not onely publique but private fasting and prayer. Sometimes there must be more then ordinary humiliation for some sinnes; for some kinde of temptations there must be prayer and fasting; for some maladies prayer and fasting, and more then ordinary stirring and rouzing up of our selves to lay hold upon God. God will not be held with ordinary humiliation, that will not doe it: but there must be a resolution against, and a hatred of all sinne, and to please God in all things. We must doe it with extraordinary humiliation now, because the judgement is extraordinary. There is ordinary humiliation, and extraordinary; as there are ordinary feasts, and extraordinary, so there is ordinary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for daily trespasses; but in extraordinary judgements extraordinary fasting and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As there is ordinary washing daily, but there is washing and scouring at good times; God calls for extraordinary humiliation now, not onely prayers, but stirring and rouzing up of our selves. We should apprehend the danger
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:17819:170"/>
as seizing on our selves; this night it may seize upon us for ought we know: It should affect us, and make us stirre up our selves. This is the way to hold God by prayer; and if we hold him, he will hold the destroying Angell, he hath all creatures at his command. Thus you see how we should confesse the sins of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the sins of our good actions, our want of calling upon God. <hi>There is none that calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Name, that stirres up himselfe to take hold of thee.</hi> Thus farre proceed the branches of their sinfull disposition in those times.</p>

that nips the leaves and takes away the vigour of health.</p>
                     <p>And so (as I said) for all idle performances, that have not a foundation in substantiall piety, they are all as leaves, when trouble of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence comes, they are as <hi>Adams</hi> figleaves; when God comes to search, and examine, they all fall off, both in respect of our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in respect of our lives, wee are all as leaves when God comes in judgement, this is one part of the complaint. <hi>We are all as leaves,</hi> the like we have of <hi>Moses</hi> the man of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. when God blowes upon us with the winde of his displeasure we fall off as leaves.</p>

He doth not say, thou art our Father, and we are thy sonnes; because hee thought they were unworthy, (as the Prodigall saith, <hi>I am unworthy to be called thy sonne</hi>) but instead of saying we are thy sonnes, he saith, <hi>we are the clay, thou art the potter.</hi> Yet he is a Father continually; and though in Christ you cannot call him Father, yet you may by Creation, and initiation, being brought up in the Church. Goe to him with the incouragements you have, and cast your selves upon him. There is a bond for you by Creation, and there is his command, he bids you call him Father, hee is a Father by Creation; looke not upon this or that sinne, but goe to him, and call him Father, as you may call him; say thou art my Father, thou hast given mee a being in the Church, wrastle with him as you may, though as found Christians you cannot call him Father. Be weary of your courses, are you willing to come under Gods hand to bee sonnes; you are sonnes by Creation already, offer thy selfe to be of his family for the time to come, and God will give a sweet report to thy soule.

If the Divell and Reprobates could bee brought to this, they should never come there where they are in terrours of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Let us labour to practise this dutie, Lord I commit to thy hands my body and soule, I cast my selfe into thy bosome, doe with mee as thou wilt. Some that have stood out at the staves end with temptations many yeares, have gotten comfort by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation. <hi>VVe are the clay, thou art the potter,</hi> thou maist mold and break us as thou wilt. The way now to escape the plague is not alltoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to use tricks of wit, and policie (though lawfull meanes must be used) but labour to get into Christ, and resigne our selves into Gods hand absolutely, and say thus, <hi>VVe are the clay, &amp;c.</hi> Lord, thou maist dash us if thou wilt, as thou dost now many hundreds weekely, thou
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:17819:178"/>
maist dash us in that fashion if thou wilt: Only we may have a desire that God would make our lives and health pretious to him, that we may serve him as if we were now in Heaven, and that we may have grace to make good use of all. But if God have determined and decreed to take us away, let us resigne our selves into his hands. It is no matter though the body bee <hi>sowne in dishonour, they shall be raised in honour, wee are the clay, he is the potter,</hi> let him do what he will with our carkasses and bodies, so he be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to our soules. These vessells of clay when they are turned to earth, they shall be renewed of better stuffe, like the glorious body of Christ; then our soules and bodies shall be glorious by him that took a peece of flesh and clay for us: O the humility of Christ! we wonder that the soule should animate a peece of clay, so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a thing as the soule is; much more may we wonder that the Sonne of God should take a piece of flesh and clay upon him, to take our nature of base earth, to make us eternally glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as himselfe. Let it comfort us though God dash our clay in pieces as a Potter: yet Christ that tooke our clay to the unity of his Person, our nature being ingrafted into him, hee will make our bodies eternall and everlasting as his owne glorious body. Let us resigne our selves into Gods hands, as the Church here, <hi>Thou art the Potter, and we are the clay,</hi> and then wee shall never miscarry.</p>

                        <hi>Foure things that trouble a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans peace.</hi>
                     </note> that trouble the peace of a Christian (and indeed of any man) in this world.</p>
                  <p>The first, is sinne, with the guilt of it, binding them over to the wrath of God, and the expectation of miserie; a heavie bondage.</p>
                  <p>The second, is (besides the guilt of sinne) the remainders of corruption, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that accompanies them while we live in this world; and that conflict must needes be tedious.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:17819:180"/>The third, is the miseries of this life, that accompanie alway both the guilt and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of sinne in this world; we are condemned to a great deale of trouble here: and this doth much exercise and perplex Gods children<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then the shutting up of all; death, and damnation: the thought of these things doth much disquiet and disturbe the peace of a Christians soule.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Epistle we have comfort against all these: First, for the guilt of sinne, that binds us over to eternall judgement, and the wrath of God; we are freed by the obedience of Christ, the second <hi>Adam:</hi> as is excellently she well in the fifth Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And for the remainders of corruption, that we conflict with in this world; we are assisted against that, by the Spirit of Christ: for, as by the obedience of Christ, we are freed from the guilt; so by the Spirit of Christ, we are helped and assisted against the remainders of our corruptions.</p>
                  <p>For the third, the miseries of this life; we have victori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> singular comforts in this Chapter against all the troubles than can be fall us; and this is one, that triumphs over all: <hi>All things shall worke for the best, to them that love God.</hi> What should I speake of hurt, from any thing that

befalls us, when all shall worke for the best, by the over-ruling of him that commands all, <hi>Vers.</hi> 28?</p>
                  <p>And for death it selfe, <hi>Neither life nor death shall be able to separate us from the love of God.</hi> And for damnation, which accompanies death, <hi>It is God that justifieth, who shall condemne?</hi> There is opposite comforts in Gods Booke, nay, in this Epistle, and in this Chapter, against all that may any way trouble our peace. <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus,</hi> saith the Apostle; and then he goes on after, to shew how by the helpe of the Spirit, <hi>all things worke for the best, &amp;c.</hi> In this very Verse likewise, you have this comfort set downe, of our freedome by Christ from any thing that may hurt us. <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus, hath made me free from the Law of sinne and of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The words are dependant,<note place="margin">

                        </hi>
                     </note> as we see in the particle, for, <hi>For the Law of the Spirit of Life, &amp;c.</hi> They depend upon the first Verse thus, as a reason why, how ever there be sinne in Gods children, yet there is no damnation to them. <hi>There is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Iesus,</hi> he prooves it thus; Those that are free from the Law of sinne, and of death, which brings in condemnation; those undoubtedly are free from damnation: but those that are in Christ Jesus, they are freed from the Law of sinne, and of death; therefore there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to such. But how shall we know,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17819:181"/>
that we are in Christ Jesus? Those that have the Spirit, and are led by the Spirit of Christ, they are in Christ; <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus, hath freed me from the Law of sinne, and of death.</hi> So I say, the words are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially a reason of the former, <hi>There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them that are in Christ Iesus:</hi> because, by the <hi>Spirit of Christ they are freed from the Law of sinne, and of death</hi>; and by consequent, they are freed from damnation: for, what brings in damnation, but sinne?</p>
                  <p>In the words then, there is an opposition; there is Law against Law; <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life, in Christ</hi>; and, <hi>the Law of sinne, and of death.</hi> Now, where there are contrarie Lawes, if there be contrarie Lords (as there must be) New Lords will have new Lawes; especially, if they be Lords by conquest: they will alter the very fundamentall Lawes that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as you know the old Conquerours have done in this Kingdome. Here is Law against Law, and Lord against Lord; Christ against sinne, and death. Here is a Lord by conquest over all other Lords, and Lawes: therefore, here must needes be an alteration of Lawes upon it, the very fundamentall Lawes must be altered. But to come more particularly to the words;</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>For the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus, hath freed me from the Law of sinne, and of death.</head>
                     <p>The words are much vexed by Expositors.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17819:181"/>
I will rather speake my owne judgement of them, and reconcile them, then dash one mans judgement against another: for that tends not to edification. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of life, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning of the words is plaine, if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with other Scriptures.</p>

                        </note>] It is nothing but a commanding power: for so the word written, the Law (in the Apostles meaning) is but a power forcing and commanding. So the <hi>Law of the Spirit of life,</hi> is the commanding and forcing power of the <hi>Spirit of life in Christ Iesus:</hi> and so the <hi>Law of sinne,</hi> it is either the tyrannicall command and forcing power of sinne, or else the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning for sinne afterwards, as we shall see hereafter; for we shall unfold the words better in the particulars.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>And then, here is our freedome and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from that; <hi>we are made free from the Law of sinne, and of death.</hi>

We are dead by nature, but we are dead and rotten by actuall sinnes; we super adde to the guilt of our sinne, by our dayly conversation. We are blind by nature, but we are blinded indeed much more, by our custome of life. Every sinne doth, as it were, tie us faster to damnation, and keepes us faster under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of sinne. Every new sinne takes away some part of the light of the understanding, and takes away some freedom of the will; it darkens the judgement more and more, and enthralls the will and affections, and bindes a man more and more to the just sentence of God: That as it is, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">Prov. 5.</note> 
                        <hi>the sinner is tied with the bonds of his owne sinnes:</hi> he is under the chaines of an habituated wicked course of life, as well as of the sinne of nature, which is the spring of all.</p>

the chaines, and bondage, vexed with our sinnes, we are at the same time in the chaines of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of conscience, the beginnings of Hell, and reserved to chaines of damnation, and death, world without end. It is another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of matter, our estate by nature, then it is usually taken for. If men had but a little su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall light, to see what condition they are in, till they get out into Christ Jesus, they would not continue a minute in that cursed estate.</p>

                        </note>And we have deserved to be cast into this estate, by reason that we left our subordination and dependance upon God; which being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, we should have had. Therefore we turning from God to the creature, God punisheth our rebellion to him, with rebellion in our selves; because we withdrew our subjection from him, that therefore there should be in us a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of the subjection of sinne, and of the whole soule to God. So this captivitie to, and giving up to sinne in us, it is penall, and sinfull; but as it comes from God, it is meerely judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. Therefore we have it oft in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. &amp; 2 <hi>Thess.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 2 Thess.</note> The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> because they would not entertaine the Truth that they might have had by the light of Nature, <hi>God gave them up to their sinnes.</hi> And then the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, after the Apostles times, they set slight by the good Word of God, the Gospel, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gave them up to beleeve lyes.</hi> It was sinne in them; but as God gave them up, it was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17819:183"/>
So this captivitie, and giving men up to their owne lusts, it is justice, as it comes from God, it is a horrible judgement; it is worse, then to be given up to the Devill himselfe: for by being given up to our lusts, we encrease our damnation. To be given up to be tormented of the Devill, it is not such a mischiefe, as this spirituall captivitie under sinne: we are guiltie our selves, of our owne thraldome. And this will encrease both the shame, and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The shame, that a man shall say in Hell afterward; I have brought my selfe hither, I had meanes enow, prohibitions enow; I had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chastisements of God, sometimes moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Spirit, sometimes one helpe from God, sometimes another: yet notwithstanding I brake through all oppositions that God set betweene me, and the execution of my lusts, and to Hell-ward I would; and hither I have brought my selfe. So that indeed, the greatest part of Hell torment, the shame of them espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it will be, that men have brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by their owne wits and carnall lusts, thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And indeed, all the wit a carnall man hath that is not sanctified by Gods Spirit, it is to worke himselfe to miserie, to be a drudge to his lusts; that sets all the parts he hath on work, not how he may serve God, and be happie in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world; but how he may proule &amp; provide for his owne carnall lusts.<note place="margin">

                        </note>The fearefulnesse and odiousnesse of this condition, to be in prison, and thraldome, and bondage to all kind of sinne, naturall &amp; actuall, it will appeare further by this; That being in subjection to our base lusts, by consequence we are under the bondage of Satan: for, he hath power over death, by sinne; because he drawes us to sinne, and then accuseth us, and torments us for sinne. By sinne, we come to be under his bondage; so that we are under the fearefull cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of the Devil, while we are under the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie of sinne: for, all the power that he hath over us, it is by sinne; he is but Gods executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner for sinne. First, God gives him power to draw us to sinne, to punish one sinne with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then he suffers him to accuse, and to torment us afterward. What a fearfull bondage is this, that being under sinne, we are under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan? We are servants to our enemie; as God threatned his people, that they should serve their <hi>enemies:</hi> but this is a greater judgement, to be slaves to this enemie. This is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every sinner. To be a slave to a mans enemie, it is a judgement of judgements: yet nothwithstanding, this is the case of every man by nature, he is a servant to his enemie, to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and his owne lusts. He is a right <hi>Cham, a servant of servants:</hi> for Satan useth him as the <hi>Philistims</hi> did <hi>Samson,</hi> he puts out his eyes, he puts out his judgement, his wits, he besots

him; and so he goes blind in Satans blind worke, and businesse: he is in a Maze all his life long, till at length he sinke into Hell. So this is the aggravation of a mans estate by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he is a slave to his enemie.

                     <p>But how chanceth it, that they doe not know and perceive it?</p>
                     <p>It is because he goeth with the streame of their owne corruptions.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Carnall men bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill would have them.</hi>
                        </note> Indeed we must make some limitation of this. In some cases, the Devill doth not move carnall men, they are better then the Devill would have them be for the good of the Common-wealth, and State; but yet take them as they stand in relation to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17819:185"/>
Religion, they may be devillish, secret, bitter, darke enemies to that. Though they may have strong heads for the good of the State, yet it is not from any intrinsecall good in themselves; but God useth them, and makes them doe that. For the Devill would have all naught; he is an enemie to the very Swine, therefore much more to the good of a State. Therefore there are many politike civill Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as we fee in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> which no question, is more then the Devill would have; he would not have civill men so good, he would not have them doe that they doe for the common good oft times: yet the Devill will be sure to be at one end of the good they doe, to taint them, that their aime shall not be good, it shall not be to the glory of God, it shall not be in reference to salvation.</p>
                     <p>And so as the good is temporall, they have a reward sutable to their desire, they care for no more: for they beleeve not Heaven, but in a generall notion; It may be there is such things, it may be not: therefore the good they doe, is some little pettie obedience; and what doe they desire? To be well esteemed, and respected; to be venerable, and to have honourable opinions in the hearts of men, that men may stoupe in their conceits to them as men of respect. This they deserve indeed, and this they have; God gives them that they would have. But as Christ tells the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises,</hi>
                        <pb n="13" facs="tcp:17819:185"/>
who did excellent good things, but it was to be <hi>seene of men,</hi> he tells them, <hi>they had their reward:</hi> they had all they looked for; for they were <hi>Atheists,</hi> they looked not for Heaven. So a man may say of all men that are out of the state of grace: though they doe more then the Devill would have them, and for diverse degrees of that they doe, they are not subject to the Devill; yet he taints their actions one way or other in the end, he joynes himselfe in the action first or last, he hath a hand in all their actions. So that notwithstanding there be many good things, yet this hinders not a whit, but that they may be under the power of the Devill: for it is but in reference to civill Government and State, which is but for a time: <hi>The fashion of this world passeth away</hi>; here will be no Magistrates to governe, nor no people to be governed, ere long.</p>
                     <p>I speake it, because many men are readie to propound such and such, to imitate them in their courses; and to say, I will be no more religious then he: when, perhaps, all may be but formalitie, and common graces for this world. God will honour some so much, to be instruments for common good here: but what is that to eternall salvation? He may be a slave to his lusts, and an enemie to the power of grace, for all that. Therefore, unlesse we see men wrought upon thorowly, to be of the mind of Christ, to have the Spirit of Christ, to judge of things as Christ
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17819:186"/>
judgeth, to judge the service of God, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his will, to be the best things, and to <hi>goe about doing good,</hi> and that with reference and obedience to God; all is nothing, else: A man may be under the bondage of his corruptions, and so by them to Satan.</p>

Our will was given us, to cleave to God, and the best things; to make choise of the best things, and to cleave to them undivided in life, and death, and for ever; and so by cleaving to things better then our selves, to advance our selves to a higher condition. For when the soule of man that is under better things, that is under God, and Christ, and doth cleave to God, and Christ, in his affections, and to the things of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life; these be things bettering a mans condition, even raysing the soule from its owne present estate, to a glorious condition.

A miserable condition, why? the more will a man hath in evill, the more miserable; for the more freely, and with lesse opposition hee tangleth himselfe, (let his place be never so great) the deeper he sinks in rebellion, and the deeper hee sinks into guilt upon guilt; which will all come to a recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, at the houre of death, and day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So the men that we admire, and envie most (out of simplenesse, and want of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) they are the most miserable creatures in the world; if they be out of Christ; and have not grace: for they have nature let loose in them, without restraint, and nature being under the captivitie of sinne, becomes <hi>out of measure sinfull,</hi> in such: The lesse a man is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed either from Lawes above him, or the Law within him, to check him, the more wretched man he is: for the deeper hee goes in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and sinne, the deeper his torment shall be afterward.</p>

naught. Those that shake off all bonds, any earthly priviledge and prerogative, is so farre from exempting them from misery, that it makes them more miserable: for unlesse they have grace to use those things that might be an advantage to better things, they sinke dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and deeper into sinne, and so into terrours of conscience, first or last; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to damnation: Oh, it is a fearefull condition, to be the greatest Monarch in the world, and not to be in Christ, and under the Law of <hi>the Spirit of life in Christ</hi>! they are the objects of pitty above all kinde of men, to truely judicious soules, that know out of Gods truth, and by the light of the Spirit, what is to be judged of the state of men.

As if anger and wrath, keepe a man in bondage, you shall have it in his countenance, his hand will be ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, his feet will be ready to carry him to revenge. If it be a proud heart that a man is kept under, you shall have it in his lookes, and expressions outward. If it be the base af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of lust, you shall have adultery in the eye, an unchast and uncircumcised eare, and filthy rotten language. Men you see upon all occasions are ready to execute the commands of these tyrannicall lusts, in some kinde or other. Therefore never talke of thy freedome, when lusts are raised up within thee, either ascending from thine owne corruption, or cast in by Satan, and so joyning with thy heart, presently thy tongue will speake wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly, and thine eyes, and lookes, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, shew that there is a naughty heart within, and the whole man is ready to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it, further then a man is curbed by Law, or respect to his reputation or the like, which is no thankes to him.

And as the body without the soule, is a noysome odious carcasse, offensive in the eyes of its dearest friends: so the soule without the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ, quickening and seasoning it, and putting a comelinesse and beautie upon it, it is odious. All the cloathes, and flowers

you put upon a dead body, cannot make it but a stinking carkasse: so all the morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and all the honours in this world put upon a man out of Christ, it makes him not a spirituall living soule: he is but a loathsome carrion a dead carkasse in the sight of God, and of all that have the Spirit of God: for hee is under death, he is starke, and stiffe, unable to stirre or moove to any duty whatsoever, he hath no sense, nor motion. Though such men live a common, naturall civill life, and walke up and downe, yet they are dead men to God, and to a better life. The world is full of dead men, that are dead while they are alive, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of the <hi>Widow that lives in pleasures.</hi> A fearefull estate, if we had Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eyes to see it, and thinke of it.</p>

under death? God gives us up to death. Why, are we under Satans government? he is Gods executioner, Gods serjeant, he gives us up to him here, because we offend him. Why are we under damnation and wrath? because God is offended. All our slavery comes ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from God; however it be sinfull in regard of Satan that keepes us; yet the power whereby he keepes us is good: for he doth it from God. His will is alwayes naught, but his power is alwayes lawfull: therefore the power whereby the Devill keepes us (if wee looke up to God, under whom the power is) it is a lawfull power: for God hath a hand in giving us up to finne, it is a judiciall giving up; and then by lusts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So if we speake of freedome, wee must not begin with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner: the wrath of God must be satisfied; God must be one with us, so as his Justice must have contentment. Satisfaction must be with the glory of his Justice, as well as of his Mercie: his Attributes must have full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, one must not be destroyed to satisfie another; hee must so be mercifull in freeing us, as that content must be given to his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, that it complaine not of any losse.

So the life of God is his being. <hi>As I live saith the Lord,</hi> that is, <hi>as I am God, I will not the death of a sinner.</hi> Now, Christ hath life in him as God, as the Father hath: but that is not espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially here meant.</p>

                        </note>There is life in Christ as God-man, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. Now, this life is that life, which is originally from the God-head: indeed it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17819:196"/>
but the God-heads quickening, and giving life to the man-hood in Christ; the Spirit quickning, and sanctifying the man-hood. And we have no comfort by the life of God, as it is in Gods life alone severed: for alas, what communion have wee with God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Mediator? but our comfort is this, that God, who is the fountaine of life, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man, and having satisfied Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, he conveyes life to us, he is our head, hee hath life in himselfe as God, to impart spirituall life to all his members; so there is life in Christ, as Mediator.</p>
                     <p>And there is a Spirit of life; that life it is a working life: for spirit is an emphaticall word; spirit added to a thing, increased the thing. Againe, he saith, <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life. Law,</hi> is a commanding thing; to shew that the life in Christ, it is a commanding life, it countermands all opposite lives what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, of sinne, and death; and this Law is a countermand to all other Lawes; <hi>the Law of the Spirit of life</hi> frees us from all other Lawes. So here is life, the Spirit of life, and the Law of the Spirit of life; all words of strong signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>But for the cleare understanding of this sweet and comfortable point: First, consider how the Law of the Spirit of life is in Christ, what it doth in him; and then how it is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively in us.</p>

whatsoever is done to us, is done to Christ first, and whatsoever wee have, Christ hath it first. Therefore life is first in Christ, and then in us; Resurrection, first in Christ, and then in us; Sonne-ship, first in Christ, and then in us; Justification from our sins, first in Christ, (he is freed from our sinnes) and then in us: Ascension first in Christ, and then in us: Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in heaven first in Christ, and then in us. We have nothing in us, but it is derived from Christ: therefore this being layd as a ground, we must consider how the Spirit of life works in Christ, what it doth in Christ; and then what it doth as it is in us: for whatsoever Christ hath, it is not onely for himselfe, but for us.</p>

it was to sanctifie, and quicken that blessed masse, that he tooke upon him.</p>

And this the Spirit of life did to <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, to his humane nature that he tooke upon him, that hee might be a publicke Person. For God the second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, tooke not upon him any mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar person, of <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Iohn:</hi> for then there should have beene distinct persons, one person should have dyed, and another rise: but hee tooke our nature into his Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that the same Person that did dye was God, though he dyed in our nature; that he might be a publicke Person.

Therefore the Law of the Spirit of life workes faith in me, to knit me to <hi>Christ,</hi> to make me beleeve, that all that hee hath done is mine: and the same power that raised <hi>Christ</hi> from the dead, workes the power of faith, and application: For wee must not thinke, that it is an easie thing for a carnall man to beleeve, to goe out of himselfe, that it is salvation enough to have salvation, by the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:17819:201"/>
obedience of another man: No; both in the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> and <hi>Colossians,</hi> in divers places, it is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> phrase, that the <hi>same power that raised Christ from the dead,</hi> must raise our hearts, and worke faith in them. For as the good things that faith layes hold on, are wondrous good things, even above admiration almost: that poore flesh and blood, a piece of earth, should be an heire of heaven, a member of <hi>Christ,</hi> that it should be above Angels in dignity; as the things are superexcellent things, even above admiration (in a manner:) so the grace that beleeves these things, it is a strange and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and admirable grace, that is faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith must be wrought by the Law of the Spirit of <hi>Christ</hi>; by the ministery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell. This is the grace of application, when a man goes out of himselfe; when he sees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe first in bondage to his corruptions, to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and to death: and then sees the excellent way that God hath wrought in <hi>Christ,</hi> to bring him out of that cursed estate: then hee hath by the Spirit of life faith wrought in him. And indeed the same power, and Spirit that quickened <hi>Christ</hi> from the dead, must quicken our hearts to beleeve in <hi>Christ.</hi> It is a miracle to bring the heart of man to beleeve.

Faith is said to save us: you know it is <hi>Christ</hi> that saves us: but faith layes hold on <hi>Christ,</hi> that saves us: faith purgeth the heart, and overcomes the world: <hi>Christ</hi> by his Spirit doth all this: but because faith wrought by the Spirit, is such a grace, as layes hold on the power of <hi>Christ,</hi> it goes out of it selfe to <hi>Christ</hi>: therefore what <hi>Christ</hi> doth, faith is said to doe. So then the Law of the Spirit of life in <hi>Christ,</hi> not onely freed <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe, by his Resurrection: but likewise by the same power, whereby hee raysed himselfe, he rayseth our hearts to beleeve what hee hath done, both in his state of humiliation, and exaltation, and makes all that <hi>Christ</hi> did ours.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17819:202"/>
I am a slave to sinne and damnation? the Word of God can judge better then my selfe, and then the Spirit of God sets it on with conviction, that undoubtedly this is true. And together, with the cursed kingdome and slavery that I am under, there is discovered a better state in <hi>Christ</hi>: for the Gospel tells us what we are in <hi>Christ</hi>; freed from hell, and death, and heires of heaven: oh the happy estate of a Christian to be in <hi>Christ</hi>! The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, with the Spirit discovering this, a man is called out of the cursed estate he is in by nature, to the fellow-ship of <hi>Christ,</hi> by faith, which is wrought in this calling: so that now he comes to be a member of <hi>Christ</hi> by faith, so that whatsoever <hi>Christ</hi> hath, or is, or hath done or suffered, it is mine by reason of this union with him by faith, which is the grace of union that knits us to <hi>Christ,</hi> and the first grace of application. So there is the first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of liberty, and freedome wrought by the Spirit of God, together with the Gospel in effectuall calling.</p>

For when the Gospel (in effectuall calling) discovers, that <hi>Christ</hi> is such a one, and that there is such an estate in <hi>Christ</hi>; and there is faith wrought in me: then that faith layes hold upon the obedience of <hi>Christ</hi> to be mine. For <hi>Christ</hi> in the Gospel offers his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

to be mine, as if I had done it in mine own person; whatsoever <hi>Christ</hi> did or suffered is mine: for he is made of God, to be <hi>Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, righteousnesse, sanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> to be all in all; the Gospell sets him forth to be so. Now faith laying hold of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be made of God all in all, obedience, <hi>righteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> whatsoever is needfull, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this faith justifies me, hereupon I come to be free from the guilt of my sinnes, because my sinnes were laid upon <hi>Christ, Christs</hi> death, was the death of a surety; it was as if I had dyed my selfe, and more firme; thus I come to be free in justification: for what my surety hath done, I have done.</p>

It is one thing to be freed from sinne, and death, and another thing to be freed from the <hi>law</hi> of them: for wee are not indeed freed from sinne, and death, but from the law of sinne, and death; that is, from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of sinne; that though sinne be in us; yet it doth not condemne us: and though we die, yet the sting is pulled out, death is but a passage to a better life. So I say in Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee are freed from the condemning power of sinne, and in sanctification, from the commanding power of sinne. When we are knit once to <hi>Christ,</hi> we have the obedience of <hi>Christ,</hi> ours in justification: and the holinesse of <hi>Christ</hi> is derived to us, as from the head to the members in sanctification, and so we are freed from the law of sin. To understand this a little better, the same Spirit that sanctified the naturall body, the humane nature of <hi>Christ,</hi> wherby he <hi>became bone of our bone, and flesh of our flesh:</hi> the same Spirit doth sanctifie the mysticall body of <hi>Christ,</hi> that it may be <hi>bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh.</hi> For before wee come to heaven, <hi>Christ</hi> must not onely <hi>be bone of our bone, &amp;c.</hi> that is, in his Incarnation, but wee must be <hi>bone of his bone, &amp;c.</hi> that is, wee must have natures like <hi>Christ,</hi> not onely flesh and blood; for (so a reprobate hath flesh and blood, as <hi>Christ</hi> hath) but wee must have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17819:204"/>
his Spirit altering and changing our nature, that instead of a proud, disobedient, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious nature, now it must be a holy and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and meeke nature; (together with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, for that we carry about with us;) then the Spirit of life derived from <hi>Christ,</hi> makes us <hi>bone of his bone.</hi> For indeed, in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, being <hi>bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh,</hi> hee made us <hi>bone of his bone,</hi> and <hi>flesh of his flesh:</hi> he became man, that we might partake of the divine nature, being partakers of the divine Spirit. So that now the Spirit of life in <hi>Christ,</hi> when we are knit to him, is a Spirit of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, altering our natures, and working in our hearts a disposition like <hi>Christs</hi>; that wee judge, as <hi>Christ</hi> judgeth, and chuse, as <hi>Christ</hi> chuseth, and ayme at Gods glory as <hi>Christ</hi> did.

                        <hi>My flesh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed:</hi> and hee calls his body broken, <hi>the bread of life,</hi> Why? because it was the body of the Sonne of God, <hi>who is life, Iob</hi> 6. All life comes from God. Now <hi>Christ</hi> taking our nature upon him, his death is a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning death: and by reason of the union with the divine nature, now, it is the body of God broken, and the blood of God shed for us, (there is our comfort,) and hee was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be so by his Resurrection, that decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was God, and that hee was freed from our sinnes. Powerfull must that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour needs be, that was so strong in his very death, when his very body was broken, and his blood let out: then hee did worke the foundation of all comfort: for then hee satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the wrath of God. <hi>Christ</hi> was strongest when hee was weakest. The Resurrection was but a declaration of the worth of that hee had done.) Now, in the Sacrament wee have Communion with <hi>Christ</hi> dying, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, as his body is broken, and his blood shed: for that is the foundation of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by his Resurrection.

So the reason why God the Father, Sonne, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost, are with us; it is because <hi>Christ,</hi> the second Person, God and man, is with us: or else there could be no such sweet termes as these are: you see how it is founded. <hi>Christ</hi> took our nature, and advanced and inriched it.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17819:217"/>
world, to flesh and blood, that such persons, should prevayle over such enemies, by such weake meanes as they doe, in this respect, they are more then conquerours. So he may say, <hi>Who can be against us?</hi> that is, to have their wills, to overthrow the cause of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the courage of Gods children; they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayle in this, or that particular, but at the last, all their plots, and counsels, shall proove abortive, and bring forth a lie. All is but to magnifie Gods power the more, in letting them goe so farre: and then to dash all their molds, and plots. Gods children, they have the Devill and all his company, the world, and the flesh: but there is God the Father, Sonne, and Holy-Ghost, for them, the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Trinity, that are able to blow away the other three, and all the strength, and support they have whatsoever.</p>

There is a strange confidence which is seated in the hearts of Gods children that they dare, thus dare hell, and earth, and all infernall powers, they set God so high in their hearts, that they dare
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:17819:217"/>
say with a spirit of confidence, <hi>Who shall be against us?</hi> The meaning is, not, who shall be against us, to take away our lives or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, &amp;c. As the speech is, they may kill us, but they cannot hurt us: the worst they can doe is to send us to heaven, and make us partakers of that we desire most. First wee desire that God will be with us here; and secondly, that we may be with God in heaven: they make Gods children partakers of their desires, by killing of them. Let Tyrants, and all persons, that have a malignant disposition to the Church of God, and are armed with power, let them doe their worst, the cause must stand impregnable; <hi>Christ</hi> will have a Church, and Kingdome in the world, and their spirits will be impregnable against them: they may kill them, but they cannot hurt them; they may kill them, but they cannot kill their courage. As we see in the Martyres, there was the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in them, above all the dealings of of the persecutors: there was a fire of Gods Spirit in them, above all outward fire whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.

Therefore you see every way the state of a Christian is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious condition, <hi>Who can be against us?</hi> You see the state of Gods people, it is an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and glorious condition.<note place="margin">

The world accounts them as wormes, and they account themselves so, they are trodden on as wormes; they are wormes upon earth, yet they have a glorious head in heaven, and a glorious guard about them, strange things agree in a Christian: therefore let us not stumble, though wee see not these things presently, the life of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a mysterie.</p>

                        </note> hence we see that a Christian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; to be a sound Christian, to have true faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> to be one with <hi>Christ,</hi> and to be taken out of the state of nature, this condition and the happinesse of it, it hath the strongest foundation of any life in the world. Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is founded upon the strongest and the greatest reasons that can bee: Faith stands with the greatest reason, that a thing can doe. Why? The comfort of a Christian is that he hath no enemy that shall prevaile over him, and what is the ground of that? God is with him, God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17819:219"/>
Faith is that that layes hold upon that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and promise, and covenant of God, and is not faith well bottomed? A Christian that carries himselfe valiantly and couragiously, is not his course grounded on sound reason? Is not God with him? God the Father, is his father; God the Son is his Redeemer; God the Holy Ghost, is his Comforter. There is no other men that have strong reason for their course, for that choise that they make of their Religion and of their wayes, they prove but fooles in the conclusion: onely the sound Christian that by the Spirit of God hath his eyes open to see the cursed estate he is in by nature, and what it is to be in Christ, and by a Spirit of faith is made one with Christ, hee is the truely wise man in his faith and affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that the world mockes at, that hee hath no common supports in the world, which hee cares not for, if God be on his side, hee cares not what man can doe against him, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 118. you see on what ground it is founded:<note place="margin">Psal. 118.</note> God is with him, and none can be against him.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17819:219"/>
in the conclusion. Let us build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rocke, to be well bottomed, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that our principles and grounds bee strong, and that they be so to us; for what if God be with his, if he be not so to us? Let us labour to lay up sound grounds. Grounds have influence into the whole course of our lives; this one Text hath influence into all the parts of our lives, in doing, in suffering, in all conditions. I know not a more preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant fruitfull principle in the Scripture than this, <hi>If God be with us, who can be against us</hi>? It is like a pearle, little in quantity, few in words; but strong in sence, large in the fruit that is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues from it. Therefore as wee may carry pearles or precious things wheresoever we go, because there is a great deale of worth in them, and they be small in quantity: so wee may carry this principle with us, let us bee sure to lay it up, and make use of it. There be these two, <hi>That there is a God,</hi> and <hi>that God is with his children,</hi> and so with his children, that hee will subvert and overthrow all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and all their plots and endevours; a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of wonderfull comfort.</p>

                        </gap>oyle: why? here is the principle, God is with us, there is no power can resist God; for then God should withstand himselfe: the power that the creature hath, it is but a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed power; and if by a borrowed power it should withstand Gods purpose, God must be against himselfe, his Kingdome must bee divided, which is a contradiction. Therefore this is the ground of the courage of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian in all conditions. What is the reason that the Scripture hath that phrase so often, <hi>Feare not, I am with thee</hi>; as to <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and the rest? because it is the ground of all courage. We see weaker creatures than man, a Dogge in the sight of his master, hee will fight couragiously, because he hath a superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our nature by him, that he thinkes will backe him: And shall not a Christian when he hath layd up this principle, that God is with him, God incarnate, God in his nature, when he is a member of God (as it were) of that person that is God, shall he not be couragious when he hath him to looke upon him, and to backe him?</p>
                     <p>And if God be with us, hee is not so with us as to neglect us, he is so with us, as he hath
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17819:220"/>
interest in the cause we have, and in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, hee is with us as one with us, nay as in us by his Spirit, and whosoever toucheth us toucheth the apple of his eye. <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> Here is ground of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in whatsoever may befall us, to stand it out in all conditions whatsoever. Nothing can sever <hi>Christ</hi> and a Christian: this bodie will never be beheaded: <hi>Christ</hi> will never bee separated from his body, hee will not loose the poorest member he hath. You see it is the duty of a Christian to be couragious, and undaunted in the cause of God, and from this ground, because God is with him, and who can be against him? Let all the world bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, and against the cause that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian professeth, they doe but kicke against the prickes, they dash against a rocke, as the waves that breake themselves, they doe not hurt the rock a whit, they doe but cast stones upward that fall upon their heads againe. Therefore it is a desperate cause that malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirits manage, who have more parts then grace, and arme themselves and their wits to hurt the people and Church of God, and slander his cause, and doe all the hurt they can.</p>

And wee ought not to forget this, but upon occasion of this great deliverance, to call all former deliverances to minde, nationall, and personall, to consider how often God hath given us our lives, and how oft he hath pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

none hath beene against us.</hi> If God had not been with us in the Powder-plot, where had wee beene? Our lives would have beene made a prey, that that would have beene done, would have beene more then the blowing up of the Parliament; they would have blowne up the Kingdome with the King, and Religion with religious persons, and the State with States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: It would have brought a confusion of all, and have molded all after an Idolatrous Antichristian fashion, it would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne the State, and persons and all; the issues would have been worse than the present thing: And therefore if God had not beene with us, as hee was graciously with us, what would have become of us?<note place="margin">Psal. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Have not wee cause to blesse God, and to be thankefull? therefore let us labour to doe it for our selves, and for our neighbours. How shall we shew our thankfulnesse to God? not in outvvard manifestations onely, vvhich is laudable, and a good demonstration of the affections of people: but alas what is that? wee must shew our thankfulnesse in loving that Religion that <hi>God</hi> hath so witnessed for, and defended so miraculously: Labour to love the truth, to entertaine it in the love of it, and to bring our hearts to a more perfect hatred of Popery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if wee waxe cold and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:17819:226"/>
indifferent, or oppose Gods cause, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, doe wee think that God would suffer this long, would hee not spue us out of his mouth? (with reverence I speake it.) Though hee have defended us againe and againe, hee will be gone with his truth and religion: It came not alone, nor it will not goe alone; if Religion goe, our peace, and prosperity, and the flourishing of our state; all will goe. It is our Arke, if that goe away, our happinesse goes away, let us make much of Religion, that is the way to be thankfull.</p>
                     <p>Againe, let us shew our thankfulnesse by giving and doing some good to the poore, by refreshing their bowels, that they may have occasion to blesse God.</p>
                     <p>And for the time to come, let us trust in God, that God will bee with us, if wee bee with him; and to sticke to him: who then shall bee against us? Let the Devill, and <hi>Rome,</hi> and Hell, bee all against us, if God bee with us. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> goes about to prove <hi>Luther</hi> a false Prophet. <hi>Luther</hi> as hee was a couragious man, and had a great and mighty spirit of Faith, and prayer: so his expressions were sutable to his spirit: what saith he? The cause that I defend, is <hi>Christs,</hi> and Gods cause, and all the world shall not stand against it, it shall prevaile; if there be a counsell in earth, there is a counsell in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that will disappoint all. God laughes in Heaven at his enemies, and shall wee weepe?
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:17819:226"/>
And things are in a good way, if wee can goe on, and helpe the cause of God with our prayers, and faith that God will goe on; and with our cheerefulnesse and joy, that God may delight to goe on with his owne cause. We may encourage our selves; though perhaps wee shall not see the issue of these things, yet po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity shall see it.</p>

                  <p>The Church is sometime compared to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for weakenesse; sometimes to a wife, for faithfulnesse to her Husband and <hi>Christ</hi>; sometimes to a Bride; because she is contracted to <hi>Christ</hi> in this world; sometimes to a mother for her fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse; sometimes to a Virgin, for her chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: here to a Bride, because this life is but the time of Contract; but the consummation of the marriage shall be in heaven. Now this contract between the Church and <hi>Christ,</hi> and betweene every particular soule and <hi>Christ</hi>: for both are the bride of <hi>Christ.</hi> Even as it is the same soule that is in the little finger, and in all the whole
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:17819:230"/>
body, the same soule enlivens both: so it is the same Spirit in the Bride in generall, and in every particular Christian, therfore the Bride is both every particular Christian, &amp; the whole Church. Now the contract that is made betweene the soule, and between the Church &amp; <hi>Christ,</hi> it is by the Spirit of God which knits the soule to <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> to the soule. And for this end that <hi>Christ</hi> might be a Husband, and contract this Bride to himselfe in our nature, he married our nature, that he might marry our persons.</p>
                  <p>There is a three-fold degree of union.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>An union of Nature.</item>

                     <item>An union of Glory.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>The union of nature was, then <hi>Christ</hi> tooke our nature upon him. The union of grace, is when we take his nature, when wee partake of the divine nature: The union of glory is when we shall all be in heaven. The first is, for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and the second for the third. <hi>Christ</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>bone of our bone,</hi> in nature, that we might be <hi>bone of his bone,</hi> with him in grace, and so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one with him in glory. We see the Bride that is the Person. Here I might take occasion to speak of the sweet comfort that issues from this, that the second Person in the Trinity should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie us so much, as to take us to unity, with, and contract us to himselfe; but I will not speak much of this point, having spoken more at large of it out of the Canticles.<note place="margin">Can. 5.</note>

Take the comparison from a wife, a spouse, she heartily desires the comming home of her husband: yet perhaps sometimes things may not be in so good order, as to wish that he were here now; nay, I have not yet prepared.

from whence it comes: so it is impossible that our desires should rise higher then the spring from whence they come; the desires of nature cannot goe higher then nature; the desires of the flesh are fleshly: but spirituall desires, as they spring from heaven, (they have a noble originall, and head) so they carry to heaven againe. Therefore as the Spirit comes from God the Father and the Sonne; so it carries us backe againe to the Father, and the Sonne; as it comes from heaven, so it carries to heaven back againe. That is one way to know whether our desires be spirituall or no; our desire of death, and of the comming of <hi>Christ,</hi> if it be from wearisomnesse of life, and from afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the world, so nature may desire. I were better be dead then to be thus; as <hi>Ionas</hi> wished death, and the children of Israel, and <hi>Elias</hi> in a passion; oh that I were dead, &amp;c. but if those desires spring from the Spirit, then they come from heaven: from the consideration of the excellency of the state wee shall have there, that it shall be better with us, and that death is but a darke passage to a glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. We may know our desires are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all from the rise of them, if they come from spirituall, and holy, and heavenly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: the Spirit doth all in the Spouse that is holy and Spirituall.</p>

in spirituall Ordinances. The preaching of Gods holy Word, (though it be meanely esteemed by the world) <hi>it is the Ministerie of the Spirit</hi>; in the hearing of it, the Spirit is given: if we would have the Spirit, let us attend upon the Ministerie of the Spirit. And let us study <hi>Christ,</hi> and make him all in all. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions with the <hi>Galathians,</hi> saith hee, I would know of you, <hi>how came ye by the Spirit? by hearing of Christs Gospel, or of the Law preached?</hi> No, it was by the Gospel: so that not onely the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie in generall, but the Evangelicall Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie that unfolds <hi>Christ,</hi> and the infinite love of God in <hi>Christ,</hi> the excellent condition we have in this world, and look for in the world to come: the Spirit is effectuall with these thoughts to make us holy and heavenly. The Law beats downe; but the Gospel, especially these Evangelicall truths make us spirituall. Therefore wee should be willing to heare spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall points.

Onely let us attend upon the meanes, and Ordinances, that hee hath left in his Church. And let us consider wee are not for this life, we are not to live here alway: the child in the wombe is not for that life, and when it is in the world, it is not for this life,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17819:242"/>
there is a third life that we are for. An imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect state rests not till it come to perfection: our best is behind: let those that are naught, feare the second comming of <hi>Christ.</hi> Let <hi>Herod,</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the beast of <hi>Rome</hi> feare, that shall <hi>be cast into the burning lake.</hi> Let <hi>Felix</hi> tremble, the corrupt Judge, and all that live in corrupt courses. But wee that professe our selves to be Christians, and hope for better things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, let us labour to banish base feares: and to this end, let us labour to be spirituall, and not to be lead by the flesh, <hi>Whosoever is Christs, hath the Spirit of Christ, or else he is none of his,</hi> as it is sweetly, and largely, and heavenly prooved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.

                  <p>Before I come to the words, it is not
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:17819:245"/>
amisse, briefly to touch these points, to make way to that I am to deliver.</p>
                  <p>First of all that,</p>

                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gods children exercised with conflicts.</hi>
                     </note>Gods dearest children are exercised with sharp spirituall conflicts.</p>
                  <p>God suffers their very faith in principles sometimes to be shaken. What is more cleare than Gods providence? not the noone day: yet God suffers sometimes his owne children to be exercised with conflicts in this kind, to doubt of principles written in the book of God (as it were) with a Sun-beame; that have a lustre in themselves. There is nothing more cleare, than that God hath a particular spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence over his; yet Gods wayes are so unsearchable, and deep, that hee doth spiritually exercise his children; hee suffers them to bee exercised, as you see here, hee comes out of a conflict: <hi>but it is good for mee to draw neere to God.</hi> I will but touch it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will extend it only to Gods people, that (if by reason of the remainders of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, God suffer their rebellious hearts to cast myre, and dirt, to cast in objections that are odious to the spirituall man, that part that is good) they may not be cast down too much, and dejected. It is no otherwise with them, than it hath beene with Gods deare children; as we see in <hi>Ieremie, Habakuk,</hi> and others. It is a cleare truth; I only poynt at it, that we might have it ready, to comfort our selves when such things rise in our soules;
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17819:245"/>
it is no otherwise with us, than it hath beene with other of Gods deare children.</p>
                  <p>The second poynt is, that,
Gods children when they are in this conflict they recover themselves.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gods children recover <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </p>

nature that the will followes the last designe of the understanding; that which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding saith is to be done, here, and now all circumstances considered it is best, that the Will chuseth, and that a man doth: for the Will rules, and leads the outward man. Now where there is a heavenly conviction of the understanding of any particular thing, this at this time is good, all things considered; and weighed in the ballance, on the one side, and on the other; where this is, there comes in practise, and drawing near to God alway. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is when a man is set down, so that he cannot gainsay nor will not, but fals to practice presently: then a man is convinced of a thing. That which is immediatly before practise, and leads to practise, it is conviction; Now there are these foure things in conviction.<note place="margin">4. <hi>Things in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There is first truth, a man must know that such a thing is true. Then it must not only be a truth, but a good truth; as the Gospell is said to be <hi>the good word of God,</hi> and <hi>it is a true, and a faithfull saying.</hi> It is a true saying, <hi>that Christ came to save sinners</hi>; and it is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, a good saying. If it bee not good as well as true; truth doth not draw to practice as it is truth, but as it is good.</p>
                     <p>As it must be truth, and a good truth, so it must be good for me, as the holy man saith here, <hi>It is good for me, &amp;c.</hi> A thing may bee good for another man; the Divell knowes what is good; and that makes him envy
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:17819:254"/>
poore Christians so; wicked men know that which is good, when they sinne against the holy Hhost; but for them it is better to keep in the contrary: so that we must know it is a truth, and a good truth, and good for us in particular, that it is best for us to do so.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is this, though it be true, and good, and good for us; yet before we can come to practise, it must be a good that is compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, better than other things that are presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or else no action will follow. A man must be able to say, this is better than that. A weak man that is led with passions, and lusts, he oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times sees the truth of things, and sees they are good, and good for me, and wishes that he could take such a course: but such is the strength of his passions at this time that it is better to do thus, it is better to yeeld to his lusts, and he trusts that God will be mercifull, and he shall recover it afterwards. These foure things, therefore must bee in conviction, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee can take the best course; and these are all here in this holy man: for he saw it was a truth, a duty, and likewise that it was a good truth: for to bee neare to God the fountaine of good, it must needs be good: And then it was good for him to be so: nay it was good, all things considered: for it is a Conclusion (as it were) brought out of the fire, out of a conflict; Nay say the flesh, and say all the world what it can to the contrary, <hi>It is good for me to draw neare to God,</hi> he brings it in as a
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17819:254"/>
triumphant Conclusion. Put drawing neare to God in one ballance, and lay in that bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance all the inconveniences that may fallow drawing neare to God; the displeasure of great ones, the losse of any earthly advantage; and lay in the other ballance all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that keep men from drawing neare to God: as if a man do not keep a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, he may please this or that man, hee may get riches, and advance himselfe, and better his estate; consider all that can bee, yet notwithstanding, it is better to draw neare to God, with all the disadvantages that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that course, than to take the contrary: Thus you see the truth cleare, that conviction is the way, and foundation of practice.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we should labour by all meanes to be convinced of the best things.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vse. To labour for conviction.</hi>
                        </note> It is not sufficient to have a generall notion, and slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to heare of good things: no, wee must beg the spirit of God that hee would seale, and set them upon our soules, and so strongly set, and seale them there, that when other things are presented to the contrary, with all the advantages, and colours, and glosses that flesh and blood can set upon them: yet out of the strength of spirtuall judgement wee may bee able to judge of the best things out of a spirituall conviction, and to say it is best to cleave to God. So said the blessed man of God <hi>Moses,</hi> there was in the one end of the ballance, the pleasures of sinne,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:17819:255"/>
the honours of a Court, there was all that earth could afford: for if it bee not to bee had in a Princes Court, where is it to bee had? his place was more than ordinary, hee was accounted the sonne of <hi>Pharoh's</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: yet lay all that in the ballance; and in the other part of the ballance, to draw neare to Gods people; though the people of God were a base, fore-lorne, despised, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted people at that time: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to draw neare to the cause of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the disgraced cause of Religion, to draw neare to God when hee is disgraced in the world (it is easie to draw neare to God when there is no opposition) but to draw neare to Gods part, and side, when it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced in the world, <hi>Moses</hi> saw it the best end of the ballance, put in the afflictions, and disgrace of Gods people, or what you will. So it was with <hi>Abraham</hi> when hee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed God (as it were) blind-fold, and left all, his fathers house, and the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had there. So it was with our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Disciples, they left all to follow Christ: they were convinced of this; surely we shall get more good by the company of Christ, than by those things that we leave for him.</p>

                        </note>Let us labour therefore to be convinced of the excellency of spirituall things, &amp; then spirituall practice will follow. And undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly the reason of the prophane conversation of the world, it comes from hidden athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:17819:255"/>
that men make no better choyce than they do, that they draw not neare to God; let them say what they will, it proceeds from hence. I prove it thus; when men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of good things, they will do good: for conviction is the ground of practise, and when men do not take good courses, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not convinced of the best things. Therefore men that sweare, and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, that are carnall bruit persons, at that time Atheisme rules in their hearts; that they beleeve not these things in the book of God to be true. Can the swearer beleeve that <hi>God will not hold him guiltlesse that takes his name in vaine: that a curse shall follow the swearer?</hi> and the whoremonger, <hi>that whoremongers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers God will judge?</hi> and so the covetous, and extortioners, (they that raise themselves by ill means) <hi>shall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> can men beleeve this, and live in the practise of these sinnes? (if they did beleeve these things indeed, as the word of God sets them downe, if they did beleeve that sin were so bitter, and so soule a thing as the word of God makes it) certainly they would not: therefore it comes from a hidden Atheisme. Indeed there is a bundle of Atheisme, and infidelity in the heart of man, and we cannot bewaile it too much: In the best there are some remainders of it: as this holy man, <hi>so foolish was I, and as a beast before thee,</hi> when he thought of his doubting of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17819:256"/>
Therefore considering that the cause of all ill practise, is that we are not spiritually convinced of the contrary, that sinne is a naughty, and bitter thing; nor are wee suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convinced of the best things, let us labour more and more to be soundly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of these things—</p>

                  <p>THe words are part of a Sermon of blessed Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> wherein he proves out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. that <hi>David</hi> prophesied of Christ, and not of himselfe. <hi>David</hi> saw cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but hee of whom <hi>David</hi> spake, saw no Corruption: therefore <hi>David</hi> was not the Messias.

                  <p>That which was spoken, and fore-told of Christ in the old Testament; and fulfilled in the New, that must needs bee true. Christ is the true Messias; why?

For the old, and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make up but this syllogisme: He that should be so, and so as was prophesied: Born of a Virgin; that should come at such a time in the later end of <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks &amp;c. he is the true Messias: But Christ was such a one, hee was borne of a Virgin, came at such a time, he saw no corruption: for hee rose the third day: therefore Christ is the true Messias.</p>

                  <p>Mark here the language of the holy Ghost,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Savoury lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     </note> the language of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When hee speaks of a good man, hee speaks of him in savorie termes: he doth not say that <hi>David</hi> after hee had been so long, or lived so long, or reigned, and flourished so long: (as wee see in stories such a man lived, or reigned, &amp;c. so long and then died:) yet this had beene true, after hee had lived, and reigned so long hee died. But that is not the language of the holy Ghost; but after hee had served God so long. The Scripture values men by that that God values
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:17819:261"/>
them, and not as men do, by their life, and reign, and flourishing in the world, and their esteem with men, but as his carriage hath been to God. <hi>David</hi> served the will of God in his generation.</p>
                  <p>And then when he speaks of his death, <hi>he fell asleep</hi> he sweetens the harsh name of death, with a sweet term the Scripture puts upon it. It is a comfortable thing to consider the very language of the Scripture, how savoury and heavenly it is, raising us up to comfortable and heavenly thoughts, even from the very manner of the phrase. Different (as I said) is the phrase of Scripture from other histories, that say, such a man lived, and reigned so long, and then he died. And indeed a man may say of a wicked man, he was so long in the world, but if he did no good, a man can scarce say that he lived: for what is life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing good, but a meer being in the world? Or if his life be ill, we may say, such a man troubled the world so many years, &amp; then went to his own place, as it is said of <hi>Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This I observe from the very language or phrase: <hi>David when he had served the will (or counsell) of God</hi> as the Word is.</p>
                  <p>Again in the third place observe this in generall, that God sets down <hi>David</hi> here

But <hi>David</hi> after he had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God in his generation, &amp;c. The spirit of God in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> passeth by all that was amisse, and sets down that which is good; to shew us this comfortable point,<note place="margin">

                     </note> that God va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues those that are in Christ, (and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of their sinnes) not by what they have been, or have done at some time: but by what they are, and what they resolve to be.</p>
                  <p>God values them by their better part, by that that is his in them, by that that is spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in them. He iudgeth them by the tenour of their lives, and not by a particular flaw in their lives. This is Gods infinite mercy, when he pardons, he pardons absolutely, he forgets as well as forgives: therefore the phrase of Scripture runs, <hi>He will cast our sins behinde his back, &amp; cast them into the bottome of the sea, that they shall never rise up in remembrance.</hi> When we have once repented of our sinnes, they are to him as if they had never been done; they are as things forgotten. <hi>Peter,</hi> after his foul fall, he was not so much as upbraided by Christ in particular, Thou hast denied me, &amp;c.

                     </hi> he tels him not, thou hast betrayed me thus and thus: no, he doth not so much as upbraid him with the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. So curious is God for troubling the peace of his people, that when they have soundly repented of their sins, they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hear of it to their confusion, nor at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to better them, and to perfect the work of humiliation.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to the fashion of the corrupt poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonfull nature of man: if they have but one thing (in all a mans life) to hit him in the teeth with, he shall be sure to hear of it oft enough, and passe by whatsoever is good in him. God doth not so with his children, but though they have some breaches in their lives, he passeth by them, and takes notice of that which is good in them; as we see here the Apostle doth, being directed by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.</p>
                  <p>But though God so sweetly passe by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> faults when he mentions him, &amp; cals him a man after his own heart, &amp;c. yet there is one thing that God puts in as a scarre upon <hi>David</hi>

Let no man therefore presume upon this that God will iudge him by the tenour of his life; and therefore hee will commit particular enormities: oh no! it cost <hi>David</hi> deare: for besides his heart-smart in his owne particular (God made his heart bleed, it cost him many a salt tear, besides that) it was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in his posteritie: God raysed up his own bowels to take armes against him; hee made him wish a thousand times that he had not so offended God. It is ill trying conclusions with God; though God afterwards pardon

us, and turne all to good; yet it shall cost us deare first. Though God will bring us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: yet if we will venture upon sinnes against conscience, and take libertie to offend God, he will take sharp courses with us, yet it shall not preiudice our salvation; you see those sins of <hi>David</hi> after he had repented &amp; was corrected for them, they were forgotten, and <hi>David</hi> (in regard of the course of his life) served God; his life was a service of God notwithstanding some particular actions. These things may be usefull to the best of us all: therefore I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them in generall from Gods manner of mentioning <hi>David</hi> here with honour; and passing by his infirmities.

                     <p>THe words are a short Epitome of the life and death of the blessed man <hi>David</hi> First, I will speak of his life, and then of his death. In his life there are these two parts:</p>

                     <p>And then the manner of his carriage in that time of his generation, It was a service of God, <hi>He served God.</hi>

therefore the succession of men from one to another, is called Generation.</p>

A man shall have better, and more civill usage; hee shall see better carriage in a Pagan, than in many Christians that are not good under the meanes. There bee degrees of those that are naught; some God gives up to a prophane spirit in the middest of the means: a fearfull brand. Those that are bad now in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times of the Gospell, their sinnes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinnes: they are not damned sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for sinning, so much as for sinning against the meanes, for sinning against such light, for sinning in these times; Those that lived in darknesse they could do no better.

In this generation when the light of the Gospel hath so gloriously shined! what excuse can men have for their sinnes now? Certainly it shall agravate their damnation that they were children of darknesse in the middest of light: nothing will trouble their consciences so much as that they have offended against so many meanes, and so many helps as they had in the dayes they lived in.

It is a time to reap the comforts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at the houre of death; shall we defer to serve Gods will till we come to make our own will? and oft times it is forced what wee do then. No, wee must serve God all our time: <hi>David served God all his generation.</hi> To do a few good works at our death only; it is a swinish doing good: the swine will do good when he is dead; then there is profit of his flesh, though all his life hee were noysome. Those men that put off thus, they are rather swine than men; beastly men. God seldome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the good they do then, and it is a forced good; if they were not to die then, no good at all would be done: that they do, is because they can keep it no longer. It shewes they have no grace nor faith at all: for if there had beene faith to depend upon God, they would have done good before; but they think, I may come to misery my selfe, and I know not what distrustfull base thoughts; therefore they will do no good in their life-time. But wee must serve God in our generation, if wee will be saved. These things are of some use, and wee should not forget them; but I come to the service it selfe, which I shall a little more stand upon.</p>

                        </note> because it is secret. That which is a rule must bee manifest and open: therefore the revealed will of God that every one may see,<note place="margin">

                        </note> that is our rule. Wee may crosse Gods secret will and do well, and wee may serve it, and yet do ill. A Father may pray for his childs life, and may crosse the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will of God, and yet doth well; God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes bowels in Fathers. A wicked man may do according to Gods secret will, and yet sin: therefore that was not the rule of <hi>Davids</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, nor cannot be of ours. <hi>Secret things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God: but revealed things to us and our children,</hi> saith blessed <hi>Moses.</hi> The will of God as it is discovered must be the rule of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: A rule must be open, or else it is no rule.</p>
                     <p>Againe, the rule by which we must lead our lives it must bee infallible,<note n="2" place="margin">

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17819:273"/>
The Word of God is an infallible rule, it cannot deceive, because it is the Word of God: men wrote it indeed; but it was God that dictated it: the finger writes, but the head dictates: holy men wrote it according as they were guided be the holy Ghost. The will of any man cannot be the rule of any mans service, further than it is agreeable to the first rule, why? because it is subject to errour, and mistake. That which must be the constant rule of a mans life, it must not be as popish tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and the like; it must be infallible: now the word of God is so, it is infallible: a man may erre, and be a man, and a good man too: but God cannot erre, and be God; the word of God cannot bee false and bee the word of God, therefore it is an infallible rule.</p>
                     <p>When this is applied to any creature,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>The Grand lie in the Church of</hi> Rome.</note> it is a Grand lie, and the foundation of misery in that Church: this is the first lie in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; That the Church consisting of a company of men cannot erre: what a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible absurdity is this, to make the will of man the rule: that the Church cannot erre, that Popery cannot erre? though they erre egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously; they account rebellion service; and make traitors merit, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>But are our Tenents subject to such grosse things? No, we make the rule of obedience the infallible word of God, that cannot erre. To attribute that of that which cannot erre, to that which can erre, it is a horrible absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie:

There is a proportion between the rule, and all things that are to bee ruled by it; all things fall under the word of God to bee directed, and ruled by it: It gives direction to our thoughts, to our speeches, to our actions, in our callings; it gives direction to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, to Ministers, to Masters, to Servants, to all estates, and conditions, in life, in death. It is exceeding large as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>All things come to an end, but thy Commandements are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding large.</hi> It is a rule that extends to all things that are to bee ruled whatsoever: no other rule but Gods will doth so: for mens lawes, they have nothing to do with thoughts: thought is free for them.</p>

                        </note> It is an inflexible rule, it cannot bee bent to mens purposes; man would bring Gods will to his will; but it is the measure that measures all, and is measured by none: for we must not judge the word, the word must judge us. You have some presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous persons that will judge, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure at the word, but the word will bee too good for them, and judge them.

These are the maine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of that that must be a rule to judge our lives by. Now the word of God, is both knowne; and is not subject to errour any kind of way: and it is equall to all things that may fall under it; and it is authenticall, of credit for it selfe (let men say what they will,) it must rule, and not be ruled.

We ought to have reverent conceits of the Lawes: for they doe but bring Gods generalls to particulars, if they bee good Lawes: if they have not their derivation from Gods Lawes, they are naught; but if they backe that in any thing, they are nothing but a particular determining of the generall rules in Gods Word, to give every man his due, &amp;c. Therefore in many cases we may know what the Will of God is, by the good Lawes of the kingdome, which bind the Conscience to obedience.

It is Prudence, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to discerne of differences: now that grace of God is in some measure given to all his children: he makes them wise to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand their owne way. They are not so wise perhaps for other things, it is not their way.

God gives e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of his a Spirit, to discerne what to speake, how to advise, how to comfort, what to doe.

                           <hi>Conscience.</hi>
                        </note> God hath put into every man a Conscience, wherefore serves conscience, but especially to direct in particulars? There is a faculty of the soule, that wee call a Treasurie; a preserving faculty, that is to lay up generall rules out of the Word of God, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of good bookes, and from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of other men: it is a faculty to treasure up rules, therfore it hath the name of preserving: but there is a conscience under this, that being sanctified by the Spirit of God, &amp; being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in generall by the word of God, it directs in particular. Conscience tels us, this in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular you ought to doe; this you have done: in this particular you have done well, in this you have done ill: so conscience is put in us to check, or direct us in particular. It is Gods Vicar in every man, together with the Spirit: Conscience, together with the Spirit is a great
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:17819:278"/>
helpe to know Gods Will in particulars. If men would not bee too bold with Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Conscience (together with Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) would be faithfull to them. Conscience may say as <hi>Reuben</hi> said to his brethren, when they were in miserie; <hi>Did not I tell you, doe no hurt to the lad?</hi> deale not so hardly with <hi>Ioseph</hi> as to cast him into the pit? so many men do many things amisse, Conscience may say; did not I tell you this before, it was naught, and yet you would needs doe it? yes certainly: and when Conscience is not hearkned unto as a director, it will scourge as a Iudge. It hath many offices; and it is good to keepe this Conscience in its office, to let Conscience doe its full duty, let Conscience direct us to the full. Certainly, if wee would hearken to this Vice-gerent in our hearts; (this little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god, that God hath placed there (in mercie) to guide our lives in particular) it would be better with us than it is, wee should end our dayes with more comfort, and give a better reckoning than we can.</p>

                        </note>Againe, experience may bee added as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe. Experience is a great helpe in particulars: for indeed generalls are raised out of experiments in particular. Therefore those that are wise Polititians, States-men, they are not so out of bookes altogether; but men of experience, that can say, such a case hath beene so at such a time: so that out of observation, and particular experience, they are able to say
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:17819:278"/>
(upon the like case) it should bee now at this time thus, and thus. If therefore wee would treasure up experience, it would bee a good helpe to know what is to bee done in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: to consider how it hath beene in former time, and consider the experience of others; you see then what the rule of our service is, Gods Will: with these helpes subordinate to it, how to direct our selves in particular actions to serve the Will of God: So much for that point.</p>

So common actions, they are not a <hi>service</hi> of God, as they come from common men, that have not grace, and the Spirit of God in their hearts: they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:17819:284"/>
are meere buying, and selling, and going about the actions of their callings, as the actions of a beast are the actions of a beast. But let a Christian come to doe them, he hath a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er life, and a higher spirit, that makes them spirituall actions that are common in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; hee raiseth them up to a higher order, and ranke. Therfore a Christian <hi>serveth</hi> God in all that hee doth, hee hath an eye to God: that which another man doth with no eye to God, but meerely in civill respects. Wee say of policie: it is an ancient observation, which is good, and very fit. The knowledge of a common wealth; it is a building knowledge, a commanding knowledge: for though a States-man doth not build, hee doth not buy and sell, and commerce: but hee useth all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trades for the good of the State. It is a knowledge commanding all other inferiour Arts, and Trades (in a common wealth) to the last end: they should all bee serviceable to the common-wealth, and if they bee not, away with them. So Religion, and the knowledge of Divine things, it is a commanding know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it commands all other <hi>services</hi> in our callings, &amp;c. It doth not teach a man what he shall doe in particular in his calling: but it teacheth him how to direct that calling to <hi>serve</hi> God, to bee advantageous, and helpfull to his generall calling: to further him to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to make every thing reductive to his last end, which hee sets before him, that is, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:17819:285"/>
and serve God in all things, to whom, hee desires to approve himselfe, in life, and death: hee hath a principle, the holy Ghost in him, and he labours to reduce every thing to the maine end, oh that wee were in this temper.</p>

Wee rest from the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of sinne, wee rest from the wearisome la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the body, from the labour of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and oppressions, from the molestations
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:17819:288"/>
of other men among whom we live, every way this life is tedious, and death rest.</p>
                     <p>Againe, it is in this respect a <hi>sleep:</hi>
                        <note n="2" place="margin">
                           <hi>Hope of rising.</hi>
                        </note> because a man goes to bed with assured hope of rising againe, and therefore he goes quietly: though it be a state of darknesse for the time, all the senses are bound up, yet hee knowes that in Gods ordinarie providence, hee shall rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: therefore men not only quietly, but cheerefully go to bed. So there is greater ground to know that wee shall rise againe out of our graves, than that we should rise out of our beds: for many mens beds have been their graves, in some sort, (I meane) they have died in their beds: but for the resurrection, we have the word of Almighty God, (that is a God of his word) that we shall rise againe: and we have it in the pledge of our Saviours resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, there is no doubt of that.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when wee die (if wee have faith) wee should make no more of death, than men doe to goe to bed: hoping undoubtedly of an assured, and joyfull resurrection. The want of faith in that kind, makes us backward to this: you see in what respect death is said to be a <hi>sleep.</hi> To speak only of those references, and relations that are most pertinent between <hi>sleep</hi> and death.</p>

so to a man that hath served God carefully in his calling, and kept a good conscience, death is very sweete.
