            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the King's Moſt Excellent Majeſty, <hi>The Humble Addreſs of the</hi> Atheiſts, <hi>or the Sect of the</hi> Epicureans.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GREAT SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SINCE Men of all Factions and Miſperſwaſions of Religion have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their Thanks for your Majeſty's gracious Declaration of Liberty of Conſcience, we think our ſelves obliged as Gentlemen to bring up the Reer, and become Addreſſers too. We are ſure there is no Party of Men more improved and advanced by your Indulgence, both as to Principles and Proſelytes of <hi>England.</hi> And our Cabals are as full as your Royal Chapel, for your unlimitted Toleration has freed the Nation from the troubleſom Bygottries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and has taught Men to conclude, That there is nothing Sacred or Divine but Trade and Empire, and nothing of ſuch eternal Moment as ſecular Intereſt. Your Majeſty's Univerſal Indulgence hath introduced ſuch unanſwerable Objections and happy Inferences towards' all Religion, that many have given over the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Enquiry after Truth, and ſet down that eaſie Inference, That all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a Cheat. In particular, we can never ſufficiently Congratulate and Admire that generous Paſſage in your Majeſty's gracious Declaration, wherein you have Freed your People from the ſolemn Superſtition of Oaths, and eſpecially from thoſe ſlaviſh Ceremonious ones of Supremacy and Allegiance; and are pleaſed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That you expect no more from your People, than what they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to by the Ancient Law of Nature; and ſo have bravely given them leave to preſerve and defend themſelves, according to the Firſt Chapter of Nature's <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> Your Majeſty was pleaſed to wiſh, That all your Subjects were of your own Religion, and perhaps every Diviſion wiſhes you were of theirs. But, for our parts, we freely declare, That if ever we ſhould be obliged to profeſs any Religion, we would preferr the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which does not much trouble the World with the Affairs of inviſible Beings, and is very Civil and Indulgent to the Failings of humane Nature. That Church can eaſe us from the grave Fatigues of Religion, and, for our Moneys, allow us Proxies, both for Piety and Penances: We can eaſily ſwallow and digeſt a Wafer Deity, and will never cavil at the Maſs in an unknown Tongue, when the Sacrifice it ſelf is ſo unintelligible. We ſhall never ſcruple the Adoration of an Image, when the chiefeſt Religion is but Imagination: And we are willing to allow the Pops an abſolute Power to diſpenſe with all penal Laws, in this World and in another. But before we return to <hi>Rome,</hi> the greateſt Origin of Atheiſm, we wiſh the Pope and all his Vaſſal Princes would free the World from the fear of Hell and Devils, the Inquiſition and Dragoons, and that he would take of the Chimney-Money of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and Cuſtom and Exciſe of Pardons and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences, which are ſo much inconſiſtent with the flouriſhing Trade and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Nation. As for the Ingagements of Lives and Fortunes, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Complement of Addreſſers, we confeſs we have a more peculiar Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for thoſe moſt ſacred Concernments, but yet we will hazard them in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of your Majeſty, with as much Conſtancy and Reſolution, as your Majeſty will defend your Indulgence; that is, ſo far as the Adventure will ſerve our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns and Intereſt.</p>
