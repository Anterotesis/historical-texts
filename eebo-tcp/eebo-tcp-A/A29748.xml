            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

any thing, among those he wrote unto, save Iesus Christ and him crucified. O! this noble, heart-ravishing, soul-satisfying mysterious theme, <hi>Iesus Christ crucified,</hi> the short compend of that uncontrovertibly great mysterie of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, God manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, beleeved on in the world, received up into glory: wherein are things the Angels desire to look into, or with vehement desire bend (as it were) their necks, and bow down their heads to look and peep into (as the word used, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 12. importeth) is a Subject for angelical heads to prie into; for the most inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable, &amp; industrious Spirits, to be occupyed about. The searching into and studying of this one <hi>Truth,</hi> in reference to a closeing with it, as our life, is an infallible mark of a soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely enlightened, and endued with spiritual and heavenly wisdom; for though it be unto the jewes a stumbling block, &amp; unto the Greeks foolishness; yet unto them, who are called, it is Christ the power of God, &amp; the wisdom of God, because the foolishness of God is wiser then men, &amp; the weakness of God is stronger then men. O! what depths of the manifold wisdom of God are there in this mysterie? The more it is preached, known &amp; beleeved aright, the more is it understood, to be beyond understanding, &amp; to be what it is, a mysterie. Did ever any Preacher or beleever, get a broad look of this boundless ocean, wherein infinite <hi>Wisdom, Love</hi> that

Did ever any with serious diligence, as knowing their life lay in it, study this mysterious <hi>Theme,</hi> and were not, in full conviction of soul, made to say, the more they promoved in this study, and the more they descended in their diveings into this depth, or soared upward in their mounting speculations in this height, they found it the more an unse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archable mystery? The study of other <hi>Themes</hi> (which Alas! many, who think it below them to be happy, are too much occupyed in) when it hath wasted the spirits, wearyed the minde, worne the body, and rarified the braine to the next degree unto a distraction, what satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can it give, as to what is attained, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement as to future attainments?

And what peace &amp; joy in the holy Ghost, what inward and inexpressible quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of minde, will the soul enjoy, in dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on these thoughts, when it shall have withall the inward and well grounded perswasion of its right, through Jesus Christ, to the full possession of that <hi>All,</hi> which now it cannot conceive, let be comprehend; the foretastes whereof filleth it with joy unspeakable and full of glory; and the hope of shortly landing there, where it shall see and enjoy &amp; wonder &amp; praise, and rest in this endless and restless felicitating work, making it to sing, while passing thorow the valley of the shadow of death? O if this were beleeved! O that we were not drunk, to a distraction and madness, with the adulterous love of vaine and aery speculations, to the postponing, if not utter neglecting, of this maine and only upmaking work, of getting real acquaintance with and a begun possession of this mystery in our souls, Christ, the grand mystery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> formed within us, living, and working within us by his Spirit, and working us up unto a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity

Oh why cry we not out, in the hieght of the passion of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual longing &amp; desire. <hi>O come Lord Iesus, King of glory, with thine owne key, and open the door and enlarge &amp; dilate the chambers of the soul, that thou may enter, and be entertained as the King of glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with all thy glorious retinue, to the ennobling of my soul, &amp; satisfying of all the desires of that immortal spark?</hi> Why do we not covet after this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which hath a true and firme connexion with all the best and truely divine gifts?

O happy day, O happy houre, that is really and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually spent in this imployment! what would souls, sweeming in this ocean of all pleasures

O! must not this be the very suburbs of heaven to the soul?

O what a complacency hath the graced soul, in that contrivance of infinite wisdom, wherein the mystery of the grace of God is so displayed, that nothing appeareth, from the lowest foundation stone to the upper, most cope-stone but grace, grace, free grace making up all the materials, and free grace with infinite wisdom cementing all? The gracious soul can be warme under no other covering, but what is made of that web, wherein grace and only grace is both wooft and werpe; and the reason is manifest, for such an one hath the clearest sight and discovery of his owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and seeth that nothing suiteth him, and his case, but free grace: nothing can make up his wants, but free grace: nothing can cover his deformities, but free grace; nothing can help his weaknesses, shortcomings, faintings, sins and miscarriages, but free grace: therefore

is free grace all his Salvation, and all his Desire: itis his glory to be free grace's debtor, for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; the crown of glory will have a far more exceeding and eternal weight, and be of an hyperbolically hyperbolick and eternal weight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet easily carryed and worne, when he seeth how free grace and free love hath lined it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and free grace and free love sets it on, and keeps it on for ever: this maketh the glorified Saint, weare it with ease, by casting it down at the feet of the gracious and loving purchaser, and bestower.

O what a glory is it to the Saint, to set the crown of glorious free grace, with his owne hands, on the head of such a Saviour, and to say, <hi>not unto me, not unto me, but unto thee, even unto thee alone, be the glory for ever and ever!</hi> With what delight, satisfaction, and complacency, will the glorified Saint, upon this account, sing the Redeemed and Ransomed their song?

            <p>This is that heart-moveing object, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents itself to thy eye &amp; observation this day: this is that deplorable posture, wherein thou mayst perceive most men at the very point of perishing eternally, who are within the pale of the visible Church; some danceing themselves headlong in all hast into the lake of fire and brimstone; some so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in things, which have no connexion with their happiness, as to drop inconcernedly into the pit, out of which there is no redemption; and others dreaming themselvs into endlesse perdition; &amp; all of them unite in a deriding at or despiseing the means used, &amp; essays made, in order to their recovery.</p>

(O my soul enter not into their secrets! and, O sweet Jesus, let thy name be to me, the Lord my righteousness, thou hast wone it, weare it; and gather not my soul with such, who make mention of any other righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but of thine onely!) to bring-in another Gospel amongst men, then the Gospel of the grace of God; as they determine to know some other thing then Christ and him crucified; so with the inticeing words of mans wisdom, they bewitch men into a disobedience to the truth, setting somewhat else before them then a crucified Christ: And this they do, that they may remove men from those, who call them into the grace of Christ, unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Gospel: A Christ, it is true, they speake of; but it is not the Christ of God; for all they drive at (O cursed and truely Antichristian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe!) is, that he may profite them nothing, while they model all Religion according to this novel project of their magnified <hi>morality?</hi> This is that which gives both life and lustre to that image they adore, to the Dagon, after whom they would have the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wonder and Worship.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:44048:15"/>That there is such a <hi>moralizeing</hi> or <hi>muddizeing</hi> (if I may be for once admitted to coine a new word to give these men their due) of Christianity now introduced and comeing in fashion, many of the late pieces in request do evince? Now, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity should moralize men above all things, I both give and grante; for he who is partaker of the divine nature, and hath obtained precious faith, must adde vertue to his faith; But that it should be only conceived and conceited as an elevation of nature to a more cleare light, in the matter of morality, wherein our Lord is onely respected, as an heavenly teacher, and perfect paterne proposed for imitation, is but a proud pleasing fansie of self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, darkened and deluded dreamers, robing God of the glory of his mercy and goodnesse; our Lord Jesus Christ of the glory of his grace and merit; The Spirit of the efficacy of his glorious and mighty operations; and themselves and their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes, who give them the hand as guids, of the comfort and frute of all.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>pilgrimage,</hi> we are perswaded to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to the holy Land; this is that <hi>reasonablenesse of Christianitie,</hi> which with great swelling words of vanitie is ventilat, to the allureing and ensnare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such, who had almost escaped the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is in the world through lust, and the pollutions of the flesh through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; This is the way which they, who undertake to publish to the world the true causes of the decay of pietie, take to revive and introduce that pietie, which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain is wanting: O impious invention, not only

encroaching upon the unsearchable mysterie of the Gospel; but subversive of the whole method, and blessed and beautiful contrivance of salvation, and rendering salvation impossible to the greatest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients in this studie; and the grand patrons and practitioners in this new art, the greatest opposers of that grace of God, which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ingeth salvation unto all men. It is true, they will not plainly plead for profanitie, Nay, they may and do make a great noise about the practise of pietie, as if they were the only patrons thereof; that with lesse observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and greater facility, they may beguile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their followers of the reward: they may possibly perswade even to a pinching of the body, that they may puffe up, and pamper their fleshly minde; and while they overdrive men to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of will - worship, and performance of those things, which have a shew of wisdome, it is that they may withdraw them from holding that blessed head, from which all the body by joints &amp; bands, having nourishment ministred, and knit toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, encreaseth with the encrease of God; yet the grace of God, that onely liveing principle of all true pietie, which they dispute out of the souls of men, that they may debauch them into a contempt of the Spirits working in men to will and to do, takes frequent vengance on this their invention, by leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them not onely to play the Devil in disguise, that they may be known by their fruits; but also to lay aside that garbe of external godlinesse, (for the Devil nor his Domesticks cannot long weare a strait doublet) that it may appeare, how it is verified in them, <hi>from him that hath not shall be taken</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It cannot escape thy observation, how busie Satan is this day, upon the one hand, to keep men, under the call of the Gospel to give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make their calling and election sure, idle all the day; so that no perswasion can enduce them to engage seriously to fall about a working out their own salvation in feare and trembling; and on the other, equally diligent and industrious to divert men from trusting in the name of the Lord, and staying upon their God; seting them on work to go and gather fewel, and kindle a fire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe themselves about with sparks, that they may walk in the light of their own fire, and in the sparks that they have kindled; knowing well that they shall this way most certainly lose their toil and travel, and have no other reward at his hand of all their labour, but to ly down in everlasting sorrow, while the stout hearted and far from righteousnesse, and salvation, shall get their soul for a prey, and be made to rejoyce in his salvation, and blesse him who hath made them meet to be partakers of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the saints in light.</p>
            <p>It is fit therefore, in order to thy own establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the present truth, and that thou mayest so work, that thy labour be not in vaine, but God may accept thy works, often to think, and seriously to consider in thy own soul, what that
<pb facs="tcp:44048:17"/>
Gospel holinesse is, and what these men substitute in the place of it, that thou may choice the perfect and pleasant way of Gospel holinesse, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise thy self to that <hi>godlinesse, which is profitable for all things, haveing the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am neither the fit person for so great an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, nor do these limits, within which I must bound my self, permit me to expatiat, in many notions about the nature of this excellent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thing, true Gospel holinesse: Oh if, in the entry, I could on my own behalfe and others, sob out my <hi>Alas,</hi> from the bottome of my soul, because, be what it will, it is some other thing then men take it to be: few habituat themselves to a thinking upon it, in its high nature, and soul enriching advantages, till their hearts receive su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teable impressions of it, and their lives be the very transumpt of the law of God written in their heart; the thing (Alas!) is lost in a noise of words, and heap of notions about it, neither is it a wonder that men fal into mistakes about it, since it is onely the heart possessed of it that is capable to understand &amp; perceive its true excellency: But if it be asked, what it is? we say, it may be shortly taken up, as the elevation and raising up of a poor mortal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conformity with God; As a participation of the divine nature; or as the very image of God stamped on the soul, impressed on the thoughts &amp; affections, and expressed in the life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that the man, in whom Christ is formed, and in whom he dwells, lives and walks, hath, while upon the earth, a conversation in heaven;
<pb facs="tcp:44048:17"/>
not only in opposition to those many, whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, whose glory is in their shame, who minde earthly things; but also to these pretenders unto &amp; personaters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who have confidence in the flesh, &amp; Worship God with their own Spirit (which in the matters of God is flesh, and not Spirit) and have somewhat else to rejoyce in, then in Christ Jesus, and a being found in him not having their own righteousnesse.</p>
            <p>True Gospel holinesse then consists in some simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and likenesse to God, and fellowship with him, founded upon that likenesse: there is such an impression of God, his glorious attributes, his infinit Power, Majesty, Mercy, Justice, Wisdom, Holinesse, and Grace, &amp;c. As sets him up all alone in the soul without any competition, and produceth those real apprehensions of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he is alone excellent and matchlesse. O how prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able doth he appeare, when indeed seen, to all things? And how doth this light of his infinit glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousnesse, shineing into the soul, darken &amp; abscure to an invisiblenesse all other excellencies, even as the riseing of the sun makes all the lesser lights to disappear. Alas! how is God unknown in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious being and attribute? When once the Lord enters the soul, and shines into the heart, it is like the riseing of the sun at midnight: all these things, which formerly pretended to some lovelinesse, and did dazil with their lustre, are eternally darkened: now all natural perfections and moral vertues, in their flowr and perfections are at best looked upon as <hi>aliquid nihil:</hi> what things were formerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted gaine and godlinesse, are now counted
<pb facs="tcp:44048:18"/>
losse for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the Lord; and the soul cannot onely suffer the losse of them all without a sob, but be satisfied to throw them away as dung, that it may win him, and be found in him. Now the wonder of a Deity, in his greatnesse, power and grace, swallowes up the soul in sweet admiration: O how doth it love to lose it self in finding here what it cannot fathome? And then it begins truely to see the greatnesse and evil of sin; then it is looked upon without the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of pleasure or profit, and loathed as the leprosy of hell. Now the man is truely like God in the knowledge of good and evil, in the knowledge of that one infinit good, <hi>God;</hi> &amp; to the knowledge of that one almost infinit evil, <hi>sin.</hi> This is the first point of likenesse to him, to be conformed to him in our understanding, that as he knowes himself to be the onely self being and fountain good, and all created things in their flour and perfection, with all their real or fancied conveniencies being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with him, but as the drop of a bucket, the small dust of the ballance, or nothing, yea lesse then nothing, vanity; (which is nothing blown up, by the force or forgery of a vainly working imagination, to the consistence of an appearance) so for a soul to know indeed and beleeve in the heart, that there is nothing deserves the name of good besides God, to have the same superlative and transc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dent thoughts of that great and glorious self being <hi>God,</hi> and the same diminishing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baseing thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o all things &amp; beings besides him. And that as the Lord seeth no evil in the creation but sin, and hates that with a perfect hatred, as
<pb facs="tcp:44048:18"/>
contrary to his holy will; so for a soul to aggravat sin in its own sight to an infinitnesse of evil, at least till it see it onely short of infinitnesse in this respect, that it can be swallowed up of infinit mercy. But whence hath the soul all this light? It owes all this and owns it self as debtor for it to him, <hi>who opens the eyes of the blind:</hi> it is he <hi>who commands the light to shine out of darkenesse,</hi> who hath made these blessed discoveries, and hath given the poor benighted soul, <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Iesus Christ:</hi> These irradiations are from the Spirits illumination: it is the Spirit of wisdom and revelation that hath made day light in the darkened soul: the man who had the heart of a beast, as to any saveing or solid knowledge of God or himself, hath now got an understanding to know him that is true: now is Christ become the poor mans <hi>wisdome,</hi> he is now <hi>renewed in knowledge after the image of him that oreated him:</hi> he might well bable of spiritual things, but till now he understood nothing of the beauty &amp; excellency of God and his wayes: Nay, he knew not what he knew, he was ignorant as a beast of the life and lustre of those things, which he knew in the letter: nothing seemed more despicable to him in the world, then true godlinesse; but now he judgeth otherwise, because he hath the mind of Christ: the things, which in his darkenesse he did undervalue as trifles to be mocked at, he now can onely minde and admire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since he became a child of light: now being delivered from that blindnesse and brutishnesse of Spirit, which possesseth the world, (and possessed himself till he was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb facs="tcp:44048:19"/>
by the renewing of his minde) who esteem basely of spiritual things and set them at nought, he prizeth as alone precious: the world wonders, what pleasure or content can be in the service of God, because they see not by tasteing how good he is: to be pryeing into, and poreing upon invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things, is to them visible madnesse, but to the enlightened minde, the things that are not seen are onely worth seeing, and while they appeare not to be they onely are; whereas the things that are seen appeare but to be, and are not. Though the surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing sweetnesse of spiritual things should be spoke of to them, who cannot savour the things of God, in such a manner as the giorious light of them did surround men; yet they can perceive no such thing: all is to them cuningly devised fables: let be spoke what will, they see no forme, no comelinesse, no beau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of God; and these, though seen at a distance, reflect such rayes of beauty into his soul, that he beholds and is ravished, he sees and is swallowed up in wonder.</p>
            <p>But then, in the next place, this is not a Spirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse inefficacious speculation about these things, to know no evil but sin and separation from God, and no blessednesse but in the fruition of him; it is not such a knowledge of them as doth not principle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to pursue after them.

               <hi>First,</hi> I say, true holinesse, in its being and operation, respects Jesus Christ as its <hi>principle:</hi> I <hi>live,</hi> (said that shineing saint) <hi>yet not I, but Christ liveth in me:</hi> as that which gives religion its first being, is the religation of the soul to God; so that which gives it motion, and drawes forth that life into action, is the same God's working all their works in them and for them, so that in all they do, they are workers together with God; every act of holinesse is an act of the soul made alive unto God through Jesus Christ, and quickened to each acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the supervenience of new life and influence: therefore, says Christ, <hi>without me you can do nothing:</hi> it is not, being out of me you can do nothing (for he spoke it to those who were in him) but if ye leave me out in doing, all ye do will be nothing: Its Jesus Christ who gives life and leggs, so that our runings are according to his drawings: <hi>my soul followeth hard after thee</hi> (said that holy man;) but whence is all this life and vigour? <hi>Thy right hand upholdeth me.</hi> O it is the upholdings and helpings of this right hand, enlargeing the mans heart, that makes a runing in the way of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>mount all these difficulties, with a holy facility, which were simply insupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pure impossibilities: now the man runs and doth not weary, because Christ drawes; and he walks and doth not faint, because Christ, in whom dwels the fulnesse of the God-head bodily, dwels in him, and walks in him, and dwels in him for that very end, that he may have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatnesse and competency of strength for duety: all grace is made to abound unto him, that he alwayes having all sufficiency in all things, may abound unto every good work: he is able of himself to do nothing, no not to think any thing as he ought, but he hath a sufficiency of God, whereby he is thorowly furnished unto every good work; so that he may say, <hi>I am able for all things,</hi> it is more then I <hi>am able to do all things</hi> (as we read it) its just import is. I am able to do all things, and to endure all things; and that which keeps it from vain boasting is what is ad led, <hi>through Christ which strengtheneth me,</hi> or <hi>putting power in me,</hi> or rather <hi>impowering me,</hi> which is by a supervenient act drawing forth life into a livelinesse of excercise, according to the present exigent. There is a power in a saint, because Christ is in him, that over pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers all the powers of darknesse with out, and all the power of indwelling corruption within, so that when the poor weak creature is ready to despond, within sight of his duty, and say because of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, <hi>what is my strength that I should hope?</hi> Christ saith, despond not, <hi>my grace is sufficient forthee,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:44048:22"/>
and <hi>my power shall rest upon thee,</hi> to a reviveing thee, and raising thee up, and putting thee in case to say, <hi>when I am weake then am I strong; his strength,</hi> who impowers me, <hi>is made perfect in my weakenesse,</hi> so that <hi>I will glory in my infirmities,</hi> and be glade in being graces debtor. But what power is that, which raiseth the dead finner, and carries the soul in its actings so far without the line, and above the sphere of all natural activity, when stretched to its utmost? O it is <hi>an exceading great power, which is to them ward who beleive,</hi> that must make all things, how difficult so ever, easie, when he works in them to will and to do, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>the working of his mighty power</hi> (or as it is upon the margent, &amp; more emphatick, of <hi>the might of his power) which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand,</hi> &amp;c. he that raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead, raiseth up beleevers also by Jesus, and being raised and revived by him, to walk in new nesse of life: the life of Jesus, in its commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications of strength, is manifest in their mortal flesh, according to that of the same Apostle, the <hi>life that I live in the flesh</hi> (sais he) I <hi>live by the faith of the Son of God:</hi> faith brings in Christ in my soul, and Christ being my life carries out my soul, in all the acts of obedience, wherein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though I be the formal agent, yet the efficiency and the power, by which I operat, is from him; so that I can give no better account of it, then this, <hi>I not I.</hi> But who then, if not you? <hi>The grace of God,</hi> sais he, <hi>which was with me.</hi> But this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery to our bold, because blind, <hi>moralists,</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:44048:22"/>
an indwelling Christ, working mightily in the soul, is plain madnesse and melancholy; however we understand his knowledge in the mystery of Christ, who said, <hi>the life</hi> I <hi>live in the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. and from what we understand of his knowledge in that mystery, which he had by revelation, we understand, our <hi>moralists</hi> to be men of corrupt minds, who concerning the faith have made ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack; but what is that, <hi>the life</hi> I <hi>live in the flesh,</hi> &amp;c? The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>port of it seems to be this, if not more, while I have in me a soul animating my body, as the principle of all my vital and natural actions, I have Jesus Christ animating my soul, and by the impulse and communicat vertue and strength of an indwelling Christ, I am made to run the wayes of his commandements, wherein I take so great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, that I am found of no duty as of my enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This gospel holinesse respects Jesus Christ as its <hi>patern.</hi> It proposeth no lower patern for imitation, then to be conforme to his image; he that is <hi>begotten againe unto a lively hope, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ from the dead, girds up the loins of his minde</hi> (wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It is written, saith he, <hi>Be ye holy for I am holy,</hi> the hope of seeing God, and being ever with him imposeth a necessity upon him who hath it, to look no lower, then
<pb facs="tcp:44048:23"/>
at him, who is glorious in holinesse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is said to <hi>purify himself, even as he is pure;</hi> and knowing that this is the end of their being quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened together with Christ, that they may walk even as he walked; they, in their working and walking, aime at no lesse then to be like him; and therefore never sit down upon any attained mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as if they were already perfect: the spotlesse purity of God expressed in his laws, is that whereto they study assimilation; therefore they are still in motion towards this mark, and are changed from one degree of glorious grace into another, into the same image, even as by the Spirit of the Lord, who never gives over his putting them to cleanse from all filthinesse of the flesh and of the Spirit, till that be true in the truest sense, <hi>thou art all fair, my love, there is no spot in thee.</hi> And knowing that perfect fruition of him cannot be without perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to him, herein do they exercise themselves, to grow in grace, and to be still advanceing towards some more likenesse to his image, forgetting all their attainments, as things that are behind, and by their reachings forth unto that which is before, make it evident, that they make every begun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of grace and conformity to God, a prevenient capacity for a new degree, which yet they have not attained. I know, our <hi>maralists</hi> look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as matchlesse, in talkeing of following his steps, as he hath left us an example: in this they make a flourish with flanting effrontry, but for all their boasting of wisdom, such a poor simple man as I, am made to wonder at their folly, who propose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as they say, the purity of Christ for their
<pb facs="tcp:44048:23"/>
paterne, are not even thence convinced, that in order to a conformity thereto, there is a simple &amp; absolute necessity of the mighty operations of that Spirit of God, whereby this end can be reached; but while they flout at the Spirits working, as a melancholy fancy, whereby the soul is garnished with the beauty of holinesse, and made an habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for God, I doubt not to say of these great <hi>sayers,</hi> that they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirme: nay doth not their talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the one, not only without seeing the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the other, but speaking against it, say in the heart of every one, (who hath not the heart of a beast) that they have never yet got a sight of the holinesse of that paterne, nor of their own pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and impotency; for if they had, they would give themselves up to Jesus Christ to be washed by him, without which they can have no part with him. O there will be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ast difference, at the latter day, betwixt them who have given their blake souls to Jesus Christ to bletch, when he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them without spot, not onely cloathed with wrought gold, but all glorious within, and these who have never dipped, yea who have despised to dip their defiled souls in any other fountain, save in the impure pudle of their own performances: this will make them loathsome in his sight, and cause his soul abhorre those, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> have done this despite unto the Spirit of grace, as to slight that bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to the grace of Jesus Christ, as that which can onely principle any acceptable performance of duety, he will plunge them in the ditch, and it Will cost them their souls, for rejecting the counsel of God against themselves, in not making use of him who came by water, as well as by blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This gospel holinesse respects Christ as the <hi>Altar.</hi> It is in him and for him that his soul is well pleased with our performance, this is the Altar, upon which thou must lay thy gift, &amp; leave it, without which thy labour is lost, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thou dost is loathed, as a corrupt thing. As beleevers draw all their strength from him, so they expect acceptation onely through him, and for him: they do not look for it, but in the beloved: they dare not draw near to God in duty, but by him: this is the new and liveing way, which is consecrat for them: and if such, who offer to come to God, do no enter in hereat, in stead of being admitted to a familiar converse with God, they shall finde him a consumeing fire: when the saints have greatest liberty in prayer (and so of all other performances, when their hearts are most lifted up in the wayes of the Lord) they abhorre at think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their prayer can any otherwise be set forth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as incense, or the lifting up of their hands as the evening sacrifice, but as presented by the great intercessor and perfumed by the merit of his oblation. If they could weep out the marrow of their bones, and the moisture of their body in mourning over sin; yet they durst not think of having what comes from so impure a spring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb facs="tcp:44048:24"/>
runs thorow so polluted a channel, presented to God but by Jesus Christ, in order to acceptation; for as they look to the exalted Saviour, to get their repentance from him, so when by the pourings out upon them the Spirit of grace and supplication, he hath made them pour out their hearts before him, and hath melted them into true tendernesse, so that their mourning is a great mourning, they carry backe these teares to be washen and bathed in his blood, as knowing without this of how little worth and value with God their salt water is; but when they are thus washed, he puts them in his bottle, and then pours them out again to them in the wine of strong consolation: thus are they made glade in his house of prayer, and their sighes and groans come up with acceptance upon his Altar. O blessed Altar, that sanctifies the gold! This is that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, whereto the <hi>mocking moralist</hi> hath no right. It is by him, that the poor beleever offers up his sacrifice to God continually; what ever he doth, in word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> deed, he desires to do all in the name of the Lord Jesus: as he knowes, He lives to make intercession, and to appeare in the presence of God for his poor people, both to procure influences for duety, and plead for acceptation; so he depends upon him for both, as knowing he can never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise heare, or have it said unto him, <hi>well done, good and faithful servant.</hi> It may be he can do little, he hath but a mite to offer; but he puts it in the mediators hand to be presented to God: he hath not gold, nor silver, nor purple to bring, he can do no great things, he hath but goats hair or rams skins, but he gives them the right tincture,
<pb facs="tcp:44048:25"/>
he makes them red in the blood of Christ, and so they are a beautiful incarnat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> This Gospel holinesse respects Jesus Christ as its <hi>last end:</hi> as it hath its being from him, so it is all directed toward the praise of his grace; while the beleeving soul in whom Christ dwells de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In a word, as all he hath is of him and from him, so all he does or designs is for him and to him; it is Christ to him to live, in whom Christ lives: now this is the very nature of pure religion and undefiled, and that which compleats the image of God, and puts it beyond all debat, that his soul hath received the stamp and impression of the royal seal on it, and that his heart is the epistle of Christ, written not with inck and pen, but with the Spirit of the liveing God, when his glory and the exaltation of the manifold grace, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wisdom of God, in the contriveance of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is upmost in his thinkings, desireings, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectings and endeavourings, and hath the first place in the roll of his wishings; while other men seek their own things, it is his own, his onely own, his one, his all, to seek the things of Christ, that blessed seeker, who came to seek him and save him; and being found of him, he endeavours to carry as one no more his owne; the glorifieing of him in

The deep my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of salvation, which Angels desire to look

into, and onely satisfy themselves with admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at, must appeare as respondents at their bar, and if they decline the judge and court, as incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, they flee out and flout at subjecting this blinde <hi>mole,</hi> mans reason, to the revelation of faith in a mystery. The manifold wisdome of God and the manifold grace of God, must either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to their unfoldings, and be content to speak in their dialect, or else these wits, these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian dictators will give the deep things of God, because beyond their diveings, the same entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which that great gospel preacher, <hi>Paul,</hi> met with from men of the same mould, kidney and complexion, because he preached unto them Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, <hi>what would this babler say,</hi> said they; The Spirit of wisdom and revelation they know not, they have not, they acknowledge not; nay they despise him in his saveing, and soul - ascertaining illuminations; and the workings of that mighty power to them ward who beleeve, is to the men of this new mould (because they have not found it) an insufferable fansy, to be exploded with a disdain and indignation, which discovers what Spirit acts them in this opposition.</p>
            <p>But what do they say, that will found this charge, and free us from casting iniquity upon them?

            <p>But to sum up all shortly, there are but three things which make religion an heavy burden. <hi>First,</hi> the blindnesse of the minde; &amp; here thou art taught to make use of that eye-salve, whereby <hi>the eyes of the blind see out of obscurity and out of darkenesse</hi> he who formerly erred in Spirit, by the light held forth in these lines, may see a surpasseing beauty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the wayes of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That aversion and unwillingnesse, which is in the minde, whereby the sweet &amp; easy yoke of his commands i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> spurned at as heavy; in order to the removing thereof; &amp; that thou mayest be among his willing people, here thou hast Christ held forth in his conquering beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, displaying his banner of love over souls, so that thou canst not look upon him as held forth, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ith will bow thy neck to take on his yoke, because
<pb facs="tcp:44048:38"/>
it sees it is lined with the love of Christ, &amp; then this love, that line the yoke, shed abroad in the heart, will constraine to a bearing of it. O it must be an easy yoke, because itis love, tender love, that imposeth it; and it must be easy &amp; delightful to the bearer, because itis the nature of love to think the greatest difficulties easy, if thereby an evidence of loves reality may be given to the party beloved: now, if Christ thought the greatest burden easy, even that which with its weight wrung these words from him, <hi>now is my soul troubled,</hi> &amp;c. to perswade souls of the reality and riches of his love to them; Then the soul can think nothing heavy that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth, since he will interpret the bearing of it an evidence of its love to him: none of his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can be grievous to the man now, since he hath saide, <hi>This is the love of God, that yee keep his commandments.</hi> Now there is a readinesse of minde to do all things without disputings &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings; as love knowes no lyon in its way, so it is no murmuring disputant; when this question is cleared, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do,</hi> then love hath no moe questions; its greatest difficulty is solved. But <hi>Thirdly</hi> when the Spirit is willing, there remains yet much weaknesse, love kindled in the heart conquers the mind into a compliance with his will, and a complacency in his commands, but its greatest strength is often to weep over a withered hand: now that thy hands which fall down may be made strong for labour, and thou mayest be girded with strength, and have grace for grace, yea all grace, to make thee abound unto every good word and work; The <hi>Author</hi> leads thee up

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44048:50"/>
the right wayes of the Lord; and one way or other to lead souls away, and draw them of Christ; knowing that if he prevail here, he hath gained his poynt: and therefore he endeavoureth not only to darken it by error, either more grosse, or more subtile; but also to darken it by mistakes, and prejudices; whence it cometh to passe, that not only Strangers are made to wander out of the way, but oftentimes many of his owne people are walking in the darknesse of ignorance and mistakes, and remaine leane through want of the reall exercise of the Life of faith, which would make them fat &amp; flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing; because it would make them <hi>strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, and to grow up in Christ in all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The clearing up then of this truth cannot but be most seasonable now, when Satan is prevailing with many, whom he cannot get tempted to loosenesse and profanitie, to sit downe upon some thing, which is not Christ; and to rest upon something within themselves, distinct from him, both in the matter of <hi>Iustification,</hi> and <hi>Sanctification.</hi> This subtile Adversary is now setting some a work, to cry up, by preaching, speaking and printing, a way to heaven, which is not Christ, a kinde of <hi>morality,</hi> civility and outward holinesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the soul is to rest: and this holinesse, not wrought and effectuated through the strength of Iesus, by faith sucking life and furniture from him; but through our owne art and skill; which in effect is nothing but an extract of refined <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Socinianisme,</hi> and <hi>Arminianisme,</hi> devised
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44048:50"/>
and broached of purpose, to draw the soul off Christ; that he may stand upon his owne legs, and walk by his owne power, and thank himself, at least in part, for the crown, at length.</p>
               <p>Further, through the great goodnesse of God, the true way of a soul's justification is admirablie cleared up; and many are, at least <hi>theoretically,</hi> acquanted therewith; and many also <hi>practically,</hi> to the quieting of their wakened consciences, and stopping the mouth of their accusers, and obtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of peace, joy, and the lively hope of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting crowne: yet many a gratious soul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their unacquantednesse with the solide and thriveing way of usemaking of Christ for <hi>grouth in grace</hi> and true <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Therefore some discovery of the truth here cannot but be usefull, seasonable, yea and acceptable unto them: If He, who is the <hi>Truth,</hi> would give grace to understand, and to unfold this so necessary and alwayes advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a <hi>Truth;</hi> and would help to write of and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine this <hi>Truth,</hi> by faith in him, who is here said to be the <hi>Truth;</hi> then should we have cause to blesse and magnifie his name: But if he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because of sin, shall hide himself, and not let out those beames of light, whereby we might discover light, we shall but <hi>darken counsell with words without knowledge,</hi> and leave the matter as uncleare, as ever. Therefore is it necessarie, there be both in him that writeth, and in such as reade a single dependence on him, <hi>who is given for a leader, Esa.</hi> 55: 5. and hath promised to <hi>bring the blinde by a way, which they knew not, and to lead them in paths that they had not known,</hi> and to <hi>make dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>

                  <hi>light before them, and crooked things streight<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Esa.</hi> 42: 16. that thus by acting faith on him, we may finde, in so far, the truth of this verified, viz. <hi>That he is the Way the Truth, and the Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for clearing up of this matter, we would know, That our Lord Iesus, from the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> is laying downe some grounds of consolation, sufficient to comfort his Disciples, against the sad newes of his departure and death; and to encourage them against the feares they had of much evill to befall them, when their Lord &amp; Master should be taken from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which is a sufficient proof of the tender heart of Iesus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who alloweth all his followers <hi>strong consolation,</hi> against all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> feares, hazards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> troubles and perplexities, which they can meet with in their way. He will not leave them comfortlesse; and therefore he layeth downe strong grounds of consolation, to support their drouping and fainting hearts; as loving to see his followers <hi>rejoyceing alwayes in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Singing in the wayes of Zion;</hi> that the world may see, and be convinced of a reality in Christianity, and of the preferablenesse of that life, notwithstanding of all the troubles that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, unto any other, how sweet and desireable so ever it may appear to flesh and blood.</p>
               <p>In prosecution of which designe, he told them <hi>vers.</hi> 4. that they <hi>knew wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> which he was to take, and by which he was to bring them to the Father to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions spoken of, and so to life eternall. But <hi>Thomas</hi> rashly and incredulously (as too usually he did <hi>Chap.</hi> 11: 16. and 20: 25) venteth himself,

                  <hi>We know not whither thow goest, and how can we know the way?</hi> wherein we have an emblem of many a beleever, who may have more grace and knowledge of God and of Christ, than they will be able to see, or acknowledge that they have, what through temptations; inward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers; sense of their many defects and great ignorance; strong desires of high measures; clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er discoveries of the vastnesse of the object; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes about the true nature of grace, despiseing the day of small things; and indistinctnesse as to the actings of grace, or want of understanding and right uptaking of grace, in its various out goings, and actings under various notions, and the like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon Christ, after his usuall manner, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth occasion to clear up that ground of consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion further unto them; and to let them see the true way of coming to the Father, that thereby they night be helped to see, that they were not such strangers unto the <hi>way,</hi> as they supposed; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he amplifieth; and layeth out the properties and excellencies of <hi>this way,</hi> as being <hi>the true and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way,</hi> and the <hi>only true and living way;</hi> and that in such a manner, as they might both see the way to be perfect, full, saife, saving and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; and also learne their duty, of improving this way alwayes, and in all things, untill they came home at length to the Father: saying I <hi>am the Way, the Truth and the Life: no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ then, saying, that <hi>He</hi> not only is <hi>the Way</hi> to the Father, even the <hi>true way;</hi> but that he is

And the reason is because 1 Christ knoweth our infirmitie and weaknesse, and is of a tender heart, and therefore <hi>Will not break the bruised reed. Esa.</hi> 42. Well knoweth He, that rough and untender handling would crush us, and break us all in pieces. And 2. He is full of bowells of mercy, and can <hi>have compassion on them that are out of the way</hi> and <hi>can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. Heb.</hi> 4: 15. &amp; 5: 2.</p>
                  <p>Which truth, as, upon the one hand, it should encourage all to choose him for their leader, &amp; give up themselves to Him, who is so tender of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; so, upon the other hand, it should rebuke such as are ready to intertaine evill and hard thoughts of Him, as if he were an hard Master, and ill to be followed: and put all from intertean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the least thought of his untendernesse, and want of compassion. But moreover.</p>

                  <p>WE see, <hi>That weaknesses and corruptions breaking out in beleevers, when they are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly and ingenuously laid open before the Lord, will not scarre Him away: But rather engadge Him the more to helpe and succour.</hi> Much of <hi>Thomas</hi> his weaknesse and corruption appeared in what he said: yet the same being honestly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously laid open to Christ, not out of a spirit of contradiction, but out of a desire to learne, Christ is so far from thrusting him away, that He rather condescendeth the more, out of love and tendernesse, to instruct him better, and to cleare the way more fully. And that because 1. He knoweth our mould and fashion, how fecklesse and frail we are, and that if he should deal with us according to our folly, we should quickly be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. 2. He is not as Man, hasty, rash, Proud; but gentle, loving, tender and full of compassion. 2. It is his office and proper work to be an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter to the ignorant, and a helper of our infirmities and weaknesses, a phisitian to binde up and cure our sores &amp; wounds.</p>
                  <p>Who would not then willingly give up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to such a teacher, that will not thrust them to the door, nor give them up to themselves, alwayes when their corruptions would provoke Him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? And what a madnesse is this in many, to stand aback from Christ, because of their <hi>infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and to scarre at Him, because of their <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi> when the more corruption we finde the more
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44048:53"/>
should we run to him? and it is soon enough to depart from Christ, when he thrusts us away; &amp; sayeth, he will have no more to doe with us: yea he will allow us to stay, after we are, as it were, thrice thrust away: only let us take heed, that we approve not ourselves in our evils, that we hide them not, as unwilling to part with them, that we obstinatly maintaine them not, nor ourselves in them: but that we lie open before him, and deal with him, with honesty, ingenuity and plainnesse.</p>

                  <p>WE see further, <hi>That ignorance ingenuously acknowledged and laid open before Christ puts the soul in a faire way to get more instruction.

                  </p>
                  <p>Why then are we so foolish, as to conceale our ignorance from him, and to hide our case and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition from him: and why doth not this commend Christ's School to us so much the more? why do we not carry as ingenuous schollars, really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireous to learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

seeing Christ taketh occasion here from <hi>Thomas</hi> his laying open his condition, not without some mixture of corruption, to cleare up the truth, more fully and plainely, than it was before: for hereby 1. Christ giveth an open declaration of the glory of his power, mercy, goodnesse, wisdome &amp;c. 2. He hath occasion to give a proof of his divine art, and glorious skill of healing diseased souls, and of making brocken bones stronger than ever they were 3. Thus he effectually accomplisheth his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble designes, and perfecteth his work, in a way tending to abase Man, by discovering his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and failings; and to glorifie Himself in his goodnesse and love. 4 Thus he triumpheth more over Satan, and in a more remarkable and glorious manner destroyeth his works. 5. Thus he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how wonderfully he can make all things work together for good to his chosen ones, that love him, and follow him. 6 Yea thus he engadgeth souls to wonder more at his divine wisdome and power; to despaire lesse in time comeing, when cases would seem hard; to acknowledge his great and wonderfull grace, and his infinite power and wisdome, that can bring death out of life; and also to be more sensible of the mercy, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for it.</p>

                  <p>2. <hi>Where there is the least measure of true acquantance with Christ, with love to him, and a desire to know more of him, Christ will take notice thereof,</hi> though it be covered over with a heap of mistakes, and accompanyed with much ignorance, weaknesse, and indistinctnesse. <hi>He seeth not as man seeth:</hi> which is good newes to some, that are weak in knowledge, and unable to give any good account of any knowledge they have, yet one thing they can say, <hi>That he who knoweth all things, knoweth that they love him.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> How Christ is the way, in General. I am the way.</head>
               <p>WE come now to speak more particularly to the words; and <hi>first</hi> of his being a <hi>Way.</hi> Our designe being to point at the way of use making of Christ, in all our necessities, straites and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, which are in our way to heaven: and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to point out the way, how beleevers should make use of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in all their particular exigences; and so <hi>live by faith in him, walk in him, grow up in him, advance &amp; march forward toward glory in him.</hi> It will not be amisse to speak of this fulnesse of Christ in reference to unbeleevers, as occasion offereth, because this will help to cleare the other.</p>
               <p>Before we can cleare up, how any can make use of Christ, we must speak some thing of their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of him, and of his being furnished fitly, fully, richly &amp; satisfylngly for their case; and this will make the way of use making of Christ more plaine.</p>
               <p>While Christ then sayes I <hi>am the Way,</hi> he points out those things to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>first. That man is now estranged from the Lord, and in a wandering condition:</hi> He hath departed,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44048:59"/>
from God; he is revolted and gone. <hi>They are all gone out of the way.</hi> Rom. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. <hi>They goe astray, as soon as they are borne, speaking lies.</hi> Psal. 58: 3. Nay not only so, but we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ove naturally to wander, and to run away from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> compleaneth of that wicked people Ier 14: 10. Naturally, with <hi>the dromedary, we traverse our wayes.</hi> Ier. 2. 23. and run hither and thither, but never looke towards him. Nay we are like those spoken of Iob. 21: 14. <hi>We desire not the knowledge of his wayes we will have none of him</hi> Psal. 81: 11. Nor <hi>of his reproofs</hi> Prov. 1: 30.</p>
               <p>Oh how sad is this? And yet how is it more sad, that this is not beleeved, nor once considered. And that it is not beleeved, is manifest, for,</p>
               <p>1. How rare is it to meet with persons, that are not very well pleased and satisfied with themselves and their condition? They thank the Lord, it was ay well with them. They have no complaints. They see no wants, nor necessities. They wonder what makes folk complaine of their condition, of their evill heart, or of their hazard and danger. They understand not these matters.</p>
               <p>2. Do we not finde people very quiet and at rest, though <hi>they remaine in the congregation of the dead</hi> P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ov. 21: 16. They sleep in a sound skinne, because they see no hazard. The thoughts of their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never bereave them of one nights rest: no challenges have they; all is at peace with them, for the strong man keeps the house.</p>
               <p>3. How rare is it, to finde people exercised about this matter, and busied with it in their thoughts, either while alone, or while in company
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44048:60"/>
with others; or once seriously thinking and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of it, yea or so much as suspecting the matter?</p>
               <p>4 How rare is it to see any soul brocken in heart, and humbled because of this? who is walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under this as under a load? whose soul is bleeding upon the consideration of this? Is there any mourning for this?</p>
               <p>5 Where is that to be heard, <hi>Men and brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</hi> How shall we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the right way? where is that good old way, that we may walk in it? Few such questions and cases troubling consciences: and no wonder; for a deep sleep is upon them.</p>
               <p>6. How cometh it then, that the pointing forth of the way is so little hearkened unto; Sure, were this naturall condition perceived, a report of the sure and saise way, would be much more welcome, then it is. Christ by his Messengers would not be put to cry so often in vaine. <hi>This is the way, turne in hither.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is enough to convince of this ignorance, and in sensiblenesse: but it is his Spirit, which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth the world of sin,</hi> Iohn. 16. that must beare home this conviction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> It pointeth out to us this, That <hi>the way of man is not in himself</hi> Ier. 10: 23. That is, That nothing he can do, can or will prove a way to him to the Father: for Christ is <hi>the Way,</hi> as excludeing all other meanes and wayes. And that man can do nothing to help himself into the way is cleare, for,</p>
               <p>1. His way is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>is as darknesse</hi> Prov. 4: 14. He
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44048:60"/>
knoweth no better, he is satisfied therewith, there he sleepeth and resteth.</p>
               <p>2. He cannot, nor doth not desire to returne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>He hateth to be reformed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Yea, he thinketh himself saise; no man can convince him of the contrary, The way he is in <hi>seemeth right to him, though the end thereof be death,</hi> Prov. 14: 12. &amp; 16: 25.</p>
               <p>4. Every man hath his owne particular way, to which he turneth Esa. 53: 6. some one thing or other, that he is pleased with, and that he thinks will abundantly carry him through, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth he: and what these ordinaryly are, we shall hear presently.</p>
               <p>5. In this <hi>his way,</hi> which yet is a false way, <hi>he trusteth</hi> Hos. 10: 13. he leaneth upon it, little knowing that it will faill him at length, and that he and his hope and confidence shall perish.</p>
               <p>Is it not strange then to see men and women <hi>gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deing about to seek their way,</hi> as it is said, Ier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2: 36. as if they could finde it out; or as if they could of themselves fall upon the way. What a lamentable sight is it, to see people, <hi>wearying themselves with very lies,</hi> Ezech. 24: 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>and wearyed in the multitude of their owne counsells,</hi> Esa. 47: 15.</p>
               <p>But what are those false and lying wayes, which men weary themselves in, and all in vaine, &amp; which they choose &amp; trust into, and yet are not the way, which will prove sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> It will not be easie to reckon them all up, we shall name some, that are principall, and most ordinary: such as,</p>
               <p>1. Good purposes and resolutions, with which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44048:61"/>
many deceive themselves, supposeing that to be all, which is required: and alas all their purposes are like to <hi>Ephraims</hi> goodnesse, <hi>like the early cloud and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dew,</hi> that soon evanisheth: <hi>their purposes are soon brocken off,</hi> and soon disappointed, because <hi>made without counsell,</hi> Prov. 15: 22. Many foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly rest here, that they have a good minde to do better, and to amend their wayes, and they purpose after such a time or such a time, they shall beginne a new manner of life; but their purposes never come to any effect, and fo at length they and their purposes both perish.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Some convictions</hi> and <hi>inward challenges.</hi> The word now and then p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>3. <hi>Convictions followed with some sort of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Some may dreadfully deceive themselves with this, and conclude that all is right with them, and that the way they are in is saife &amp; sure: because they have had convictions, which have been so effectuall, as to cause them amend many things, and become, as to many things, changed men &amp; women, when alas their way is but a way of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44048:61"/>
still; it is not Christ, they have never, come to him. <hi>Herod</hi> hearing <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had his owne convictions and amendements: for <hi>he did many things,</hi> Mark. 6: 20.</p>
               <p>4. Many rest upon their <hi>outward civility</hi> &amp; <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> or <hi>negative holinesse.</hi> They cannot be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged for grosse faults, and that is all the way they have to rest in: alas, could not a wicked Pharise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

How many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, as to this, shall outstripe such as professe themselves Christians? and yet they lived and dyed strangers to the right way to happinesse. See what that poor young man said Luk. 18: 21.</p>
               <p>5. Some may win to more then civility, and attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne unto a kinde of <hi>outward holinesse,</hi> and outward performance of the duties of religion, such as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading, prayer, communicating; and rest there, and yet perish: for that is but <hi>their owne way;</hi> it is not <hi>the right way.</hi> Had not the <hi>foolish virgins</hi> lamps? and did they not waite with the rest Matt. 25? and will not many say in that day, <hi>we have eaten and drunken in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streats,</hi> to whom Christ shall answer, <hi>I know not whence you are, depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Luk. 13: 26, 27? were not the jewes much in duties &amp; outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances? and yet see how the Lord rejecteth them all, Esa. 1: 11, 12, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 66: 3.</p>
               <p>6. Much knowledge doth deceive many. They think because they can talk of religion, speak to cases of consciences, handle places of scripture, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44048:62"/>
the like, that therefore all is right with them: when alas that is but a slippery ground to stand upon. The <hi>Phari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ees</hi> sat in <hi>Moses</hi> seat, &amp; taught sometimes sound doctrine: and yet were heart enemies to Jesus, Mat. 23. And will not many, think to plead themselves in to heaven. By saying, that they <hi>have Prophecyed in his name,</hi> Mat. 7: 22? There is <hi>a knowledg that puffeth up</hi> 1 Cor. 13: 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some there are, whose knowledge seemeth to be opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and practicall, and not meerly speculative.

               <p>7. A <hi>kinde of seeming seriousnesse in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties,</hi> and in seeking of God, deceiveth many. They think because they are not conscious to their owne dissembling, but they look upon themselves as earnest in what they do, that therefore all is well. Sayeth not Christ, that not <hi>every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And yet they come short of their expectation: did not the <hi>foolish virgins</hi> seem earnest and serious, when they continued wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the rest, and at length, cryed <hi>Lord, Lord open unto us;</hi> and yet they were keeped at the door<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44048:62"/>
Many consider not that there is a secret and closse hypocrisie, that some may be under and not know it, as well as a grosse hypocrisie, and dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, which may be easily observed: <hi>Will not many seek to enter in, that shall not be able?</hi> Mat. 7: 13. Luk. 13. 24.</p>
               <p>8. Many may deceive themselves with this, that <hi>they are looked on by others godly discerning persons &amp; ministers, as good serious Christians,</hi> and that they carry so handsomely and faire, that no man can judge otherwayes of them, than that they are good serious seekers of God. But alas the day is comeing, which will discover many things: and many one will be deceived both of themselves &amp; of others. <hi>Not he who commendeth himself is approved; but whom God approveth.</hi> 2 Cor. 10: 18. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts <hi>Timothie to study to show him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self approved unto God,</hi> 2 Tim. 2: 15. Men look only on the outside, and cannot see in to the heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>but God searcheth the heart:</hi> and it is an easie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to deceive Men: But God will not be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>9. Some may suppose themselves in a saife and sure way, if they out stripe others in religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, and be much in extraordinary dutyes, when alas, for all that, the heart may be rotten. The <hi>Pharisee fasted twice a week.</hi> Luk. 18: 12. and yet was but an enemie to Christ. O how deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is the heart of Man!</p>
               <p>10. Inward peace and quietnesse of conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may deceive some: and they may suppose that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll is right with them, because they do nothing over the belly of their conscience. Their heart doth not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44048:63"/>
accuse them of falshood and dissimulation in their way with God or Man; but they do all things according to their light. No doubt that young Man, Luk. 18: 21. spoke according to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and light, when he said, <hi>all these things have I observed from my youth.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Act. 23: 1. <hi>that he had lived in all good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science before God till that very day.</hi> Meaning, that even while he was a Pharisee unconverted, he had not thortured his conscience, nor done any thing directly against it, but had alwayes walked according to his light. See Act. 26: 9.</p>
               <p>11. A way of Zeal may deceive many; who may think their case unquestionable, because they are Zealous for their way: and as they think their Zeal is pure zeal for God: was not <hi>Paul,</hi> while a Pharisee, very Zealous, when out of zeal to his way he persecuted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Church? Phil. 3: 6. See my zeal for the Lord, could a I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>12. Some also may put it beyond question, that they are in the right way, because, they are more strick in all their wayes, than others, and will not so much as keep fellowship or company with them, saying, with those Esa. 65: 5. <hi>Stand by, I am holier<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than thou, come not neare to me,</hi> who yet are but <hi>a smoak in Gods nose, &amp; a fire that burneth all the day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. Some may rest on, and deceive themselves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44048:63"/>
with their great attainments, and more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary experiences. When alas! we see to what a hieght some may come, and yet prove nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let such souls read with trembling that word of <hi>Paul</hi> Heb. 6: 4, 5. where we see some may come to be enlightened, to taste of the heavenly gift, to be made partakers of the holy ghost, to taste the good word of God, &amp; the powers of the world to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet prove castawayes: taking these expressions as pointing forth some thing distinct from reall grace.</p>
               <p>Many such false wayes, wherein Men please themselves, might be mentioned: By these every one may see cause of Searching &amp; trying, over &amp; over againe. It is a dreadfull thing to be deceived here; and it is best to put it to a tryall, when there is a possibility of getting the matter helped: and many may feare and tremble, when they see, they are not yet come the length of many such, as sit downe without Christ, and lose all their labour. O<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if this could put people to a serious examination &amp; tryall of themselves, and of the nature of that way, wherein they are &amp; rest at present!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> We might here observe. <hi>That this true &amp; living way is but one for all.</hi> There is but <hi>one Mediator betwixt God &amp; Man,</hi> 1 Tim. 2: 5. One Mediator for both old &amp; new Testament: the Seed of the woman: Howbeit the Lords dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with his people, in that one way, may be various; as his way with his people <hi>under the Law</hi> is different from his way with his people <hi>under the gospell;</hi> and his dispensations with individual beleevers, whether under the law, or under the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44048:64"/>
gospell, is not the same in all things.</p>
               <p>And this should teach us to relinquish our owne wayes, and to enter into this one only way: and it should move such as are in this way, to study unity and agreement among themselves; and yet not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre or suppose that Gods way with them must be in all things alike. Yea, though the Lords way with them be different from his way with others, &amp; more dark, disconsolate, and bitter; yet let them be quiet and silent before the Lord, and acknowledge his goodnesse, that hath brought them into the one only way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iesus Christ, and keepeth them there.</p>
               <p>But <hi>fourthly,</hi> the maine thing here, and which is obvious, is this, <hi>That Iesus Christ is the Way to the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the one and only way, the soveraigne and excellent way: and he alone is this way. There is not another. <hi>Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved, Act.</hi> 4: 12.</p>
               <p>For clearing of this, we shall speak a little to those foure things, and show</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>And this will make way for our clearing up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how Christ is made use of as a way by poor sinners.</p>
               <p>For the first of these, our present case &amp; necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44048:64"/>
something was spoken to it before: we shall reduce all to those two heads. The <hi>first</hi> is <hi>our state of guilt, and separation from God because of sin &amp; guilt.</hi> The <hi>next</hi> is <hi>our state of wickednesse and enmity against God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the first, we may take notice of those things.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>sin originall and actuall hath separated us from God,</hi> and cast us out of his favour, and out of that station of favour &amp; friendshipe, which once we were advanced to, in <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That <hi>we are under Gods curse &amp; wrath,</hi> and excommunicated from the presence of the Lord, by a sad, yet just, sentence, according to law, and so are under death.</p>
               <p>As to the next thing, we may take notice of those particulars</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>we are impure</hi> and <hi>polluted with sin,</hi> and dayly iniquity.</p>
               <p>2. That <hi>we are ignorant of the right way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning into favour with God,</hi> seeking out to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves many inventions.</p>
               <p>3. That <hi>we are impotent for any good work or commanded duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That not only so, but <hi>we are unwilling to do any thing that is good,</hi> or to enter into the way, when pointed out unto us; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> we are <hi>enemies to God by wicked works,</hi> &amp; have an innate hatred to all his wayes.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>We desire not to be out of the condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into we are:</hi> there we love to lie and sleep, and desire not to be roused up or awakened.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44048:65"/>6. <hi>We are under the power &amp; command of Satan,</hi> who leadeth us out of the way, yea &amp; driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us forward in the wrong way to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>tion.</p>
               <p>These things are plaine &amp; undeniable, and need no further confirmation, though alas! it is little beleeved &amp; laid to heart by many.</p>
               <p>For the second, How Christ answereth this our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ase and necessitie. He is a way to us, to helpe us out of both these, both out of our state of guilt, and separation; and out of our state of wickednesse, &amp; enmity.</p>
               <p>And first he helpeth us out of our state of guilt &amp; separation.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>Taking away our guilt</hi> &amp; sin, <hi>being made sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him</hi> 2 Cor. 5: 21. He hath filled up the great gap betwixt God &amp; us, with his body, and hath made of it, as it were, a bridge, by which we may goe over unto the Father: <hi>we enter now into the holyest by the blood of Iesus, by a new &amp; living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the vail, that is to say, his flesh,</hi> Heb. 10: 19, 20. <hi>we are now brought neer by his blood,</hi> Ephes. 2: 13. So that through him we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored againe to friendship with God, &amp; made one with him: for Christ the Mediator hath <hi>made both one, reconcileing jewes &amp; Gentils both unto God, in one body, by the crosse, having slaine the enmity,</hi> Ephes. 2: 16.</p>
               <p>2. By <hi>taking way the curse</hi> &amp; wrath, that was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ue to us, being <hi>made a curse for us,</hi> Gal. 3: 13.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44048:65"/>
So that he <hi>is become our peace,</hi> and <hi>through him, we have an accesse by one Spirit unto the Father, and are no more strangers &amp; forreigners, but fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens with the saints, and of the houshold of God,</hi> Ephes. 2: 14, 18, 19. He is <hi>set forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3: 25, 1 Iohn. 2: 2. &amp; 4: 10. <hi>by him have we now received atonement</hi> Rom. 5: 11.</p>
               <p>Next, He helpeth us out of our state of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse &amp; enmity.</p>
               <p>1. By <hi>taking away our impurity</hi> and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>by washing us &amp; cleansing us in his blood</hi> Ephes. 5: 26. 27. Col. 1: 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having purchased grace for us Ephes. 1: 3. we are blessed with all spirituall blessings in Him: He applyeth his merites and layeth the foundation of grace &amp; holinesse in the soul, &amp; carryeth on the work of mortification and vivification, and so, killing the old man by his Spirit, both meritoriously &amp; efficiently, he cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and washeth. Hence we are said, to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with him in his death, and buryed with him by baptisme into death, that we should walk in newnesse of life: and so our old Man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin, Rom. 6: 3, 4, 6. And for our dayly infirmities &amp; escapes, whereby we pollute ourselves his blood is a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine opened to the house of David &amp; to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Ierusalem, for sin &amp; uncleannesse Zach. 13: 1. and to this fountaine he bringeth, by the spirit of repentance, which he, as an exalted prince, bestoweth. Act. 5: 31. &amp; by faith. So 1 Ioh. 2: 1. <hi>If any Man sin, we have an advocat with the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44048:66"/>2. As for our ignorance &amp; blindnesse, he taketh that away, being given for a light to the Gentiles. Esai. 42: 6. &amp; 49. 6. Luk. 2. 32. He is sent to open the blinde eyes Esa. 42: 7. to bring out the prisoners from their dark prisons, Esa. 42: 7. &amp; 61: 1. Yea, he is anoynted for this end. So that such as walk in darknesse see a great light, and they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them the light hath shined, Esai. 9: 2. Mat. 4: 15. and he hath eye salve to give <hi>Revel</hi> 3: 18.</p>
               <p>3. He is qualified for taking away our impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: so that through Him, we can do all things, Phil. 4: 13. When we are weak, we are strong in him, who is our strength, and liveth in us, 2 Cor. 12. 10. Gal. 2: 20. Hence He worketh in us both to will, &amp; to do, of his owne good pleasure, Phil. 2: 13.</p>
               <p>4. He also taketh away our naturall aversenesse, unwillingnesse, wickednesse &amp; hatred of his wayes, making his people <hi>willing, in the day of his power.</hi> Psal. 110. So he taketh away <hi>the enmitie that is in us</hi> Col. 2: 20, 21. and reconcileth us to God, and to His wayes, that our hearts do sweetly comply with them, and we become most willing and glade to walk in them: yea &amp; <hi>to run the way of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements</hi> through his <hi>enlarging of our hearts,</hi> Psal. 119: 32.</p>
               <p>5. He likewise taketh away that desire and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse; which we have to lie still in our naturall condition; by convinceing us of the dreadfull hazard thereof, through the Spirit of conviction, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby he convinceth the world of in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohn. 16: 8. and circumciseth their care to hear, &amp; maketh them
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44048:66"/>
willing to hearken to the counsel of God.</p>
               <p>6. As for the power &amp; Dominion of Satan, he breaketh that, by <hi>leading captivity captive.</hi> Ephes. 4: 8. Psal. 68: 18. and <hi>spoiling the strong Mans house: for he is come to destroy the works of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> 1 Iohn. 3: 8. and <hi>He spoileth principalities &amp; powers,</hi> Col. 2: 15. Thus, as captaine of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he leadeth them out as a conquerour; having payed the price, he delivereth also by power and authoritie, from the hand of this Jailour.</p>
               <p>And thus we see, how he answereth our case and necessitie, and is a fit way for us: and though this be not questioned; yet little is it beleeved and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and lesse put in practise.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>Third particular.</hi> That <hi>He alone is this way,</hi> and answereth our case herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it needeth not be much spoken to, since it is clear and manifest, confirmed by the experience of all generations, and the disappointments of fools, who have been seeking other wayes. Angels in heaven cannot do our businesse. They cannot satisfy justice for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor have they any power over our heart to turne it as they will; nay they are not acquanted with our secret thoughts, that cabinet is keept closse from them, and reserved as the peculiar privilege of God alone. The blood of bulls and goats can not do it: for the Apostle tells us, that it is impossible that that should take away sin, Heb. 10: 4. That blood shed according to the law did cleanse cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially, but it is only the blood of Iesus, typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by that, which cleanseth really: so that we are sanctified through the offerring of the body of Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44048:67"/>
paines or labour of ours can avail here. The Lord will not be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil. He will not take our first borne for our transgression, nor the Son of our body for the sin of our soul, Micah. 6: 7. Ordinances and meanes will not do it, nor any invention of our owne, <hi>No man can by any meanes redeem his brother, or give to God a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some for him, for the redemption of the soul is precious &amp; ceaseth for ever.</hi> Psal. 49: 7. 8. He alone hath laid downe the price; all our sufferings, prayers, teares, labours, pennances, and the like, signifie nothing here; they cannot satisfie justice for one sin.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>fourth particular,</hi> viz the <hi>singularity</hi> of this way, Those things make it manifest and apparent.</p>
               <p>1. This is such a way, as can <hi>discover it self,</hi> and make it self known unto the erring traveller: Christ Iesus is such a way, as can say to the wandering soul, <hi>This is the way walk in it,</hi> Esa. 30: 25. No way can do this. This is comfortable.</p>
               <p>2. This way can not only discover it self to the wandering traveller; but also it can bring folk into it. Christ can bring souls unto himself, when they are runnig on in their wandering condition, He can move their heart to turne in to the right way, put grace in their soul for this end, beginne reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in them, and sow the seed of faith; and so stay their course, which they were violently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueing, and make them look about and consider what they are doing: as the former was good newes to poor blinde and witlesse creatures, that were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44048:67"/>
wandering, and knew not whither they were going; so this is good newes to poor souls, that finde their heart inclineing to wander, and loving to goe astray.</p>
               <p>3. This way can cause us walk in it, If we be rebellious and obstinate. He can command with authoritie: for he is given for a leader and <hi>a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> Esa. 55: 4. How sweet should this be to the soul, that is weighted with a stubborn, untra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable and unperswadable heart, that He, as a <hi>King, Governour,</hi> &amp; <hi>Commander,</hi> can with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie draw, or drive, and cause us follow and run?</p>
               <p>4. This way is Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as well as the Way, So that the soul that once entereth in here is saife for ever, no wandering here: <hi>The wayfareing men though fooles shall not erre in this way,</hi> Esa. 35: 8. <hi>He will bring the blinde by a way that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they knew not, and lead them in paths that they have not knowne; he will make darknesse light before them, and crooked things streight, those things will he do unto them, and not forsake them.</hi> Esai. 42: 16.</p>
               <p>5. This way is also Life: and so can revive the fainting and weary travailer: <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth strength:</hi> Yea, <hi>he renowes their strength, and makes them mount up with wings as eagles, and run and not be weary, and walk and not faint,</hi> Esa. 40: 29, 31. and so he giveth legs to the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller: yea he carryeth the lambs in his bosome Esa. 40: 11. O! who would not walk in this way? what can discourage the man that walketh here?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44048:68"/>
what can he feare? no way can quicken or refresh the weary man. This way can do it: yea it can quicken one that is as dead, and cause him march on with fresh alacrity and vigour.</p>
               <p>6 From all these it followeth, that this way is a most pleasant, hartsome, desireable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table way. The man is saife here, and he may <hi>sing in the wayes of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 138: 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>for wisdomes wayes are wayes of pleasantnesse, and all her paths are peace</hi> Prov. 3: 17. He is a <hi>Way,</hi> that is Food, <hi>Physick, cordials,</hi> and all that the poor traveller standeth in need of, till he come home.</p>
               <p>From all which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>re we come to particulars, we shall in generall shortly point out those dutyes, which natively result thence by way of use.</p>
               <p>1. O! what cause is there here for all of us to fall on wondering, both that God should ever have condescended to have appointed a way, how sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and rebells, that had wickedly departed from him, and deserved to be cast out of his presence and favour for ever, might come back againe, and enjoy happinesse and felicity, in the friendshipe and favour of that God, that could have gote the glory of his justice in our destruction, and stood in no need of us, or of any thing we could do: as also, that he appointed such a way, That Iesus Christ, his only Son should, to speak so, lie as a bridge betwixt God and sinfull rebells, and as a high-way that they might returne to the great God, upon him: Let all the creation of God wonder at this wonderfull condescending love of God, that appointed such a way; and of Christ, that was content to lou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> so low, as to become this way to us, this new and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44048:68"/>
way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that for this end, he should have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en on flesh, and become <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with us, and taberrackled with us, that through this vaile of his flesh, he might consecrate a way to us. Let angels wonder at this condescendency.</p>
               <p>2. Hence we may see ground of being convinced of those things 1 That naturally we are out of the way to peace and favour with God, and in a way that leadeth to death, and so, that our miserie and wreatchednesse, so long as it is, so, cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. 2. That we can do nothing for ourselves, set all our wits a work we cannot fall upon a way that will bring us home. 3. That it is madnesse for us to seek out another way, and to vex ourselves in vaine, to run to this and to that meane, or inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of owr owne, and be found fools in end. 4. That our madnesse is so much the greater in this, that we will turne to our owne wayes, that will fail us, when there is such a noble and excellent &amp; every way satisfying way prepared to our hand. 5. That our wickednesse is so desperat, that the way, which is pointed out to us, doth not please us, and that we will not enter into it, not walk in it, 6. That this Way, which is also the Truth and the Life, is only worth the Imbraceing, and is only saife and sure: we should be convinced and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the worth, sufficiency and desireablenesse of this way. Reason with ordinary light from the word may teach these things; But grace can only cary them into the heart, and make them take rooting there.</p>
               <p>3. We may read here our obligation unto those particulars. 1. To turne our bak upon all other

               <p>In a word, This pointeth out our duty, to make use of Christ as our way to the father; and only of Christ: and this leads us to the particulars we shall speak a little to.</p>
               <p>There are two maine things, which stand in our way, and hinder us from approaching to the Father, 1. <hi>Unrighteousnesse</hi> and guilt, whereby we are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally banished because of the broken covenant, and the righteous sentence of God according to that covenant: &amp; 2. <hi>Wickednesse,</hi> impurity &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holinesse, which is, as a physicall bar, lying in our way, because nothing that is uncleane can dwell and abide with him, <hi>who is of purer eyes then he can behold inquitie;</hi> and <hi>nothing that is uncleane can enter in there,</hi> where He is. So then there must be an usemaking of Christ, as a way, through both these impediments. We need <hi>justification</hi> &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

Now Christ being the way to the Father; both as to <hi>justification,</hi> in taking away the enmitie, in changeing our state, &amp; removing our unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, &amp; guilt, whereby we were lying under the sentence of the law, adjudging such sinners, as we are, to hell: and as to <hi>sanctification,</hi> in cleansing us from all our pollutions, renewing our souls, washing away our spots &amp; defilements &amp;c. He must be made use of in reference to both.</p>
               <p>In speaking to the first, we shall be the shorter, because, through God's great mercy, the gospell pure way of justification by faith in Christ, is richly and aboundantly cleared up by many worthy au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of late, both as concearning the theoreticall, and practicall part.</p>

               <p>WHat Christ hath done to purchase, procure &amp; to bring about our <hi>justification</hi> before God, is mentioned already <hi>viz.</hi> That He stood in the room of sinners, engadging for them as their cautioner, undertaking, &amp; at length paying down the ransome: becoming sin, or a sacrifice for sin, &amp; a curse for them, and so laying downe his life a ransome to satisfie divine justice: and this he hath made known in the gospell, calling sinners to an accepting of him, as their only Mediator, and to a resting upon him for life &amp; salvation; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

working- up such, as belong to the election of grace, to an actuall closeing with him, upon the conditions of the covenant, &amp; to an accepting of him, beleeving in him, &amp; resting upon him, as satisfied with, and acquiesceing in that soveraigne way of salvation &amp; justification, through a crucified mediator.</p>
               <p>Now, for such as would make use of Christ as the way to the Father in the point of <hi>justification,</hi> those things are requisite; to which we shall only premit this word of caution; That we Judge not the want of these requisites a ground to exeem any, that heareth the gospell, from the obligation to believe &amp; rest upon Christ, as He is offered in the gospell.</p>

persisting in rebellion &amp; heart opposition; not only not accepting his kindnesses &amp; offers of mercy; but contemning them, trampling them underfoot as imbittered against him. As also there must be a conviction of our <hi>actuall transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> whereby we have corrupted our wayes yet more, run further away from God, brought on more wrath upon our souls, according to that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of the law, <hi>cursed is every one that abideth not in all that is written in the law to do it.</hi> Deut. 27: 26. Gal. 3: 10. What way this conviction is begun &amp; carryed on in the soul, and to what a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure it must come, I cannot now stand to explaine: only in short know, That upon whatsoever occasion it be begun, whether by a word carryed home to the heart by the finger of God, or by some sharpe &amp; crossing dispensation, feare of approaching death, some hainous outbreaking, or the like, it is a reall thing, a heart reaching conviction, not generall &amp; notionall, but particular, plaine, and pinching, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the heart with fear &amp; terrour, making the soul seriously &amp; really to minde this matter, to be taken up with the thoughts of it, and anxiously &amp; earnestly to cry out, <hi>what shall I do to be saved,</hi> and finally will make the soul willing to hearken &amp; hear what hopes of mercy there is in the gospell, and to imbrace the way of salvation, which is there laid downe: And the reason of this is, because Christ himself tells us, <hi>The whole needeth not the phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but the sick,</hi> Mat. 9: 12. <hi>He is not come to call the righteous,</hi> that is, such as are righteous in their owne eyes, <hi>but sinners,</hi> that is, such as are no more now whole at the heart, as seeing no evill, no hazard

Because naturally we hate God &amp; Christ Iohn. 15: 23, 24, 25. and have a strong naturall antipathy at the way of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation through Iesus; therefore, nothing but strong &amp; inevitable necessity will drive us to a complyance with this gospell device of love.</p>
               <p>2. There must be <hi>some measure of humiliation:</hi> under this conviction the man is bowed down, and made mute before God; no more boasting of his goodnesse &amp; of his happy condition; no high or great thoughts of his righteousnesse; for all are now to be looked <hi>on as filthy rags,</hi> Esai 64: 6. <hi>what things were as gaine before</hi> to the soul, must now <hi>be counted losse,</hi> yea and <hi>as dung</hi> Phil. 3: 7, 8. The man must be cast downe, in himself, and far from high and conceity thoughts of himself, or of any thing he ever did, or can do: <hi>for the Lord resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> Jam 4: 6. 1 Pet. 5: 5. He <hi>reviveth the Spirit of the humble.</hi> Esa 57: 15. <hi>He that humbleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall be exalted,</hi> Mat. 18: 4. &amp; 23: 12. Luk. 14: 11. &amp; 18: 14.</p>
               <p>3. There must be a <hi>despaireing of getting help or relief</hi> out of this condition, <hi>by our selves,</hi> or any thing we can do: a conviction of the unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all things under the sun for our reliefe: No expectation of help from our supposed good heart, good purposes, good deeds; works of charity, many prayers, commendation of others, sober &amp;

harmlesse walking, or any thing else within us or without us, that is not Christ: for so long as we have the least hope or expectation of doing our owne businesse without Christ, we will never come to Him. Our heart hangeth so after the old way of salvation through works, that we cannot endure to hear of any other, nor can we yeeld to any other: could we but have heaven by the way of works; we would spare no paines, no coast, no labour, no expences; Nay we would put ourselves to much paine &amp; torment by whippings, cuttings, fastings watchings, and the like; we would not spare our first borne; nay, we would dig our graves in a rock with our nailes, and cut our owne dayes, could we but get heaven by this meanes: such is our antipathy at the way of salvation through a crucified Christ, that we would choose any way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that, cost what it would: therefore before we can heartyly close with Christ &amp; accept of him, we must be put from those refuges of lies, and see that there is nothing but a disappointment written on them all, that all our prayers, fastings, cryes, dutyes, reformations, sufferings, good wishes, good deeds &amp;c, are nothing in his eyes, but so many provocations to the eyes of his jealousie, and so, further causes of our misery.</p>
               <p>4. There must be a <hi>rational, deliberate, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute relinquishing of all those things in our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, on which our heart is ready to dote.</hi> The Man being convinced of the vanity of all things, by which he hath been hopeing for salvation, must now purpose to loose his grips off them, to turn his back upon them, to quite them with purpose

of heart, &amp; say to them, <hi>get you hence,</hi> as Esa. 30: 22. This is to <hi>deny our selves,</hi> which we must do, ere we become his disciples Mat. 16. 24. This is <hi>to forsake our Fathers house</hi> Psal. 45: 10. and to <hi>pluck out our right eye,</hi> &amp; <hi>to cut off our right arme.</hi> Mat. 5: 29, 30. This abandoning of all our form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er false props &amp; subterfuges must be <hi>resolute,</hi> over the belly of much opposition within, from the carnall &amp; naturall inclinations of the heart; and of much opposition without, from Satan's insnareing suggestions, &amp; deceitfull temptations: It must be a <hi>real, rational act of the Soul,</hi> upon solide and through conviction of their unprofitablenesse; yea of their dangerousnesse &amp; destructivenesse.</p>
               <p>5. There must be <hi>some knowledge of the nature of the gospell covenant,</hi> and of the way, which now God hath chosen, whereby to glorifie his grace in the salvation of poor sinners. That God, Father, Son, &amp; Holy ghost thought good, for the glory of free grace, and wisdome, in a way of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice &amp; mercy, to send Jesus Christ to assume mans nature, and so become God &amp; man in two distinct natures, &amp; one person for ever; &amp; to become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law, to undergoe the curse thereof, and to die the cursed death of the crosse, to satisfie Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and to pay the ransome for the redemption of the elect. In which undertaking our Lord was a servant Esa. 42: 1. &amp; 49: 6. &amp; 52: 13. &amp; 53: 11. Zech. 3: 8.

God &amp; the Mediator: and the Mediator undertaking was obliged to performe all that he undertook, and accordingly did so: for as the Lord <hi>laid on him,</hi> or <hi>caused to meet together on him, the iniquitie of us all</hi> Esa. 53: 6. So in due time <hi>He bear our griefs and carryed our sorrowes: He was wounded for our transgressions &amp; bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was upon him: He was cut off out of the land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and stricken for the transgression of his people. He made his soul an offering for sin, &amp; bear the iniquities of his people.

So that <hi>what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his owne Son in the likenesse of sinfull flesh, for sin,</hi> (or by a sacrifice for sin) <hi>condemned sin in the flesh</hi> Rom. 8: 3. <hi>that the righteousnesse of the law might be fulfilled in us</hi> vers. 4.

There must, I say, be some knowledge of, and acquantance with this great mysterie of the gospell, wherein is declared <hi>the manifold wisdome of God</hi> Ephes. 3: 10. and with the noble designe of God in sending his Son after this manner, to die the death, that condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sinners might live, and returne to the bosome

               <p>6. There must be a perswasion of the sufficiency, compleatnesse &amp; satisfactorynesse of the way of salvation, through this crucified Mediator; el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

He must be sure, that salvation is only to be had this way; And that undoubtedly it will be had this way; that so with confidence he may cast himself over on this way, and sweetly sing in hope of a noble outgate. And therefore he must beleeve, that Christ is really God as well as Man, and a true Man, as well as God; that he is fully furnished for the work of Redemption, having the spirit given to him without measure; and endued fully and richly with all qualifications, fitting him for all our necessiries, &amp; inabling him to <hi>save to the uttermost all that come unto God by him,</hi> Heb. 7. 25; that <hi>He is made of God to us wisdome, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, sanctification and redemption,</hi> 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Yet it would be knowne, that this act of faith,

               <p>2. In some, the acts and actings of this faith may be more clear, and discerneable, both by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and by spirituall on-lookers: In others so covered over with an heape of doubts, unbeleef, jealousie, &amp; other corruption, that the actings of it can hardly, or not at all, be perceived by themselvs or others, so that nothing shall be heard but complaints, feares, doubtings, and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>3. In some, this faith may have strong, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible actings, wreastling thorow much discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragment and opposition, and many difficulties; as in that woman of Canaan Matth. 15. runing tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

opposition or discouragement may be sufficient to make the soul give over hope, &amp; almost dispaire of overcomeing and wining thorow: &amp; be as a bruised reed, or a smoaking flax.</p>
               <p>4. In some, though it appeare not strong, &amp; vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or wilfull (in a manner) in its actings; yet it may be <hi>firme, fixed,</hi> &amp; <hi>resolute,</hi> in staying upon Him, Esa. 26: 3, 4. and trusting in Him. Psal. 125. 1. resolving to hing there, and if it perish It perisheth. In others weak, &amp; bashful.</p>
               <p>5. In some, it may be yet weaker, going out in <hi>strong &amp; vehement hungerings,</hi> Mat. 5: 6. The man dar not say, that he doth beleeve, or that he doth adhere to Christ, and stay upon him; yet he dar say, he longeth for him, and panteth after Him, as ever <hi>the hart doth after the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>6. in some, it may be that weak, that the soul can only perceive <hi>the heart looking out after Him:</hi> upon little more ground, than a <hi>may be</hi> it shall be helped Esai. 45: 22. They look to Him for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, being convinced that there is no other way, and resolved to follow no other way, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to lye at his door, waiting and looking for à sight of the kings face, and to lye there waiting till they die, if no better may be.</p>
               <p>7. In some, it may be so weak, that nothing more can be perceived, but a <hi>satisfaction with the tearmes of the covenant,</hi> a willingnesse to accept of the bargane, and an heart consenting thereunto, though they dar not say, that they actually close therewith, yea nor dar say, that they shall be welcome Revel. 22: 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:44048:76"/>8. In some, it may be so weak and low, that they cannot say, that they have any right hunger or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire after Him, nor that their heart doth rightly and really consent to the covenant of grace; yet they would faine be at it, and cry out oh for a willing heart. O for ardent desires! O for a right hunger! and they are dissatisfied and can not be reconciled with their hearts, for not desireing more, hungering more, consenting more; so that if they had this, they would think themselvs happy and upmade. And thus we see their faith is so low, that it appeareth in nothing, more manifestly, than in their complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the want of it.</p>
               <p>So then the poor weak beleever needeth not be so far discouraged, as to dispaire and give over the matter as hopelesse &amp; lost: let him hang on, depend, and waite; a week faith to day may become stronger within a short time. He that laid the foundation, can and will finish the building, for all <hi>his Works are perfect.</hi> And a weak faith, when true, will prove saving, and lay hold on a saving strong Mediator.</p>
               <p>Moreover, as to the acting of faith on <hi>Christ's death and sacrifice;</hi> for stopping the mouth of <hi>Conscience, Law, Satan,</hi> and for opposeing to the pursueing Justice of God because of sin.

                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44048:77"/>This is a maine businesse, and of great concearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet many are not much troubled about it, nor exercised at the heart hereabout, as they ought, deceiving themselves with foolish imaginations; for</p>

               <p>2. Or they think, because God is mercifull, he will not be so severe, as to stand upon all those things, that Ministers require; forgetting that He is a just God, and a God of truth, that wil do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what He hath said.</p>
               <p>3. Or they suppose, it is an easie matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, &amp; not such a difficult thing as it is called: not considering or beleeving, that no lesse power, than that, which raised Christ againe from the dead, will worke up the heart unto faith.</p>
               <p>4. Or they resolve that they will do it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, at some more convenient season; not perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cunning slight of Satan in this, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that faith is not in their power, but the gift of God; and that if they lay not hold on the call of God, but harden their heart in their day, God may judicially blinde them, so that these things shall be hid from their eyes; and so that occasion, they pretend to waite for, never come.</p>

               <p>3. His being appointed of the Father, to be me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the covenant, and particularly to lay down his life a ransome for sin; and Christs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking all his offices, and performeing all the duties thereof, conforme to the covenant of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a strong encouragement to poor sinners

to come to Him; because He cannot deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and he will be true to his trust.</p>
               <p>4. The Fathers offering of him to us in the gospell, and Christs inviteing us, who are weary, and heavy loaden; yea calling and commanding such to come to him, in his owne, and in his Fathers name, under the paine of his and his Fathers wrath and everlasting displeasure; exhorting further and requesting upon tearms of love, pressing earnestly by many motives, sending out his ambassadours to beseech, in his stead, poor sinners to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and to turne in to him for life and salvation: yea upbraiding such as will not come to him: all these are a sufficient warrant for a poor necessitous sinner to lay hold on his offer.</p>
               <p>And further, to encourage poor souls to come unto him, all things are so well ordered in the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as that nothing occurreth, that can in the least prove a stumbling block, or a just ground of excuse, for their forbearing to beleeve, and to accept of his offer: all objections possible are obviated to such, as are but willing? the way is cast up; and all stones of stumbling cast out of it; so that such as will not come can pretend no excuse.

Nor can they object their changeablenesse, that they will not stand to the bargan, but break and returne with the dog to the vomite: for Christ hath engadged to bring all thorow that come to him, He will raise them up at the last day, Joh. 6: 40.

The covenant is fully provided with promises to stoppe the mouth of that objection. Nor can they object the difficulty, or impossibility of beleeving: for that is Christ's work also. He is the author and finisher of faith Heb. 12: 1. Can they not with confidence cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selvs upon him; yet if they can hunger and thirst for him, and look to him, he will accept of that: <hi>look to me</hi> (sayes he) <hi>and be saved</hi> Esa. 45: 22. If they cannot look to him, nor hunger &amp; thirst for him; yet if they be willing, all is well: are they willing that Christ save them in his way, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willingly give themselves over to him, and are willing and content, that Christ by his spirit work more hunger in them, and a more lively faith, and <hi>work both to will and to do according to his owne good pleasure.</hi> it is well.</p>

Corrupt nature is averse from this, and would at least mix something of self with him, and not rest on Christ only: corrupt nature would not have the man wholly denying himself, and following Christ only: and hence many lose themselves and lose all; because with the <hi>Gallatians</hi> they would mix the law and the gospel together; do something themselvs for satisfaction of justice, &amp; take Christ for the rest that remaines.

alsufficient Mediator. And is not this most reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable? Ought we not to take Him for all the ends and purposes, for which God hath appointed Him, and set Him forth, and offered Him to us? What then can any suppose to lie here, which should scarre a soul from laying hold upon Him? Nay should not this be looked upon as a very great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement? And should we not blesse the Lord, that hath provided such a compleet and alsufficient Mediator?</p>
               <p>7. We are to take <hi>Him,</hi> and <hi>all the crosses,</hi> that may attend our taking or following of Him: <hi>we must take up our crosse,</hi> be it what it will be, that He thinketh good to appoint for us, <hi>and follow Him.</hi> Matth. 16: 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mark. 8: 34. for <hi>he that taketh not up his crosse, and followeth not after Him, is not worthy of Him.</hi> Mat. 10: 38. I know, flesh and blood will take this for a hard saying; but they, that consider, that Christ will beare the heavyest end of the crosse, yea all of it, and so support, them by his Spirit, while they are under it, that they shall have no just cause to compleane; and how He will suffer none to goe his errand, upon their owne charges, but will <hi>be with them, when they goe through fire and watter,</hi> Esai. 43: 2. so that they shall suffer no losse, <hi>neither shall the watters over flow them; nor the fire kindle upon them:</hi> and that <hi>he who loseth his life, for Christ's sake, &amp; the gospels, shall save it.</hi> Mark. 8: 35. yea, that <hi>they shall receive an hundered fold for all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:44048:81"/>
see no discouragement here, nor ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint; nay, they will account it their glory to suffer any losse for Christ's sake.</p>
               <p>8. Hence it followeth, that we are to take Him, so as to <hi>avouch Him, and his cause, and interest, on all hizards,</hi> stand to his truth, and not be ashamed of Him, in a day of tryall. <hi>Confession of Him must be made with the mouth, as with the heart we must beleeve</hi> Ro. 10: 9. Let corruption speak against this what it will, because it is alwayes desireous to keep the skinne whole: yet reason cannot but say, that it is equitable, especially, seing He hath said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>whosoever confesseth Him before men, He will confesse them before his Father which is in heaven.</hi> Mat. 10. 32. And that, if <hi>we suffer with Him, we shall also reigne with Him.</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 12. Is He our Lord and Master, and should we not owne and avouch Him? Should we be ashamed of him for any thing, that can befall us, upon that account? What Master would not take that ill at his servants hands?</p>
               <p>Hence then we see, that there is nothing in all the conditions, on which He offereth Himself to us, that can give the least ground, in reason, why a poor soul should draw back, and be unwilling to accept of this noble offer, or think that the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are hard.</p>
               <p>But there is one maine <hi>Objection,</hi> which may trouble some, and that is. They cannot beleeve: faith being the gift of God, it must be wrought in them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How then can they goe to God for this, and make use of Christ for this end, that their souls may be wrought up to a beleeving &amp; consenting to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44048:81"/>
the bargan and hearty accepting of the offer?</p>
               <p>To this I would say these things.</p>
               <p>1. It is true, that <hi>faith is the gift of God.</hi> Ephes. 2: 8. and that it is <hi>He alone who worketh in us, both to will &amp; to do</hi> Phil. 1: 29, and <hi>none cometh to the son, but whom the father draweth</hi> Iohn. 6: 44. and it is a great matter, and no small advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to win to the reall faith, and through con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this our impotency: for thereby the soul will be brought to a greater measure of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, and of despaireing of salvation in it self, which is no small advantage unto a poor soul that would be saved.</p>
               <p>2. Though faith be not in our power, yet it is <hi>our duty:</hi> Our impotency to performe our duty, doth not loose our obligation to the duty; so that our not beleeving is our sin; and for this God may justly condemne us. His wrath abideth on all, who beleeve not in his Son Jesus, and will not accept of the offer of salvation through the crucified me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. And though faith, as all other acts of grace, be efficiently the work of the Spirit, yet it is formally our work: we do beleeve; but it is the Spirit that worketh faith in us.</p>
               <p>3. The ordinary way of the <hi>Spirit's working faith in us,</hi> is by <hi>pressing home the duty upon us,</hi> whereby we are brought to a despairing in ourselves and to a looking out to Him, whose grace alone it is that can work it in the soul, for that necessary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and breathing, without, which the soul will not come.</p>
               <p>4. Christ Jesus hath purchased this grace of faith, to all the elect, as other graces necessary to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44048:82"/>
their salvation: and it is promised and convenanted to Him; that <hi>He shal see his seed</hi> and shall <hi>see of the travell of his soull</hi> Esai. 53: 10, 11. and that by the knowledge of him, that is, the rationall and understanding act of the soul griping to and laying hold upon Him, as he is offered in the gospell, <hi>many shall be justified:</hi> Ibid. Hence he sayeth, <hi>that all, whom the father hath given to Him, shall come unto Him,</hi> Ioh. 6: 37. and the Apostle tels us, that we are <hi>blessed with all spiritual blessings in Him,</hi> Ephes. 1: 3.</p>
               <p>5. Not only hath Christ purchased this grace of faith, and all other graces necessary for the salvation of the elect; but <hi>God hath committed to Him the administration and actuall dispensation and outgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all those graces,</hi> which the redeemed stand in need of. Hence, <hi>He is a Prince exalted to give re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and forgivenesse of sinns</hi> Act. 5: 31. <hi>all power in heaven and earth is committed unto him.</hi> Mat. 28: 18: 19. Hence, He is called the <hi>author and finisher of faith</hi> Heb. 12: v. 2. and He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his disciples Iohn. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13. 14. That <hi>whatever they shall ask in his name, He will do it.</hi> He is <hi>made Prince and a Saviour,</hi> having <hi>all judgment committed unto him.</hi> Iohn. 5: 22. and <hi>He is Lord of all</hi> Act. 10: 36. Rom. 14: 9.</p>
               <p>6. Hereupon, the sinner being convinced of his lost condition, through sin and misery: of an utter impossibility of helping himself out of that state of death: of Christ's alsufficiency, and willingnesse to save all that will come to Him; and of its owne inability to beleeve or come to Him for life and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; or to lay hold on and leane to his merites
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44048:82"/>
and satisfaction, and so despaireing in himself, is to look out to Iesus the author of eternall salvation, the foundation and chiefe corner stone, the author and finisher of faith. I say, the sinner, being thus convinced, is thus to look out to Iesus; not that, that conviction is any proper qualification, prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite as necessary, either to prepare, dispose, and fit for faith, or, far lesse, to merite, any manner of way, or bring on faith; But because this is Christ's methode to bring a soul to faith by this convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to the glory of his grace. The soul natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally being averse from Christ, and utterly unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to accept of that way of salvation, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacted to that straite, that it shal see, that it must either accept of this offer, or die: as the whole needeth not a physitian; so Christ is come to save only that which is lost: and his method is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world of sin, in the first place, and then <hi>of righteousnesse</hi> Iohn. 16: 8, 9.</p>
               <p>7. This looking out to Iesus for faith, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth those things 1. The Souls acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the necessitie of faith, to the end it may partake of Christ, and of his merites. 2. The souls satisfaction with that way of partaking of Christ; by a closeing with Him, and a resting upon Him, by faith 3. A sense and conviction of the unbeleefe and stubbornnesse of the heart; or a seeing of its own impotency, yea and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse to beleeve 4. A persuasion that Christ can overmaster the infidelity, &amp; wickednesse of the heart, and worke up the soul to a willing consent unto the bargane. 5. A <hi>hope,</hi> or <hi>a half hope</hi> (to speak so) <hi>that Christ, who is willing</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44048:83"/>
                  <hi>to save all poor sinners, that come to Him for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and hath said, that He will put none away in any case, that cometh, will have pity upon him at length. 6. A resolution to lye at his door, till he come with life, till He quicken, till He unite the soul to Himself. 7. A lying open to the breathings of his Spirit, by guarding against every thing (so far as they can) that may grieve or provok Him, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on Him in all the ordinances, He hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for begetting of faith; such as reading the scriptures, hearing the word, conference with godly persons, and prayer &amp;c. 8. A waiting with patience on Him, who never <hi>said to the house of Iacob, seek me, in vaine,</hi> Esai. 45: 19. still crying, and looking to Him, who hath commanded the ends of the earth to look to him; and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for him, <hi>who waiteth to be gracious,</hi> Esai. 30: 18. remembering that they are all <hi>blessed that waite for him,</hi> Ibid. and that there is much <hi>good prepared for them, that waite for Him.</hi> Esai. 64: 4.</p>
               <p>8. The sinner would <hi>essay this beleeving,</hi> and <hi>closeing with Christ,</hi> and set about it, as he can, seriously, heartily, &amp; willingly, yea and resolutely over the belly of much opposition, and many discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, looking to Him, who must helpe, yea and worke the whole work: for God worketh in and with Man, as a rationall creature. The soul then would set the willingnesse it findeth on work, &amp; waite for more; and as the Lord is pleased to commend, by his Spirit, the way of grace more unto the soul, and to warme the heart with love to it and a desire after it, strick the yron while it is
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44048:83"/>
hote; and looking to Him for help, gripe to Christ in the covenant: and so set to its seal, though with a tembling hand; and subscribe its name, though with fear and much doubting, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that He who worketh to will, must work the deed also Phil. 2: 13. and He that begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a good work will perfect it, Phil. 1: 6.</p>
               <p>9. The soul essaying thus to beleeve, in Christ's strength, and to creep when it can not walk or run, would hold fast what it hath attained, and resolve never to recall any consent, or half consent, it hath given to the bargane, but still look forward, hold on, wreastle against unbeleefe, and unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; intertaine every good motion of the Spirit for this end, and never admit of any thing, that may quench its longings, desires, or exspecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nay 10. If the sinner be come this length, that with the bit willingnesse he hath, he consenteth to the bargane, &amp; is not satisfied with any thing in himself, that draweth back, or consenteth not, &amp; with the little skill or strength he hath is writing downe his name, and saying even so I take Him. and is holding at this, peremptorily resolving, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to goe bake, or unsay what he hath said; but on the contrare, is firmly purposed to adhere, &amp;, as he groweth in strength, to grippe more firmly, and adhere to Him, he may conclude, that <hi>the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan is closed already,</hi> and that <hi>he hath faith already:</hi> for, here ther is an accepting of Christ on his owne tearmes, a reall consenting unto the covenant of grace, though weak, and not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable, as the soul would wish. The soul dar
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44048:84"/>
not say, but it loveth the bargane, and is satisfied with it, and longeth for it, and desireth nothing more than that it might partake thereof, and enjoy Him whom it loveth, hungereth for, panteth after, or breatheth, as it is able, that it may live in Him, &amp; be saved through Him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Some will say,</hi> If I had any evidence of God's approbation of this act of my soul, any testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Spirit, I could then with confidence say, that I had beleeved &amp; accepted of the covenant and of Christ offered therein: but so long as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing of this; how can I suppose, that any motion of this kinde in my soul, is real faith?</p>
               <p>For <hi>answere.</hi> 1. We would know, that our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, and God's sealing to our sense are two distinct acts, and separable, and oft separated: our beleeving is one thing, and God's sealing with the holy Spirit of promise to our sense, is another thing; and this followeth though not inseparably the other Eph. 1: 13.—<hi>In whom also, after that yee beleeved, yee were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so, 2. We would know, that Many a man may beleeve, &amp; yet not know that he doth belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve; He may set to his seal, that God is true, in his offer of life through Iesus, and accept of that offer as a truth, and close with it; and yet live under darknesse &amp; doubtings of his faith, long &amp; many aday; <hi>partly</hi> through not discerning the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith; <hi>partly</hi> through the great sense and feeling of his owne corruption and unbeleefe; <hi>partly</hi> through a mistake of the operations of the spirit within, or the want of a clear &amp; distinct uptaking
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44048:84"/>
of the motions of his owne soul; <hi>Partly</hi> because he findeth so much doubting and feare, as if there could be no faith, where there were doubting or fear, contrare to Mark. 9: 24. Mat. 8: 26. &amp; 14: 31. <hi>Partly</hi> because he hath not that perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that others have had, as if there were not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious degrees of faith, as there is of other graces, &amp; the like.</p>
               <p>Therefore 3. We would know, that many may really beleeve, and yet misse this sensible sealing of the Spirit which they would be at: God may think it not yet seasonable to grant them that, lest they forget themselves and become too proud; and to traine them up more to the life of faith, whereby He may be glorified; and for other holy ends, He may suspend the giving of this for a time.</p>
               <p>4. Yet we would know, that all that beleeve, have the seal within them 1. Iohn. 5: 10. <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth on the Son of God, hath the witnesse in himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is,</hi> He hath that which really is a seal, though he see it not, nor perceive it not; even the work of God's spirit in his soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inclining and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineing him unto the accepting of this bargan, &amp; to a likeing of &amp; endeavouring after holinesse: and the whole gospel clearing up what faith is, is a seal &amp; confirmation of the businesse. So that the matter is sealed, and confirmed by the word, though the soul want those sensible breathings of the Spirit, sheding abroad his love in the heart, and filling the soul with a full assurance, by hushing all doubts and feares to the door; yea though they should be a stranger unto the Spirits witnessing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44048:85"/>
thus with their spirits, that they are the children of God, and clearning up distinctly the reall wot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of grace within their soul, and so saying in effect, that they have in truth beleeved.</p>
               <p>But enough of this, seing all this and much more is abundantly held forth and explained, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>that excellent &amp; usefull treatise of Mr. <hi>Guthries</hi> intituled <hi>The Christians great interest.</hi>

               <p>That we may therefore, in some weak measure, through the helpe of His light and grace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44048:85"/>
some things to cleare up this great and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth, we shall first speak a little to it, in the generall, and then come to cleare up the matter more particularly.</p>
               <p>Before we speak of the matter in generall, it would be remembered, <hi>first,</hi> That the person who only is in case to make use of Christ for <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> is one, that hath made use of Him already for <hi>Righteousnesse &amp; justification:</hi> for one who is a stranger to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is living in nature, hath no accesse to Christ for sanctification. He must be a beleever and within the covenant, ere he can make use of the grounds of sanctification, laid down in the covenant. One must first be united to Christ, and justified by faith in Him, before he can draw any vertue from Him for perfecting holinesse. He must first <hi>be in Him</hi> before he can <hi>grow up in Him,</hi> or <hi>bring forth fruit in Him.</hi> And therefore the first thing that souls would goe about, should be to get an union made up with Christ, and be cloathed with his righteousnesse by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then they have a right to all his benefites: first they should labour to get their state changed from enmity, to peace &amp; reconciliation with God, through faith in Jesus.</p>
               <p>Yet, <hi>next,</hi> it would be observed. That when it is said, that one must be a beleever, before he can go to Christ, &amp; make use of Him for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holinesse &amp; sanctification; it is not so understood, or said. That one must know, that indeed he is justified by faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before he can make any use of Christ for sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One may be justified, and a beleever, yea and growing in grace through Iesus Christ, and so

actually improving the grounds of sanctification, and making use of Christ for this end, and allowed thereunto, and yet win to no certainty, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </hi> It is true, a clear fight of our interest in Christ by faith, would be a great encouragement to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident approaching to, and usemaking of Him, in all things; and this consideration should mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Nay 20 we would remember, for our encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and confidence, that in carrying on of this work lyeth the satisfaction of soul, &amp; the pleasure of the Lord, that must prosper in His hand, &amp; thus He seeth his seed, &amp; hath of the travail of his soul, and is satisfied.</p>
               <p>These particulars rightly considered will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto us, what a noble ground for sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is in Christ laid downe for beleevers, which they may, and must, by faith, grippe to, that they may grow in grace, and grow up in Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perfecte holinesse; and what a wonderfull

contriveance of grace this is, wherein all things are made so sure for beleevers; Christ becomeing all things to them, and paveing a royall &amp; sure way for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sure for them, and glorious to himself.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>second</hi> particular; that is, How belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to carry in this matter, or how they are to make use of Christ, and of those grounds of saucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in Christ, which we have mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There are some things which they would bewar of, and guaird against: as,</p>
               <p>1. They would bewar of an <hi>heartlesse despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> &amp; giving way to discouragements, and heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the language of unbeleefe, or to the suggestions of Satan, whereby he will labour to perswade them of the impossibility of getting the work of sanctification throughed, or any progresse made therein to purpose. Satan &amp; a deceitfull heart can soon muster up many difficultyes, &amp; alledge that there are many Lyons, many insuperable difficultyes, in the way, to discourage them from ventureing forward: and if Satan prevail here, he hath gained a great point. Therefore the beleever would keep up his head in hope, and beware of multiplying discouragements to himself, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeing the matter impossible; for then shall he neither have heart nor hand for the work, but sit downe &amp; wring his hands, as overcome with discouragement, &amp; despondency of Spirit.</p>
               <p>2. They would beware of <hi>wilfull rejecting their owne mercyes,</hi> and forbearing to make use of the grounds of hope of strength and progresse, in the matter of sanctification, which Christ hath allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them to make use of. There is such an evill
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44048:91"/>
even amongst Gods children, that they scarre at that which Christ out of great love hath provided for them, and dar not with confidence make use of nor apply to themselves, the great and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able promises, to the end they might be encouraged: they will not take their allowance, as thinking themselves unworthy; and that it should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption in them to challenge a right to such great things; and they think it commendable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in them, to stand aback; and so wilfully refuse the advantages and helps, that make so much for their grouth in grace.</p>
               <p>3. They would beware of <hi>a carelesse neglect of the meanes,</hi> appointed for advanceing in holinesse: for though the meanes do not worke the effect, yet it is by the meanes, that God hath chosen to worke the work of sanctification: Here that is to be seen, that the hand of the diligent maketh rich; and the field of the slothfull is soon grown over with thorns and nettles; so that poverty cometh as one that travelleth, and want as an armed man. <hi>Prov.</hi> 24: 30, 31, 34. It is a sinfull tempting of God, to think to be sanctified another way, than God hath in his deep wisdom condescended upon.</p>
               <p>4. Yet they would <hi>beware of laying too much weight on the meanes &amp; ordinances;</hi> as if they could effectuat the businesse. Though the Lord hath thought good to work in and by the meanes; yet He himself must do the work. Meanes are but meanes, and not the principal cause; nor can they work, but as the principal agent is pleased to make use of them, and to work by them: when we leane to the meanes, and to instruments, we prejudge our
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44048:91"/>
selves; by disobligeing God, and provoking Him to leave us, that we may wrestle with the ordinances alone, and finde no advantage. Therefore the soul would guaird against this.</p>
               <p>5. Albeit the meanes can do nothing unlesse He breath, yet we would <hi>beware</hi> not only of negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting them (as we said afore) but also <hi>of a slighting way of performing of them,</hi> without that earnestnesse and diligence, that is required. <hi>Cursed is he who doth the work of the Lord negligently. Ier.</hi> 48: 10. Here then is the speciall art of Christianity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, to be as diligent, earnest, and serious in the use of the means, as if they could effectuate the matter, we were seeking; and yet to be as much abstracted from them, in our hopes and exspectation, and to be as much leaning on the Lord alone, and depending on Him for the blessing, as if we were useing no meanes at all.</p>
               <p>6. They would <hi>beware of slighting and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the motions of the Spirit:</hi> for thereby they may lose the best opportunity. They should be alwayes on the wing, ready to imbrace the least motion; and they should stand alwayes ready, waiting for the breathings of his Spirit, and open at his call; least afterward, they be put to call and seek, and not attaine what they would be at, as we see in the Spouse <hi>Cant.</hi> 5: 2, 3, 4. 5, 6. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>7. They would also <hi>guaird against the quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Spirit</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: 12. or <hi>greiving of the Spirit. Ephes.</hi> 4: 30. by their unchristian &amp; unsuteable carriage: for this will much marre their sanctification. It is by the Spirit that the work of sanctification is carryed on, in the soul: and when
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44048:92"/>
this Spirit is disturbed, and put from his work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how can the work go on? When the motions of this indwelling Spirit are extinguished, his work is marred, and retarded: and when He is grieved, he is hindered in his work. Therefore souls would guard against unbeleefe, despondency, unsuteable &amp; unchristian carriage &amp;c.</p>

               <p>That by this meanes the soul may be jealous of it self, and despaire of doing any thing in its owne strength; and so be fortified against that maine evill, which is an enemy to all true sanctification, <hi>viz confidence in the flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The soul would keep its eye fixed on those things.</p>
               <p>1. On <hi>Christ's alsufficiency</hi> to helpe, in all cases, that <hi>He is able to save to the uttermost. Heb.</hi> 7: v. 25.</p>

               <p>3. On the <hi>commands to holinesse:</hi> such as those <hi>cleanse your hands, and purify your hearts Iam</hi> 4: 8. and <hi>be ye holy for</hi> I <hi>am holy</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 15, 16. and the like. That the authority of God, and conscience to a command, may set the soul a work.</p>
               <p>4. On the <hi>great recompense of reward,</hi> that is appointed for such as wrestle on, and endure to the end; and on all the great promises of great things to such, as are sanctified, whereof the Scriptures are full; that the soul may be encouraged to run thorow difficultyes, to ride out stormes, to endure hardnesse, as a good souldier, and to persevere in duty.</p>
               <p>5. On the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the many sad <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> and <hi>denunciations, of wrath,</hi> against such as transgresse his lawes; and on all the sad things
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44048:93"/>
that such as shake off the fear of God, and the study of holinesse, have to look for, of which the Scripture is full; that by this meanes, the soul may be keeped in awe, and spurred forward unto duty, and made the more willing to shake off Leazy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>6. On the <hi>Rule, the word of God;</hi> by which alone we must regulate all our actions; and this ought to be our meditation day and night, and all our study, as we see it was <hi>Davids<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and other holy men of God their dayly work. See <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. and 119.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In all this study of holinesse, and aimeing at an hiegher measure of grace, the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would lavell at a right end: and so would not designe holinesse for this end, that he might be justified thereby, or that he might thereby procure and purchase to himself heaven and God's favoure for the weight of all that, must lie on Iesus Christ, who is our Righteousnesse: and our holinesse must not dethrone Him, nor rob Him of his glory, which He will not give to another: But would study holinesse, to the end, he might glorifie God, Father, Son, and holy Spirit; and please Him, who calleth to holinesse; and thereby be made <hi>meet to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Inheritance of the saints in light Col.</hi> 1: 10, 12. and be made a meet bride for such a holy bridegroome, and a member to such an holy head: that hereby others might be edified <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 12. and 3: 1, 2. that the soul may look like a temple of the holy ghost, and like a servant of Christ's, bought with a price 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6: 17, 18, 10. 20. And have a clear evidence of his regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44048:93"/>
and justification, and also that he may expresse his thankfulnesse to God, for all his favours and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly.</hi> The soul would by faith lay hold on, and grip fast to the ground of sanctification: that is to say. 1. To what Christ hath <hi>purchased</hi> for his people. 2. To what as a publike person He hath <hi>done</hi> for them: And so by faith,</p>
               <p>1. Challenge a right to, and lay hold on the promises of grace, strength, victory, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, in their combating with corruption within, and Satan and a wicked world without.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Reckon themselves dead unto sin, through the death of Christ; and alive unto God through his resurrection, Rom.</hi> 6: 4, 11. and that <hi>the old man is crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be destroyed vers.</hi> 6. and that <hi>they are now, not under the law, but under grace, vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>That by this meanes, they may be encouraged to continue fighting against a vanquished enemy, and not give over, notwithstanding of disappointments, discouragements, prevailings of corruption, &amp;c. and the beleever may know upon what ground he standoth, and what is the ground of his hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectation of victory in end; and so he <hi>may run, not as uncertanely; and so fight, not as one that beateth the aire</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9: 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> In this work of sanctification, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever would be much in the lively exercise of faith; fight by faith; advance by faith; grow up, and bring forth fruit by faith: and so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>1. The beleever would be oft renewing his grips of Christ, holding Him fast by faith, and so abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eing
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44048:94"/>
in Him, that he may bring forth fruit <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15: 4, 5.</p>
               <p>2. Not only would he be keeping his union fast with Christ, but he would be also eyeing Christ by faith, as his store house, and generall Lord dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sator of all the purchased blessings of the Covenant, which he standeth in need of: and looking on Christ, as standing engadged by office, to compleate his work of salvation; and to present him with the rest to himself holy, without blemish, yea and without spote or wrinkle or any such thing <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 27.</p>
               <p>3. He would by faith gripe to the promises, both of the generall stock of grace, the new heart &amp; heart of flesh, and the Spirit to cause us walk in his statutes <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36: 26, 27. and of the severall particular acts of grace, that he standeth in need of, such as that <hi>Ier.</hi> 30: 8. <hi>I will cleause them from all their iniquities</hi> &amp;c. so <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36: 25: <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 19. as the Church doth <hi>Micah.</hi> 7: 9. <hi>He will subdue our iniquities</hi> &amp;c. And so <hi>having,</hi> or gripping <hi>these promises,</hi> we are to <hi>cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of flesh &amp; Spirit, and perfect holinesse in the fear of God.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7: 1.</p>
               <p>4. As the beleever would by faith draw out of Christ, through the conduite of the promises, which are <hi>all yea &amp; amen in Him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. grace, strength, knowledge, courage, or what ever his fight in this warfare calleth for, to the end, he may be <hi>strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, Ephes.</hi> 6: 10. So he would by faith roll the weight of the whole work upon Christ; and thus cast himself, and his care and burden on Him, who careth for him, 1 <hi>Pat.</hi> 5: 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 37: 5. &amp;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44048:94"/>
55: 22. and so go on in duty, without anxiety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who beareth the weight of all, and who hath undertaken to work both to will and to do, according to his good pleasure: thus should the work be easie and saife, when by faith we roll the burden on Him, who is the chosen one, fitted for that work; and leave it on Him, who is our strength, patiently waiting for the outgate, in hope.</p>
               <p>Thus the beleever makes use of Christ, as made of God <hi>Sanctification,</hi> when in the use of meanes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, eyeing the covenant of grace, and the promises thereof, and what Christ hath done to Sanctifie and cleanse his prople, he rolleth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on Him, and exspecteth help, salvation &amp; victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, through Him.</p>
               <div type="cautions">
                  <head>CAUTIONS.</head>
                  <p>But least some should be discouraged, and think all this in vaine, because they perceive no progresse, nor grouth in grace, for all this, but rather corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as strong and troublesome as ever, I would say a few things to them.</p>
                  <p>1. Let them search and try, whether their short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming and disappointment doth not much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from this, that the matter is not so cleanly cast over on Christ, as it should be: Is it not too oft found, that they goe forth to the battell in their own strength, lippening to their owne stock of grace, to their own knowledge or to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the like? How then can they prosper?</p>
                  <p>2. Let them mourne, as they get any discovery of this; and guaird hereafter against that corrupt by as of the heart, which is still inclining them to an engadgment, without the Captane of their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44048:95"/>
and a fighting without the armour of God.</p>
                  <p>3. Let them try and see, if in studying holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, they be not led by corrupt ends: and do not more laboure after sanctification, that they may be more worthy, and the better accepted of God, and that they may have quietnesse and peace as to their acceptance with God, as if this were any cause, matter or condition of their righteousnesse and justification before God; then that they may shew their obedience to the command of God 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4: 3. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 10. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15: 16. and expresse their thankfulnesse to Him, and glorifie God <hi>Mal.</hi> 1: 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 16. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17: 10. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: 30. and if so, they ought to acknowledge Gods goodness in that disappointment, seing thereby they see more and more a necessity of laying aside their own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and of betaking themselves to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ, and of resting on that alone, for peace and acceptance with God.</p>
                  <p>4. They would try and see, if their negligence and carelesnesse in watching, and in the discharge of duties, do not occasion their disappointments &amp; shortcomeing. God sometimes thinks fit to suffer a lion of corruption to set on them, that they may look about them, and stand more vigilantly upon their watch tour, knowing that they have to do with a vigilant adversary, <hi>the devil,</hi> who as a <hi>roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lion goeth about, seeking whom he may devoure</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5: 8. and that <hi>they fight not against flesh &amp; blood; but against Principalities, against powers, against the Rulers of the darknesse of this world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> against spirituall wickednesse in high places. Ephes.</hi> 6: 12. It is not for nought, that we are so often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44048:95"/>
to watch <hi>Mat.</hi> 24: 42. &amp; 25: 13. &amp; 26: 41. &amp; 14: 38. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21: 36. <hi>Mark</hi> 13: 33, 34, 35, 37. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16: 13. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: 6. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>5. They would try and see, whether there be not too much self confidence, which occasioned <hi>Peter's</hi> foule fall: God may, in justice and mercy, suffer corruption to break loose upon such, at a time, and tread them underfoot, to learne them afterward to carry more soberly; and to <hi>work out their salvation with fear &amp; trembling Phil.</hi> 2: 12. remembering what a Jealous holy God He is, with whom they have to do; what an adversary they have against them; and how weak their owne strength is.</p>
                  <p>6. This would be remembered, that one may be growing in grace, and advancing in holinesse, when to his apprehension, he is not going forward from strength to strength, but rather going back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. It is one thing to have grace, and another thing to see that we have grace: so it is one thing to be growing in grace, and nother thing to see that we are growing in grace. Many may questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their grouth in grace, when their very questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it may evince the contrary: for they may conclude no grouth, but rather a back going, because they perceive moe and more violent, and strong corruptions, and hidden works of darknesse and wickednesse, within their souls, than ever they did before; while as that great discovery, sheweth the Increase of their spirituall knowledge; and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease in this is an increase in grace. So they may
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44048:96"/>
question and doubt of their grouth, upon mistakes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as thinking corruption alwayes strongest, when it makes the greatest stirre &amp; noise; Or their complaints may flow from a vehement desire they have to have much more sanctification, which may cause them overlook many degrees they have advanced: or some such thing may occasion their darknesse and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; yea God may think it fittest for them, to the end they may be keeped humble and diligent, to be in the dark as to their progresse; whereas if they saw, what advancement &amp; progresse they had made in christianity, they might grow wanton, secure, and carelesse, and so occasion some sad dispensation to humble them againe.</p>
                  <p>7. It would be remembered, that perfect victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not be had here: it is true, in respect of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, through the imputation of the perfect righteousnesse of Christ; and in respect of their sincerity and gospel simplicitie, and in respect also of the parts of the new man, beleevers are said to be perfect; Such an one was <hi>Noah Gen.</hi> 6: 9. and <hi>Iob. Cap.</hi> 1: 1, 8. see also <hi>Psal.</hi> 37: 37, and 64: 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 6. <hi>Heb</hi> 5: 14. <hi>Iam.</hi> 3: 2. And it is true, we are to aime at perfection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to pray for it, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5: 48. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13: 11. <hi>Col.</hi> 4: 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1: 4. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5: 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 1. Yet as to the degrees of holinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; sanctification, and in respect of the remnant of corruption within, there is no full perfection here. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9: 20, 21. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 12. for even he who is washen, and as to justification, is cleane every whit, yet needeth to wash his feet, because contracting filth, in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13: 10. So that <hi>if the Lord should</hi>

                     <hi>mark iniquity, no man should stand. Psal.</hi> 130: 3. &amp; 143: 2. There will stil be in the best something, more or lesse; of that battell, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. So that they will stil have occasion to cry out with him <hi>vers.</hi> 24. <hi>O! wretched man that I am, who shall deliver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The place of perfection is above, where all tears are wiped away, and the weary wreastler is at rest.</p>
                  <p>8. Let them not mistake, and think, that every stirring of corruption in the soul, argueth its dominion and prevailing power. Corruption may stirre and make a great deal ado, where it cannot get leave to reigne; and be as a violent and cruell invader, seeking the throne, putting the whole kingdom in a combustion, who is resisted with force of armes. Corruption may be more quiet and still, when indeed it hath the throne of the soul: as a conquerour may be more quiet and still, when he hath overcome, and is in peacable possession of the kingdom, than when he was but fighting for it: when the strong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> man keeps the house, and is Master, than all is quiet, and at rest, till a stronger come to thrust him out, and dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse him.</p>
                  <p>9. Sanctification doth not alwayes consist, in a mans freedom from some corruptions: for there may be some corruptions, that one hath no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination to; but, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44048:97"/>
no inclination to prodigality, and ranting, or such like vices, which are contrary to their humor, or to their constant education: and Satan may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> get more advantage, by plying his temper and genius, and so carying him away to the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary evill; and so, though this man know not so much, as what it is once to be tempted to those vices, yet that will not say, that he is a sanctified man; farr lesse will it say, that he hath more grace than another man, whose predominant that evil is, and against which he is dayly fighting and wreast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Whence it appeareth, that wreastling, and protesting against even an overcoming corruption, may evidence more of grace, than freedom from some evils, to which some are not so much tempted, and to which they are naturally lesse inclined.</p>
                  <p>10. Nor should they think, that corruption is alwayes master of the soul, and possessing the throne as a full conquerour, when it prevaileth and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeth the soul head-long, at a time: for corruption may sometimes come in upon the soul as an inu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Therefore this being such an enemie, and so dangerous an enemie, so constant and implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an enemy, so active<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and closse an enemie, so deadly and destructive; it is the beleevers part, to guaird against this enemy, to have a vigilant eye upon it, to carry as an irreconcilable enemy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and therefore never to come in tearms of capitulation, or agreement, therewith, never o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>2. Though the beleever should have a maine eye upon the Body, this innate, strong and forcible law of sin and death; yet should he have friendshipe and familiarity with no part, member or lust of

               <p>5.

The beleever would remember that this ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is not for him to fight against alone, and that his owne strength and skill will make but a slender opposition unto it: It will laugh at the shaking of his spear: it can easily insinuate it self, on all occasions, because it lyeth so neare &amp; close to the soul, alwayes resideing there, and is at the beleevers right hand, whatever he be doing, and is alwayes openly or closely, opposeing, and that with great facility: for it easily besetteth <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 1. because it lyeth within the soul, &amp; in all the faculties of it, in the Heart, Minde, Will, Conscience &amp; Affectiones; so that upon this account, the deceitfulnesse of the heart is great, &amp; passeth the search of Man <hi>Ier.</hi> 17: 9.

And beside this slight and cunning, it hath strength and power to draw, by lusts, into destruction and perdition 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4: 9. and to carry the soul headlong.

And therefore the beleever must lay aside all his carnall weapons, in dealing with this adversary; and look out for divine help &amp; assistance, even for the promised Spirit, through which alone he can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed &amp; inabled for this great work; for of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self he can do nothing, not so much as think a good thought as of himself 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3: 5. fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>3. As they would bring the particular lust, or lusts, unto Christ, as chiefe Lord justice; so they would alwayes lay the axe to the root of the tree; and crave justice against the maine body, that yet lieth within the soul; and these particular corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and affections, that are as members of that body of sin, should put them in minde of the old man; for they should <hi>crucifie the flesh with the affections and lusts thereof Gal.</hi> 5: 24. the body and the members: these lusts are the lusts of sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of that Head-sin, which hath a law, or the force and impulse of a law, in the soul: and therefore, their maine designe would be against this root, where lyeth the strength and body of the enemy, and which acteth in those members; this is the capitall enmity, and should be mainely opposed: and the following of this course, would prove more

It is true, Beleevers may be keeped from some grosse outbreaking of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which sometime prevailed, as <hi>Peter</hi> was from relapseing into an open and down-right denying his Master; yet that same corruption did afterward stirre, though not so violently as to carry him to such an hieght of sin; yet so farr as to cause him do that, which was a partiall denying of his Master, when <hi>Paul</hi> withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the Gentils, for fear of them of the circumcision &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Though we should not finde present ease and quiet, by our following this way; yet we should think it much, if the Lord helpe us to stand, when we have done all we can; though we meet not with the hoped for successe presently: If he give us grace to continue, without wearying or fainting, and to be resolute never to give over, we have reason to blesse Him: if we be keeped still in the conflict with pursuite of the enemy, it is our great advantage; the victory shall come, in God's owne time. If our opposition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>15. Yea, if we get quietnesse or ease from the violence of rageing lusts, for any little time; and be not continually driven and carryed head-long therewith, we ought to be thankful for this, and to walk humbly before Him; lest He be provoked, through our unthankfulnesse and pride, to let these furious dogs loose upon us againe.</p>
                  <p>16. When we are bending our strength and all our forces against some one corruption or other, which possibly hath been most troublesome to us; we would not be secure as to all others; or think that we are in hazard only on this side: for Satan may make a sainte here; and really intend a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Let us so then fight against one member of this body of death, as to have our eye upon others, lest when we think to keep out Satan at the fore door, he enter in at the back door. He can make use of extremities, and play his game, with both; yea, and gaine his poynt, if we be not aware.</p>

                  <p>But further <hi>Fiftly,</hi> some may say. If I were keeped from yeelding, my wrestling and standing would yeeld me some comfort; but when lust so stirreth, as that it conceiveth, and bringeth forth sin <hi>Iames</hi> 1: 15. what can support or comfort me then?</p>

Corruption can not stirre in us, but therein we sinne, for the very first rise, the <hi>motus primo-primi,</hi> as they are called, are sinfull, being contrare to the holy law of God: and the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeing of that Old man, is our sin; for it is sinfull and rebellious against God, yea it is very enmity &amp; rebellion it self: when Satan cometh with a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from without, he findeth alwayes much in us, to intertaine the temptation. So that the very stirring of corruption, which is occasioned by the temptation from without, is ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

measure of Mortification attained, where lust some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not only enticeth, but conceiveth and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth sin. The sad experience of many of God's worthies, registrated in the word, cleareth this abundantly. We must not say, Such an one is fallen, Therefore he is dead. <hi>Paul</hi> reasoneth otherwayes <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>3. Yet even then, when lust conceiveth and bringeth forth sin, this may comfort and bear up the heart of a poor beleever, 1. That though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption prevail so farr, as to bear down all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition &amp; run downe all that standeth in its way; yet it getteth not the full consent of the soul, there is still a party for God, in the soul, that opposeth, so farr as to protest against it, or at least, to dissent from it, and not to will, that which yet is done, and positively to will that which cannot be gotten effectuated. 2. And farther this may bear up the poor soul, that there is a party within, which, though for a time, dureing the violent overruning of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, can do little more than sigh &amp; groan in a corner, yet is waiting &amp; longing for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, when it may appear more for God, and against that wicked usurper. 3.

It may suffice, that the prevailing of others may encourage thee to hope, that, at last, thy strong corruptions shall also fall by the hand of the same grace of God.</p>

And all of them point out a speciall piece of work, which lieth on all, that would see the face of God, <hi>viz.</hi> to be holy, gracious and growing in grace.</p>

               <p>For <hi>answere</hi> whereunto, though, by what we have said in our former discourse, it may be easie to gather what is to be said here; yet I shall briefly put the Reader in minde of those things, as usefull here.</p>
               <p>1. The Beleever would consider, what an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this is to the soul, to have on this new m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

What hazard is in the want of holinesse, when without it we cannot see God <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 14. How unanswereable it is unto our profession, who are members to such a holy Head, to be un holy? What profite, joy and satisfaction there is, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these and other motives unto this study of sanctification, would arme the soul with resolution, and harden it against opposition.</p>
               <p>2. It would be remembered, that this work, though it be laid upon us, as our duty, and we be called thereunto of God; yet it is beyond our hand and power: it is true, at conversion, the seed of grace is cast into the soul, new habites are infused, a new principle of life is given, the stonny heart is changed into an heart of flesh; yet these principles and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits can not act in themselves, or be brought into act, by any thing that a beleever, considered in himself and without divine helpe, can do: But this work of sanctification, and grou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

We would remember, that of our selves we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3: 5. and that <hi>He must work in us both to will and to do, of his owne good pleasure Phil.</hi> 2: 13. Albeit no beleever will question the truth of this; yet it may be, it shall be found af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter tryal, that one maine cause of their not growing in grace, and making progresse in this work, is their not acting as beleeving this; but setting about the work, as if it were a work, which they themselves could master, and do, without speciall divine help: Therefore the beleever would abide, live and act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the faith of this truth.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore beleevers would not, in going about this work, either trust to their own strength, to the habites of grace, to their former experiences, to their knowledge and pairts, or the like; nor yet would they trust to any externall meane, which they are to go about: because the wisdome, strength and helpe, which their case calleth for, is not to be found in them: yet they should not think of laying these meanes and dutyes aside; for then should they sin against God, they should prejudge themselvs of the helpe, strength and supply, which God useth to convey to the soul, in &amp; by the use of the meanes: and withall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they should tempte the Lord, by prescribing another way to Him, than He hath thought good to take: The beleever then would use the meanes and duties prescribed, and that diligently, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>iously and constantly; and yet would leane as little to them, and exspect help &amp; reliefe as little from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if he were not
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44048:117"/>
useing them at all, as we said above. And indeed this would be a right way, yea the most advantagious and profitable way, of going about dutyes, to be diligent in the use of them, because of Gods command; and yet to place out hope and exspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation in God alone, and to look above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for our help.</p>
               <p>4. Albeit it be true, that the power and grace of God, alone, doth beginne, and carry on this work of sanctification in the soul; yet, though he might, did He but see it for his glory, carry on and finish this work in the so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l, without the interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of second causes or meanes, he hath notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thought it fit, forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> glory of his name, to worke this work, by meanes, and particulary by beleevers setting about the work: He worketh not in man, as if he were a block or a stone, but useth him as a rationall creature, endued with a rationall soul, having useful and necessary facultyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and having a body fitted by organs to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ubservient to the soul, in its actions. Therefore the beleever must not think to lye by and do nothing: for he is commanded <hi>to worke out his owne salvation,</hi> and that because <hi>it is God that worketh in him, both to will and to do:</hi> Because God worketh all, therefore he should worke; so reasoneth the Apostle: so that God's working is an argument and motive to man to worke, and not an argument to him to lye by idle, and do nothing. And here is the holy art &amp; divine skill, requisite in this businesse, to wit, for the believer to be as diligent and active, as if he could bring forth fruit, in his own strength, and by his owne working; and yet to be as abstracted
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44048:118"/>
from himself, his owne grace, ability, knowledge and experience, in his working, as if he were lying by like a mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>5. The soul, that would make progresse in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, and grow in grace, would remember, that Christ is proposed to us, as a copy, which we are to imitate; and that therefore we should set Christ continually before us, as our patterne, that we may follow his steps. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 15. and 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>1. But with all, it would be remembered, that He is not like other ensamples or copies, that can helpe the man, that imitateth them, no other way than by their objective prospect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for looking by faith on this copy, will bring vertue to the man, that studyeth to imitate, whereby he shall be inabled to follow his copie the better.

                  <p>3. It would be remembered, that there may be some progresse made in the way of holinesse, when yet the beleever may apprehend no such thing; not only because the measure of the grouth may be so small and indiscernable, but also because even where the growth in it self is discernable, the Lord may think it good for wise ends, to hide it from their eyes, that they may be keeped humble, and diligent; whileas if they saw how matters stood indeed with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they might, (without a new degree of grace) swell and be puffed up, yea even forget God, and misken themselves and others

too. Likewise this may proceed from such an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire after more, that they forget any measure they have gotten. and so despise the day of small things.</p>
                  <p>4. There may be a progresse in holinesse, though not in that particular, which the beleever is most eying, to his sense and apprehension: for when he thinks he is not growing in <hi>Love</hi> to, and <hi>Zeal</hi> for, God &amp;c. he may be growing in <hi>Humility,</hi> which is also a memb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>5.

                  <p>6. But withall, it would be observed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this gracious frame of soul, that is silent before God, under severall disappointments, is accompanied with much singleness of heart, in panting after more holiness, and with seriousness and diligence in all commanded dutyes, waiting upon the Lord, who is their hope and their salvation, in each of them: and with mourning for their own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full accession to that shortcoming in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>7. We would not think that there is no progress in Christianity, or grouth in grace, because it cometh not our way, or by the instruments and meanes, that we most expect it by: possibly we are too fonde o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>8. Nor would we think, that there is no grouth in the work of grace, because it cometh not at such or such a prelimited or fore-set time: nor would we think the matter desperate, because of our looking long, and waiting, and asking, and labouring, and yet seeing no sensible advantage: Such and such a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44048:124"/>
beleever (sayeth the soul) made great progresse in a short time, but I come no speed, for as long as I have been at this school. O! we should beware of limiteing the holy one of Israel, Let us be at duty, and commit the event to Him.</p>
                  <p>9. It is not a fit time, to take the measure of our graces, as to their sensible grouth and fruitfulnesse, when devils are broken loose upon us; temptations are multiplyed, corruptions make a great noise, and we are meeting with an horrible tempest shaking us on all hands: for it will be strong grace, that will much appear then; It will be a strong faith, that will say, <hi>though He kill me, yet will I trust in Him.</hi> At such a time it will be much, if the man keep the ground he hath gained, though he make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress: It will be much for a tree to stand, and not be blowne out of the ground, in the time of a strong and vehement storme of winde, though it keep not its flourishes, &amp; yeeld not fruit.

                  <p>10. We would not alway measure our graces by what appeareth outwardly; for there may be some accidental occurrence, that may hinder that: and yet grace be at work within doors, which few or none can observe.

Have not some complained of their fruitlesnesse and want of grouth, that other good Christians would have thought themselves very happy, if they had but advanced half so farre, as they saw them to have done?</p>
                  <p>2. But be it so, as it is alleiged, what if the fault be their owne? what if the cause of this be, that they attempt things in their owne strength, leaning to their own understanding, or habites of grace, or meanes &amp;c. and that they do not go about duties, with that single dependence on Christ that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, nor do they suck life, strength and sap from Him by faith, through the promises; nor give themselvs up to Him by faith, that He may worke in them both to will and to do?

                  <p>4. Withall, they would do well to hold on in duty, looking to Christ for help, and rolling all difficulties on Him, give themselves away to Him, as their Head and Lord, and so continue their life of faith, or their consenting to let Christ live in them by faith, or work in them by his Spirit, what is welpleasing in his sight, and waite for the blessing and fruit, in God's own time.</p>

                  <p>2. No great measure is promised to any absolutly. So much indeed is secured to all beleevers, as shall carry them to heaven, as without which they cannot see God: but much as to the degrees depends on our performing through faith the conditions requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, to wit, on condition of our abideing in the vine, of our acting faith on Him &amp;c. and when these &amp; the like conditions are not faithfully performed by us, what can we exspect?

The consideration and saith of the covenant of Redemption, wherein both the Fathers engadgment to the Son, and the Sons engadgment to the Father, secureth grace and holinesse, and salvation to the beleever.

                  <p>2. The consideration of the noble and faithfull promises, contained in the covenant of Grace, which shall be all made good in due time.</p>

Though there be no actuall pardon of sins, till they be committed, and repented of, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the tenor of the gospell <hi>Matth.</hi> 3: 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 13: 3. <hi>Act.</hi> 2: 38. &amp; 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22. yet, while Christ <hi>beare all the sins of his people upon the crosse,</hi> they were all then <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>meritoriously</hi> taken away: of which Christ's resurrection was a certane pledge and evidence: for then gote He his acquittance from all, that either law or justice could charge Him with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in behalfe of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for whom He laid downe

               <p>6. So that by vertue of Christ's death, there is a way laid down, in the covenant of grace, how the sinns of the elect shall be actually pardoned. <hi>viz.</hi> That at their conversion and first laying hold on Christ by faith, all the sins, whereof they then stand guilty, shall be actually pardoned and forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in their justification: and all their after sins shall also be actually pardoned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon their grip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ of new by faith, and turning to God by repentance. And this way is agreed to by <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> and revealed in the gospel, for the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and encouragement of beleevers: and all to the glory of his free grace. <hi>In whom we have redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (sayeth the Apostle <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1: 7, 8, 9.) <hi>through his blood, the forgivenesse of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein He hath abounded toward us, in all wisdom and prudence; having made known unto us the mystery of his will, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good pleasure, which He purposed in himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Beside Christ's <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> which give ground of hope of pardon of dayly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakings; there is likewise his <hi>Intercession</hi> usefull for this end: for sayeth the Apostle <hi>Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1 <hi>Epist.</hi> 2: 1. 2.—<hi>If any man sin, we have an advocat with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins.</hi> This intercession of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>sion, and sitting at the Fathers right hand. And thus, as beleevers are reconciled to God by Christs death, they are saved by his life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 10. So that Christ's living for to be an intercessour, makes the beleevers sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation sure; and so layeth down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a ground for taking away of dayly outbreakings, which, if not taken away, would hinder and obstruct the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers salvation.</p>
               <p>8. And as for the condition requisite to renewed pardon, <hi>viz faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> Christ is the worker of both: for He <hi>is a Prince exalted to give Repentance,</hi> first and last <hi>Act.</hi> 4: 30. and as He is <hi>the author of faith,</hi> so He is <hi>the finisher of it Heb.</hi> 12: 2.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>second</hi> particular, namely, what belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers should do for getting the guilt of their dayly failings and outbreakings taken away by Christ: or how they should make use of Christ for this end; I shall for clearing of it, propose those things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.</p>
               <p>1. We would beware to think, that all our after
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44048:129"/>
actuall transgressions are actually pardoned, either when Christ dyed, or when we first beleeved in Christ, as some suppose; for sin cannot properly be said to be pardoned before it be committed, <hi>David</hi> was put to sue out for pardon, after his actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all transgression was committed; and not for the mere sense and feeling of the pardon, or the intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to his Spirit, when he cryed out <hi>Psal,</hi> 51: 2—<hi>blot out my transgressions, wash me</hi> &amp;c. &amp; vers. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities</hi> and vers. 14. <hi>deliver me from blood guiltinesse.</hi> Sure when he spoke thus, he sought some other thing, than intimation of pardon to his sense and conscience; for that he desired also, but in far more clear expressions <hi>vers.</hi> 8. <hi>make me to hear joy and gladnesse</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <hi>restore unto me the joy of thy salvation &amp;c.</hi> Scripture phrases to expresse <hi>remission</hi> import this. viz <hi>Covering of sin, Pardoning of debts, Blotting out of sins Hideing of God's face from sins,</hi> not <hi>Remembering of them, Casting of them behinde his back, Casting of them into the sea, Removing of sins Psal.</hi> 103: 12. <hi>a lifting off of sin, or Taking it away, a Non-imputation of sin Psal.</hi> 33: 1, 2. These and the like phrases, though many of them be metaphoricall; yet do all of them clearly evince, that sin must first have a being, before it can be pardoned. The same is clearly imported by the gospel conditions, requisite before Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, such as <hi>acknowledgment of sin</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 9. which we see was practised by the worthies of old, <hi>David Psal.</hi> 32. &amp; 51. <hi>Nehemiah Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Ezra Cap</hi> 9 &amp; <hi>Daniel Chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Confessing and Forsaking</hi> of it <hi>Prov.</hi> 28: 13. <hi>Sorrowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it</hi> &amp; Repenting of it, and laying hold on Christ by faith,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44048:129"/>
&amp;c. The reason why I propose this, is not only to guaird against this <hi>antinomian</hi> error: but also to guaird the soul from security, to which this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath a naturall tendency: for if a person once think, that all his sins were pardoned, upon his first beleeving, so that many of them were pardoned before they were committed; he shall never be affected for his after transgressions, nor complean of a body of death, nor account himself miserable upon that account, as <hi>Paul</hi> did <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 24. nor shall he ever pray for remission, though Christ hath taught all to do so, in that patern of prayer; nor shall he act faith upon the promises of pardon, made in the covenant of grace, for after transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or for transgressions actually committed <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 34. &amp; 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>2. The beleever would remember, that, among other things, antecedently requisite to remission of posterior actuall transgressions, <hi>gospel Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> is especially required <hi>Luk.</hi> 13: 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 2. <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 18: 28, 30, 32. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15: 17, 18 <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This makes them more warry in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44048:130"/>
time coming, and carefull: <hi>for behold</hi> (sayes the Apostle 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7: 11.) <hi>This self same thing that yee sorowed after a godly sort, what carefulnesse it wrought in you; yea, what clearing of yoursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves; what indignation, yea what feare; yea, what vehement desire; yea what Zeal; yea what reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge; &amp;c.</hi> Thus is God glorified in his justice, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 4. and his mercy is acknowledged, in not entering with us into judgement, nor cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into hell, as He might have done in justice.</p>
               <p>3. Yet it would be remembered, that though it hath seemed good in the Lord's eyes, to chuse this method, and appoint this way of obtaining pardon of sins dayly committed, for the glory of his grace and mercy; and likewise for our good, we must not ascribe too much unto Repentance, in the matter of pardon: we must not make it a cause of our remission, either efficient or meritorious: we must not think, that it hath any hand in appease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wrath of God, or in satisfying of justice: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don must alwayes be an act of God's free grace, unmerited at our hands; &amp; procured alone through the merites of Christ: we must not put repentance in Christ's room and place, nor ascribe any imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection unto his merites, as if they needed any sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from any act of ours: we must beware of lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our Repentance, and godly Sorrow, even so far as to think to commend ourselves to God thereby, that we may obtaine pardon.</p>
               <p>4. The beleever would consider seriously the dreadfulnesse of their condition, who are lying under the lash of the law for sin, The law <hi>sayeth,</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:44048:130"/>
                  <hi>cursed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the law:</hi> and every sin is a transgression of the law: so that, acording to law and justice, they are in hazard: for evry sin in it self exposeth the sinner to eternal wrath, sin being an offence against God who is a righteous judge, and a breach of his law. A right sight and apprehension of this, would serve to humble the sinner before God, and make him more earnest in seeking out for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that this obligation to punishment might be removed.</p>
               <p>5. The beleever would not only consider the sin it self; but also take notice of all its <hi>Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> There are peculiar aggravations of some sins, taken from the time, manner and other circumstanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, which rightly considered will helpe forward the work of humiliation: And the sins of beleevers have this aggravation, above the sins of others, that they are committed against more love, and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Love, and against more opposition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of the grace of God within the soul, against more light and conviction &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, their humiliation upon this account ought to be singular and serious, So was it with <hi>David,</hi> when he took notice of the speciall aggravations of his sin <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 4, 6, 14. and <hi>Ezra. cap.</hi> 9. &amp; <hi>Nehemiah</hi> Cap. 9. and <hi>Daniel</hi> Cap 9. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering of sin with its due aggravations, would helpe to prize mercy at an high rate, and cause the soul more willingly waite for, and more seriously seek after Remission; knowing that God is more angry for great sins, than for sins of infirmity, and may therefore pursue the same with sorer judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44048:131"/>
as He broke <hi>David's</hi> bones, withdrew his comforts &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. The beleever would be convinced of an <hi>impossibility of doing any thing in himself,</hi> which can procure pardon at the hands of God: should he weep, cry, afflict himself, &amp; pray never so, all will do nothing by way of merite; for the taking away of the least sin, that ever he commited: and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of this would drive him to despaire in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and be a meane to bring him cleanly off him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and to look out for mere mercy in Christ Jesus. So long as, through the deceitfulnesse of Satan, the false heart inclineth to the old byas, and hath its eye upon any thing in it self, from whence it draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth its hops and expectation of pardon and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it will not purely act faith on Christ for this end, and so he will lose all his labour, and in end be disappointed. Therefore the beleever would guard against this, and that so much the more, that the false deceitful heart is so much inclined thereto; and that this deceit can sometime work so cuningly, that it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can hardly be discerned, being fairded over with many false glosses and pretexts; and that it is so dishonourable to Jesus, and hurtful and prejudicial to the soul.</p>
               <p>7. The beleever would act faith on the promises of pardon in the new covenant, as having a right to them through Jesus Christ, and challenge with humble boldnesse, the fulfilling of the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that 1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>If we confesse our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins.</hi> So that the beleever may not only take hold of mercy, and grace in God, as an incouragement and invitation
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44048:131"/>
to go to God for pardon; but even of the justice and righteousnesse of God, because of his faithful promises: and the beleever would have here a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall eye to Christ, <hi>in whom all the promises<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are yea and amen;</hi> and look for the accomplishment of them through Him, and for his sake alone.</p>
               <p>8. Faith would eye Christ, as <hi>hanging upon the crosse,</hi> and offering up himself, through the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Spirit, a sacrifice to satisfie divine justice, for all the sins of his own chosen ones: we cannot think, that Christ bare but some of their sins, or only their sins, committed before conversion; and if he bare all, as the Father laid all upon Him, the beleever is to lay hold on Him by faith, as hanging on the crosse, as well for taking away of the guilt of sins committed after conversion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. His sacrifice was a sacrifice for all, <hi>and He bare our sins</hi> without distinction or exception, <hi>in his owne body on the tree,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 24. <hi>David</hi> had his eye on this, when he cryed out <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 7. <hi>purge me with hysope,</hi> hysope being sometimes used in the legall purifications, which typified that purification, which Christ really wrought, when He gave himself a sacrifice for sin <hi>Levit.</hi> 14: 6. <hi>Num.</hi> 19: 18.</p>
               <p>9. The beleever looking on Christ, dying as a Mediator, to pacifie the wrath of God, and to make satisfaction to the justice of God, for the sins of his people, would <hi>renew his consent unto that gracious, and wise contriveance of heaven,</hi> of pardoning sins, through a crucified Mediator, that mercy and Justice might kisse each other, and be glorified together: and declare againe his full satisfaction
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44048:132"/>
with Christ's satisfying of justice for him, and taking away the guilt of his sins, by that blood, that was shed upon the crosse, by taking those sins, whereof now he standeth guilty, and for which he is desireous of pardon, and by faith nail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the crosse of Christ, and rolling them on his shoulders, that the guilt of them, as well as of the rest, might be taken away, through the merites of his death and satisfaction. Thus the beleever consenteth to that noble act of free grace, whereby the Lord made all our sins to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on Christ, when he taketh those particular sins, wherewith now he is troubled, and casteth them in into the heape, that Christ, as the true scape-goat, may carry all away. This is to lay our hands on the head of our sacrifice.</p>
               <p>10. The beleever hath another ground of comfort to grippe to, in this case, and that is, Christ's eternall Priesthood, whereby he makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for the transgressions of his people, and as their advocate and atturnay with the father, pleadeth their cause, whereby he is able to save them to the last, and uttermost step of their jurnay, and so to save them from the guilt of all casuall and emergent sins, that might hinder their salvation: So that the beleever is to put those sins, that now he would have pardoned, into the hands of Christ, the everlasting intercessour and alsufficient advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, that He, by vertue of his death, would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a new pardon of these their failings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and transgressions, and deliverance from the guilt thereof; and their acceptance with the Father not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding of these transgressions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:44048:132"/>11. Thus beleevers eyeing Christ as Dying, Riseing againe, Ascending, and as Sitting at the Fathers right hand, there to be a Priest for ever, after the order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> and to interceed for his owne, and to see to the application of what benefites, pardons, favours, and other things they need, from all which they have strong ground of comfort and of hope, yea and assurance of pardon, would acquiesce in this way; and having laid those particular sins, under the burden whereof they now groan, on Christ the mediator, dying on the crosse to make satisfaction, and ariseing to make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what was purchased, and having put them in his hand, who is a faithfull High priest, and a noble Intercessour, would remember, that Christ is a <hi>Prince exalted to give Repentance and Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and so exspect the sentence even from Him, as a Prince now exalted, and as having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that of the Father, even a power to forgive sins, justice being now sufficiently satisfied, through his death; yea &amp; as <hi>having all power in heaven and in earth,</hi> as being <hi>Lord both of the dead and of the living.</hi> Sure a right thought of this would much quiet the soul, in hope of obtaining pardon through Him; seing now the pardon is in his owne hand, to give out, who loved them so dearly, that he gave himself to the death for them, and shed his heart blood to satisfie justice for their transgressions. Since he, who hath procured their pardon at so dear a rate, and is their atturnay to agent their businesse at the throne of grace, hath now obtained the prayed-for &amp; looked-for pardon, and hath it in his ownehand, they will not question but He will
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44048:133"/>
give it, and so absolve them from their guilt.</p>
               <p>12. The beleever, having taken this course, with his dayly provocations, and laid them all on Him, would <hi>acqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>sce in this way,</hi> and not seek after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he may obtaine pardon. Here he would rest, committing the matter by faith in prayer to Christ, &amp; leaving his guilt and sins on Him, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the pardon: yea conclude, that they are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pardoned: and that for these sins, he shall never be brought unto condemnation; whatever Satan and a misbeleeving heart may say or suggest after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Thus should a beleever make use of Christ, for the taking away of the Guilt of his dayly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions; and for further clearing of it, I shall adde a few cautions.</p>

It is true, such sins, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if grosse, whether in themselves or by reason of circumstances, will darken a mans state, and put him to search and try his condition, over againe. But yet we dar not say, that they make any alteration in the state of a beleever: for once in a justified state alwayes in a justified state. It is true likewise, that as to those sins, which now he hath committed, he

cannot be said to be acquited or justified, till this pardon be got out by faith and repentance, as is said; yet his State remaineth fixed and unchanged; so that though God should seem to deal with such in his dispensations, as with enemies; yet really his affections change not; he never accounteth them real enemies; nay love lieth at the bottom of all his sharp st dispen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Lord doth not revoke his sentence, nor alter the thing that is gone out of his mouth. It is true likewise, that a beleever, by committing of grosse sins, may come to misse the effects of God's favour and good will, and the intimations of his love and kindnesse; and so be made to cry with <hi>David Psal.</hi> 51: 8. <hi>make me to heare joy and gladnesse</hi> and <hi>vers.</hi> 12. <hi>restore unto me the joy of thy salvation,</hi> &amp;c.

We finde none of those kinde of sins excepted in the new covenant; and where the law doth not distinguish, we ought not to distinguish: where God's law doth not expressely exclude us, we should not exclude our selves.

We would not be discouraged then from taking this course, because our sins are such and such; nay rather, we would look on this, as an argument to presse us more unto this way, because the greater our sins be, the greater need have we of pardon, and to say with <hi>David</hi> Ps. 25: 11. <hi>Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. We would not think, that upon our taking of this course, we shall be instantly freed from chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, because of those sins, for pardoning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we take this course: nor should we think, that because challenges remaine, that therefore, there is no pardon had, or that this is not the way to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: for, as we shall shew afterward, pardon is one thing, and intimation of pardon is another thing: we may be pardoned, and yet suppose that we are not pardoned; challenges will abide, till the conscience be sprinkled, and till the Prince of peace command peace to the conscience, and put the accuser to silence; who, when he can do no more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will marre the peace of a beleever, as long as he can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stoppe the current of his comforts, which made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>4. Nor would we think, that upon our taking of this course for the pardon of our sins, we shall never thereafter meet with a challenge upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of these sins. It is true, when sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, they are fully pardoned in God's court, and that obligation to condemnation is taken away, and the pardoned person is looked upon as no sinner, that is, as no person liable to condemnation because of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44048:135"/>
these sins; for being pardoned he becometh just be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; yet we darre not say, but conscience afterward, being alarmed with new transgressions, may mistake, as people suddenly put into a fright are ready to do: nor dar we say, that God will not permit Satan, to upbraid us with those sins, which have been blotted out long ago, as he suffered <hi>Shim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Lord may think good to suffer this, that his people may be keeped humble; and made more tender and watchfull, in all their wayes.</p>
                  <p>5. Beleevers would not mis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> improve or abuse this great condescendency of free grace, &amp; take the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter liberty to sin, because there is such a sure, saif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And it may be a question, if such as have really repented, &amp; gotten their sins pardoned, will be so ready to make this use of it: sure, sense of pardon will work some other effect, as we see <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16: 62, 63.</p>
                  <p>6. The beleever, in going about this work of nailing his sins to the crosse of Christ, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Christ's Death, Resurrection and constant intercession, for the obtaining of pardon, would not think of going alone, or of doing this, in his own strength: for of himself he can do nothing. He must look to Christ for grace, to help in this time of need, and must got about this duty with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44048:135"/>
dependence on Him, waiting for the influences of Light, Counsell, Strength, and Grace from Him to repent and beleeve: for He is a Prince exalted to give repentance, first and last, and He is the author and finisher of faith: so that without Him we can do nothing.</p>
                  <p>7. Let the beleever beware of concluding, that he hath got no pardon, because he hath met with no sensible intimation thereof, by the flowing in of peace and joy in his soul. Pardon is one mercy, and intimation of it to the soul is another distinct mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and separable from it: shall we therefore say, we have not gotten the <hi>first,</hi> because we have not gotten <hi>both?</hi> The Lord, for wise reasons, can pardon poor sinners, and not give any intimation thereof; to wit, that they may watch more against sin afterward, and not be so bold as they have been, and that they may finde more in experience, what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> bitter thing it is to sin against God, and learne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to depend on Him for lesse and more: and to carry more humbly: for it may be, God seeth, that if they saw their sins pardoned, they would forget themselves, and rush into new sins againe.</p>
                  <p>8. The beleever must not think it strange, if he finde more trouble after greater sins, and a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er difficulty to lay hold on Christ for pardon of those, then for pardon of others: for as God hath been more dishonoured by these; so is his anger more kindled, upon that account: and it is sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the glory of God's justice, that our sorrow for such hainous sins be proportionably greater: and this will likewise increase the difficulty: and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narly the effects of God's fatherly displeasure, make
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44048:136"/>
deeper wounds in the soul after such sins, and these are not so easily healed: all which will call for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and proportionably greater godly sorrow and repentance, and acts of faith: because faith will meet with more opposition and discouragment there; and therefore must be the more strong, to go thorow these impediments, and to lay hold on his crosse. Yet though this should make all watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and to guaird against grosse and crying sins, it should not drive any to dispaire, nor to say, with that dispairing wretch, <hi>their sin is greater than it can be forgiven,</hi> the ocean of mercy can drown and swallow up great, as well as lesser sinnes: Christ is an alsufficient Mediator, for the greatest sins, as well as for the least. <hi>O for thy names sake pardon mine iniquitie, for it is great,</hi> will come in season to a soul ready to sink with the weight of this milstone, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ied about its neck.</p>
                  <p>9. as the greater sins should not make us dispaire of taking this course for remission; so nor should the smaln<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>sse of sin make us to neglect this way: for the least sin cannot be pardoned but through Jesus Christ; for the law of God is violated thereby, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice provoked, Gods authority vilipended &amp;c. and therefore cannot be now pardoned, by reason of the threatnings annexed to the transgression of the law, without a ransome: death is the wages of all sin, lesser and greater; and the curse is due to all sinners greater and smaller. Therefore the beleever would not suffer one sin, seen and discovered, to lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned; but on the first discovery thereof, take it away to Christ, and nail it to his crosse.</p>
                  <p>10. The beleever would not conclude, that his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44048:136"/>
sins are not pardoned, because possibly temporal strokes, inflicted because of them, are not remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for though <hi>Davids</hi> sin was pardoned; yet, because of that sin of his a temporall stroke attended him and his family, to his dying day: for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did God cut off the childe 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15: 14. but told him, that the <hi>sword should never depairt from his house,</hi> and that <hi>He would raise up evil against him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>3. But what can yeeld me any ground of peace, while itis so, that I see no pardon or remission grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me? <hi>Answere.</hi> This may yeeld thee peace, that following this course, which hath been explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou art about thy duty. Thou art not at peace with sin, nor harbouring that viper in thy soul; thou art mourning and sorrowing over it, and runing to Christ, the Prince of pardons, through his blood, and intercession, conforme to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of redemption and after the encouragement given, in the many and precious promises of the covenant of grace, and, having these promises, and rolling thy guilt on Christ, as thy cautioner, conforme to the manner expressed in the gospel, thou art allowed to beleeve, that thy sins are pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44048:137"/>
and that thou art accepted in the beloved, and so quiet thy soul through faith, God abideing faithfull and true, and his promises being all yea and amen in Christ.</p>
                  <p>4. But so long as I finde not intimation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, I cannot think that I have taken the right gospel way of bringing my sins to Christ. <hi>Answere.</hi> Though that will not follow, as we cleared above: for a soul may take the right gospel way of getting the guilt of their sins taken away in Christ; and God may pardon thereupon; and for all that not think it fit to give intimation of that pardon as yet, for wise and holy ends: yet the soul may humble it self for its shortcoming, and still goe about the duty, amending in Christ, what it supposeth is amisse, and renewing its acts of repentance and faith, and beg of Christ understanding in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and so continue carrying sin al way to Christ's crosse, and eyeing his intercession, and waite for a full clearing of the matter, in his good time.</p>
                  <p>5. But what shall I do with the guilt of my weak Repentance, and weak faith? <hi>Answer.</hi> When with a weak and defective repentance and faith thou art carrying thy sins away to Christ, and nailing them to his crosse, let the imperfections of thy faith and repentance go with the rest, and leave all there.</p>

duty: yet know that conscience is but an under ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and God's deputy, and must accuse according to law (I speak not here of the irregular, furious and turbulent motions of Satan, casting-in granads in the soul and conscience, to raise a combustion and put all in a fire) its mouth most be stopped by law, and so the soul would stay and answere the accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conscience with this, that he hath fled to Christ, the only Mediator and Cautioner, and cast his burden on him; and leaneth to his merites alone; and hath put those sins in his hand, as his advocat and intercessour with the Father; and that the gospel requireth no more of him: and if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science should say, that both faith and repentance are imperfect and defective, and that guilt is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rather increased then taken away: He must ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were againe. True, but I have done with the guilt of my faith and repentance, as with the rest, taken all to Christ, and left all on him; and herein only do I acquiesce; I look not for pardon for my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect faith and repentance, yea nor would I look for pardon of my sins, for my faith and repentance, were they never so perfect, but only in and through Jesus Christ, the only Cautioner, Redeemer and Advocat.

               <p>HAving spoken of the way of making use of Christ, for removing of the <hi>guilt</hi> of our dayly transgressions, we come to speak of the way of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing use of Christ, for taking away the <hi>filth</hi> that cleaveth to the soul, through dayly transgressions: for every sin defileth the man <hi>Mat,</hi> 15: 20 and the best are said to have their spots, and to need washing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which presupposeth filthinesse and defilement <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 27. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13: 8, 10. Hence we are so oft called to this duty of washing and making us clean <hi>Esai.</hi> 1: 16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4: 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 22: 16. <hi>David</hi> prayes for this washing <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 2, 7. And it is Christ's work to wash 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6: 11. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1: 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 26. See <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 5. Now in speaking to this, we shall observe the same method; and <hi>first</hi> shew, what Christ hath done to take away this filth; and <hi>next,</hi> what way we are to make use of Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this end, to get our spots and filthinesse taken away, that we may be holy.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first.</hi> For the purging away of the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44048:139"/>
filth of our dayly failings and transgressions, Christ hath done those things.</p>
               <p>1. He hath died that He might procure this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite and advantage to us; and thus he hath washed us meritoriously in his blood, which he shed upon the crosse. Thus he <hi>loved us, and washed us from our sins, in his owne blood. Revel.</hi> 1: 5. and this is from all sins, as well such as are committed after, as such as are committed before conversion. Thus <hi>He by himself purged our sins Heb.</hi> 1: 3. <hi>viz</hi> by offering up of himself as an expiatory sacrifice to make an atonement, and so procure this liberty. So also it is said <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5: 25, 26, 27. that Christ <hi>gave himself for his Church, that He might sanctify and cleanse it—that He might present it to himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should be holy &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blemish.</hi> So <hi>Tit.</hi> 2: 14. <hi>He gave himself for us, that he—might purify to himself a peculiar people, Zealous of good works.</hi> Here then is the foundation and ground of all our cleanseing and purification; Christ's death procuring it.</p>
               <p>2. As He hath procured; so he sendeth the Spirit to effectuate this, and to worke this washing and sanctification, in us. Hence it is said 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6: 11. that <hi>we are sanctified and washed, in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the Spirit of our God. We are</hi> said to be <hi>saved by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy ghost, which he shed upon us abundantly through Iesus Christ our Saviour Tit.</hi> 3: 5<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. The sending then or shedding of the holy and sanctifying Spirit upon us, whereby we are sanctified, and consequently purified and purged from our filth,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44048:139"/>
is a fruit of Christ's death and mediation, being purchased thereby, and is an effect of his resurrection: and glorification, and intercession in glory.</p>
               <p>3. He hath made a fountaine of his blood for this end, that we may go to it daylie, and wash and be cleane: thus his <hi>blood cleanseth from all sin</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1: 7, 9. This is the <hi>fountaine opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Ierusalem for sin and for uncleannesse. Zech.</hi> 13: 1.</p>
               <p>4. He hath purchased and provided the externall meanes, whereby this cleansing and sanctification is brought about: <hi>viz</hi> the preaching of the gospell, which He himself preached, and thereby sanctified <hi>Iohn</hi> 15: 3. <hi>Now are yee clean through the word that I have spoken unto you. Ephes.</hi> 5: 26. the Church <hi>is sanctified and cleansed with the washing of water, by the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. So hath He procured, and worketh in the soul those graces, that promove and cary on this work of sanctification and purifying; such as <hi>faith,</hi> which <hi>purifyeth the heart Act.</hi> 15: 9. whereof he is the author and finisher <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. and <hi>hope</hi> which whosoever hath, purifyeth himself, even as He is pure. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3: 3.</p>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e these promises, let us cleanse our selves</hi> &amp;c. all which promises are yea and amen in Christ 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 20.</p>
               <p>Thus Christ hath made all sure, for the cleanse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and washing of his people, conforme to that article of the covenant of Redemption. <hi>So shall he sprinckle many nations Esai.</hi> 52: 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the way of our usemaking of Christ, for the purging away of our filth and daylie pollutions. Beleevers would take this course.</p>
               <p>1. They would remember and live in the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the exceeding abominablnesse and filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sin, which is compared to the vomite of a dog, and to the mire, wherein the sow walloweth 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 22. to filthy rags <hi>Esai.</hi> 64: 6. to a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous cloath <hi>Esai</hi> 30<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the like, that this may move them to seek with greater care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to have that filth washen away.</p>
               <p>2. They would remember also how abominable sin maketh them in the eyes of an holy God, who cannot behold iniquity, being a God of purer eyes than to behold it <hi>Habak.</hi> 1: 13. nor can He look on it. And how therefore no unclean thing can enter in into the new Jerusalem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor any thing that defileth. And this will make them so much the more to abhore it, and to seek to be washen from it.</p>
               <p>3. They would look by faith upon the blood of Christ, that is shed for this end, to wash filthy souls into; and run to it as a fountaine opened for this end, that they might come to it, and wash &amp; be cleane.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:44048:140"/>4. For their encouragement, they would grip by faith to the promises of the new covenant, which are large and full.</p>
               <p>5. And remember the end of Christ's death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz</hi> to purchase to himself a holy people, Zealous of good works, to present them to Himself holy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot and wrinkle, or any such thing: and this will be a further encouragement.</p>
               <p>6. They would put the work by faith in his hand, who hath best skill to wash a foule soul, and to purge away all their spots; and by faith pray for and exspect the Spirit, to sanctifie and cleanse them from all their filthinesse: that is, they would make known, and spread forth their abominations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and eyeing Christ as the only great Highpriest, whose blood is a fountaine to wash in, would lay the work on Him, and by faith put Him to wash away that filth, and to purifie their souls by his Spirit, pardoning their bygone iniquities, &amp; renewing them in the spirit of their mindes by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that they may walk before him in fear. Thus they would roll the work on Him, and leave it there.</p>
               <div type="cautions_and_directions">
                  <head>Cautions &amp; Directions.</head>
                  <p>1. The beleever would in all this work be keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the exercise of those graces following.</p>
                  <p>1. Of <hi>Humility,</hi> seeing what a vile filthy wreatch he is, that stands in need of washing and purging dayly, because of his daylie pollutions, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions.</p>
                  <p>2. Of <hi>Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> considering with what a loving God he hath to do, that hath provided so liberally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:44048:141"/>
things for him, and particularly hath provided a fountaine and such a fountaine, whereto he no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> only may, but is commanded to resort dayly.</p>
                  <p>3. Of <hi>Thankfulnesse,</hi> remembering how great this mercy is, how unworthy he is, on whom it is bestowed, and who He is that doth grant it.</p>
                  <p>4. Of <hi>Fear,</hi> least God's goodnesse be abused, and He provoked, who is so gracious to us.</p>
                  <p>5. Of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and godly ingenuity, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all hypocrisie, and formality, knowing that we have to do with Him, who will not be mocked.</p>
                  <p>6. Of <hi>holy Hatred, loathing</hi> and <hi>abhorrence</hi> of sin, which maketh us so filthy and odious in the eyes of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>2. This course would be followed, for the purging away of the least sins: for till they be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged away, we remaine in our filth, and cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect God's favourable countenance, nor his warme imbracements, nor the hearty intimations of his love and kindnesse. And a small inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable like spot may grow greater, and provoke God to let the accuser of the brethren, Satan, who alwayes waits for his opportunity, losse upon us, and a conscience wakened may make much of a little defilement, to keep the soul from approaching to God.</p>
                  <p>3. This course would be followed with every sin, <hi>quickly,</hi> without delay: for the longer those spots continue, it will be the more difficult to get them taken away: the soul will after some time, become the lesse troubled about them, and possibly forget them; and so they will remaine; and this may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion at last a sad distance, and provoke God to hide
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44048:141"/>
his face, which will cause more bitternesse and sorrow. It were good then, to keep up a Spirit of tendernesse and feare.</p>
                  <p>4. Let this be our <hi>Dayly work</hi> and exercise: for we are daylie contracting new filth: yesterdayes cleansing will not save us from new filth to day: nor will our runing to the fountaine to day, serve to take away new spots tomorrow: new spots call for new washing, so that this must be our very life and exercise, to be dayly and continually runing to the fountaine with our foule souls; and giving Christ, the great purger, much to do.</p>
                  <p>5. We must not think to be <hi>perfectly Washen,</hi> so long as we are here; for we will be contracting new filth dayly, our feet will still be to wash <hi>Iohn.</hi> 13: 10. We will not be without spote or wrinckle, till we come home to that place, wherein entereth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that defileth.</p>
                  <p>6. Let the beleevers recourse in this matter be <hi>wholly to Iesus Christ</hi> and <hi>his blood,</hi> and lay no weight on their sorrow, repentance, or teares, or on any outward meane, which they are commanded to use: yet would they not lay aside these meanes, but goe through them to the fountaine, to Jesus, there and there only to be cleansed.</p>
                  <p>7. They would not be discouraged or dispaire, when their spots appear great, and not like the spots of his children: for Christ's blood can purge from all sin; and wash away all their filth, of how deep so ever a dye it, be. Christ's blood is so deep an ocean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a mountain will be sunck out of sight in it, as wel as a small peeble stone.</p>
                  <p>8. Though Christ's blood be strong enough to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:44048:142"/>
purge from all sin, even the greatest; yet they would know, that scandalous spots, or a deep staine, may cost them more frequent runing to the fountaine, through humiliation, godly sorrow, prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. <hi>David's</hi> scandalous blot cost him more trouble and paines, before he got it purged away, than many others, as we see <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
                  <p>9. When all this is done, we must think of having on another righteousnesse, as our cloathing and covering, in the day of our appearance before our judge, even the righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, which only is perfect, and able to save us from the wrath of God. Let us be never so washen in the matter of sanctification, and cleansed from our spots, we cannot for all that be accounted righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God: nor will that satisfie justice, or take away the guilt so much as of one transgression before God. Christ's righteousnesse will be ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> upper-garment for all eternitie: Ut his is the fine lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wherewith his bride is busked in heaven.</p>
                  <p>10. At every time we run to the fountaine, with our dayly contracted filth, we would not forget to carry alongs with us the mother corruption, which is the sinck and puddle of all filthinesse: <hi>I</hi> meane, our naturall corrupted rottennesse and pollution, from whence flow all our other actuall pollutions. We would do well to carry mother and daughter both together to the fountaine. <hi>David</hi> prayeth to be washen and purged, as well from his originall filthinesse, wherein he was conceived and borne, as from his bloudguiltinesse <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 5, 7.</p>
                  <p>11. Let not this occasion our carelesnesse in watching against sin; for that would be to turne
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44048:142"/>
his grace into wantonness, but rather let it sharpen our diligence in watching against all occasions of sin, lest we againe defile our soul.</p>
                  <p>12. Not only must we have our bodyes, or our outward conversation washen; but our soul within, the frame of our heart, our understanding, will, affections, and conscience sprinkled with that blood. The blood of Christ, who through the eternall Spirit, offered himself without spot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  <p>Finally. If the beleever feare, that he shall not be able to remember all these particular duties, let him remember this, to wit. To put a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>oule soul, defiled with originall and actuall pollutions, in Christ's hand, dayly, and leave it with him to wash by his blood and Spirit. And yet remember to lay the weight of his acceptance before God, upon the imputed righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, and not upon his own cleannesse, when thus sanctified and washen, which is but imperfect.</p>

                  <p>2.

The Lord, it is true, may suffer our consciences still to bark upon us, and cast up our filthinesse to us, that we may be the more humbled, and be put to lye more constantly at the fountaine; yet when we have fled to Christ, and taken our fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse to the open and appointed fountaine, we can answere the accusations of conscience, in law, and have peace.</p>
                  <p>3. But I am apt to think, will some say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That if I had once taken the right way, to get my sins &amp; filthinesse purged away, my conscience would trouble me no more; but now so long as it doggeth me thus, I cannot think, that the way, which I have taken, is the right way. <hi>Ans.</hi> Though the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44048:143"/>
Lord may think good to suffer conscience to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man for a time, though he hath taken the right way, as is said, for a further exercise and tryall to him; yet the beleever will have no losse nor disadvantage, by examineing his way, and trying whether he hath laid the matter, cleanly over on Christ, or whether he hath laid too much weight on his own humiliation, sorrow and paines; and whether he beleaving the matter on Jesus; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting to be washen alone in his blood, or looking in to himself, and exspecting some helpe in the matter from self. And after tryall would mourne for any failing he gets discovered: and still be about that work of runing with filth to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. But withall they would go to Christ for helpe, because without Him, they cannot come to Him, they cannot come or carry their soul to the fountaine opened for sin and uncleannesse. So that, in all this work, there would be a single depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on Christ, for understanding, and strength to go about this work aright.</p>
                  <p>Thus, have we endeavoured to cleare up Christ's being the <hi>Way to the Father,</hi> first and last; and how all, beleevers or unbeleevers, are to make use of him, as the way to the Father, whatever their condition be; from all which we may see<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. That such are in a wreatched and forlorne condition, who are still strangers to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will not lay hold on Him, nor come to Him, and walk in Him, and make use of Him. They are unrighteous and unholy, and dayly contracting more guilt and more filth: and they know no way either for justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or sanctification, but a way of self, which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44048:144"/>
will prove like the brooks, which run dry in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer &amp; disappoint the weary travailer, when he hath most need. They are without Christ, and so without the way, the only way, the saife and sure way, to the Father. And oh! if all that is here spoken could induce them, to think once of the misery of their condition; and to seek out for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, that they might not only be saved from their state of sin and misery; but brought into a state of salvation through Jesus Christ; so that they might be justified before God, from all that justice, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the law, or conscience, could lay against them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and throughly sanctified; and so at length brought home to the Father, faire and spotlesse 2. Upon the other hand, we see the noble advantage of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, who through grace are entered into this way; for it is a full and compleat way, that shall carry them saife home: they shall finde, that He is able to save to the uttermost all that come to God through Him. And O if<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they were sensible of this! How would it excite them to thankfulnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> How would it encourage them to run thorow difficulties great and many! 3. We see what a special duty lyeth upon beleevers to make special use of Christ, in all things, as the way to the Father, and so march to heaven in Him, as the only way, march in his hands, or rather be carryed in his armes and bosome. This were to goe from strength to strength, till at length they appeared in Zion, and landed in that pleasant place of rest, where the weary are at rest, and yet rest not, day nor night, but sing praises to <hi>Him, that hath redeemed them by his blood, out of every kinred and tongue, and</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:44048:144"/>
                     <hi>people and nation, saying blessing, honour, glory &amp; power be unto Him, that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb, forever and ever Revel.</hi> 5: 9, 13. 4. Hence we may see the cause of the lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of beleevers, of their wanderings, of their short comings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their many defilements &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> their not constant making use of Christ, as the way, in all things, according to the tenor of the gospel. Oh if this were laid to heart and mourned for, and if grace were sought to helpe it.</p>
                  <p>This one point of truth. That Christ is <hi>the way,</hi> well understood, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> it supposeth, that we cannot turne-in to the right way: a Spirit of errour and untruth leadeth us continually wrong: like the sheep we wander still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we weary ourselves in our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering; and so spend all our labour and paines in vaine.

and erroneous wayes, to grippe to shadowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to leane to them, as if they were the wayes of truth: Such as</p>
               <p>1. A <hi>good heart,</hi> which many imagine they have, when they have nothing lesse.</p>

               <p>6. The <hi>commendation &amp; applause of ministers &amp; christians,</hi> is that which many rest upon: which is a sad proof of the blindnesse of their hearts.</p>
               <p>7. The <hi>way of good works and almes deeds,</hi> blindfoldeth many, and sheweth that they were never led by truth, or taught of Christ, who is <hi>the Truth.</hi>

                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:44048:146"/>8. Some <hi>pinching greif</hi> and <hi>sorrow for sin,</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>9. A <hi>common sort of repentance, backed with some kinde of amendement</hi> and outward reformation, is away that many rest secure in, though it lead to destruction.</p>
               <p>10. <hi>Freedom from challenges of conscience,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth many.</p>
               <p>Though these and such like wayes be dangerous, yea deadly, yet how many is there to be found among christians, that have no better ground of their hope of salvation, and will cleave to them so fast, as no preaching will make them so much as once question the matter, or suspect that these wayes will in end deceive them; so strong is their inclination to the way of errour, though not as the way of errour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> It presupposeth also an inclineable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in us by nature to wander out of the way: for being nothing but a mass of errour, made up of darkness, ignorance and mistakes, we have a strong byas to errour, which agreeth best, with our naturall corrupted temper. Hence is it, that we have such a strong propension to errour and mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes: Whether</p>

Who is able to recount all the errours and mistakes, which our heart by nature is ready to admit, and foster with complacency? Are we not by nature ready to say, that there is not a God, as the fool <hi>Psal.</hi> 14: 1. Or That He is not such a God, as his word and works declare Him to be; a Holy, Just, Righteous, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omniscient God &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or that He is a changeable God, and actually changed, not being the same now, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he was. That He hath forgotten to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and remembereth not his people in adversity; and so is not Tender and Mercifull. That He hath forgotten his promises, and so is not Faithful and True. That he approveth of sin, because he suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the way of the wicked to prosper, and so is not an Holy God &amp;c. Yea do not ofttimes such thoughts as these lodge within the heart of the truly God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? All which sheweth, how prone we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and intertaine erroneous and false thoughts of God.</p>
               <p>2. Concearning <hi>Ourselves,</hi> Supposeing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be borne againe and reconciled to God, when yet we are living in black nature: and who so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Or, in questioned matters, taking truth to be errour, and errour to be truth.</p>
               <p>3. Concearning <hi>Others.</hi> How ready are we to run either to the one extremity, or the other, in judging their persons, and actions?</p>
               <p>O! where is the faith of this natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Where is the reall conviction of it? Sure there is but little real beleeving of this, when</p>
               <p>1.

               <p>2. And so many, that are not lamenting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing this their condition, nor crying out and compleaning of a false deceitful and desperatly wicked heart.</p>

misconceptions of God and of his wayes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of our hearts, might sufficiently put it out of doubt with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next.</hi> How miserable must their condition be, who are yet strangers to Christ; for they are living in darkness, lying in darkness, walking in darkness, yea very darkness it self, a mass of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, mistakes, ignorance, and misconceptions of all things, that are good; and still wandering out of the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally</hi> should not this preach out to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us all of a necessity of having more acquantance with <hi>Truth,</hi> with Jesus Christ, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> that we may be delivered from this wofull and wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atched condition: for Truth only can set us free therefrom.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> general thing to be noticed here is. That all other wayes and courses, which we can take or follow, that we may obtaine life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side Christ, are but lies, false and deceitful wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, there is no truth in them: for He only is <hi>the Truth,</hi> No other whatsoever can beare this epithete: for</p>
               <p>1. He only can satisfie the soul in all points: other wayes, whatever we may imagine and dre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame, can yeeld no true satisfaction in this matter.</p>
               <p>2. He only can secure the soul from destructive ruinous courses, which will undoe the soul: all other wayes will fail here; none of them can give the least security to the soul, that they shall not bring him, in end, to destruction and everlasting perdition.</p>
               <p>3. He only can bring the soul saife through all
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44048:148"/>
opposition, and difficulties in the way: no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way can do this; but will leave us in the myre, ere ever we come to the end of our journay.</p>
               <p>4. He will not deceive nor disappoint the soul: all other wayes, in end will prove treacherous, and give the travailer a doo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ul and sad disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>O what a warning should this be to us all, to take heed, that we imbrace not a lie, in stead of Him, who is <hi>the Truth:</hi> and sit not downe with a shadow in stead of the substance. How ready are we to put other things in his place? But whatever it be, that gets his room in the soul, though good and worthy in it self, will prove a lie, Even. 1. All our outward holinesse and duties: yea. 2. All our experiences and great attainments. Yea. 3. All our gifts and enduements. Ay. 4. Our very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: none of these are Christ; and if we place that hope and confidence in them, which we should place on Him, they will not prove the Truth to us. He alone is <hi>the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How sure then should we laboure to be, that we do not die with a lie in our right hand: and how carefully should we guaird against the trusting in, or leaning to any thing that is not Christ, and whole Christ, and only Christ, and Christ as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the gospel: seing this way is only <hi>the Truth.</hi> And no other way will be found so in end, though at present we may finde in it.</p>
               <p>1. Some inward peace and quietnesse of heart, as if all were right.</p>
               <p>2. Some satisfaction of minde, things being right as we apprehend, butfalsly, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:44048:148"/>3. Something like assurance and confidence, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> all will be right with us.</p>
               <p>4. And hope founded thereupon, which may helpe to ride thorow some stormes, and yet fail us atlength.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> general is this, Christ Jesus is not only <hi>the Truth</hi> in himself, but also in reference to us. The scope of the place cleareth this, as he is <hi>the Way</hi> and <hi>the Life,</hi> for our use; so he is <hi>the Truth.</hi> Not only as God equall with the Father, but also as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and our immanuel.</p>
               <p>As God, He is 1. Essentially Truth, being God equall with the Father, in power and glory.</p>
               <p>2. In respect of veracity, he is the <hi>God of truth Deut.</hi> 32: 4. faithfull in all his sayings <hi>Psal.</hi> 31<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>3. He is the fountaine and spring head of all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated truth, for he is the first truth.</p>
               <p>As Mediator, and in reference to us. He is full of grace and truth <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1: 14. He received not the Spirit in measure <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3: 34. and this Spirit is a Spirit of truth. But of this more, when we come to show more particularly, how and in what respects, he is called <hi>the Truth,</hi> as mediator.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> general, which is here observable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is, That he is not only called <hi>Truth,</hi> but <hi>the Truth,</hi> as he is <hi>the Way,</hi> and <hi>the Life:</hi> and not only <hi>true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but <hi>Truth,</hi> in the abstract: which sayeth.</p>
               <p>1. That He is every way Truth. how ever we consider him, as God, or as Mediator.</p>
               <p>2. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ll Truth is in Him: all truth of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for us is to be found in Him.</p>
               <p>3. That all that is in him is truth, his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:44048:149"/>
Offices, Performances, Words, Works &amp;c. all are true.</p>
               <p>4. That He is pure and unmixed Truth: no lie in Him, no errour or mistake there.</p>
               <p>5. That truth in Him is in its perfection, and excellency: In the truest of men, it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
               <p>O what an excellent one must He be? How compleatly fitted and furnished for us! Oh if our souls could love him, and close with him, and rest upon him as alsufficient!</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> More particularly, in what respects Christs is called the <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUt for further explaineing of this matter, we would see more particularly, in what respects it is, that He is called <hi>the Truth;</hi> and this will make way to our use making of Him. So</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> He is <hi>the Truth,</hi> in opposition to the shadowes and types of Him, under the law: Hence, as <hi>the law</hi> (the whole leviticall and typicall dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation) <hi>came by Moses;</hi> so <hi>grace and truth came by Iesus Christ Iohn.</hi> 1: 17. They were all shado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes of Him, and He is the substance and body of them all. <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 17. And this is true in these res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects.</p>
               <p>1. All these shadowes and types pointed at Him, and directed as with a finger the Israelites, who were under that dispersition, to look to Christ, the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:44048:149"/>
promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to rest, and to lay all their weight, on Him: so that the law was a shadow of good things to come <hi>Heb.</hi> 10: 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 17.</p>
               <p>2. They all terminate in Him, He putting an end, by his coming and performing his work, to all those typs, which only related to Him, and to what He was to do: the body being come, there is no more need of the shadow, and the thing typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied existing, there is no more need or use of the type.</p>
               <p>3. They are all fulfilled in Him, He answereth them all fully: so that what ever was shadowed forth by them is compleatly to be found in Him. This the Apostle in his Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> abundantly evinceth, and <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Colossians</hi> tells us, <hi>we are compleat in Him.</hi> and therefore need no more follow the shadowes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> He is <hi>the Truth</hi> in reference to the prophecies of old; all which did principally point at him, and his concearnments: his Person, Nature, Offices, Work, Kingdome, &amp;c. and whatever was foretold in these prophecies, is perfectly fulfilled in Him, or done by Him, or shall in due time be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuated by Him. He is <hi>that great prophet,</hi> spoken of <hi>Deut.</hi> 18: 15, 18, 19. So said the Jewes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6: 14. <hi>All the Prophets from Samuel spoke of Him,</hi> and of his dayes Act. 3. 22, 23, 24. And <hi>to Him gave all the Prophets witnesse</hi> Act. 10. 43. And whatever they prophecied or witnessed of Him, was, or is in due time, to be fulfilled in Him. Hence we finde the Euangelists and Apost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les frequently applying the sayings and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the old testament unto Him, And <hi>Luk.</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:44048:150"/>
4: 18. himselfe said, that the prophecy of <hi>Esa</hi> 61: 1. &amp;c. was fulfilled in him. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 10: 11, 12. And Himself expounded to the two Disciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> in all the scriptures, beginning at Moses, and all the prophets, all the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himself <hi>Luk.</hi> 24: 27. And thus is He the truth of all the prophecies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly</hi> He is <hi>the Truth,</hi> in reference to his undertaking with the Father, in that glorious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of redemption: for whatever the Father laid on him to do, that He did fully and faithfully. He was to <hi>bear our griefs</hi> and <hi>to carry our sorrows,</hi> and that He did. He was to be <hi>wounded for our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions,</hi> and <hi>bruised for our iniquities, the chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sement of our peace was to be upon Him,</hi> and <hi>by his stripes we were to be healed Esai.</hi> 53: 5, and so it was <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 25. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15: 3. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 23. His <hi>soul was to be made an offering for sin Esa.</hi> 53: 10. and so it was; for he offered up himself a sacrifice for sin: yea all that He was to do, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that covenant, he did it perfectly, so as he cryed out, while hanging on the cross, <hi>it is finished. Iohn.</hi> 19: 30. and in his prayer <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17. he told the Father <hi>vers.</hi> 4. that He had glorified Him on earth, and had finished the work, which He gave him to do. So that the Father was well pleased with Him <hi>Mat.</hi> 3: 17. and 12: 18, and 17: 5. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1: 11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 3: 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly</hi> He is <hi>the Truth,</hi> in respect of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which He took upon him for our good: for all the duties of these offices, which He was to do, &amp; what remaineth to be done, He will perfect in due time. Did He take upon him the office of a

                  </gap>aling mediatly and immediatly the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of God. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1: 18. and 15: 15. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: 11, 12, 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 20: 32. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 11, 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1: 2. Did He take upon him the office of a <hi>Priest,</hi> so did he fulfill the same, offering up himself an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory sacrifice to God. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9: 14, 28. and 2: 17. and becoming a Priest, living for ever to make intercession for us <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 25.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44048:154"/>
use of Him, as <hi>the Truth,</hi> in several cases, wherein they will stand in need of Him as <hi>the Truth.</hi> But ere we come to the particulars, we shall first propose some general uses of this usefull point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> This point of truth, serveth to discover to us the wofull condition of such, as are strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Christ, <hi>the Truth:</hi> and oh if it were beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! for</p>
               <p>1. They are not yet delivered from that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plague of blindenesse, errour, ignorance, mistakes, under which all are by nature, a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, if rightly seen, would cause the soul lie low in the dust.</p>
               <p>2. Whatever course they take, till they come to Christ, and while they remaine in that condition, is a lie, and a false, erroneous, and deceitful way: for still they are turning aside to lies <hi>Psal.</hi> 40: 4. and seeking after them <hi>Psal.</hi> 4: 2.</p>
               <p>3. Whatever hopes and confidence they may have, that their way shall carry them thorow; yet in end they will be found to inherite lies <hi>Ier.</hi> 16: 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and meet with the sadest disappointment that can be: for in stead of the followshipe of God, Christ, angels, and glorified spirits, they shall take up their lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with devils and damned souls: and that because they have made no acquantance with the way of truth; and the way wherein they are is but a lie, and a falshood: and so of necessity must deceive them.</p>
               <p>4. All their literal and speculative knowledge shall not avail them, so long as they are strangers unto Him, who is <hi>the Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>th.</hi> Their knowledge is but ignorance because it is not a knowledge of Him, who is <hi>the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:44048:154"/>5. They have none to go to, for help and light, in the day of their darknesse, confusion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity: for they are not reconciled unto <hi>the Truth,</hi> which alone can prove steadable and comfortable in that day.</p>
               <p>6. They can do nothing to helpe themselves out of that state of darknesse and ignorance; and whatever they do to helpe themselves, shall but increase their darknesse, and misery: because there is no truth there, and Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even <hi>the Truth,</hi> alone can dispell these clouds of errour, mistakes, ignorance, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Hence we see the happy and blessed condition of beleevers, who have imbraced this <hi>Truth,</hi> and gotten their souls opened to Him, who is <hi>the Truth:</hi> for,</p>
               <p>1. They are, in part, delivered from that masse of lies, mistakes, misapprehensions, errours, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse and ignorance, under which they lay formerly, and all the unregenerate do yet lye: and though they be not fully delivered therefrom, yet the day is comeing when that shall be, and the begun work of grace and truth in them is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane pledge thereof: and at present they have ground to beleeve, that that evil shall not againe have dominion over them, they being now under grace, and under the guidance of <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Howbeit they have many perplexing thoughts, doubts and feares of their state and condition, and think many a time, that they shall one day or other perish by the way; and all their hopes and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence shall evani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44048:155"/>
disappointed in end. <hi>The Truth</hi> shall land them saife on the other side. <hi>The Truth</hi> shall prove no lie.</p>
               <p>3. They have a fast and steadable friend to go to, in a day of darknesse, clouds, doubts, when falshood and lies are like to prevail, even <hi>the Truth,</hi> who alone can help them in that day.</p>
               <p>4. Howbeit the knowledge they have of God, and of the mysteries of the gospell, be but small; yet that small measure, being taught by Him, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> and flowing from <hi>Truth,</hi> shall prove sanctifying and saving.</p>
               <p>5. They have ground to hope for more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from errours and deceitfull lies, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for they have chosen the way of truth, and given themselves up to the leading of <hi>Truth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Answere</hi> I grant the Lord may suffer even some of his own to fall into, and to continue for some time in errors, yea and it may be all their dayes, as to some errours, that hereby, all may learne to tremble and feare, and to work out their salvation with fear and trembling. 2. Some may be tryed thereby <hi>Dan.</hi> 11: 35. 3. Others may break their neck thereupon. 4. To punish themselves, for not making that use of <hi>Truth,</hi> and of <hi>the Truth,</hi> that they should have done: yet we would consider these few things.</p>
                  <p>1. That there are many moe unregenerat persons that fall into errour</p>

                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:44048:155"/>2. If his people fall into errour at any time, they do not alwayes continue therein to the end. God for his own glory maketh, some time or other, truth shine in upon their soul, which discovereth that mistake, and presently, the grace of God in their soul maketh them to abhore the same.</p>
                  <p>3 Or if some continue in it to their dieing day; yet they repent of it, by an implicite repentance, as they do of other unknown, and unseen evils, that lye in their soul; so that that errour doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy their soul.</p>
                  <p>4 There are some grosse errours, which a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerat soul cannot readyly imbrace, or, if, through a mistake, or the power of a temptation, they do imbrace them, yet they cannot heartyly close with them, whatever for a time, through corruption and pride, they may seem outwardly to do: and that because the very dayly exercise of grace, will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them; and so they will be found to be against their dayly experience; as some opinions of the <hi>Papists, Arminians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> together with the abominable <hi>Quakers,</hi> which a gracious soul, when not carryed away with the torrent of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and with the tempest of a temptation, cannot but observe to contradict the dayly workings of grace in their soul, and the motions of their sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied soul, in prayer and other holy dutyes; and so such as they cannot but finde to be false by their own experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Here is ground of a sharpe reproof of the wicked, who continue in unbeleef; and</p>
                  <p>I Will not beleeve, nor give any credite to his

promises, wherewith He seeketh to allure poor souls to come to Him for life.</p>
                  <p>2 Nor will they beleeve His threatnings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with He useth to alarme souls, and to pouse them forward to their duty.</p>
                  <p>3 Nor will they beleeve and receive His offers, as true.</p>
                  <p>4 Nor will they beleeve, that He is the true Prophet, Priest, and king, that must save souls from hell and death, and therefore they will not give Him imployment in his offices.</p>
                  <p>All which cannot but be an high provocation: for in effect, it is to say, that He is not <hi>the Truth,</hi> nor worthy to be beleeved. Let them consider this, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ee how they think, he shall take this off their hands. No man will take it well, that another should either call or account Him a liar: and can they think, that Christ shall take it well, at their hands, to be accounted by them a liar? What will they think to be challenged for this, in the great day? Now the truth is, all unbeleevers, as they make God a liar (o horrid and abominable crime! Whose haire would not stand on end to hear this?) 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5: 10, 11,—<hi>He that beleeveth not God, hath made him a liar, because he beleeveth not the record, that God gave of his Son, and this is the record, that God hath given to us eternall life; and this life is in his Son.</hi> So do they make the Son of God a liar, in all his sayings, in all his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and in all his works: And they make the holy ghost a liar, in not beleeving that truth, that He hath sealed as a firme truth. They make the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44048:156"/>
of surtyshipe betwixt the Father and the Son a mere lie, and a forgery, <hi>o dreadfull!</hi> They make the word of truth a lie, and they make all the saints liars, and all the officers of Iesus Christ, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare this truth, and the saints, who beleeve it and test upon it, liars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Hence is there ground of reproof to the godly, in that</p>
                  <p>1. They do not firmely enough beleeve his sayings, neither his promises, nor his threatnings, as appeareth too oft upon the one hand, by their faintings and feares; and upon the other hand, by their carelesnesse and loose walk.</p>
                  <p>2. They make not use of Him, in all cases, as they ought: his offices lye by and are not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>3. They do not approach to Him, nor to God through Him heartyly, and cordially, as <hi>the very Truth,</hi> and true way.</p>
                  <p>4. Nor do they rest with confidence upon Him, in all difficulties, as being <hi>the Truth,</hi> that will not fail them, nor disappoint them.</p>
                  <p>5. Nor do they rejoyce in Him, as satisfied with Him, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> in the want of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly.</hi> The right consideration of this truth, should keep us in minde of several great duties: such as those,</p>
                  <p>1. Of <hi>pitying those places, where this truth is not heard of,</hi> as among <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Heathens:</hi> or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44048:157"/>
where it is darkened with superstition and mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, as among <hi>Papists:</hi> or where it hath been clearly shineing, but now is darkened; as in some churches now under the prevailing power of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or lastly where it is not received in its power &amp; lustre, as alas it is too little received in the best and purest churches.</p>
                  <p>2. Of being <hi>thankful to Him,</hi> for making this <hi>truth</hi> known in the world, and particularly in the place, where we Were borne, or had our abode; and yet more, for that he hath determined our hearts to a beleeving of this <hi>Truth,</hi> in some weak measure; to an imbraceing of it, and to a giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our selves up to be led, ruled and guided thereby.</p>
                  <p>3. Of <hi>esteeming highly of every piece of Truth</hi> for his sake, who is <hi>the Truth;</hi> studying it for his sake, loving it for his sake; holding it fast for his sake; witnessing to it, as we are called, for his sake: we should <hi>buy the truth, and not sell it Prov.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>4. Of <hi>taking part with Him,</hi> and his cause, in all hazards, for <hi>Truth</hi> is alwayes on his side, and truth shall prevail at length.</p>
                  <p>5. Of <hi>giving Him imployment</hi> in our doubts &amp; difficulties, whether (1) they be about some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted points of truth, which come to be deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to trouble the Church: or (2) about our own estate and condition, quarreled at by Satan, or questioned by the false heart: or (3) about our carriage in our dayly walk. In all these and the like, we should be imploying <hi>Truth,</hi> that we may be
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44048:157"/>
led in truth, and taught by truth, to walk in sure pathes.</p>
                  <p>6. Of <hi>carrying in all things before Him as true:</hi> for He is <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Truth;</hi> and so cannot be deceived, and therefore we should walk before Him in sincerity and singlenesse of heart, without guile, hypocrisie, or falshood, that we may look like children of the truth; and of the day, and of light, and children that will not lie or dissemble. <hi>Esa.</hi> 63: 8. not like these, that lied unto Him <hi>Psal.</hi> 78: 38. <hi>Esa.</hi> 59: 13.</p>
                  <p>7. Of <hi>taking Him only for our guide to heaven,</hi> by denying our own wit, skill and understanding; and looking to and resting upon Him, who alone is <hi>the Truth,</hi> and so acknowledging Him in all our wayes, depending on Him for light and counsell, with singlenesse of heart, humility, diligence, and truth in the inward parts.</p>
                  <p>8. Of <hi>giving up ourselves dayly unto Him,</hi> and his guidance, and denying our own wills, humors, parties, or opinions: for He alone is <hi>Truth,</hi> and can only guide us aright: and for this cause, we would acquant ourselves well with the word, which is our rule, and seek after the Spirit, whom Christ hath promised, to lead us into all truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtly,</hi> should not this be a strong inducement to all of us, to lay hold on and gripe to Him, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> and <hi>only the Truth?</hi> seing,</p>
                  <p>1. All other wayes, which we can take, will prove a lie to us, in end.</p>
                  <p>2. He is substance and no shadow, and all that <hi>love Him shall inherite substance:</hi> for <hi>He will fill all their treasures Prov:</hi> 8: 21.</p>

                  <p>5. He will never, nay never, leave his people, not forsake them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13: 5. He is <hi>Truth,</hi> and cannot deceive; he cannot forsake nor disappoint: He is a spring of water, whose waters fail not <hi>Esai.</hi> 58: 11.

                  <p>2. when friends, acquantances, relations, faile them; and father and mother forsake them, truth

                  <p>3. When riches, honours, pleasures, or what else their heart hath been going out after, prove like summer brooks: for <hi>the Truth</hi> will be the same to them in all generations; there is no shadow of turning with Him. <hi>The Truth</hi> is alwayes truth, and true.</p>
                  <p>4. When we feare, that either ourselves or others shall fall away, in a day of tryall, and turne from the truth. Though all men prove liars and deceivers, <hi>Truth</hi> will abide the same, and stand out all the blasts of opposition.</p>
                  <p>5. When unbeleef would make us question the truth of the promises. The faith of his being <hi>Truth</hi> it self, and <hi>the Truth,</hi> even <hi>Truth</hi> in the abstract, would shame unbeleef out of countenance. Shall Truth faile? Shall not <hi>the Truth</hi> be true? what a contradiction were that!</p>
                  <p>6. When we know not how to answere the objections of Satan, and of a false treacherous heart: for <hi>Truth</hi> can easily answere all cavils: and He who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> can repell all objections against truth. Truth is impregnable, and can stand against all.</p>
                  <p>7. When we cannot know, nor discover the wiles and subtility of Satan. Truth can discover the depths of Satan, and make the poor soul more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quant with them; so that they shall not any more be ignorant of his devices, who look to Him.</p>
                  <p>8. when the thoughts of the deceitfulnesse of our hearts trouble us, the depth whereof we cannot search. This then may comfort us, that <hi>Truth</hi> can

When we cannot tell what our disease and distemper is, and so cannot seek suteable remedies, or help from God, O what a comfort is it, to know and beleeve, that He is <hi>the Truth,</hi> with whom we have to do, and so knoweth our distemper perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; all its causes and symptoms, <hi>Truth</hi> cannot be at a stand in discerning our disease; so nor can he be ignorant of the fittest and only saifest cures.</p>
                  <p>10. When we know not what to ask in prayer, as not knowing what is best for us; it is comfort to remember, that we have to do with <hi>the Truth,</hi> that is perfectly acquanted with all that, and knoweth what is best.</p>

It is comfortable to remember that, though we and all men be liars, and deal deceitfully with Him, yet He is <hi>the Truth</hi> and will keep covenant for ever, He will not, He cannot deny himself. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2: 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>2. These enemies should prosper, and that for a long time, and carry on their course of errour and wickednesse with a high band.</p>
                  <p>3. There should be few found to befriend truth, and to own it, in an evil day.</p>
                  <p>4. Yea many of those, that did some time owne it, and plead for it, should at length turne their back upon it, as did <hi>Demas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. And such, as continue constant and faithful, be loaded with reproaches and pressed under with sore persecution, for adhereing to truth, and owning constantly the good cause.</p>

                  <p>1. We would live in the constant conviction of our ignorance, blindnesse, hypocrisie, readynesse to mistake a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>3ly. We should be dayly giving up ourselves to Him, as <hi>the Truth,</hi> in all the forementioned res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects; and receiving Him into our souls as such, that He may dwell and abide there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then shall

There would also be a serious and Christian reading and hearing of the word, which is <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Word of Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Scripture of Truth,</hi> and those duties would be gone about, with (1) much self denyal (2) with much singlenesse of heart. (3) with much humility. (4) with much willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and readynesse to be instructed. (5) with much seriousnesse and earnestnesse: and (6) with faith and dependance on God, for his blessing and breathing.</p>
                  <p>8ly We would beware, as of trusting to our own understandings, so to the judgments of other men: nor would we look to what suiteth most our own humors, nor to what appeareth most specious and plausible: for that may deceive us.</p>
                  <p>9ly We would lye open to the influences and rayes of light, by exerciseing faith in earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, as also patient waiting for and single looking to Him: mindeing his name and his relations, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and engadgments; for the strengthning of our faith, and confidence.</p>
                  <p>10ly We would labour to keep fast, whatever He teacheth us by his word and spirit; &amp; not prove <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> How to make use of Christ, as the <hi>Truth,</hi> for grouth in knowledge.</head>
               <p>IT is a commanded duty, that we <hi>grow in the knowledge of Iesus Christ.</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. last. And the <hi>knowledge of Him</hi> being <hi>life eternal Ioh.</hi> 17: 3. and our measure of knowledge of Him here being but imperfect, for <hi>we know but in part;</hi> it cannot but be an useful duty, and a desireable thing, to be growing in this knowledge. This is to <hi>walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of the Lord unto all pleasing, to be increasing in the knowledge of God. Col.</hi> 1: 10. <hi>Knowledge must be added unto vertue;</hi> and it layeth a ground for other christian virtues 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 5, 6. In this <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> we must <hi>not be barren</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 8. And this being so necessary, so desireable, and so use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and so advantagious a grace, the beleever can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but desire to have more and more of it. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially seing it is a part of the image of God <hi>Col.</hi> 3: vers. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:44048:162"/>Now, it is <hi>the Truth</hi> that must teach them here, first and last. The <hi>light of the knowledge of the glory of God</hi> must be had, in <hi>the face of Iesus Christ</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 6. The question therefore is, how we should make use of Jesus Christ for this end, that we may attaine to more of this excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</p>
               <p>For clearing of this, I shall propose those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> It is good to live in the constant convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a necessity of his teaching us, and this tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in those particulars,</p>
               <p>1. That we should be conscious of our ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, even when we know most, or think we know most, remembring that the best knoweth but in part 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13: 9. The more true knowledge we attaine to, the more will we see and be convinced of our ignorance; because the more we know, the more will we discover of the vastnesse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensibility of that object, which is proposed to our knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. That we should remember, how deceitful our hearts are; and how ready they are to sit down upon a shadow of knowledge, even when we know nothing, as we ought to know. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. vers. 2. and this will keep us jealous, and watchful.</p>
               <p>3. And to helpe forward our jealousie of our own hearts, and watchfulnesse, we would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that our hearts naturally are averse from any true and saving knowledge: whatever desire there be naturally after knowledge of hidden things, out of curiosity; and of things natural; or of thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> spiritual, as natural, for the perfection of nature,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44048:163"/>
as might be pretended, whereby in effect those that increase knowledge, increase sorrow <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1: 18. yet there is no inclination after spiritual and saving knowledge, in us naturally: But an aversation of heart therefrom.</p>
               <p>4. That we should study and know the absolute necessity of this knowledge: how necessary it is for our christian communion with God, and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian walk with others; how necessary for our right improving of dispensations, general and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; what a noble ornament of a christian it is, and a necessary piece of the image of God, which we have lost;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Upon these grounds mentioned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> would also be convinced of this; That of ourselves, and by all our natural parts, enduements, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and sagacity, we cannot attaine to this saving knowledge; which is a special and saving grace, and so must be wrought in the soul, by a divine hand, even the mighty power of God. By our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate study and reading, we may attaine to a literal, heady, and speculative knowledge, that will puff us up 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8: 1. but thereby shall we never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this knowledge, which is spiritual, hearty, and practical, and so saving. We must have the anoynting here, which teacheth us all things. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2: 27. And of this we would be perswaded, that we may look to a higher hand, for light, and instruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There would be an eyeing of Christ's furniture and fitnesse, for this work of teaching of us. To wit,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:44048:163"/>1. An eyeing of Him, as the <hi>substantial wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of the Father <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>2. An eyeing of Him, as one <hi>come out of the bosome of the Father Iohn.</hi> 1: 18. and so sufficiently enabled to acquant us with the mysteries of God, for salvation.</p>
               <p>3. An eyeing of Him, as <hi>mediator, fully endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all necessaries for this piece of his work,</hi> and so, having <hi>received the Spirit without measure,</hi> for this end <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3: 34. and as having <hi>hid in Him, all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge Col.</hi> 2: 3. and as having <hi>all fulnesse dwelling in Him Col.</hi> 1: 19. Sed also <hi>Esai.</hi> 11: 2, &amp; 61: 1, 2.</p>
               <p>4. An eyeing of Him, as <hi>having power to send the Spirit,</hi> that anointing that teacheth us all things, and is truth and is no lie 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2: 20, 27. not only by way of intercession and intreaty, begging it of the Father <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15: 16, 17. But also autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively, as conjunct with the Father. The Father sendeth Him in Christ's name <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14: 26. and Christ sendeth Him from the Father <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15: 26. and this Spirit of truth, which guideth into all truth, shall receive of Christ's, &amp; shew it unto us <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16: 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> There would be an eyeing of Christ's <hi>readynesse, willingnesse and engadgment to helpe,</hi> in this case: and this will encourage the soul to go forward: And for this cause we would remember those things.</p>
               <p>1. That He standeth obliged to helpe us with instruction, by vertue of his office, as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> a <hi>Witnesse,</hi> a <hi>Leader,</hi> and a <hi>Commander, Esai.</hi> 55: vers. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:44048:164"/>2. That He is <hi>commissionated of the Father for this end,</hi> and so is the Fathers servant; and is given for a light to the gentiles <hi>Esai.</hi> 42: 6. &amp; 49: 6. and the Father is said to speak by Him, or in Him <hi>Heb.</hi> 1: 1.</p>
               <p>3. That He <hi>received his gifts and qualifications for this end</hi> and purpose, that He might give out and dispense to his members, according to their necessity: as is clear from <hi>Psal.</hi> 68: 18. compared with <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: 8. what He is said to have <hi>received,</hi> in the one place, he is said to have <hi>given,</hi> in the other.</p>
               <p>4. That <hi>He hath begun this work already,</hi> by his Spirit, in his followers; and therefore standeth engadged, to see it perfected: for all his works are perfect works.</p>
               <p>5. That <hi>He hath a love to his scholers,</hi> and a desire to have them all thriveing, and making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse in knowledge; this being his glory, who is their master and teacher.</p>
               <p>6. That <hi>He laid down wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>es and meanes,</hi> and a constant course, for instructing of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for.</p>
               <p>(1.) He hath given his word, and setled and established ordinances, for this end.</p>
               <p>(2.) He hath established a ministery for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing his people <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: 8, 9, 10, 13.</p>
               <p>(3.) He hath gifted persons for this work of the ministery, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 4, 5, 6 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>(4.) He backeth these officers, in the faithful administration of their function, and, through his blessing and Spirit, maketh their work prosperous and effectuall, in his own, as He seeth fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:44048:164"/>
                  <hi>Fiftly.</hi> There would be an eyeing of the promises of the covenant of grace, made for this end, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther general, or particular, or both. Such as those which we have <hi>Esai.</hi> 11: 9. <hi>Habbak.</hi> 2: 14. <hi>The earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord</hi> (or <hi>of the glory of the Lord) as the waters cover the sea:</hi> and that <hi>Esai.</hi> 32: 4. <hi>the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 34. <hi>They shall all know me</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> There would be a constant, diligent, serious and single useing of the means of knowledge, with a faithfull dependence on Christ by faith, gripping to him, in his relations, offices, engadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and promises, and waiting upon his breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in hope and patience <hi>Psal.</hi> 25: 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly.</hi> There would be a guairding against every thing, that may obstruct this work, and grieve Him, in it: and therefore we would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware.</p>
               <p>1. To undervalue and have a little esteern of knowledge: for this will grieve Him, and, to speak so, put him from work.</p>
               <p>2. To misimprove any measure of knowledge, he giveth.</p>
               <p>3. To weary of the meanes and ordinances, whereby He useth to convey knowledge in to the soul.</p>
               <p>4. To limite the holy one of Israël to this, or that meane, to this or that time, or to this or that measure, who should have a latitude, as to all these.</p>
               <p>5. To despise the day of small things, because we get not more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:44048:165"/>6. To be too curious in seeking after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of hidden mysteries, the knowledge whereof is not so necessary.</p>
               <p>7. To leane too much unto, and to depend too much upon the ordinances or instruments, as if all, or any thing, could come from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly</hi> There would be a right improving of any measure of knowledge we get, to his glory and to the edification of others, with humility &amp; thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, and so a putting of that talent in use, to gaine more to his glory: whatever measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we get, we should in all haste, put it into practice; and set it to work: so shall it increase, and engadge Him to give more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly.</hi> There would be a lying open to Christs instructions, and to the shineings of the Spirit of light and of truth, and a ready receiving of what measure He is pleased to grant or infuse: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth those duties.</p>
               <p>1. A serious and earnest hungering and thirsting after more spiritual knowledge.</p>
               <p>2. A diligent use of every approven meane for this end.</p>
               <p>3. A going about the meanes with much self denyal, spirituality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> singlenesse of heart and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, looking to and depending upon Him, who must breath upon the meanes, and make them usefull.</p>
               <p>4. A greedy receiving, drinking in, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sureing up in the soul, what is gotten.</p>
               <p>5. A guairding against Selfish and by ends, with a single eyeing of his glory.</p>
               <p>6. A guairding against pride in the heart, and a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44048:165"/>
stustying of humility and meeknesse: for <hi>the meek will He guide in judgement, and the meek will He teach his way Psal.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5: 9.</p>
               <p>7. A putting of the heart, or understanding in his hand, together with the truth, that is heard and received, that He may write the truth in the heart, and cause the heart receive the impression of that truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly.</hi> There would be a rolling of the whole matter by faith on Him, as the only teacher, a putting of the ignorant, blockish, averse, and perverse heart, into his hand, that He may frame it to his own minde, and a leaving of it there, till He by his Spirit, write in it what He thinketh meet, to his own glory, and our good.</p>
               <p>And sure, were this way followed, grouth in knowledge would not be so rare a thing as it is.</p>
               <div type="cautions">
                  <head>Cautions.</head>
                  <p>For further direction and caution in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the beleever would take notice of these parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <p>1. That he should not sit down upon any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge he hath attained to, or can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to here, as if he had enough, and should la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for no more: but he should still be mindeing his duty of seeking, and pressing for more.</p>
                  <p>2. Whenever he is about any mean of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, such as preaching, reading, conference &amp;c. his heart should be only upon Christ: He should be hanging on his lips for a word of instruction; and with greedinesse looking for a word from his mouth: he would be sending many postes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44048:166"/>
many ejaculatory desires for light and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and that with singlenesse and since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not for base ends, or out of hypocrisie.</p>
                  <p>3. Let him not think, that there is no grouth in knowledge, because possibly he perceiveth it not, or is not satisfied, as to the measure thereof; yea though possibly he perceive more ignorance, than ever he did before: If he grow in the knowledge of his own ignorance, it is a grouth of knowledge not to be despised: and in a manner, what can we else know of God, but that He farr transcendeth all our knowledge, and that He is an incomprehensible one, in all his wayes?</p>
                  <p>4. Let him not think, that there is no grouth in knowledge, because he perceiveth not a grouth in the knowledge of such or such a particular, which he desireth most: for if there be a grouth in the knowledge of other particulars, necessary to be known, there is no reason to compleane. If one grow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not, as he supposeth, in the knowledge of God, and of the mysteries of the gospel; yet if he grow in the discovery of the treachery and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his own heart, he cannot say, that he grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in knowledge.</p>
                  <p>5. Let him not measure his grouth in knowledge, by his grouth in the faculty of speaking and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing of such or such points of Religion: many measure their knowledge by their tongue, and think they know little because they can expresse little; and so they think they attaine to no increase or grouth in knowledge, because they perceive no grouth or increase in this faculty of discoursing, and talking of such or such points of truth. It is saifer to measure
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44048:166"/>
their knowledge by the impression that the truth hath on their spirits, and the effects of it on all their carriage, than by their ability or skill to talk and disput of it.</p>
                  <p>6. Let them beware to imagine, that they shall be able to search out the almighty unto perfection, <hi>canst thou</hi> (said <hi>Zophar Iob.</hi> 11: 7, 8, 9.) <hi>by searching find out God? canst thou finde out the almighty unto perfection? He is as high as heaven, what canst thou do? deeper then hell, what canst thou know? The measure thereof is longer than the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and broader than the sea.</hi> Or that they shall be able ever to win to the bottome of their own false deceitful heart, which, as <hi>Ieremiah</hi> sayeth <hi>Cap.</hi> 17: 9. <hi>is deceitful above all things, and desperatly wicked, who can know it?</hi> And which is God's prerogative alone to search and try. <hi>vers.</hi> 10. Neither let them think, so long as they are here, to win to an exact and perfect knowledge of the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God, wherein is <hi>the manifold wisdom of God Ephes.</hi> 3: 10. which very <hi>Principalities and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in heavenly places</hi> are learning; and which the <hi>Angels are</hi> poreing and <hi>looking into</hi> with desire 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 12. There is no perfection in knowledge to be had here: for here the best but <hi>knoweth in part,</hi> and <hi>Prophecyeth in part.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13: 4.</p>
                  <p>7. Let them not think that every one shall have the same measure of knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Every one hath not the like use for it, or the like capacity for it. There is a measure proportioned to every one: They should not then complean, because they have not such a measure of knowledge, as they perceive in some others. It may be, the Lord hath some
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44048:167"/>
harder piece of service, which calleth for more knowledge, to put others to. Let every one then minde his duty faithfully, and conscientiously, and let him not quarrel with God, that he attaineth not to such a measure of knowledge, as he seeth others attaine unto.</p>
                  <p>8. Neither let them think, that the same measure is required of all: for more is required of some, by reason of their office and charge, in the house of God, being called to teach and instruct others; than of others: and so more is required of such, as have larger capacities, and a better faculty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding than others, who naturally are but of a narrow reach, and of a shallow capacity: more also is required of such, as live under plaine, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull, and lively ordinances, and under a more powerful and spiritual dispensation of the grace of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than of others, that want such advantages. So likewise, more is required of old Christians, than of new beginners: Old men, of much and long experience, should know more, than such as are but babes in Christ, and of yesterday.</p>
                  <p>9. Let their desires run out after that knowledge, not which puffeth up; for there <hi>is a knowledge which puffeth up.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. but which humbleth, and driveth the soul further from it self, and nearer to Christ.</p>
                  <p>10. They would carefully distinguish betwixt the gift of knowledge, and the grace of knowledge, That ordinarily puffeth up; This humbleth: That bringeth not the soul to Iesus; This doth: That is but <hi>a forme Rom.</hi> 2: 20. and doth <hi>not retaine God Rom.</hi> 1: 28. This is a real thing, laying hold
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44048:167"/>
on God, and holdeth him fast, having the feare of the Lord for its principle, for this <hi>fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdome Iob.</hi> 28: 28. <hi>Psal.</hi> 111: 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1: 7. and 9: 10. That lyeth most in the head, and venteth most in discourses, words, yea and sometime evanisheth into vaine notions; But this goeth down to the heart, and lodgeth there, and appeareth in the mans walk &amp; conversation: as these two would be distinguished, so the one should not be measured by the other.</p>
                  <p>11 When they do not profite indeed, let them beware of quarrelling with Christ, or of blameing Him, in any manner of way: but let them lay the blame of their shortcoming on themselves, for not making more use of Him, by faith and single de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon Him. It is true, none will be so bold, as in words to quarrell with or blame Him; yet the heart is deceitful, and tacitely may raise &amp; foment such thoughts of Him, and his dispensations, as can passe under no other notion, than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling with Him. Now these would be guairded against.</p>
                  <p>12. Beware of urgeing for or expecting of immediat revelations, or extraordinary manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for we should not tempt the Lord, nor set limites to Him, neither should we prescribe meanes and wayes to Him, we must be satisfied with the ordinary meanes, which He hath appointed, and waite at wisdomes doors, with our eares nailed to his posts.</p>
                  <p>13. Whatever point of truth they learne, or whatever measure of knowledge they get<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would do well to give that back againe to Christ,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44048:168"/>
to keep for them, against a time of need; and waite on Him for grace to improve it for his glory.</p>
                  <p>14. Let them beware of mindeing things too high. <hi>Psal.</hi> 131: 1. It is better to feare and stand in awe, and to seek to lay the foundations well, to get the saving knowledge of things necessary to salvation. This will yeeld most peace and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> How to make use of Christ, as Truth, for comfort, when truth is oppressed and borne down.</head>
               <p>THere is another difficulty, wherein beleeving souls will stand in need of Christ, as <hi>the Truth,</hi> to helpe them; and that is, when his work is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, his cause borne down, truth condemned, and enemies, in their opposition to his work, prospering in all their wicked attempts. This is a very trying dispensation, as we see it was to the holy penman of <hi>Psalme</hi> 73. for it made him to stagger, so that his <hi>feet were almost gone, and his steps had well nigh slipt:</hi> yea he was almost repenting of his being a godly person, saying <hi>vers.</hi> 13. <hi>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ly</hi> I <hi>have clansed my heart in vaine, &amp; washed my hands in innocencie.</hi> It was something like this, which made <hi>Ieremie</hi> say <hi>Cap,</hi> 8: 18. <hi>when</hi> I <hi>would comfort my self against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. The harvest was past, and the summer was ended, and yet they were not saved. vers.</hi> 20. and they <hi>looked for peace, but no</hi>

                  <hi>good came, and for a time of health, but behold trouble vers.</hi> 15. and this was fainting and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. And what made <hi>Baruch, Ieremiah's</hi> faith full companion in tribulation, say, <hi>woe is me now; for the Lord hath added grief to my sorow,</hi> I <hi>fainted in my sighing, and</hi> I <hi>finde no rest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ier.</hi> 45: 3. but this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that all things were turning upside down. God was breaking down that, which he had bui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>; and plucking up that; which he had planted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tribulation and suffering for a good cause, is even fainting to some; as the Apostle hinteth <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 13. when he sayes, <hi>wherefore</hi> I <hi>desire that yee fainte not, at my tribulation for you.</hi> And that which evinceth the danger of this dispensation, is the fainting and backsliding of many, in such a time of tryal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as sad experience too often cleareth.</p>
               <p>Now the beleevers stay in this case, must be the rock of ages, Jesus, <hi>the Truth.</hi> It is He alone, who can keep streight and honest, in such a reeling time. So that a sight of Christ, as <hi>the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> in reference to the carrying on of Truth in the earth, and throughing his cause and work, will be the only support of a soul, shaken by such a piece of tryal.</p>
               <p>But the question is, How should Beleevers make use of Christ, in such a time, to the end they may be keeped from fainting and succumbing in such a storme? To which I <hi>answere.</hi> That the faith and consideration of those particulars would helpe to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment.</p>
               <p>1. That Christ, in all this great work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and in every piece of it, is the Fathers servant. So is He frequently called, <hi>his servant Esai.</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:44048:169"/>
42: 1. &amp; 49: 3, 5, 6. &amp; 52: 13. &amp; 53: 11. <hi>Zech.</hi> 3: 8. &amp; therefore this work is a work intrusted to Him, &amp; He standeth engadged as a servant, to be faithful to his trust. Moreover adde to this, that He hath a commission to perfect that work; and we need not doubt, but He, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> will be true to his trust. <hi>Him hath God the Father sealed Iohn.</hi> 6: 27. &amp; He oft tells us himself, that He <hi>is sent of the Father Iohn.</hi> 4: 34. &amp; 5: 23, 24, 30, 36, 37. &amp; 6: 38: 39. 40, 44, 57. &amp; 8: 16, 18. &amp; 12: 44, 45, 49. &amp; 7: &amp; 9: 4. &amp; 10: 36. &amp; 11: 42.</p>
               <p>2. That while He was upon the earth, He fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished that work, that was committed to Him to finish here, having purchased all that was to be bought by his blood, paying all the price that justice did ask <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17: 4. &amp; 19: 30. By which price he hath purchased a people to himself <hi>Revel.</hi> 5: 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1: 68. So that His work, cause, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest is a purchased work, bought with his blood.</p>
               <p>3. That his resurrection and glorification is an undoubted proof of this, that justice is satisfied, and that the price is fully payed; and also that his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation at the Fathers right hand is a sure evidence &amp; ground of hope, that He shall at last triumphe over all his enemies; and that his work of truth shall prosper. The Father said to Him <hi>Psal.</hi> 110: 1. <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, until</hi> I <hi>make thine enemies, thy foot stool.</hi> Being now highly exalted, he hath <hi>got a name above every name, that in his name every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth, and that every tongue should confesse, that Iesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father Phil.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:44048:169"/>4. That the Father standeth engadged to make good to Him, all that was promised, and to give Him all that He purchased <hi>Esa.</hi> 53: 10, 11, 12. Christ, having now fulfilled his undertaking, by making his soul an offering for sin, and so satisfying justice, which is openly declared by his resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, admission to glory, as the Head of his elect, is to expect the accomplishment of what was condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned unto Him. His work therefore on the earth must prosper: and the Father hath undertaken to see it prosper. Sure the faith of this would much support a poor soul, staggering at the thoughts of the prosperity of the wicked, and of their evil cause.</p>
               <p>5. That Christ himself is now throughly furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and inabled, for the carrying on of his work, over the belly of all adversaries, for <hi>all power in heaven and earth is given to Him Matth.</hi> 28: 18. and <hi>every knee must bow to Him. Phil.</hi> 2: 10. <hi>all judgment is committed unto Him Ioh.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>: 22, 27. <hi>Angels, powers and authoritie are made subject unto Him</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3: 22. Yea <hi>all things are under Him Ephes.</hi> 1: 22. How then can his work miscarry? or who can hinder, that truth should not flourish in the earth?</p>
               <p>6. That Christ is actually at work, imploying this power for the carrying forward of his designe, for the glory of the Father and for his own glory, and for the good of his poor people. The Father worketh by Him, and He by the Spirit, which is his great vicegerent, sent from the Father, and from Him, and his work is to glorify the Son, and shall receive of his, and show it unto us <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16: 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:44048:170"/>7, That Christ, upon many accounts, standeth engadged to perfect this work, which He hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and is about. His honour is engadged to go thorow, seing now He is fully furnished for it, and hath all the creation at his command. He must then perfect his work, as to the application, as well as He did perfect it, as to the purchase: His love to his Fathers &amp; his own glory, &amp; to his own peoples good and salvation may assure us, that He will not leave the work unperfected; and his power and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may give us full security, that no stope, which his work meeteth with, shall be able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>8. That hence it is clear and manifest, that his wheel is in the midst of the wheels of men, and that therefore He is ordering all their motions and reel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the best. His wheel keepeth an even pace and moveth equally &amp; equably, in the midst of mens contrary motions.</p>
               <p>9. And that therefore, all the eccentrick and irregular motions of devils and wicked men, being in His hand, and ordered by Him, cannot hinder but further His end; So that even enemies, while opposeing and seeking to destroy the cause and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of Christ, that his name and truth should no more be mentioned, are promoveing his work. His wheel is the great wheel that ordereth all the lesser and subordinate wheels, whatever contrary motions they may have the one to the other, and all or many of them may seem to have to this great wheel. So that, do they what they will, the work of our Lord goeth on. Their opposition is setting his work forward, though they intend the contrary. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44048:170"/>
their faces look, they row to the port, He would be at. This is an undoubted truth, and confirmed in all ages, and yet is not firmly beleev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and a truth it is, which, if beleeved, would do much to settle our staggering souls in a stormy day.</p>
               <p>10, That at last, He shall come <hi>to be glorifyed in his saints</hi> 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1: 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when <hi>He shall be revealed from heaven with all his mighty angels</hi> vers. 7. Then shall it be seen, whose shall counsel stand His or mens; and whose work shall prosper, His or Satans.</p>
               <div type="cautions">
                  <head>Cautions.</head>
                  <p>Yet let me adde a few words, for caution and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection here.</p>
                  <p>1. The consideration of those things mentioned should not make us slacken our diligence in prayer, and other duties: and when they are a right consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they will rather prove a spurre and a goad in our side, to set us forward, than a bridle to hold us aback.</p>
                  <p>2. We would not think, that Christ's work and interest is going backward alwayes, when it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so to us. Even when He is casting downe. what He hath built up; and plucking up, what He hath planted, his work is prospering, for all that is in order to the laying of a better foundation, and to the carrying on of a more glorious work; when He shall lay all the stones with faire colours, &amp; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations with saphires, and make the windowes of crystal &amp;c. <hi>Esai.</hi> 5 4: 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>3. Though his work be alwayes going on, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44048:171"/>
his truth prospering; yet we would not think that it will alwayes prosper alike, in our apprehensions; many times we judge by rules of our own making, and not by the rule of truth; and hence it is that we mistake oftentimes. We walk little by faith, and too much by sense; and hence we judge too much by sense, and so passe a wrong judgement, to his dishonour, and the sadning of our own hearts.</p>
                  <p>4. Nor would we think, that His Truth and interest is ruined and gone, because it is sore oppressed, in this or that particular place of the world; as if his work were not of an universal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and in all the churches. If his truth thrive and prosper in some other place of the world, shall we not say, that his kingdome is coming? Or shall we limite all his work and interest to one small part of the world?</p>
                  <p>5. We would not think the worse of his work, because it is carryed on with so many stops, and doth meet with so many Impediments in its way: We are not acquanted with the depths of his infinite wisdome and counsel: and so we see not what noble ends He hath before Him, in suffering those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to lie in the way of his chariot. We think He should ride so triumphantly all alongs, that none should once dar to cast the least block in his way: but we judge carnally, as unacquanted with the many noble and glorious designes, which He hath, in ordering matters. As Himself was for a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; so will he have the way of the carrying on of his work prove, in his holy and spotlesse justice, a stumbling stone to many, that shall stumble thereat, and fall, and never rise any more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:44048:171"/>6. We would beware to think, that Christ-hath forgotten his work, because He seemeth to take no notice of our prayers, which we are putting up, now and then for his work. He may be doing that, which we are desireing, in the general, and yet not let us know, that He is answering our prayers: &amp; that for wise and holy ends, to keep us humble &amp; diligent. He may seem to misregaird our suites, and yet be carrying on his work, and granting us our desires, upon the matter.</p>
                  <p>7. Hence we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ould beware of desponding, and growing heartlesse and fainte, when we see few owneing truth, Or standing upon Christ's side; for He needeth not mans help, to carry on his work, though He sometimes thinketh good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend so far, as to honour some to be instrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in setting of it forward, who yet have nothing but as He giveth; let us not then think, that his work cannot prosper, because great ones and meane ones oppose it, and such as should stand for it and owne it, are few and fainting, without strength courage or Zeal.</p>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>pe of obloquy. For satisfaction to this question, I shall shortly point out those directions, which, if followed, may prove helpful to keep the soul from fainting, misbeleeving, doubting, quarrelling at the Lord's dispensations, and from yeelding to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in such a day.</p>
               <p>1. The beleever would live in the conviction of his hazard, through the slight of Satan, the strength of the temptation, the wickednesse and treachery of the heart, the evil example of others, and the want of sanctified courage, Zeal and resolution; and this will keep the soul humble, and farr from boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its own strength, which was <hi>Peter's</hi> fault.</p>
               <p>2. They would live in the faith and perswasion of this. That it is Christ alone, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> who can help them to stand for truth, in a day of temptation; and that all their former purposes, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, resolutions, solemne professions, and the like, will prove but weak cables to hold them fast, in a day of storme: and that only the rock of ages must save them; and their being a ley ward of Him, and partaking of his warme and saife protection,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44048:172"/>
will do their businesse. That all their stock of grace, and knowledge, and that confirmed with resolutions and sincere purposes, will helpe but little, in that day: and that new influences of grace and truth, from the fountaine, that is full of grace and truth, will only prove establishing to the soul, and confirme it in the truth, in that day.</p>
               <p>3. Therefore, they would eye Christ in his <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> particularly as the great <hi>Prophet,</hi> who can teach, as never man taught; so teach, as to make the soul receive the doctrine, and to hold it fast, to receive it in love, and lay it up in the heart, as a rich and enriching treasure.</p>
               <p>4.

They would look on Christ as <hi>an exalted conquerour,</hi> now risen and glorified: as a victorious captaine, that hath fought and overcome; that they, as his followers, may be made partakers of his victory and conquest, and so reape the fruit of his resurrection and ascension, in their establishment in the truth, when it is borne down, and questioned, yea and condemned by men. He abode stedfast and unmoveable in the midst of all the stormes, that blew in his face: and as He came to bear witnesse to the truth; so did He faithfully and zealously avow truth, even to the death; and in death got the victory of the Arch liar and deceiver. Now the beleever would eye this, for the strengthening of his faith and hope of victory also, through Him: and therefore would waite patiently for his help; and not make haste: for <hi>they who beleeve make not haste Esa.</hi> 28: 16. knowing that He is true and faithful and will not disappoint his followers, that trust in Him. And moreover, it would be of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them, in this case, to eye that gracious and comfortable word <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14: 19—<hi>because</hi> I <hi>live, you shall live also:</hi> and so by faith conclude, that seing Christ now liveth, as a conquerour over darknesse, untruth, reproaches, calumnies, and opposition of liars, yea of the father of lies; they, through Him, shall also live, and ride out that storme: and this will give much courage to the soul, to endure temptation, and to waite in patience for an outgate.</p>
               <p>7. They would study much, and suck at the grand promise of his coming againe, and of final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispelling all clouds: and of fully clearing up
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44048:173"/>
his glorious truths, that are now covered over with obloquie, and buryed under reproaches: and this will encourage the soul to stand to truth, in the midst of all opposition, beleeving that, at length, truth, how much soever opposed now, shall be victorious.</p>
               <p>8. They should be single in their dependence on Him, for strength and throwbearing, in that day of tryal; not leaning to their own understanding; <hi>but acknowledging Him in all their wayes Prov.</hi> 3: 6. and when they see no hope of outgate in the world, nor appearance of the clearing up of the day, they would comfort themselvs, and encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Lord, as <hi>David</hi> did, in a great straite 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 30: 6.</p>
               <p>9. Upon the forementioned grounds, they would cast all the care of their throughbearing on Him, who careth for them 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5: 7. rolling all their difficulties on Him, consulting only with Him, &amp; his Word, and not with flesh and blood; and so they would commit their wayes to Him, who disposeth of all things, as He seeth good; forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to limite the holy one of Israel, or to quarrel with Him for any thing he doth; and patiently wait for his out-gate, and delivery.</p>
               <p>10. It were good, in this time of tryal, to be remembring the worth of truth, and intertaining high thoughts of the smallest piece of truth, that is questioned, for his sake, who is <hi>the Truth:</hi> that a sight of the glorious worth thereof, may make them account the lesse of all they can lose, in the defence and maintenance thereof.</p>
               <p>11. So were it good at this time, when truthes
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44048:174"/>
come to be questioned, to be lying neare to <hi>the Truth,</hi> for light, and to be keeping fast, what He by his Spirit cleareth up to be truth, though the light should not be so full, as to dispel all objections. This were to depend upon Him for light, with singlenesse of heart; and in godly simplicity and sincerity to follow his direction and torch, though it should not shine so bright, as they would wish.</p>

                  <p>A few words of caution will be usefull here also: as</p>
                  <p>1. The beleever, though taking this course, would not think to be altogether free of fear of stepping aside, in lesse or in more: God may think good, to let much of this abide, to the end he may be keeped watchfull, tender and diligent; for fear maketh the soul circumspect and watchfull; and this is a good preservative from defection.</p>
                  <p>2. Nor would the beleever think, that hereby he shall be keeped altogether free of fainting. The heart now and then, through fear and misbeleef, may fall into a fit of fainting, and think all is gone: and yet He may carry poor souls thorow, and make his strength perfect in their weaknesse 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12: 9.

                  <p>3. They would not think it strange, if in the time of their wreastling with difficultyes, the Lord

                  <p>4. In all this businesse, beleevers would carry singly, with an eye to God's glory; and would not be acted with self-ends, or drawn by carnal and selfy motives. They would not desire stability and through bearing, to be seen of men, or to gaine applause and the praise of Men; lest God be provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave them to themselves, and they at length come off with discredit, as <hi>Peter</hi> did.

many are led away with delusions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Satan can change himself into an angel of light, and make many great and faire like pretensions to holinesse, and under that pretext ushere-in untruthes, and gaine the consent of many unto them; so that, in such a time of temptation, many are stollen off their feet, and made to depart from the right wayes of God, and to imbrace error and delusions, in stead of truth. Now the question is, how a poor beleever shall make use of Christ, who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> for keeping him stedfast in the truth, in such a day of tryal, and from imbracing the way of error, how plausible soever it may appeare: for satisfaction to this, we shall propose those few things.</p>
               <p>1. In such a time, when a Spirit of error is let loose and rageth, and carrieth severall away, it were good for all, who would be keeped streight &amp; honest, to be walking in feare. It is not good to despise such a s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ye and subtile enemy, especially in the houre and power of darknesse. Then all are called to be on their guaird, and to stand upon their watch toure, and to be jealous of their corrupt hearts, that are ready enough, of their own accord, to drink-in errour, and to receive the temptation, at any time, and much more then.</p>
               <p>2. They would not think, that their knowledge, and ability to dispute for truth, will keep them stedfast, if there be not more: for if the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grow, they may come to reasone and dispute themselves out of all their former knowledge and skill. The father of lies is a cuning sophister, and knoweth how to shake their grounds, and cast all loose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:44048:175"/>3. They would renew their covenant grips of Christ, and make sure that maine businesse. <hi>viz.</hi> their peace and union with God in Christ, and their accepting of Christ for their Head and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. They would labour to have the fundation sure, and to be united unto the chief corner stone; that so, blow the storme as it will, they may ride saifely; and that hereby they may have accesse to Christ with boldnesse, in their difficulty; and may with confidence seek light from Him, in the houre of darknesse.</p>
               <p>4. To the end they may be keeped more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and circumspect, they would remember, that it is a dishonourable thing to Christ, for them to step aside, in the least matter of truth: the denying of the least point of truth, is a consequentiall denying of him, who is <hi>the Truth:</hi> and to lose a foot in the matters of truth, is very dangerous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for who can tell when they, who once slip a foot, shall recover it againe? And who can tell how many, and how dreadful errors, they may drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>in, who have once opened the door to a small errour? Therefore they would beware of tampering in this matter, and to admit any errour, upon the account that it is a small and inconsiderable one: there may be an unseen concatenation betwixt one errour and another, and betwixt a small one and a greater one, so as if the little one be admitted and received, the greater shall follow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it may be feared that if they once dally with errour, and make a gape in their consciences, that God give them up to judiciall blindenesse, that, ere all be done, they shall imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

                     <pb n="256" facs="tcp:44048:177"/>
which God hath also appointed for this end, to make known to us his minde: there must we waite for him and his light. Thus must we waite at the posts of wisdomes doors: and waite for the king of light, in his own way, wherein He hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to waite for Him. And if He think good to come another way, more immediat, Let Him alwayes be welcome: but let not us limite Him, nor prescribe wayes to Him; but follow his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>2. When any thing is borne-in upon their Spirit, as a truth to be received. or as an errour to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, more immediately, they would beware of admitting of every such thing, without tryal and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination: for we are expressely forbidden to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve every Spirit, and commanded to try them, whether they are of God or not 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4: 1. The Lord will not take it ill, that even his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat motions and revelations be tryed and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word; because the word is given us for this end, to be our teste and standart of truth. The way of immediat revelation is not the ordinary way now of God's manifesting his minde to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He hath now chosen another way, and given us a more sure word of prophecie, than was even a voice from heaven, as <hi>Peter</hi> sayeth 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 18, 19. It is commended in the <hi>Bereans Act.</hi> 17: 11. who upon this account were <hi>more noble, then those of Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica, in that they received the word with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, &amp; searched the scriptures dayly, whether those things were so.</hi> Even <hi>Pauls</hi> words, though he was an authorized, &amp; infallible Apostle of Christ's, are here put to the touch stone of the

word. Many false Prophets may go out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many, and speak great swelling words of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4: 1. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 18. and the devil can transchange himself into an angel of light 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 14. And though an Angel out of heaven should preach any other thing, than what is in the written word, we ought not to receive his doctrine, but to reject it, and to account him accursed <hi>Gal.</hi> 1: 8. So that the written word must be much studied by us; and by it must we try all motions, all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, all inspirations, all revelations, and all manifestations.</p>
                  <p>3. Much more would they beware of thinking, that the dictats of their conscience obligeth them, so as that alwayes they must of necessity follow the same. Conscience, being God's deputy in the soul, is to be followed no further, than it speaketh for God, and according to truth. An erring conscience, though it binde so far, as that he who doth contrary to the dictats thereof sinneth against God, in that, knowing no other than that the dictats of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are right and consonant to the minde of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet dar counteract the same, and thus formally rebel against Gods authoritie; yet it doth not oblige us to beleeve and to do, what it asserteth to be truth, and duty. It will not then be enough for them to say, my conscience, and the light within me speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth so, and instructeth me so: for that light may be darknesse, and errour and a delusion; and so no rule for them to walk by. <hi>To the law and to the testimony:</hi> and, if their conscience, minde, or light within them, <hi>speak not according to this word, it is because there is no lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ing conscience, and get a conscience rightly informed by the word: puting it in Christ's hand, to be better formed and informed; that so it may do its office better. This then would be especially guairded against; for if once they lay downe this for a principle, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their conscience and minde or in ward light (as some call it) dictat, must be followed, there is no delusion, how false, how abominable so ever it be, but they may be at length in hazard to be drawn away with: and so the rule, that they will walk be, be nothing in effect but the Spirit of lies and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion; and the motions and dictates of him, who is the Father of lies, that is, the Devil.</p>
                  <p>4. Such as pretend so much to walk by consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would take h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed, that they take not that for the dictate of conscience, which really is but the dictat of their own humors, inclinations, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupyed mindes, and byassed wills. When con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science speaketh, it groundeth on the authority of God, whether truely or falsely, and proposeth such a thing, to be done, or to be refrained from, meerly because God commandeth that, and forbiddeth this, though sometimes it mistaketh: but, though the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

authority, for what they say, yet really some car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal respect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> selfish end and the like, lyeth at the bottom, and is the chiefe spring of that motion: and also the dictats of humor, and byassed willes are usually more violent and fierce, then the dictats of conscience; for wanting the authority of God to back their assertions and prescriptions, they must make up that with an addition of a preternatural force and strength. Hence such as are purely led by conscience, are pliable, humble, and ready to heare and receive information; whereas others are headstrong, and pertinacious, unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive instruction, or to heare any thing contrary to their mindes, lest their conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> receiving more light, speak with a higher voyce, against their inclinations, and former wayes; and so create more trouble to them; whileas now they enjoy more quiet within, so long as the cry of their self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will &amp; byassed judgment is so loud, that they can not well hear the still and low voyce of conscience.</p>
                  <p>5. They would labour for much self denyal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sincerity; and to be free from the snares and power of selfish ends, as credite, a name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and applause, or what of that kinde, that may be like the <hi>fear of man,</hi> that <hi>bringeth a snare: Prov.</hi> 29: 2. 5. for that will be like <hi>a gift,</hi> that <hi>blindeth the eyes of the wise Exod.</hi> 23: 8. love to carry on a party, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, to be seen and accounted some body, to maintaine their credite and reputation, lest they be accounted changelings, and the like, will prove very dangerous in this case: for these may forcibly carry the soul away, to imbrace one er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour after another, and one errour to strengthen
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44048:179"/>
and confirme another, that it is hard to know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where or when they shall stand: and these by-respects may so forcibly drive the soul forward, that he shall neither heare the voice of conscience within, nor any instruction from without.</p>
                  <p>6. They would study the word of truth, without prejudice and any sinfull preingadgment, lest they be made thereby to wiredraw and wrest the word, to their own destruction; as some, of whom <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3: 16. It is a dangerous thing, to study the word with a prejudicat opinion; and to bow or wiredraw the word, and make it speak what we would have it speak, for the confirmation of out opinions and sentiments: for that is but to mock God and his law; and to say, Let his law speak what it will, I will maintaine this opinion; and so make the word speak, as we would have it, or else lay it by. This is to walk by some other rule, than the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make the word serve our lusts, and confirme our errours, than which a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indignitie can not be done to the Spirit of truth, speaking in the word.</p>
                  <p>7. In reading and studying of the word, there would be much single dependance on the Spirit for light: waiting for clearnesse from Him, whom Christ hath promised to lead us into all truth. An earnest wreastling with Him for his assistance, enlightening the minde with divine light, to understand the truth, and inclineing the soul to a ready imbraceing and receiveing of the truth, declared in the word.</p>
                  <p>8. Though one place of scripture be enough to confirme any point of truth, and ground sufficient for us to beleeve what is there said, there being
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44048:179"/>
nothing in scripture, but what is truth: yet in such a time of abounding errours, and when many are going abroad, speaking perverse things, to lead the simple away, it were spiritual wisdome to be compareing scripture with scripture; and not to be lightly imbracing whatever may seem probable, and fairely deduceable from some one passage or other of scripture; but to be comparing that with other passages, and see what concord there is: for this is certane, what ever point contradicteth other clear and manifest testimonies of scripture cannot be true; how ever a cunning sophister may make it seem very probably to flow out of such or such a passage of scripture. The testimony of the Spirit is uniforme, and free from all contradictions: and therefore we must see, if such an assertion, that some would draw from such a passage, agree with other plaine passage: and if not, be sure, that that is not the meaning of the place. When the devil did wreste and abuse that passage of truth <hi>Psal.</hi> 91: 11. <hi>He shall give his angels charge concearning thee.</hi> &amp;c. and from thence would inferre, that Christ might cast himself down. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4; 6. Christ shew that this inference was bad, because it did not agree with other divine testimonies, particularly not with that <hi>Deut.</hi> 6: 16. <hi>Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God:</hi> And thereby he teacheth us to take this course, in times of temptation? and so <hi>compare spirituall things with spirituall,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2: 13. Especially they would beware of expounding clear Scriptures by such as are more dark and mysterious: See 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3: 16. it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:44048:180"/>
saifer, to explaine darker passages by such as are more clear.</p>
                  <p>9. Let them guaird against an humore of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanglednesse, nauseating old and solide truthes, and seeking after something new, having eares itching after new doctrines, yea or new modes and dresses of old truthes: for this is provocking to God, and proveth dangerous; for such <hi>turne away their eares from the truth, and are turned into fables, as Paul</hi> telleth us. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4: 3. 4. <hi>for the time will come,</hi> sayeth he, <hi>when they will not endure sound doctrine, but after their owne lusts, shall they heape to themselves teachers, having itching ears: and they shall turne away their eares from the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and shall be turned unto fables.</hi> This favoureth of a spirit of levity and inconstancy; which is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
                  <p>10. They would labour to have no prejudice at the truth, but receive it in love, and the love of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lest for that cause God give them up to strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusions to beleeve lies, and to be led away with the deceiveablnesse of unrighteousnesse: as we see 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2: 10, 11, 12. <hi>and with all deceivablenesse of unrighteousnesse in them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should beleev a lie; that they all might be damned, who beleeved not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousnesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>11. So would they beware of stifling the truth, of making it a prisoner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; detaineing it in unrighteousnesse, like those spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 18.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:44048:180"/>
                     <hi>for which cause God gave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them up to uncleannesse and to vile affections, and they became vaine in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened; yea professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. vers.</hi> 21, 22, 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26. They should let truth have free liberty, and power in the soul; and should yeeld up themselves to be ruled and guided by it: and not thorture with it, lay chaines upon it, or fetter it, and keep it as a prisoner, that can do nothing.</p>
                  <p>2. For this cause, they would hold fast the truth, which they have learned, and have been taught by the Spirit out of the word. When <hi>Paul</hi> would gua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>rd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fortifie <hi>Timothy</hi> against seducers, that creept into houses, leading captive silly women &amp;c. among other directions, he giveth him this 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>But continue thou in the things, which thou hast learned, and hast bin assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned; and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise to Salvation &amp;c.</hi> So he would have the <hi>Colossians</hi> walking in Christ, rooted and build up in Him, &amp; <hi>stablished in the faith, as they had been taught Col.</hi> 2. 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>13. Especially they would be holding the ground-work fast, saith in Christ: It were good, in such a time of erring from the way of truth, to be griping Christ faster, and cleaving to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Him by faith, and living by faith in Him. This is to hold the foundation fast; and then let the tempest of errour blow as it will, they will ride at a sure anchor, and be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44048:181"/>
dangerous day, would be a noble preservative from the infections of error. The soul that is dwelling in Christ, and griping to Him dayly by faith, and acting love on Him, dwelleth in light, and will discover errour, sooner than another, because liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the rayes of the sun of righteousnesse; which discovereth errour.</p>
                  <p>14. They would labour to learne the truth, as it is in <hi>Iesus;</hi> and the truthes, which they have heard of Him, and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Him, will abide, when other truthes, that have been learnt but of men, and heard of men, and as it was in the preaching of men, and in books, shall soon evanish, in a day of trial. This is to learne Christ, as the Apostle speaketh <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: 20, 21. <hi>But yee have not so learned Christ, if so be that ye have heard Him, and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Iesus,</hi> When we learne the truth, as it is in Iesus, it bringeth us alwayes in to Him, and hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to fixe our hearts on Him, and is a piece of the bond that bindeth us to him and his way: we receive it then as a piece of his doctrine, which we must owne, and stand unto; O if we learned all our divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thus! we would be more constant and stedfast in it, then we are.</p>
                  <p>15. When controversies arise, and they know not which side to choise; both seemeth to them to be alike well founded on the word, they would exerce their spiritual sagacity, and set their gift of discerning a work, to see which of the two tendeth most to promove piety and godlinesse, and the kingdome of Christ: and so see which of the two is
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44048:181"/>
the <hi>truth, which is after godlinesse,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh <hi>Tit.</hi> 1: 1. they must look which of the two is the doctrine, which is according to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6: vers. 3. That is thetruth which is Christ's, and which should be owned and imbraced, <hi>viz,</hi> which floweth from a Spirit of godlinesse, &amp; tendeth to promove godlinesse, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>eth with the true principles of godlinesse, even gospel godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, wrought according to the tenor of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace; that is, by the strength of the Spirit of Jesus, dwelling and working in us; and not according to the tenor of the covenant of works, that is, wrought by our own strength &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>16. Yet withal, they would take heed, that they mistake not here: for they may look upon some wayes and doctrines, as having a greater ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to promove godlinesse, then others; which indeed have not, but only seem so. They would therefore consider well, what is the way of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse laid down in the noble device of the gospel, which is the way that only glorifyeth <hi>God, Father, Son and Holy Ghost;</hi> and see what suiteth most with that, according to the word; and not what seemeth most suitable to godlinesse in their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension. The word is the best judge and teste of true godlinesse; and in the word, we have the only saifest meane of true godlinesse held forth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore we should see, what doctrine tendeth most to promove godlinesse, according to the way held forth in the word, and choose that.</p>
                  <p>17. They would guaird against pride and selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceite, as thinking they are wise enough, and understanding enough, in those matters: and so
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44048:182"/>
need not take a lesson of any. This may be of great prejudice, for itis <hi>the meek, that God guideth in judgment. And to the meek will He teach his way Psal.</hi> 25: 9. Therefore it were good for his people in such a day, to be meek and humble, willing &amp; ready to learne of any person, how meane so ever, that can teach the wayes of God. The Lord may bless a word spoken by a private person, when he will not bless the word spoken by a Minister: for his blessings are free. And itis not good to despise any meane: <hi>Apollos,</hi> though instructed in the way of the Lord, mighty in the Scriptures, fervent in Spirit, and teaching diligently the things of the Lord <hi>Act.</hi> 18: 24, 25. Yet was content to learne of <hi>Aquila</hi> &amp; of his wife <hi>Priscilla,</hi> when they expounded unto Him the way of God more perfectly <hi>vers.</hi> 26.</p>
                  <p>18. In such a time, itis not unsaife to look to such, as have been eminent in the way of God, and lye neare to Him: for itis probable, they may know much of the minde of God, in those question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matters: Hence, we finde the Apostle putting <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> &amp; others to this duty, in a time when false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers were going abroad, saying 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3: 10. <hi>But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life:</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 16. <hi>wherefore</hi> I <hi>beseech you be ye followers of me:</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: 1. &amp; Againe <hi>Phil.</hi> 3: 17. <hi>Brethren be followers together of me.</hi> All which say, that though we should call no man <hi>Rabbi,</hi> as hanging our faith absolutely on Him; yet in such a time of prevailing errour, and of false teachers going abroad, some respect should be had to such, as have found grac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

persecution, and have with singleness of heart fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Lord; It not being ordinare with God, to leave such, as in sincerity seek Him, and desire to follow his way, in truth and uprightness; and to give the revelation of his minde, and the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of his Spirit, to others, who have not gone thorow such trials.</p>
                  <p>19. They would also at such a time be much in the sincere practice of uncontroverted duties, and in putting uncontroverted and unquestionable and unquestioned truthes into practice: and this may prove a notable meane to keep them right: for then are they in God's way; and so the devil hath not that advantage of them, that he hath of others, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>20. It were good and suteable at such a time, to be much in the feare of God; remembering what an one He is, and how hazardous itis to sin against Him, by drinking-in the least point of errour. The promise is made to such. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25: 12. <hi>What man is he that feareth the Lord, him shall He teach in the way that he shall chuse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Finally, at such a time, they would be much in communion with Jesus, lying neare Him; much in prayer to Him, studying his Relations, Offices, Furniture, Readiness to helpe with light and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; and they would draw neare to Him with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, boldness, faith, confidence, love, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and sincerity; and then they shall not finde that He shall fail them or disappoint them.</p>

               <p>THe beleever is oft complaining of darkness, concearning his case and condition, so as he cannot tell what to say of himself, or what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to passe on himself, and he knoweth not how to win to a distinct and clear discovery of his state and condition.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider then</p>
               <p>1. That grace may be in the soul, and yet not be seen nor observed: this is manifest by daylie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
               <p>2. Not only so, but a gracious soul, that is reconciled with God in Christ, and hath the Spirit of grace dwelling in it, may suppose itself a stranger yet unto this reconciliation, and you of the grace of God, and so to be still in the state of nature.</p>
               <p>3. Yea, a soul may not only suppose and conclude

it self in nature, while it is in a state of grace, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>urder, may be filled with terrour and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of God's wrath and indignation; and that in such a measure, as that thereby it may be as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted person, as we see it was with <hi>Heman, Psal.</hi> 88: 15. who said, <hi>while I suffer thy terrours, I am distracted.</hi> The wrath of God lay hard upon Him, and he said, that he was afflicted with all God's waves <hi>vers.</hi> 7. hence he cryed out <hi>vers.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me, thy terrours have cutt me off, they came round about me dayly, (or all the day) like water, they compassed me about to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,</hi> And yet for all this, the first word of his complaint was faith <hi>vers.</hi> 1.

               <p>4. Yea further, with those inward strokes upon the soul, they may have sin and guilt charged home upon their consciences: and this will make their life yet more bitter, &amp; put a sharper edge upon the rods.

               </p>
               <p>Now though sometimes, as we see in <hi>Iob,</hi> and in <hi>Heman</hi> too, a soul may be under such a sad and sharpe dispensation, and yet not brought to question their state, or to conclude themselves child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of wrath, lyeing still in blacke nature; yet it is not so with all, who are so exercised: but many, under such a dispensation, may, at least, be in the dark, as to their state before God: and if they do not positively assert their state to be bad; yet they do much question, if they be in the state of grace, and would be comforted under all their pressures and afflictions, if they could win to the least well grounded apprehension of their interest in Christ.</p>
               <p>In such a case as this is, there is ground fot a poor soul to make use of Christ for outgate; and an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate may be had in God's time, and as He seeth sit, by a right use-making of and going<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out to Him, who is <hi>the Truth.</hi> So then the soul, that would
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44048:184"/>
have its state and condition cleared up, and a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of its being reconciled to God through Jesus, and in a state of grace, and would make use of Christ as <hi>the Truth,</hi> for this end, would</p>
               <p>1. Look out to Christ, as a <hi>feeling Highpriest, faithful and mercyful,</hi> who, being like us in all things except sin, doth sympathize with, and <hi>succure such as are tempted Heb.</hi> 2: 17: 18. And as a Priest, that is <hi>touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb.</hi> 4: 15. Albeit Christ, in the deepest of his darknesse, was never made to question his soneshipe, but avouched God to be his God, even when he was forsaken, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22: 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 27: 46. <hi>Mark.</hi> 15: 34. Yet He knew what it was to be tempted <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to question his sonshipe, when the devil said unto Him <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. <hi>if thou be the Son of God,</hi> and He knowes, what such a distresse, as He himself was into, wreastling with an angry God, hideing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and forsaking, will worke in a poor sinner, and being a mercyful and sympathizeing Highpriest, he cannot but pity such as are under such a distemper; and as a gracious Head sympathize with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now the beleever would look out to Him, as such an one, and upon this ground go to Him with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and boldnesse, and lay out their case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him, that He may helpe and send reliefe.</p>
               <p>2. They would also eye Christ, as <hi>able to save out of that condition,</hi> and to command light to shine out of darknesse: and so, as one <hi>able to save to the uttermost, all that come to God through Him Heb.</hi> 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 25.</p>
               <p>3. And not only so, but eye Him also, as <hi>given, sent and commissioned of the Father, to be a light to</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:44048:185"/>
                  <hi>such,</hi> as sit in darknesse; even to the Gentiles, <hi>Esa.</hi> 42: 6. &amp; 49: 6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2: 32. <hi>Act.</hi> 13: 47. &amp; 26: 23. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8: 12. and this will encourage the poor Souls to go out to him, with their darknesse, when they see that He is sent, as a <hi>Light,</hi> and as <hi>the Truth,</hi> to clear up poor souls, that walk in darknesse and have no light: when they see, that it is his place and office to helpe them; and consider that He is true to his trust, and true and faithful, in all that was committed to Him, it not only will embolden them to come forward to Him, but it will streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their hope, and encourage them to waite on.</p>
               <p>4. They would <hi>stay themselves on Him, as an alsufficient helper,</hi> renunceing all other; crying out, that they will have no light, but His light; and that they will seek no where else for light, but waite at His door, till He, who is <hi>the Sun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, arise</hi> in their soul, and come with hailing light in his wings.</p>
               <p>5. They would <hi>by faith roll and cast their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened souls,</hi> their confused case, their over whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hearts, <hi>on Him,</hi> and leave them there: for He is the only physitian: and the blinde soul must be put in his hand, who can take away the filme, and cause the scales fall off, and make light break in to the soul, and discover to it its condition.</p>
               <p>6. It would be useful and very steadable, in such a time of darknesse, for the beleever, to be <hi>frequent in acting direct acts of faith on Christ;</hi> that is, be frequent in going to Him, as an alsufficient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, as the only refuge and shadow, for a po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>and a covert from the tempest, as rivers of water in a drye place, as the shadow of a great rock in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When the soul is thus overwhelmed with clouds, and doubteth of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ, it would then put it out of doubt, by fleeing to Him for refuge from the storme of God's indignation, and lay hold on Him, as He is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the gospel; and thus renew its grips of Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the offered alsufficient Mediator: and frequent direct acts of faith will helpe at length to a reflex act. The soul that is daylie running to Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the covenant, with all its necessities; and laying hold on Him, as only able to helpe, will at length come to see, that it hath beleeved on Him, and is made welcome by Him, and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Him. So that rëterated acts of faith on an offered Cautioner, and Salvation, will dispel at length those clouds of darknesse, that trouble the soul.</p>
               <p>7. Such souls would beware of making their bands stronger, and their darkness greater, by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>olly and unwise carriage: for this cause, they would beware,</p>
               <p>1. To cry - out in despondency of Spirit, as if there were no hope, and to conclude peremptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are cut off; and it is in vaine to waite any longer: for this course will but darken them more, and multiply the clouds over their head.</p>
               <p>2. To run away from Christ through unbeleef and dispaire; for that will make their case yet worse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="274" facs="tcp:44048:186"/>3. To walk untenderly and not circumspectly; for the moe sins appear, the lesse light will be had. O but souls would be tender in all their conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at that time, and guaird against the least sin, or appearance of evill.</p>
               <p>4. To fret and repine against God, because of that dispensation: for that will but entangle the soul more, and wreath the yock straiter about its neck; and put it self furder out of case to be relieved, and to receive light.</p>
               <p>8. Lastly, such would do well not to limite the holy one of Israel, but to waite with patience, till his time come, to speak-in light to the soul; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that such as waite upon Him shall never be ashamed, <hi>Esai.</hi> 49: 23. because <hi>He waiteth to be gracious;</hi> and therefore <hi>blessed are they all that waite upon him Esai.</hi> 30: 18.</p>
               <div type="question">
                  <head>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But what if for all this, I get no outgate, but my distress and darkness rather grow upon my hand?</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That such a thing may be, I grant, the Lord thinking it fit. (1.) To exercise their faith, dependence, patience, hope, and desire more. (2.) And to discover more unto them their own weakness, faintings, faithlesness. (3.) To shew his absolute power and soveraignity. (4.) To make his grace and mercy more conspicuous &amp; remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able at length: and. (5.) To traine them up in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of dependence on him in the dark; and of lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, when walking in darknesse; yea and in a way of beleeving, when they think they have no faith at all, and for other holy ends. Yet the soul would not despond; for there are several things,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44048:186"/>
that may serve to support and beare up the heart, even in that case; as</p>
                  <p>1. This is not their case alone: Others have been in the like before; and many have had the like complaints in all ages, as is known to such as have been acquanted with exercised souls.</p>
                  <p>2. It may yeeld peace and comfort, to know that they are about duty, when looking to Him, and depending upon Him, and waiting for his light.</p>
                  <p>3. The promises made to such, as waite for Him, may support the soul, and yeeld comfort.</p>
                  <p>4. The distinct knowledge and uptaking of their condition, though it be comfortable and refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet itis not absolutely necessary. A soul may be a saved soul, though those clouds should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to its dying day; and though, as long as they lived, they should never get a clear discovery of their gracious state, but spend their dayes in mourning, complaineing, and crying out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>5. Such a soul should think that its much, that he is keeped out of hell so long: and sure, the thoughts of what he is, and of what he doserveth, may make him sober, and not to think much, though he reach not so high, as to see his name written in the book of life.</p>
                  <p>6. They would know, that full assurance of hope and of faith, is but rare; and even such as have it, do nor ordinarily keep it long: So that it should not much trouble them, if after all their paines they cannot win at it.</p>
                  <p>7. If they win to any real ground of hope, how
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44048:187"/>
small so ever, they should think much of that; for many dear to Christ live long, and never know what so much is.</p>
                  <p>8. It is no small matter, that they are not sinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the gulfe of inconsideration, and plagued with an indifferency in these matters; but are made to value Christ and an interest in Him, at such a rate.</p>
                  <p>9. Their going to Christ with all their wants, laying all on Him; and their making that their daylie exercise, may keep up their hearts from faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea and fill their souls with joy: for that is really the exercise of faith. And the great and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promises are made to such as beleeve, and not to such only, as know they do beleeve. I grant such as know not that they do beleeve, cannot draw comfort from these promises; yet it is as true, that one may, by reflecting on the actings of his own soul, see and know that really he is going out to Christ, forsaking himself, casting his burden on Him, waiting and depending upon Him: when yet he will not say, that he doth beleeve: and when he seeth this working of soul toward Christ, he is obliged to beleeve, that he beleeveth, and thereupon rejoyce in the hope of the great promises. And however, the very sight and knowledge of this acting and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of soul, may give them some comfort, though they shall not take it for faith; because, it is the way of duty, and it is the thing, which the gospel cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth for; and because they cannot show an instance of any one soul, that did so, and perished. But the truth is, the right understanding of the nature
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44048:187"/>
of faith, would cleare many doubts, and prevent many questions.</p>
                  <p>I come to speak a little to the last case, which I shall handle, which is</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> How we shall make use of Christ, as the <hi>Truth,</hi> that we may win to right and suteable thoughts of God.</head>
               <p>This is a case, that much troubleth the people of God. They cannot get right and sutable thoughts of God, which they earnestly desire to have; nor know not how to win at them. And certane it is, He only who is <hi>the Truth,</hi> and came out of the bosome of the Father, can helpe here. Therefore, for our use making of Him for this end; It would be remembered.</p>
               <p>1. That the minde of man, through the fall, is nothing but a masse of ignorance and blindenesse; that the <hi>understanding is darkned Ephes.</hi> 4: 17, 18. And naturally we are <hi>in darknesse</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2: 9, 11. Yea <hi>under the power of darknesse. Col.</hi> 1: 13. And, which is more, our mindes naturally are filled with prejudice against God and enmity, through wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, naturally resideing there, and which <hi>the Prince of the powers of the aire, the Spirit that worketh in the children of disobediance,</hi> increaseth and stirreth up.</p>
               <p>2. That this evil is not totally taken away, even in the godly, but helped only in pairt: for they see
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44048:188"/>
and know but in pairt. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13: vers. 13.</p>
               <p>3. That hence it cometh to passe, that through the working of corruption, the soul of a beleever can sometime win to no right thought of God at all, or at best to some very narrow, and unsutable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Him and his wayes: yea sometimes, all the thoughts that they can get of God, are vaine and idle, if not misshapen and blasphemous.</p>
               <p>4. That as we are, we cannot see God: for no man hath seen Him <hi>Mat.</hi> 11: 27. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4: 46. for He is <hi>an invisible God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 27. <hi>He dwelleth in light, which no man can approach unto. Him no man hath seen, nor can see</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6: 16. 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4: 12.</p>
               <p>5. That all that knowledge of God, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> saveing, is to be found in Christ, who is the <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his glory, &amp; the expresse image of his person. Heb.</hi> 1: 2. <hi>and the image of the invisible God Col.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>. 15. and is for this end come out from the bosome of the Father, that He might acquant us with Him, and with all his secrets <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1: 18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11: 27. so far as is needful for us to know. He is God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, that in Him we may see the invisible. Thus <hi>God is manifest in the flesh</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3: 16. and the <hi>word was made flesh, and dwelt among us Iohn.</hi> 1: vers. 14.</p>
               <p>6. That therefore, if we would see and know God we must go to Christ, who is the temple, in which God dwelleth and manifesteth his glory; and in and through Him, must we see and conceive of God. The light that we get of the knowledge of the glory of God, must be in the face of Jesus Christ 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 6, that is, in the manifestations, that Christ
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44048:188"/>
hath made of himself, in his Natures, Offices, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, Works, Dispensations of grace, mediate and immediate &amp;c. And thus doth God, who <hi>commanded the light to shine out of darknesse, cause this light of the knowledge of his glory shine into our hearts, viz. in the face of Iesus Christ,</hi> that is, in the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of grace in the gospel, which is the <hi>glorious gospel of Christ</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 4. and, as it were, the face of Iesus Christ: for, as by the face a man is best known, and distinguished from others; so Christ is visibly, discernably, and manifestly seen and known, in and by the gospel dispensations; there are all the lineaments and draughts of the glory of God, which we would know, lively and clearly to be seen.</p>
               <p>So then, if we would make use of Christ for this end, that we may win to a right sight of God, and suteable conceptions of his glory, we would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider those things.</p>
               <p>1. We would live under the sense and through conviction of the greatnesse and incomprehensible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, as being every way past finding out: and also under the conviction of our own darknesse, and incapacitie to conceive aright of Him, even as to what He hath revealed of himself.</p>
               <p>2. We would know, that what the works of Creation and Providence declare and preach forth of God, though it be sufficient to make Heathens and others, that do not improve the same to a right acknowledging of him, inexcuseable; as <hi>Paul</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 20. yet all that is short of giving to us that saving knowledge of Him, which must be had, and which <hi>is life eternal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohn.</hi> 17: 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:44048:189"/>3. We would know, that what of God is to be found-out by the works of creation and providence, is more distinctly seen in Christ, and in the gospel. Here is a greater and more glorious discovery of God, and of his glorious attributes, his Iustice, Power, Wisdome, Goodnesse, Holiness, Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. than can be found by the deepest diveing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalist, and most wise moral observer of providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that is not taught out of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>4. Yea, there is something of God to be seen in Christ, in the gospel, which can be observed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o none of his works of creation, or common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: there is the <hi>grace of God that bringeth sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> that is made to appear only by the gospel <hi>Tit</hi> 2: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>1. and there is a <hi>peculiar kindenesse and love of God toward man,</hi> which is only discovered by Christ in the gospel, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3: 4. There is that <hi>manifold wisdome of God,</hi> that mysterie, which was hid from the beginning of the world in God; that Principalities and powers in heavenly places, the greatest and wisest of naturalists, must learne by the church, wherein that is preached and proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the dispensations of the gospel <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 9, 10. His <hi>mercy pardoning poor sinners, justice being satisfyed,</hi> can not be cleared by nature. Nature cannot unfold that mystery of justice and mercy, concurring to the salvation of a sinner, only the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel can cleare that riddle.</p>
               <p>5. We would remember, that all the beames of that glory, which are necessary and useful, for us to know, are, to speak so, contracted in Christ and there vailed, to the end that we may more stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyly look upon them. We may go to our Brother,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44048:189"/>
who is flesh of our flesh, and there, through the vaile of his flesh, see and behold what otherwayes was invisible: as we can look to the sun better shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a pale of water, than by looking up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly; so can we behold God and his glory better in Christ, where there is a thinne vail (to speak so) drawne over that otherwise blindeing yea kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, glory, than by looking to God without Christ: for alas we could not endure one glance of an immediat ray of divine glory, it would kill us out right.</p>
               <p>6. We must then go to Christ, and there see God: for He who seeth Him, seeth the Father also. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14: 9. Particularly, we must go to the face of Iesus Christ, that is, that, whereby He hath made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known, the noble contriveance of the glorious gospel; wherein all things are so carryed on, as that God is glorified in his Son, in the salvation of poor sinners. The whole work of salvation is laid on Christ, and the Father is glorified in Him, who is his servant and his chosen, whom He up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth and furnisheth for the work <hi>Esai.</hi> 42: 1, 2. He is called the Covenant it self: He is the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in the covenant of Redemption, and in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace: all is founded on Him: all the good things of it are given out by Him: all the grace, by which we close with it, and accept of Him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, is given by Him. Now, in this gospel contrivance are all the lines of the glorious face of Christ to be seen: and in that face must we see and discerne the glory of God; all the rayes of which are centred in Christ, and there will we get a noble prospect of that glorious object. So that
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44048:190"/>
all such, as would make use of Christ for this end, that they might come to have right and suteable thoughts and apprehensions of God, must be well acquanted with the whole draught and frame of the gospel; and so acquanted therewith, as to see Christ the substance, ground, and all of it, and to see Him in every part of it.</p>
               <p>7. Whatever we know or learne of God, by his works of Creation or Providence, in the world or about ourselves, we would bring it in here, that it may receive a new tiucture, and a deeper impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That is done, when we finde and learne some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Christ there; and are brought nearer Christ thereby; and made thereby to discover something more of the glory of God in the face of Christ; or are made to understand better something of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that is made of God in the gospel; or moved thereby to improve it better.</p>
               <p>8. In all this matter, we must not go without our guide, lest we wander in this wildernesse, and it prove a labyrinth to us. We must take Christ with us all alongs: He must teach us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his own face: and to read the glorious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of that excellent glory, which is to be seen in his face: He must be our interpreter, and teach us, how to read this book, and how to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what is written therein; He must give the discerning eye, and the understanding heart: even the Spirit of wisdome and understanding, to take up the mysteries of God.</p>
               <p>9. And for this cause, we would by faith lay hold upon the promises of the Spirit, whereby we may be made spiritual, and have our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44048:190"/>
enlightened more and more, to understand the mysterious characters of divine Majesty and Glory.</p>
               <p>10. In all this exercise, we would walk with fear, &amp; carry with us impressions of the dreadful Majesty and Glory of God, that we may tremble and feare, and stand in awe, and read what we read of this glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ, this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bible, with reverence, and godly fear.</p>
               <p>And thus may we be helped to win to right and suteable thoughts of God; yet with all we would, for</p>

                  <p>2. Nor must we think, to get any one point of God known &amp; understood perfectly: corruption will mix-in itself, do our best; and our short comeings will not easily be reckoned up.</p>
                  <p>3. We must beware of carnal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THis, as the former, being spoken indefinitly, may be universally taken, as relating both to such as are yet in the State of nature, and to such as are in the state of grace; and so may be considered in reference to both, &amp; ground three points of truth, both in reference to the one, and in reference to the other. To wit, 1. That our case is such as we stand in need of his helpe, as being <hi>the Life.</hi> 2. That no other way but by Him can we get that supply of life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which we stand in need of; for He only is <hi>the Life,</hi> excluding all other. 3. That this help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to be had in Him fully
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44048:191"/>
and compleetly: for not only is He able to quicken, but He is called <hi>the Life.</hi> So that the help, which he giveth, is full, excellent, and compleet.</p>
               <p>Looking upon the words, in reference to such as are in Nature, they point out those three truthes to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> That all of us by nature are dead, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in need of quickening and of life: for this is presupposed, while He is said to be <hi>the Life:</hi> and that both <hi>legally</hi> and <hi>reall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As to the <hi>soul,</hi> it also is many wayes dead, both first in away that is <hi>purely penal,</hi> and next in a way that is <hi>also sinful;</hi> and both wayes, as to what is <hi>present,</hi> and as to what is <hi>future:</hi> for as to that which is <hi>penal</hi> and <hi>present.</hi> It is (1) separated from God and his favour <hi>Gen.</hi> 3: 8, 10, 24.

And finally, as to what is <hi>future</hi> of this kinde, they are, being fuel for Tophet, obnoxious to that malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, sinful, blasphemous and desperat rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, in hell for ever more.</p>
               <p>O how lamentable, upon this consideration, must the condition of such be, as are yet in the state of nature. Oh if it were but seen and felt! But alas there is this addition to all, that people know no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> this, they consider it not, they beleeve it not, they feel it not, they see it not: and hence it cometh to passe, that</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:44048:192"/>1. They cannot bewail and lament their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor be humbled therefore.</p>
               <p>2. They cannot, nor will not, seek after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: for the whole will not trouble themselves to seek after a physician.</p>
               <p>And sure upon this account, their case calleth for pity and compassion from all, that know, what a dreadful thing it is to be in such a condition: and should stirre up all to pray for them, and to do all they can to helpe them out of that state of sin and misery, which is dreadful to think upon.</p>
               <p>Should not the thoughts and consideration of this put us all to try and search, if we be yet translated from death to life, and delivered out of that terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dreadful state, and made partakers of the first resurrection. It not being my purpose, to handle this point at large, I shall not here insist in giving marks, whereby this may be known, and which are obvious in <hi>Paul's</hi> Epistles, &amp; to be found handl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large in several practical pieces, chiefly in Mr. <hi>Guthries Great interest.</hi> I shall only desire every one to consider and examine,</p>
               <p>1. Whether or not, the voice of Christ, which quickeneth the dead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath been heard and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed in their soul? This is effectual calling.</p>
               <p>2. Whether or not, there be a through change wrought in their soul, a change in the whole Man, so as all things are become new 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: vers. 17?</p>
               <p>3. Whether or not, there be a Principle of life within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>? And they be led by the Spirit?</p>
               <p>4. Whether or not, there be a living to the glory of the Lord Redeemer?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:44048:193"/>And when by impartial tryal, a discovery is made of the badness of our condition, should we not be alarmed to look about us, and to laboure by all meanes for an outgate, considering, (1.) How do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and lamentable this condition is. (2.) How sad and dreadful the consequents of it are. (3.) How happy a thing itis to be delivered from this misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sinful condition: and. (4.) How there is a possibility of outgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> It may break a heart of stone to think, how people, that are in such a condition, are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come out of it: for,</p>
               <p>1. How unwilling are they, once to suspect their condition, or to suppose that it may be bad, and that they may be yet unconverted?</p>
               <p>2. How unwilling are they, to sit down seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously to try and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the matter, and to lay their case to the touch-stone of the word?</p>
               <p>3. Yea, how unwilling are they, to heare any thing that may tend to awaken them, or to discover unto them the badness of their condition?</p>
               <p>4. How ready to stiffle challenges of conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, or any common motion of the Spirit, which tendeth to alarme their soul?</p>
               <p>5. How great enemies are they to such ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, as serve to awaken sleeping consciences?</p>
               <p>6. And how do they hate such ministers, as preach such doctrine, as may serve to rouz th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We learne hence. That without Christ there is no imaginable way of delivery out of this natural state of death. <hi>No other name is given under</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:44048:193"/>
                  <hi>heaven whereby we can be saved. Act.</hi> 4: 12. and angels can make no help here, nor can one of us deliver another; the redemption of the soul is more precious then so <hi>Psal.</hi> 49: 7, 8. Not is there any thing we can do for ourselves, that will availe here; all our prayers, teares, whipeings, fastings, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es, almes deeds, purposes, promises, resolutions, abstenance from some evils, outward amendements, good morality and civility, outward religiousnesse, yea and, if it were possible, our keeping of the whole law, will not helpe us out of this pit. And we may weary ourselves in such exercises in vaine; for they will prove but bodylie exercises that profite little. And when in this way, we have spent all our time, parts, spirits and labour, we shall at length see, and say, that we have spent our money for that which is not bread.</p>
               <p>This should put all of us to try, what itis, which we leane to for life; and what it is, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration whereof giveth us peace and quietnesse, when the thoughts of death, judgment, hell and the wrath of God come upon us, and trouble us: for if it be any thing beside Christ that our soul leaneth to, and that we are comforted by, and found all our hopes upon, we will meet with a lamentable (oh! for ever lamentable!) disappointment. Be sure then, that our hearts renunce all other wayes and meanes of outgate, out of this death, beside Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, the Resurrection and the Life, else it will not be well with us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We see here. That delivery out of this natural state of death, is only had by Christ: for He alone is <hi>the Life,</hi> and the life that is in Him is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44048:194"/>
suiteable and excellent. Hence he is called the <hi>bread of life Iohn.</hi> 6: 35, 48. The <hi>resurrection and the life Iohn.</hi> 11: 25. The <hi>water of life Revel.</hi> 21: 6. &amp; 22: 17. The <hi>tree of life Revel.</hi> 22: 2, 14. The <hi>Prince of life Act.</hi> 3: 15. <hi>our life Col.</hi> 3: 4. The <hi>word of life,</hi> and <hi>life</hi> it self 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1: 1, 2.</p>
               <p>And as He is a suitable and excellent life; so is He an alsufficient and perfect life, able every way to helpe us, and to deliver us from all the parts of our death. For</p>
               <p>1. He delivereth from the sentence of the law <hi>Rom.</hi> 5: 17, 18. undergoing the curse of the law, and becomeing a curse for us 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. last.</p>
               <p>2.

               <p>3. He reconcileth to God, taking away that distance and enmity 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5: 20. and so He is <hi>our peace</hi> and peace-maker, purchaseing accesse to us to the Father <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 14, 16. &amp; 3: 12.</p>
               <p>4. He also delivereth from the power of sin and corruption <hi>Rom.</hi> 7: 24.</p>
               <p>5. And from all those spiritual stroakes; such as blindnesse, hardness of heart, &amp;c: for He is our light, and hath procured a new heart for us, even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>6. So delivereth He from hell fire, having sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied justice, and having brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

light of his eyes was gone from him <hi>Psal.</hi> 38: 10.</p>
               <p>8. Many times the frequent changes, and ups and downs they meet with, take all courage and heart from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they become like men tossed at sea, so as they have no more strength.</p>
               <p>And many such things befall them, which make them look as dead, and to stand in need of quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reviveing and strengthening cordialls from Him, who is <hi>the Life.</hi> And thus the Lord think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good to dispense with his owne people.</p>
               <p>1. That they may be keeped humble, and know themselves to be indigent creatures, needing influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of life daylie.</p>
               <p>2. That they may have many errands to Him, who is the <hi>Life,</hi> and have much to do with Him, and depend upon Him continually.</p>
               <p>3. That He may shew himself wonderful, in and about them, giving proof of His skill in quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dead, and in bringing such thorow unto everlasting life, who were daylie, as it were, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the ghost, and at the point of death.</p>
               <p>4. That heaven may be heaven; that is, a place where the weary are at rest <hi>Iob.</hi> 3: 17. and the troubled rest 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1: 7. And where the inhabitants shall not say they are sick <hi>Esai.</hi> 33: vers. 24.</p>
               <p>5. That they may be taught more the life of faith and of dependence on Him, and trained up in that way.</p>
               <p>6. That He may be owned, acknowledged and submitted unto, as a Soveraigne God, doing what He will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in heaven and in earth.</p>
               <p>For all this, there is no cause, that any should
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44048:196"/>
take up any prejudice at christianity: for, for all this, their life is sure, and the outgate is sure and saife. Nor would they think it strange, to see beleevers oft mourning and drouping, seing their case will oft call for new supplies of life. Their fits are not known to every one; nor doth every one know what lyeth sometime at their heart.</p>
               <p>Nor would they think it such an easie matter, to win to heaven, as they imagine, and so deceive themselves. The righteous are saved through many deaths.</p>
               <p>And as for beleevers, They would not think it strange, to meet with such fits of deadnesse; nor thence conclude, that all their former work was but delusion, and that they are still into the state of nature. But rather observe the wisdome, faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and power of God, in bringing their brocken shipe thorow so much brocken water; yea and ship wracks; and his goodnesse in ordering matters so, as they shall be keeped humble, watchful, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, and constant in dependence upon Him, who is and must be their life, first and last. And hence learne a necessitie of living alwayes neare to Christ, and depending constantly upon Him by faith; for, he being their life, they cannot be without Him, but they must die and decay.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We hence learne. That under all these fits of deadnesse, to which his people are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, nothing without Christ will helpe. Not</p>
               <p>1. All their paines in and about ordinary mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, prayer, reading, hearing, meditation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference &amp;c. They will all cry out, that help is not in them: for He is <hi>the Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:44048:196"/>2. Nor extraordinary duties. Such as fasting and prayer, and vowes, these will never revive &amp; quicken a drouping or fainting sickly soul: for they are not Christ; nor <hi>the Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Nor will a stout couragious Spirit, and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of heart avail. If He, who is <hi>the Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> breath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> not, all that will melt away, and evanish.</p>
               <p>4. Nor will the stock of habitual grace, which remaineth in the soul, be sufficient to quicken and revive the sick soul: if <hi>the Life</hi> breath not on these habites, and if new influences of life and strength flow not in upon the soul, and new rayes come not down from this sun of righteousnesse, to warme the frozen soul, the habites will lye by as dead.</p>
               <p>5. Far lesse will their great gifts and enduements helpe them out of that dead condition: all their light and knowledge, without the influences of this <hi>Life,</hi> will prove weak and insufficient for this end and purpose.</p>
               <p>6. Nor will sound, pure, and lively like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances work out this effect: for till He look down, all those ordinances may prove dead and deadning to them.</p>
               <p>It were good if beleevers were living under the conviction of this daylie, and, by their practice and carriage, declareing that they believe, that Christ only is <hi>the Life,</hi> and that they must live in Him, and be quickened and revived through Him alone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We see hence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That Christ is <hi>the Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> that is, one that sufficiently, yea and abundantly, can helpe the beleever, while under those fits of deadnesse, which have been mentioned, and the like. There is in him a rich supply of all things, that tend

to revive, encourage, strengthen, and enliven: soul, under spiritual deadnesse and fainting. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is He called <hi>the Life;</hi> as having in Him all that, which is necessary for, and answereable to souls under spiritual sicknesses, distempers, desertions, fainting &amp; swooning fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>For further clearing of this, we would consider those things.</p>
               <p>1. That He is God, equal with the Father in power and glory, and thereby <hi>hath life in himself Iohn.</hi> 5: 26. and can <hi>quicken whom He will. vers.</hi> 21. By this He proveth there his own godhead &amp; equality with the Father. So <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1: 4. Itis said that <hi>in Him was life; and that life was the light of men,</hi> whereby also his Godhead is confirmed. This should be firmly beleeved, and rooted in our hearts, as being the ground of all our hope, comfort and life: for were it not so, that our Mediator were the true God, all our hopes were gone, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts could not be long lived, and our life were extinct.</p>
               <p>2. As mediator God-man, He is fully and througly fournished to quicken and enliven his members and followers, first and last: and all alongs their life must be hid with Christ in God, for <hi>in Him dwelleth the fulnesse of the godhead bodyly Col.</hi> 2: 9. as mediator he is called a <hi>tree of life Prov.</hi> 3: 18. quickening and enlivening all that feed upon Him; and <hi>the bread of life.

<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44048:197"/>
because of power and authoritie to commmand life to the dead soul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is called the <hi>Prince of life Act.</hi> 3: 15. and as <hi>a living</hi> quickening <hi>stone,</hi> he giveth life to all that are built upon Him 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2: 4. Yea as being fully fitted and fournished for this work, He calleth himself <hi>the resurrection and the life Iohn.</hi> 11: 25. This should be riveted in our hearts, as a comfortable and encouraging truth.</p>
               <p>3. Of this stock of life, and quickening and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing grace, which He hath gote, and is furnished withal, as Mediator and Redeemer of his people, He is communicative: <hi>of his fulnesse do we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and grace for grace Iohn.</hi> 1: 16. He gote it, that He might give it out; and that from Him as an head it might flow out unto his members, and therefore <hi>He</hi> is the <hi>bread that came downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and giveth life to the world Iohn.</hi> 6: 35. Yea <hi>He giveth eternal life to all his sheep Ioh.</hi> 10: 28. and He is <hi>come for this end, that his sheep might have life Iohn.</hi> 10: 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Therefore hath he taken on such relations, as may give ground of confirmation of this, as of an <hi>head,</hi> of a <hi>stock</hi> or <hi>root,</hi> and the like. This consideration is strengthening and reviveing.</p>
               <p>4. He communicateth of this stock of life, and of reviveing strength, which He hath, most sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and on most easie tearmes. So that</p>

                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:44048:198"/>(4.) If we will come to Him <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5: vers. 40. and cast our dead soul upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we shall live.</p>
               <p>(5.) If we will heare his voce <hi>Esai.</hi> 55: 3. and receive his instructions we shall live; for they are the instructions of life.</p>
               <p>(6.) Nay, if the soul be so dead, that it can neither walk, nor hear, if it can but look to Him, he will give life <hi>Esai.</hi> 45; 22.</p>
               <p>7. And if the soul be so weak, that it cannot look, nor lift up its eyes; yet if it be willing, He will come with life <hi>Revel.</hi> 22: 17.</p>
               <p>Oh! if this were beleeved.</p>
               <p>5. As he is communicative of that life, which he hath goten as Head, and that upon easie tearmes; so He giveth out of that life liberally, largely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly; yea more abundantly <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10: 10.

Therefore he alloweth his friends to drink abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <hi>Cant.</hi> 5: 1.</p>

               <p>7. All this life is sure in Him, none of his shall be disappointed thereof.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:44048:199"/>
for they feare, He will not make them welcome; they doubt of his love and tendernesse, and questione his pity and compassion; yea their jealousie maketh them to doubt of his faithfulnesse. So that the faith of this truth would cure this jealousie, and deliver the soul therefrom, and open a way for the soul to come forward with boldnesse and confidence.</p>
               <p>5. They might also be hereby helped to waite with patience, and to be still and quiet under the Lord's various dispensations: so as they would not frete nor repine against him, knowing that He would prove himself to be Life, even <hi>the Life,</hi> in his own good time: so that the soul would paitiently waite at his door, till He were pleased to look out, and with his look convey life in to their dead soul.</p>
               <p>6. They might be preserved hereby from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to, or expecting any help from, any other arth: knowing that He alone is <hi>the Life,</hi> and so, that help can no where else be had. The faith of this truth would guaird from many sinistrous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, which the soul, in a time of straite, is ready to run to, for reliefe: for hereby would it see, that neither instruments, nor meanes, nor outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations, nor any thing of that kinde, can quicken their dead soul; and that He, and He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, must breathe - in life into them, as at first, so now againe.</p>

               <p>1. That we are most unworthy of any such dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pensation of grace at his hands.</p>
               <p>2. That we too oft are too desirous of other guests in our hearts, beside Him. O How much corruption, sin and death lodge we within our souls! and how more desirous are we oftimes of death, than of life!</p>
               <p>3, That we little improve the noble advantages for life, which we have granted unto us: yea many a time we abuse them; and this He did foresee, and yet notwithstanding would condescend thus unto us.</p>
               <p>4. That we do little expresse our thankfulnesse for such mercies.</p>
               <p>But not for our sakes hath He done this, but for his owne names sake: for noble and holy ends hath He resolved upon this course; as</p>

               <p>4. That mans mouth might be stopped forever, and all boasting excluded: for man is a proud crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ready to boast of that, which is nothing and vanity. Now God hath chosen this noble way of the covenant of grace, that man might boast no more. <hi>Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? by the law of works? no, but by the law of faith,</hi> sayeth the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3: vers. 24.</p>
               <p>5. That all might be sure to the poor chosen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever. The Lord will not have the stock of life, any longer to be in mans own hand: for even <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> in the state of innocency, could not use it well, but made shipewrack thereof, and turned a banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: much more would man now do so, in this state of sin, in which he lyeth at present; therefore Hath God, out of love and tendernesse to his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen ones, put all their stock in the hand of Christ, who is better able to manage it, to God's glory and mans advantage, being faithful in all things, and a trusty servant, <hi>having the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelling in Him bodyly. Therefore</hi> (sayeth the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 4: 16.) <hi>It is of faith, that it might be by grace, to the end, the promises might be sure to all the seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. That beleevers might have strong consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, notwithstanding of all the opposition of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies without and within, when they see that now their <hi>life is hid with Christ in God Col.</hi> 3: 3. and that their life is in their Head: they will not feare so

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Here is strong encouragement to all, that would be at heaven, to enter into this gospel way, which is away os life. Such need not fear that their Salvation shall not be throughed, let Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and all their adversaryes do what they can, all that enter into this way shall live: for the way it self is life, and nothing but life. So that here all obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are obviated: life can answere all. If the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever fear, that he shall never win thorow difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, he shall die by the way, or by fainting, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbeing and swooning, dishonour the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and at length f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly,</hi> Here is ground of reproof even of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers. who, though they have come to Christ, yet do not live in Him, as they ought; do not walk in Him, with that livelinesse, activity, which is called for: but</p>

               <p>2. Rest too much an duties; when they should in them goe to Him, who is <hi>the Life;</hi> for only in Him is life to be had; and Him should they seek to in the ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they might have life from Him, in those outward duties: and this appeareth in their way of going about duties, without that dependence on Him, &amp; single eyeing of Him, which is called for; as also by their freting and repineing, when duties do not their business, as if life lay all in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and concludeing all will be right, because they get duties somewhat tolerably performed; and on the contrary desponding, when duties fall heavie on them, and they finde themselves indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed for duty: all which clearly evinceth, that they lay too too much weight on duties; whileas it would be otherwayes with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they were purely depending on Christ, and looking for all from Him.</p>
               <p>3. Desponde too soon, because they get not help<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>4. Neglect to make use of Him, and to come to Him, with all their wants, failings and necessities, as they ought: or come not with that freedome and boldnesse, which the gospel grounds allow.</p>

                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> This preacheth out the woful misery of such, as are strangers to Christ: for being stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to <hi>the Life,</hi> they have no life, they are dead, and death is ingraven on all they do; even though</p>

               <p>2. They should be eminently gifted, able to iustruct others, and to speak of the mysteries of the gospel, to good purpose and to edification: for such gifts of knowledge and utterance may be, where the lively operations of the grace of Christ are not; and consequently, where Christ is not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>4. And they should have something more than ordinary; even taste of the heavenly gift, &amp; be made partakers of extraordinary gifts of the holy ghost, yea and taste the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly.</hi> This discovereth the noble advantage of such, as have accepted of Christ for their life. Their condition is happy, sure, desirable &amp; thrive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for Christ is theirs, and life is theirs; because Christ, who is <hi>the Life,</hi> is theirs</p>

                  <p>

However it be with them, either in thine eyes, or possibly in their own, sometimes; yet thou may hold thy peace: for in their worste condition, they would not exchange with thee, for a world. In their deadest-like condition, they are not voide of all life, as thou art, notwithstanding all thy motions, and seeming activenesse in duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because all thy motion in and about duty is but like the moveing of childrens puppies, caused by external motives, such as a name, applause, peace from a natural conscience, or the like; and not from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of grace and life.</p>
                  <p>2. Howbeit they sometimes seem to be dead; yet they are not alwayes so; life doth really worke sometimes in them: whereas there was never any true or kindly motion of life in thee.</p>
                  <p>3. There may be more life in them, yea life in motion, when they seem to be overcome with some lusts or corruption, yea when really they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; then beholders, that are strangers to the heart, can observe: for when temptation is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as having the advantage of the time &amp; place, of the constitution of the body, and the like, it argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no small degree of life, and of life in motion, to make some resistance and opposition thereunto, though at length he should be overcome thereby. And this opposition and resistence, flowing from a principle of grace, speaketh out life, though cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, having the advantage, should at that time over - power the motion of life, and carry the man away.</p>

                  <p>2. In not watching, but giving way to securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thereby encourageing and strengthening the adversary, as we see in <hi>David:</hi> when they stand not on their watch towre, they invite Satan to set on; and he is vigilant enough, and knoweth how to take his advantage, and to improve his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
                  <p>3. In giving way to leazinesse and not stirring up themselves, as we see in the <hi>Bride Cant.</hi> 3: 1. &amp; 5: 3. When they stirre not up the grace of God, which is in them, how can they belively? If grace be laid by, it will contract rust. The best way to keep grace lively, is to keep it in exercise, how little so ever it be.</p>
                  <p>4. By their rashnesse, walking without feare, as is to be observed in <hi>Peter,</hi> whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>, that it goe not with them, as they would; and that they provock God to leave them to themselves, that they may know what they are, and learne afterward not to tempte the Lord, and to walk more circumspectly?</p>
                  <p>5. By leaning too much to their attainements, and not looking out for new influences of grace and life. Hereby they provock God to let them know to their expences, that for as great a length as they are come, they must live by faith, and be quickened by new influences from the Spirit of life.</p>
                  <p>6. So they may wronge themselves through their ignorance of Christ, and of the way of makeing use of Him: and if they, through unacquantednesse with Christ and the right way of improveing the fulnesse that is in Him, misse the fruit and advantage, which otherwise they might have, they can only blame themselves.</p>
                  <p>7. They may also prejudge themselves, by their self love, self esteem, self seeking, self pleasing &amp;c. which piece and piece will draw them off Christ, and cause them forget the way of sucking life from Him, who is the fountaine of life.</p>
                  <p>8. When they give way to small sins, they open a door for greater; and they lose thereby their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, and so provock the Lord to withdraw: and this is another way, whereby they prejudge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of that benefite of livelinesse, which they might otherwise have.</p>

                  <p>3ly. It would be remembered, that the Lord can make their failings and shortcomings contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the furthering of their life; as we see it did in <hi>Peter.</hi>

It would also be remembered, that Christ doth not distribute and give out of this life to all his members and followers, in a like measure; but to some more, and to others lesse, according as He seeth it meet and convenient, both for his own glory and their good. He hath more service for some, than for others: and some He will imploy in greater and more difficult work, which will call for
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44048:204"/>
more life; and others He will imploy in common work, which will not call for such an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of life.</p>
                  <p>5ly. And upon the same account, He may think it good, to give to the same person a larger measure of grace at one time, than at another.</p>
                  <p>6ly. And that for wise reasons and noble ends, as</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Eightly.</hi> This may point out unto beleevers, several duties, to which they are called: we shall name some few of many: as</p>
                  <p>1. That they should <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and be comforted, in the thoughts of this, that they have such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleet Mediator, one that is throughly furnished, and made all things for them; not only <hi>the Way,</hi> and <hi>the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>h;</hi> but <hi>the Life</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>2. The thoughts of this should also <hi>stirre up to wondering</hi> at the wisdome, graciousnesse and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God; &amp; to thankfulnesse for providing such an alsufficient way for them.</p>
                  <p>3. This should also <hi>encourage</hi> them under all temptations, faintings, backsets and fits of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that they fall into, that there is one, who is <hi>the Life:</hi> and that He, whom their soul hath chosen, is <hi>the Life,</hi> and so fully able to quicken and enliven them.</p>
                  <p>4. This should teach them <hi>humility,</hi> and not to be proud of any thing they have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or do: for it is He, who is <hi>the Life,</hi> who keepeth them in life, and helpeth them to any duty; yea it is life, that worketh all in them.</p>
                  <p>5. And likewise it should teach them to <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Him,</hi> to whom they are obliged, for any thing they do, for any life they have, or any acts or frutes of life that appeare in them; and to be <hi>thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to Him therefore.</p>
                  <p>6. And mainly, They should here read their <hi>obligation and duty,</hi> to improve this advantage, and to draw life out of this fountaine, and so live by
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:44048:205"/>
this life; act and do all in and through this life; and so be quickened by this life, in all their fits of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and for this cause would keep those things in minde,</p>
                  <p>(1.) That they should live in a constant convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their own weaknesse, deadnesse and ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do any acts of life, of themselves; and far lesse to recover themselves out of any distemper and fit of deadnesse, which they fall into.</p>
                  <p>(2.) That they should live in the faith of this. That there is life enough in Him, who is <hi>the Life,</hi> to do their businesse. They should be perswaded of His alsufficiency.</p>
                  <p>(3.) That He is not only an alsufficient deliverer, able to deliver a soul, that is, as it were, rotting in the grave, and to cause the dead to heare his voice and live; but also most willing and ready to answere them, in all their necessities, according to wisdome, and as He seeth it is for his glory, and their souls advantage. The faith of this is necessary, and will be very encourageing.</p>
                  <p>(4.) That they should go to Him, how dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like so ever their condition be, and by faith roll their dead case upon Him, who is <hi>the Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5.) That they should pray upon the promises of grace and influence, even out of the belly of hell, or of the grave, with <hi>Ionah</hi> Cap. 2: 2. for He is faithful and true, and tender - hearted, and will heare and give a good answer at length.</p>
                  <p>(6.) That in the exercise of faith and prayer, they should waite with patience, till He be pleased to come, and breath upon the dry bones, and till the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:44048:206"/>1. For clearing of the case, we shall shew how probably it is brought on.</p>
               <p>2. How Christ is life to the soul in such a case, as this.</p>
               <p>3. How the beleever is to make use of Christ for life, in this case; and,</p>
               <p>4. Further cleare the matter, by answering a question or two.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first.</hi> Such a distemper as this may be brought upon the soul,</p>
               <p>1. Through some strong and violent tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from without, meeting with some evil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the heart within, and so surprizeing &amp; overpowering the poor soul, as we see in <hi>David,</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Through the cunning and slight of Satan, stealing the beleever, that is not watchful enough, insensibly off his feet, and singing him asleep by degrees.</p>
               <p>3. Through carelesnesse, in not adverting at first to the beginnings and first degrees of this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and upsiting, when the heart beginneth to grow formal, and superficial in duties, and to be satisfied with a perfunctorious performance, without life and sense.</p>
               <p>4. Through thortureing of conscience, in light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nd smaller matters: for this may provock God to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>et conscience fall a sleep, &amp; so the soul shall become more untender, and scruple little, at length, at greater matters; and thus deadnesse may come to an hieght, God ordering it so, for a further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them, for their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> untendernesse and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspectnesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:44048:207"/>5. Through their not stirring up themselves, and shaking off that Spirit of lazinesse and drousi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it first ceaseth upon them; but, with the sluggard, yet another slumber, &amp; another sleep, and a folding of the hands to sleep.</p>
               <p>6. Continuing in some known sin, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting of it, may bring on this distemper, as may be observed in <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Second</hi> particular; Christ is life to the soul in this case; in that</p>
               <p>1. He keepeth possession of the soul: for the seed remaineth, the root abideth fast in the ground, there is life still at the heart, though the man make no motion; like one in a deep sleep, or in a swoon, yet life is not away.</p>
               <p>2ly. He is due time awakeneth, and rouzeth up the soul, &amp; so recovereth it out of that condition, by one meane or other, either by some alarme of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and terror, as He did <hi>David;</hi> or dispensation of mercy and tenderness, as He did <hi>Peter.</hi> And usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally He recovereth the soul</p>
               <p>1. By discovering something of this condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by giving so much sense and knowledg; and sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much light, as will let the soul see, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> not well, and that it is under that distemper of life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness.</p>
               <p>2. By discovering the dreadfulness of such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and how hazardous it is to countinue therein.</p>
               <p>3. By puting the soul in minde, that He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the Life,</hi> and the resurrection; and through th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> stirring up of grace airting the soul to look to Him for quickening and outgate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:44048:207"/>4. By raseing up the soul at length out of that drouziness, and sluggish folding of the hands to sleep, and out of that deep security; and putting it into a more lively, vigilent and active frame.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Third.</hi> The beleever, that would make use of Christ, for a recovery out of this condition, would minde those duties.</p>
               <p>1. He would look to Christ, as the <hi>light</hi> of Men, and the enlightner of the blinde; to the end, he may get a better and a more through discovery of of his condition; for it is halfe health here to be sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of this disease. The soul that is once brought to sense, is halfe recovered of this feaver and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie.</p>
               <p>2. He would eye Christ, as <hi>God,</hi> able to cause the dead and dry bones to live, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37. and this will keep from despondency and despaire; yea it will make the poor beleever conceive hope, when he seeth that his physitian is God, to whom noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is impossible.</p>
               <p>3. He would look to Him also, as <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Husband,</hi> an <hi>Life</hi> to the poor soul, that adhereth to Him; and this will strengthen his hope &amp; expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: for he will see, that Christ is ingadged, to speak so, in point of honour, to quicken a poor dead and lifeless member: for the life in the head is for the good of the whole body, and of every member of the body, that is not quite cut off: and the good that is in the husband is forthcoming fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> the reliefe of the poor wife, that hath not yet gotten a bill of divorce. And Christ, being <hi>Life</hi> &amp; <hi>the Life,</hi> he must be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the releife, the quickening, &amp; recovering from death of such as are given to Him, that they may
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44048:208"/>
be finally raised up at the last day, He must presente all his members lively in that day.</p>
               <p>4. He would by faith wrape himself up in the promises, and lie before this Sun of righteousness, till the heat of his beames thaw his frozen heart, and bring warmth into his cold and dead soul, and thus renew his grips of Him, accepting of Him, as <hi>the Life,</hi> and as <hi>his Life.</hi> Christ himself tells us <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6: 40. <hi>That this is the Fathers will, that hath sent Him, that every one which seeth the Son, and beleeveth on Him, might have everlasting life, and He will raise him up at the last day.</hi> Faith closeing with Him, as it was the meane of life at first, so will it be the mean of recovery out of a dead distemper, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>5. He would mourne for such sins and provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as he discovereth in himself to have caused and brought on this distemper. Repentance and godly sorrow for such evils, as have sinned Christ and life away, is a way to bring life back againe.</p>
               <p>6. He would be sure to harboure no known sin in his soul, but to set himself against every known evil, as an enemie to the life and recovery, which he is seeking,</p>
               <p>7. He must waite on Christ his Life, in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed meanes: for that is the will of the Lord, that He should be waited - upon there, and sought for there. There is little hopes of recovery for such, as lay aside the ordinances. Though the ordinances without him cannot revive or quicken a poor soul; yet if He hath condescended so far as to come with life to his people, in and through the ordinances, and hath appointed us to waite for Him there, we
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44048:208"/>
must be willing to accept of all his condescensions of love, and seek him and waite for Him there, where He hath said, He will be found.</p>
               <p>8. In going about those ordinances of life, He would beware of putting them in Christ's room: that is, He would beware of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thinking, that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances will do his business: as some ignorantly do, who think that by praying so often a day, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so much, and hearing so much, they shall reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their lost lively frame, when (alas!) all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances without Him signifie nothing. They, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Him, are cold and lifeless, and can never bring heat or warmth to a cold soul. It is He in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances whom they are to seek, and from whom alone life is to be expected, and none else.</p>
               <p>9. Though life lyeth not in the ordinances, as separated from Christ, and life is to be expected from Him alone; yet he would beware of going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ordinances in a careless, superficial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different manner: for this will argue little desire after life, and will bring-on more deadness. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances than should be gone about seriously, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and with great carefulness, yea with such earnestness, as if life were to be had in them; and yet with such a single and pure dependence on Christ for life, as if we were not about the ordinances at all. This is the right way of going about ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>10. He must in all this waite with patience, without freting or quarrelling with Him, for his delaying to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He must waite with much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. It becometh not him, who hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through his folly, sinned life away to quarrel now with God,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44048:209"/>
because he restoreth him not againe to life, at the first asking. He may be glade if at length, after long seeking, waiting and much diligence, He come and restore to him the joy of his salvation, and if he be not made to lie as a bedrid all his dayes, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of folly, in sinning away his life, strength and legs, as he did.</p>
               <p>11. He must beware of giving way to any thing, that may increase or continue this deadnesse, such as untendernesse in his walk, unwatchfulnesse, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and carelesnesse; and especially he must beware to provock God, by sinning against light.</p>
               <p>12. He would also beware of limiteing the Lord to any set measure of life and strength: for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh not beggers to be carvers; far lesse such beggers, as through folly have sinned away a good portion. It was not fit for the prodigal to seek <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> new patrimony, after he had dilapidated the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, it might suffice him to be made as a servant.</p>
               <p>13. He would use well any small measure of life, he getteth, for God and his glory; getteth he but one talent he should use it, that he may gaine thereby: use (we say) limbs and have limbs, use strength and have it. This will be the way to get more.</p>
               <p>14. He would be taking on the vowes of the Lord, and that in the Lord, to walk more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in time comeing, charging all within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out not to stirre or provoke the Lord to depart fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to scarre Him from coming to the soul.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>last</hi> particular.</p>
               <p>If it be enquired. 1. What can that soul do, that is not sensible of this deadnesse and weaknesse?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:44048:209"/>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Though there be not any reall sense or feeling of this condition; yet there may be a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, that all is not right: and if this be, the soul must look out to Christ, for the life of sense, and for a sight of the provocations, that have brought on that condition. He that is <hi>the Life</hi> must recover the very beginnings of life: and when the soul winneth to any real apprehension and sense of this deadnesse, it must follow the course formerly prescribed, for a recovery.</p>
               <p>2. But it will be asked. How a soul can act faith in such a case? And if it cannot act faith, how can it come to Christ, and make use of Him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answere.</hi> It is true, while the soul is in that case, it cannot act a strong and a lively faith; yet it can act a weak and a sickly faith: and a weak and sickly faith can lay hold upon an enlivening Christ, and so bring<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>in more strength and life to the soul. If the soul be so weak, as that it cannot grippe; yet it can look to Him, that can quicken the dead, and hath helped many a poor soul before, out of a dead condition. Or if it cannot do so much as look, yet it may give an half-look, and lie before Him, who waiteth to be gracious; and sustaine it self, if it can get no more, with a <hi>may be</hi> He shall come.</p>
               <p>3. But further it will be asked, what the soul can do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when after all this, it findeth no helpe or supply, but deadnesse remaining, yea and, it may be, growing?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The soul in that case must lye at his door, waiting for his salvation; and resolving, if no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may be, to die at his door; and leave no approven mean, or commanded duty, unessayed, that it may
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44048:210"/>
recover its former vigour, activity and strength. And while the beleever is waiting thus, he is at his duty; and this may yeeld him peace, and he may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure that he shall never be ashamed <hi>Ps.</hi> 25: 3. &amp; 69: 6. <hi>Esai.</hi> 30: 18.</p>

               <p>THere is another evil and distemper, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are subject to, and that is a case of faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through manifold discouragements, which make them so heartless, that they can do nothing; yea and to sit up, as if they were dead. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then is. How such a soul shall make use of Christ, to the end it may be freed from that fit of fainting, and win over those discouragments: for satisfaction to which, we shall</p>
               <p>1. Name some of those discouragements, which occasione this.</p>
               <p>2. Show what Christ hath done, to remove all those discouragements.</p>
               <p>3. Show how the soul should make use of Christ for life, in this case; and</p>
               <p>4. Adde a few words of caution.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first.</hi> There are several things, which may give occasion to this distemper; we shall name those few.</p>
               <p>1. The sense of a strong, active, lively, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44048:210"/>
continually stirring body of death, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of meanes used to beare it down, and to kill it. This is very discourageing: for it made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out <hi>woes me miserable man, who shall deliver me from this body of death, Rom.</hi> 7: 24. It is a most discouraging thing, to be still fighting, and yet getting no ease, let be victory; to have to do with an enemie, that abides alwayes alike strong, fight and oppose as we will, yea not only is not weakned far lesse overcome, but that groweth in power and prevaileth. And this many times affecteth the heart of God's children, and causeth them to faint.</p>
               <p>2. It may be the case of some, that they are assaulted with strange temptations of Satan, his buffettings, that are not usual. This made <hi>Paul</hi> cry out thrice, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and if the Lord had not told him, that His grace was sufficient for him, what would he have done? Hence some of his cry out, in their complaint, was there ever any so tempted, so assaulted with the devil, as I am? Sure, this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot but be much afflicting, sadning and discourageing.</p>
               <p>3. The sense of the real weakness of grace under lively meanes, and notwithstanding of their serious and earnest desires, and endeavours after grouth in grace, cannot but disquiet and discourage them: for they may readily conclude, that all their paines and labour shall be in vaine, for any thing they can observe.</p>
               <p>4. The want of sensible incomes of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, is another fainting and discourageing dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation; as the feeling of these is a heart-strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:44048:211"/>
and most encourageing thing, which made <hi>David</hi> so earnestly cry for it <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 8, 12. when a poor soul, that hath the testimony of its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that it hath been, in some measure of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leness of heart and honesty, seeking the face of God, for a good many yeers, and yet cannot say, that ever it knew what those incomes of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort meane, which some have tasted largely of, it cannot choose but be discouraged, and much cast down, as not knowing what to say of it self, or how to judge of its owne case.</p>
               <p>5. The want of access in their addresses to God, is another heart-discouraging thing. They go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the duty of prayer, with that measure of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness and uprightness of heart, that they can win at, at least this is their aime and endeavour, and yet they meet with a fast-closed door: when they cry &amp; shout, he shooteth out their prayer; as the Church complaineth <hi>Lament.</hi> 3: 8. This sure will affect them deeply, and cause their hearts sometimes to fainte.</p>
               <p>6. The want of freedom and liberty in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreses to God, is another thing, which causeth sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and fainting. They go to pray, but their tongue cleaveth to the roof of their mouth; they are straitned, and cannot get their hearts vented.</p>
               <p>7. Outward persecution, that attendeth the way of godliness, and afflictions, that accompany such as live godly, is another discourageing thing, both to themselves, who are under afflictions; and to others, who heare it and see it; wherefore the Apostle desired earnestly, that the <hi>Ephesians</hi> should not faint at his tribulation, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3: 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:44048:211"/>8. The Lords sharpe and sore dispensations for sin, as toward <hi>David Psal.</hi> 51. or out of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignity for tryal and other ends, as toward <hi>Iob,</hi> is likewise a discourageing heart-breaking thing, and that which will make strong gyants to roare and fainte, and look upon themselves as dead men, as we see in these two eminent men of God.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>second</hi> thing. Christ is life to the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in this case, in having done that which in reason may support, under all these discouragements, and having done so much for removing or weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these; yea and for carrying them over them all, which may be in a word cleared, as to each.</p>
               <p>1. As for the body of death. Let it stirre in the beleever, as fast as it will, or can, it is already killed, &amp; all that strugling is but like the strugling of a man in the pangs of death; for our <hi>old man is crucified with Christ, Rom.</hi> 6: 6. and the beleever is dead to sin, and risen legally with him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2: 11, 12. &amp; 3: 3. But of this we spoke abundance above.</p>
               <p>2. As to Satans troubling the poor beleever. Through Christ also he is a vanquished enemy. He hath <hi>overcome him that had the power of death, even the devil, Heb.</hi> 2: 14.</p>
               <p>3. As for that felt weakness of grace. That is no ground of discouragement, so long as he liveth, who can make the <hi>lame to leep as an hart,</hi> and can make <hi>waters break out in the wildernesse, and strea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes in the desert. Esai.</hi> 35: 6, 7. and <hi>giveth power to the fainte, and to them that have no might increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth strength:</hi> so that such as <hi>waite upon the Lord shall renew their strength, and they shall mount up</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:44048:212"/>
                  <hi>with wings as eagles, they shall run and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint, Esai.</hi> 40: 29, 31. For in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>m are all the promises yea &amp; amen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 20. So that they need not faint upon this account, nor be discouraged: for the work He hath begun, He will finish it, and He will quicken in the way, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119: 37.</p>
               <p>4. As for the want of sensible incomes of joy and comfort: He hath promised to send the comforter, in his own good time, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14: 26. &amp; 15: 26. <hi>as one whom his mother comforteth, so will he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his, Esai.</hi> 66. 13. Joy and gladnesse is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the covenant, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31: 13. But further; though He keep up those influences of joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, He supporteth another way. The lively hope of heaven may bear up the heart, under all this want: for there shall the soul have fulnesse of joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for ever more: no teares, nor sorrow there, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16: 11. <hi>Esa.</hi> 35: 10. &amp; 51: 11.</p>
               <p>5. As for the want of accesse in their prayers. They may possibly blame themselvs, for He hath by his merites opened the door; and is become (to speak so) master usher to the poor soul, to lead him, in to the Father, so that <hi>by him we have accesse, Ephes.</hi> 2: 18. yea <hi>boldnesse and accesse, through faith in Him Ephes.</hi> 3: 12. and He is <hi>our advocate</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2: 1. and as our atturnay is gone to heaven before us; and there <hi>liveth for ever to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession Heb.</hi> 6: 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 7: 25. And what is there more to be done, to procure us accesse? or to move &amp; encourage us to <hi>come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtaine mercy, and finde grace to helpe in time of need? Heb.</hi> 4: 14, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:44048:212"/>6. As to that want of freedome and liberty in prayer: He helpeth that also: for He maketh the dumb to sing, <hi>Esa.</hi> 35: 6. and maketh the tongue <hi>of the stammerers to be ready to speak elegantly, Esai.</hi> 32: 4. He can enlairge the heart, and help the soul to pour-out its heart before God.</p>
               <p>7. As to outward persecution: He can easily take that discouragement away, by giving the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth fold with it: by supporting under it, and bringing saife thorow it: when his presence is with them through fire and water, <hi>Esa.</hi> 43: 2. what can trouble them? and when he maketh their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations abound, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 5. what can discourage them? Have not his sung in the very fires? and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in all their afflictions? The resting of the Spirit of God and of glory, which <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4: 14. is comfortable enough.</p>
               <p>8. As for all those sharpe dispensations, mentioned in the last place: He, having taken the sting of all, even of death, away, by taking away sin, and purchased the blessing and love of the Father, having made reconciliation through his blood, all those dispensations flow from love, even such as seem sharpest, being inflicted for sin, as we see <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 6. So that there is no cause here of fainting, or of being so discouraged, as to give over the matter. But for helpe in this case, there should be an use making of Jesus, as <hi>the Life;</hi> and that is</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing, which we shall speak a little to, <hi>viz</hi> How the soul should make use of Christ, as <hi>the Life,</hi> to the end it may be delivered from this fainting, occasioned through manifold discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gements,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:44048:213"/>1. The beleever in this case would minde the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption, wherein Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and so standeth obliged and engaged, to carry on his own through all discouragements, to the end; so that if any one beleever miscarry, Christ loseth more than they can lose: for the beleever can but lose his soul, but Christ shall lose his glory, and this is more worth, than all the souls that ever were created. And further, not only shall Christ lose his glory, as Redeemer; But the Father shall also lose his glory, in not making good his promise to Christ his Son: for by the same covenant, He standeth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to carry thorow all the seed, that Christ hath died for. And his appointing Christ to be his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant for this end, and chooseing Him from among all the folk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his upholding of Him, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with him, delighting in Him, and promiseing that He shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles, and that, to victory, or to truth, speak out His engadgment to see all true beleevers brought home. See <hi>Esai.</hi> 42: 1, 2, 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12: 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89: 19, 20, 21, 28, 29<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35, 36, 37. S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>re, the faith of this would support the poor belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, under all those discouragements.</p>
               <p>2. They would minde likewise the covenant of Grace, wherein all things are contrived and laid downe, so as that the beleever may have abundant consolation and comfort, in all cases; and wherein there is enough to take away all cause of fainting &amp; discouragement: as might fully be made to appeare, if any did questione it.</p>
               <p>3. They would remember how richly Christ is furnished, with all qualifications, suiteing even
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44048:213"/>
that case, wherein they are like to be overwhelmed with discouragements: and could the beleever but think upon, and beleeve those three things, he might be keeped-up under all discouragements <hi>first.</hi> That Christ is a compassionate tender-hearted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, having bowels more tender, than the bowels of any mother; so that <hi>He will not break the bruised reed, nor quench the smoaking flax Esai.</hi> 42: 3. He had compassion on the very bodies of the multitude, that followed him; and would not let them go away fasting, lest they should fainte in the way, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15: 32. <hi>Mark.</hi> 8: 3. and will He not have compassion on the soules of his followers, when like to faint through spiritual discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? <hi>Secondly.</hi> That He hath power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command all things, that can serve to carray-on a poor beleever: for all power in Heaven and Earth is given to Him; all things are made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Him. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That He hath a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adinesse and willingnesse, upon many accounts, to helpe his followers in their necessities. Sure, were these three firmly believed, the beleever could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>aint, having Christ, who is tender and loving &amp; willing to helpe, and withall able to do what he will, to look to, and to run to, for supply.</p>
               <p>4. They would take up Christ, under all his heart-strengthening, and soul comforting relations, as a tender Brother, a careful Shepherd, a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling Highpriest, a loving Husband, a sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing Head, a life-communicating Root, an alsufficient King &amp;c. any one of which is enough to beare up the head, and comfort the heart of a droup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, discouraged and fainting soul: much more may
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:44048:214"/>
all of them yeeld strong consolation, to support &amp; revive a soul, staggering and fainting, through dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. Oh! if wee could but rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and dwell upon the thoughts of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and heart-quickening relations! our hearts would not fail us, so much as they do.</p>
               <p>5. They would eye Him, as now in glory, who, as Head and Captaine of salvation, hath wreastled through, and overcome all difficulties and discouragments, that were in his way, and in name and behalf of all beleevers, that are his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and members of his body, is now possessed of glory, and thence draw an heart-comforting, and soul-strengthening conclusion, thus. Is He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into glory as Head, than such a poor faint heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, heart-brocken, discouraged worme, as I am, may at length come there, as a little bit of his body, especially since He said, that seing He liveth all his shall live also, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14: 19.</p>
               <p>6. They would remember how Christ, who was alwayes heard of his Father, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 11: 41, 42. did supplicat for this, as Mediator and Intercessor for his people <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17: 24. saying, <hi>Father,</hi> I <hi>will th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

May not the poor faint-hearted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, that is looking to Iesus, draw an heart-revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing &amp; soul encouraging conclusion out of this, &amp; say. Though my prayers be shote out, and when I cry for reliefe under my discouragements, I get no hearing; but, on the contrary, my discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grow, and my heart fainteth the more; yet Christ alwayes was heard, and the Father will not say Him nay, why then may I not lift up my head in

               <p>7. By faith they would cast all their discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, entanglements, and difficulties, as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, too heavy for their back, on Christ, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of discouragements and to wreastle thorow such difficulties. 2. They beleeve, He is only able to beare them up, and carry them thorow, &amp; make them to despise all those discouragements, which the Devil and their own evil hearts muster up against them. 3.

               <p>2. Nor would they think to be free of all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> causes and occasions of this fainting, <hi>viz</hi> the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements formerly mentioned, or the like
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:44048:215"/>
for, if the devil can do any thing, he will work dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, both within and without. So that they would lay their resolution to meet with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragaments: for few or none ever went to heaven, but they had many a storme in their face, and they must not think to have a way paved for themselves alone.</p>
               <p>3. They would not pore too much, nor dwell too long and too much upon the thoughts of those discouragements: for that is Satans advantage, &amp; tendeth to weaken themselves. But it were better to be looking beyond them, as Christ did <hi>Heb.</hi> 12: 2. when he had the crosse and the shame to wreastle with, He looked to the joy that was set before Him; and that made Him endure the crosse, and despise the shame: and as <hi>Moses</hi> did <hi>Heb.</hi> 11: 25, 26, 27. when he had afflictions, and the wrath of the King to wreastle against, He had respect unto the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the reward, and so he endured as seeing Him who is invisible.</p>
               <p>4. They would remember, that as Christ hath tender bowells, and is full of compassion, and is both ready &amp; able to helpe them, so is He wise, &amp; knoweth how to let-out his mercies best. He is not like a foolish affectionat mother, that would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarde the life of the childe, before she put the childe to any paine. He seeth what is best for his owne glory, and for their good, here and hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; &amp; that He will do, with much tendernesse &amp; readinesse.</p>
               <p>5. They would look upon it, as no mean mercy, if, notwithstanding of all the discouragements; and stormes that blow in their face, they are helped to
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44048:216"/>
keep their face up the hill, &amp; are fixed in this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never willingly to turne their back upon the way of God; but to continue creeping forward, as they may, whatever stormes they meet with: yea upon this account, ought they heartily to blesse his name, and to rejoyce; for <hi>their hearts shall live that seek Him, Psal.</hi> 22: 26.</p>
               <p>6. They would remember, for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that as many have been helped thorow all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, &amp; have been brought home at length, so may they be brought thorow all those stormes, which now they wreastle with. It is the glory of the Mediator to bring his brocken, torne &amp; sincking vessels saife to shore.</p>

                  </gap> distemper, as that he will be as unfit &amp; unable for dischargeing of any commanded duty, as a dead man, or one in a swoon, is to work or go a journay: &amp; it were good to know how Christ should be made use of, as <hi>the Life,</hi> to the end the diseased soul may be delivered from this: for this cause, we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider those foure things,</p>
               <p>1. See what are the several steps &amp; degrees of this distemper.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:44048:216"/>2. Consider whence it cometh, or what are the causes or occasions thereof.</p>
               <p>3. Consider how Christ is life to the soul, in such a dead case: &amp;</p>
               <p>4. Point out the way of the souls usemaking of Christ, that would be delivered herefrom.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first.</hi> This distemper cometh-on by several steps &amp; degrees: it will be sufficient to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion some of the maine &amp; most remarkable steps; such as,</p>
               <p>1. There is a falling from our watchfulnesse &amp; tendernesse: &amp; when we leave our watchtour, we invite &amp; encourage Satan to set upon us; as was said before.</p>
               <p>2. There is going about duty but in a lazie way, when we love &amp; seek after carnal ease, and seek out wayes of doing the duty, so as may be least trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the flesh; as the Spouse did, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3: 1. when she sought her beloved upon her bed.</p>
               <p>3. There is a lying by, &amp; not stirring up oursel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to an active way of going about duty, of which the Prophet complaineth, <hi>Esai.</hi> 64: 7. when he sayeth, <hi>there is none that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. There is a giving way to spiritual drouzinesse, &amp; upsitting in duties, &amp; in the wayes of God. <hi>I sleep</hi> (said the Spouse <hi>Cant.</hi> 5: 2, 3.) &amp; I <hi>have put off my coat</hi> &amp;c. She knew she was not right, but was drousie, &amp; yet she did not shake it off, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed herself for it, tooke off her coat, &amp; washed her feet, &amp; so lay downe to sleep.</p>
               <p>5. There is a satisfaction and contentment with his condition, as thinking we are pretty well; at
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:44048:217"/>
least, for that time; and thus was the spouse in that forementioned place led away, she was so far from being dissatisfied with her condition, that she rather expresseth her contentment therewith.</p>
               <p>6. There may be such a love to such a condition, &amp; such a satisfaction in it, as that they may shift every thing, that hath a tendency to rouze them up out of that sluggish lazinesse, as not loving to be awakened out of their sleep. So we see the Bride shift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> &amp; putteth off Christ's call &amp; invitation to her, to arise &amp; open to Him.</p>
               <p>7. Yea, there is a defending of that condition, as, at least, tollerable &amp; none of the worste; a justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it; or, at least, a pleading for themselves &amp; excuseing the matter, &amp; covering over their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of duty with faire pretexts, as the Spouse did, when she answered Christ's call, with this, that she had washed her feet &amp; might not defile them agine.</p>
               <p>8. Yea further, there is a pleading for this case, by alledging an impossibility to get it helped, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> matters now stand; or at least, they will muster up insuperable-like difficulties, in their own way of doing duty, as the sluggard will say, that there is a lyon in the way: &amp; the Spouse alledged she could not put on her coat againe.</p>
               <p>9. Yea, it way come yet higher, even to a peremptour refuseing to set about the duty: for what else can be read out of the Brides carriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than that she would not rise, and open to her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved?</p>
               <p>10. There is also a desperate laying the duty aside, as supposeing it impossible to be gote done,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:44048:217"/>
and so a resolute laying of it by as hopelesse, and as a businesse, they need not trouble themselves with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l, because they will not get it throughed.</p>
               <p>11. And hence floweth an utter indisposition, &amp; unfitnesse for duty.</p>
               <p>12. Yea, and in some it may came to this hieght that the thoughts of going about any commanded duty, especially of worshipe, either in publick or Private; or their minting, and attempting to set about it, shall fill them with terrour and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they shall be constrained to forbeare, yea to lay aside all thoughts of going about any such duty.</p>
               <p>This is a very dead - like condition, what can be the causes or occasions thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>answere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap>ving a hand in this.</p>
               <p>1. No care to keep up a tender frame of heart, but growing slack, loose and carelesse, in going <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>2. Slighting of challenges for omission of duties, or leaving duties over the belly of conscience, may make way for such an evil.</p>
               <p>3. Giving way to carnality and formality in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is a ready meane to usher - in this evil: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>4. When people drown themselves in the cares of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:44048:218"/>
the world, they occasion this deadnesse to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: for then duties not onely are not gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout heartily, but they are looked on as a burden, and the man becometh weary of them; and from that he cometh to neglect them; and by continue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the neglect of them, he contracteth an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of heart from them; &amp; then an utter unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and indisposition, for dischargeing of them, followeth.</p>
               <p>5. Satan hath an active hand here driveing-on with his crafts and wiles from one steppe to another.</p>
               <p>6. The hand also of a Soveraigne God is to be observed here, giving way to this, yea and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters in his justice and wisdome so, as such persons shall come under such an indisposition, and that for wise and holy ends, as 1. That by such a dispensation he may humble them; who possibly were puft up before, as thinking themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves fit enough to go about any duty, how difficult or hazardous soever, as <hi>Peter,</hi> who boasted so of his own strength, as he thought nothing to lay down his life for Christ, and to die with him; and yet at length came to that, that he could not, or durst not, speak the truth before a damsel. 2. That He may punish one spiritual sin with another. 3. To give warning to all to watch, and pray, and to worke out their salvation with fear and trembling, and not to be high minded but feare. 4. That thereby, in his just and righteous judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He may lay a stumbling block before some, to the breaking of their neck, when they shall, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>We <hi>answere.</hi> 1. By keeping possession of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, even when he seemeth to be most dead; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

key of <hi>David</hi> to open the heart, <hi>Revel</hi> 3: vers. 7.</p>
               <p>6. By giving a discovery of the evil of their former wayes and courses, He worketh up the heart to godly sorrow and remorse, for what is done, making their bowels move for grief and sorrow, that they should have so dishonoured and grieved Him.</p>
               <p>7. By setting the soul thus on work to do, what formerly it neither could, nor would do; and thus He maketh the soul <hi>strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, Epes.</hi> 6: 10. and able <hi>to run and not be weary, and to walk and not be faint, Esai.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>8. By discovering the great recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that is comeing, and the great help they have at hand, in the Covenant and promises thereof, and in Christ, their Head and Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He maketh the burden light, and the duty easie.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Last</hi> particular <hi>viz.</hi> How a beleever in such a case should make use of Christ, as <hi>the Life,</hi> that he may be delivered therefrom?</p>
               <p>When the poor beleever is any way sensible of this decay, and earnestly desireing to be from under that power of death, and in case to go about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded duties, he would</p>
               <p>1. Look to Christ for enlightened eyes, that he may get a more through discovery of the hazard &amp; wreatchednesse of such a condition, that hereby being awakened and alarmed he may more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly use the meanes of recovery, and be more willing to be at some paines to be delivered.</p>
               <p>2. He would run to the blood of Jesus, to get the guilt of his by gone sinful wayes washen away,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:44048:219"/>
and bloted out; to the end he may obtaine the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and get his reconciled face shineing upon him againe.</p>
               <p>3. He would eye Christ, as a Prince exalted to give repentance, that so his sorrow for his former sinful courses, may be kindely, spiritual, through and affecting the heart. He would cry to Christ, that He would put - in his hand by the hole of the door, that his bowels may become moved for Him.</p>
               <p>4. He would also look to Him, as that good Shepherd, who will strengthen that which is sick, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 34: 16. And take notice also of his other Relations, and of his Obligations thereby, and by the Covenant of Redemption; and this will strengthen his hope.</p>
               <p>5. He would lay hold on Christ as his Strength, whereby his feet may be made like hindes feet, and he may be made to walk upon his high places, <hi>Habb.</hi> 3: 19. and he would grippe to that promise, <hi>Esai.</hi> 41: 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I <hi>will strengthen thee;</hi> and lay hold on Christ in it.</p>
               <p>6. Having done thus, he would set about every commanded duty, in the strength of Jesus, looking to Him for help and supply, from whom cometh all his strength: and though he should not finde that help and assistance, which he expected, yet he would not be discouraged, but continue, and when he can do no more offer himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ready and willing to go about the duty, as if he had strength.</p>
               <p>7. He would lye open to, and be ready to receive the influences of strength, which He, who is the Head, shall think good to give, in his own time

                  <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4: vers. 30. or to quench his motions. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5: vers. 19.</p>
               <p>If these duties were honestly minded and gone about, in Him, and in His strength; none can tell, how soon there might be a change wrought in the soul.</p>
               <p>But of it be asked what such can do, to whom the very thoughts of the duty, and aimeing at it is matter of terrour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It may be something, if not much, of that may flow from such a bodyly distemper, as occasioneth the alteration of the body, upon the through apprehension of any thing, that is weighty and of moment, so as they cannot endure to be much affected with any thing: But leaving this to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I would advise such a soul to those duties.</p>
               <p>1. To be frequently seting to the duty, as for example of prayer, though that should raise the distemper of their body: for, through time that may weare away, or at least grow lesse; while as their giving way thereto will still make the duty the more and more terrible, and so render themselves the more unfit for it, and thus they shall gratifie Satan, who (it may be) may have a hand in that bodyly distemper too: when the poor soul is thus accustomed or habituated to the attempting of the duty, it will at length appeare not so terrible as it did; &amp; so the body may become not so soon altered thereby, as it was.</p>
               <p>2. When such an one can do no more, He would keep his love to the duty, and his desires after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t, fresh and lively: and would not suffer these quite to die out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:44048:221"/>3. He would be much in the use of frequent eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, and of short supplications darted up to God; for these will not make such an impression on the body, and so will not so occasion the raiseing and wakening of the bodyly distemper, as more solemne addresses to God in prayer would possibly do.</p>
               <p>4. If he cannot go to Christ with confidence, to draw out of Him life and strength, according to his need; yet he may give a look to Him, though it were from a farre: and he may think of Him, and speak of Him frequently: and would narrowly observe every thing, that pointeth Him out, or bringeth any thing of Him to remembrance.</p>
               <p>5. Such souls would not give way to despairing thoughts, as if their case were wholly helpelesse and hopelesse: for that is a reflecting upon the power &amp; skill of Christ: and therefore is provoking and dishonourable to Him.</p>
               <p>6. Let Christ, and all that is His, be precious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and lovely unto them. And thus they would keep some room in their heart open for Him; till He should be pleased to come to them with salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And who can tell, how soon He may come?</p>
               <p>But enough of this: there is a <hi>Fourth</hi> case of deadnesse to be spoken to; and that is this.</p>

               <p>And <hi>first.</hi> There are many several steps to, and degrees of this distemper: we shall mention a few, as</p>
               <p>1. When they cannot come with confidence, and draw ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of Him by faith, what their souls case calleth for; they cannot with joy draw waters out of the wels of salvation, <hi>Esai.</hi> 12: 3. But keep at a distance, and intertaine jealous thoughts of Him: this is a degree of unbeleefe, making way for more.</p>
               <p>2. When they cannot confidently assert, and avow their interest in Him, as the Church did, <hi>Esai.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed; for the Lord Ie hovah is my strength, &amp; my song<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He also is become my salvation,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. when they much question, if ever they have indeed laid hold on Christ; and so cannot go to Him, for the supply of their wants and necessities.</p>
               <p>4. When moreover they question, if they be allowed of God, and warranted to come to Him, and lay hold upon Him: yea and they think they have many arguments, whereby to maintaine this their unbeleefe, and justify their keeping aback from Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:44048:222"/>5. Or when, if they look to Him at all, it is with much mixture of faithlesse fears that they shall not be the better: or, at least, doubting whether it shall be to their advantage or not.</p>
               <p>6. This unbeleef will advance further, and they may come to that, not only to conclude, that they have no part or portion in Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that their case is desperat and irremediable: and so say, there is no more hope, they are cut off for their part, as <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37: 11. and so lye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by as dead and forelorne.</p>
               <p>7. Yea they may come higher, and vent some desperat thoughts and expressions of God, to the great scandal of the godly, and to the dishonour of God.</p>
               <p>8. And yet more, they may come that length, to question all the promises, and cry out, with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his haste, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116: 11. that <hi>all men are liars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. Yea they may come to this, to account the whole gospel, to be nothing but a heap of delusions, and a cunningly devised fable, or but mere notions and fancies.</p>
               <p>10. And at length come to question, if there be a God, that ruleth in the Earth.</p>
               <p>These are dreadful degrees and steps of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid distemper, and enough to make all flesh tremble.</p>
               <p>Let us see <hi>next,</hi> whence this cometh. The causes hereof we may reduce to three heads.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> The holy Lord hath a holy hand in this, and hath noble ends and designes before Him, in this matter: as</p>
               <p>1. The Lord may think good to order matters
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:44048:222"/>
thus, that He may magnifie his power and grace, in reseueing such, as were returned to the very brinke of hell, and seemed to many to be lost and irrecoverably gone.</p>
               <p>2. Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> in punishing them thus, for giving way to the first motions of unbeleefe, he might warne all to guaird against such an evil, and not to foster and give way to groundlesse complaints, nor intertaine objections, moved against their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the devil.</p>
               <p>3. To warne all to walk circumspectly, and to worke-out their salvation with fear and trembling, not knowing what may befal them, ere they die.</p>
               <p>4. To teach all to walk humbly, not knowing what advantage Satan may get of them, ere all be done; and to see their dayly need of Christ to stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their faith, and to keep their grips of Him fast.</p>
               <p>5. So the Lord may think good to dispense so with some, that he may give a full proof of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully great patience and longanimity, in bearing with such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that so long.</p>
               <p>6. As also to demonstrate his Soveraignity, in measureing out his dispensations to his own, as he seeth will most glorifie himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Next,</hi> Satan hath an active hand in this, for</p>
               <p>1. He raiseth clouds and mists in the believer, so that he cannot see the work of God within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and so is made to cry out, that he hath no grace, and that all was but delusions, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, which he looked upon as grace before.</p>
               <p>2. He raiseth up in them jealousies of God, and of all his wayes, and puts a false glosse and constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:44048:223"/>
on all, which God doth, to the end he may confirme them in their jealousies, which they have drunk in of God.</p>
               <p>3. Having gained this ground, he worketh then upon their corruption, with very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and thus driveth them from evil to worse, and not only to question their present interest in Christ, but also to quite all hope for the time to come.</p>
               <p>4. This being done, he driveth the soul yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and filleth it with prejudices against God &amp; his glorious truthes; and from this he can easily bring them to call all in question.</p>
               <p>5. Yea he will represent God as an enemy to them; and when this is done, how easie is it with him to put them on desperat courses, and cause them speak wickedly and desperatly of God?</p>
               <p>6. And when this is done, he can easily darken the understanding, that the poor soul shall not see the glory of the gospel, and of the covenant of grace, nor the lustre and beauty of holinesse: yea and raise prejudices against the same, because there is no hope of partaking of the benefite thereof and so bring them on, to a plaine questioning of all, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eer delusions.</p>
               <p>7. And when he hath gotten them brought this length<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath faire advantage to make them que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion if there be a God and so drive them forward to Atheisme. And thus deceitfully he can carry the soul from one step to another.</p>
               <p>But <hi>thirdly.</hi> There are many sinful causes of this, within the man self as</p>
               <p>1. Pride and haughtinesse, of minde, as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:44048:223"/>
their mountain standeth so strong, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be moved: and this provoketh God to hide his face, as, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>2. Self confidence, a concomitant of pride, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing themselves to be so well rooted, that they cannot be shaken, whileas it were better for them to walk in feare.</p>
               <p>3. Want of watchfulnesse over a deceitful heart, and an <hi>evil heart of unbeleef, that is still departing from the living God, Heb.</hi> 3: 12. It is good to be jealous here.</p>
               <p>4. Giving way to doubtings and questionings too readyly at first. It is not good to tempt the Lord by parlying too much and too readyly with Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan <hi>Eva's</hi> practice might be a warning sufficient to us.</p>
               <p>5. Not living in the sight of their wants, and of their dayly necessity of Christ, nor acting faith upon Him dayly, for the supplying of their wants: and when faith is not used, it may contract rust and be weakned, and come at length not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed.</p>
               <p>6. Intertaining of jealous thoughts of God, and harkening too readyly to any thing, that foster and increase, or confirme these.</p>
               <p>7. Not delighting themselves in, and with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure dwelling on the thoughts of Christ, of his offices, of the gospel, and promises; so that these come at length to lose their beauty and glory, in the soul, and have not the lustre that once they had; and this doth open a door to much mischiefe.</p>
               <p>8. In a word, not walking with God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:44048:224"/>
to the gospel, provoketh the Lord to give them up to themselves for a time.</p>
               <p>We come now to the <hi>Third</hi> particular, which is to show, How Chist is life to the poor soul in this case. And for the clearing of this, consider</p>
               <p>1. That Christ is <hi>the author and finisher of faith, Heb</hi> 12: 2. and so, as He did rebuke unbeleef at the first, he can rebuke it againe.</p>
               <p>2. That He is the great Prophet, clearing up the gospel, and every thing, that is necessary for us to know, <hi>bringing life and immortality to light by the gospel,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1: 11. and so manifesting the lustre and beauty of the gospel.</p>
               <p>3. He bringeth the promises home to the soul, in their <hi>reality, excellency,</hi> and <hi>truth,</hi> being the <hi>faithful witness and the Amen, Revel</hi> 3: 14. and the confirmer of the promises, so that they are all <hi>yea and Amen in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1: 20. And this serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to establish the soul in the faith, and to shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoughts of unbeleefe.</p>
               <p>4. So doth He, by his Spirit, dispel the mists &amp; clouds, which Satan, through unbeleef, had raised in the soul.</p>
               <p>5. And thereby also rebuketh those mistakes of God, and prejudices at Him and his wayes, which Satan hath wrought there, through corruption.</p>
               <p>6. He discovereth himself to be a ready help in time of trouble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the hope and anchor of salvation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6: 19 and a Priest living for ever to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for poor sinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 25.</p>
               <p>7. And hereby he cleareth up to the poor soul a possibility of helpe and reliefe; and thus rebuketh dispaire, or preventeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:44048:224"/>8. He manifesteth himself to be the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ow and substance of the gospel: and this maketh every line thereof pleasant and beautiful to the soul and so freeth them from the prejudices that they had at it.</p>
               <p>2. So in manifesting himself in the gospel, he revealeth the Father, that the soul cometh to the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4: 6. and this saveth the soul from atheisme</p>
               <p>10. When the soul cannot grippe Him, nor look to Him, yet He can look to the soul, and by his look quicken and revive the soul, and warme the heart with love to Him, and at length move and incline it sweetly to open to Him. And thus grippe and hold fast a lost sheep, yea and bring it home againe.</p>
               <p>But what should a soul do in such a case. To this (which is the <hi>Fourth</hi> particular to be spoken to) I <hi>answere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. They would strive against those evils, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, which procured or occasioned this distemper: a stop should be put to these malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant humors.</p>
               <p>2. They would be careful to lay againe the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of solide knowledge of God, and of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truthes, revealed in the gospel: and labour for the faith of God's truth and veracity: for till this be, nothing can be right in the soul.</p>
               <p>3. They would be throughly convinced of the treacherie, deceitfulnesse, and wickednesse of their hearts, that they may see it is not worthie to be trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that they may be jealous of it, and not hearken so readyly to it, as they have done, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:44048:225"/>
seing Satan can prompt it to speak for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>4. They would remember also, that it is divine helpe, that can recover them, and cause them grippe to the promises, and lay hold on them of new againe, as well as at the first, and that of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves, they can do nothing.</p>
               <p>5. In useing of the meanes for the recovery of life, they would eye Christ, and because this eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Christ is faith, and their disease lyeth most there they would do as the Israelits did, who were stung in the eye with the serpents, they looked to the brazen serpent with the wounded and stung eye: so would they do with a sickly, and almost dead, faith, grip Him, and with an eye, almost put out and made blinde, look to Him, knowing how ready He is to help, and what a tender heart He hath.</p>
               <p>6. And to confirme them in this resolution, they would take a new vieu of all the notable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to beleeve, wherewith the whole gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth.</p>
               <p>7. And withal, fix on Him, as the only author and finisher of faith.</p>
               <p>8. And in a word, They would cast a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully unbeleeving, and atheistical soul on Him, who is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and is wonderful in mercy and grace, and in all his wayes. And thus may He at length, in his own time, and in the way that will most glorify Himself, raise up that poor soul, out of the grave of infidelity, wherein it was stincking; and so prov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Himself to be indeed <hi>the resurrection and the life,</hi> to the praise of the glory of his grace.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> How Christ is to be made use of, as <hi>the life,</hi> by one that is so dead and senselesse, as he cannot know what to judge of himself, or his own case, except that it is naught.</head>
               <p>WE spoke something to this very case upon the matter, when we spoke of Christ as <hi>the Truth.</hi> Yet we shall speak alittle to it here; but shall not enlarge particulars formerly mentioned: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall speak alittle to those five particulars; and so,</p>

               <p>2. Shew, whence it proceedeth, and how the soul cometh to fall into it.</p>
               <p>3. Shew, how Christ, as the life, bringeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a recovery out of it.</p>

               <p>As to the <hi>first:</hi> Beleevers many times may be so dead, as not only not to see and know, that they have an interest in Christ, and to be uncertaine, what to judge of themselvs; but also be so carried away with prejudices and mistakes, as that they will judge no otherwayes of themselves, than that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:44048:226"/>
their case is naught; yea and not only will'deny, or mis-call the good, that God hath wrought in them by his Spirit; but also reason themselves to be out of the state of grace, and a stranger to faith and to the workings of the Spirit: and hereupon will come to call all delusions, which some time they had felt, and seen in themselves: which is a sad distemper; and which grace in life would free the soul from.</p>
               <p>This proceedeth (which is the <hi>second</hi> particular) partly from God's hideing of his face, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his dispensations, about them, and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them with clouds; and partly from themselves, and their owne mistakes: as</p>
               <p>1. Judging their state, not by the unchangable rule of truth; but by the outward dispensations of God, which change upon the best.</p>
               <p>2. Judging their state by the observable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of grace within them; and so concludeing their state bad, because they observe corruption pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing now and then, and grace decaying; and they perceive no victory over temptations, nor grouth in grace, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. Judging also their state by others; and so they suppose that they cannot be beleevers, because they are so unlike to others, whom they judge true beleevers. This is also to judge by a wrong rule.</p>
               <p>4. Judging themselves by themselves, that is, because they look so unlike to what sometimes they were themselves, they conclude, that their state cannot be good, which is also a wrong rule to judge their State by.</p>
               <p>5. Beginning to try and examine their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

State, and comeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o no close or issue, so that when they have done, they are as uncleare and uncertaine, what to judge of themselves, as when they began: or</p>
               <p>6. Taking little or no paines to try themselves seriously, as in the sight of God, but resting satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a superficial trial, which can come to no good issue.</p>
               <p>7. Trying and examineing, but, through the slight of Satan, and because pitching upon wrong marks, comeing to no good issue, but condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning themselves without ground.</p>
               <p>8. There is another thing which occasioneth this misjudging, to wit, the want of distinctnesse and clearnesse in covenanting with Christ, and the ignorance of the nature of true saving faith.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>third</hi> particular. How Chist is <hi>Life</hi> to the beleever in this case.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Answere.</hi> Christ manifesteth himself to be life to the soul, in this case.</p>
               <p>1. By sending the Spirit of life, that Enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Informeth, Perswadeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Sealeth.</p>
               <p>2. By actuating grace so in the soul, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth it self, and evidenceth it self to be there, as the heate and burning of a fire will discover it self, without other toakens.</p>
               <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> particular, to wit, how the soul should be exercised, or how it should imploy Christ, for an outgate out of this, hath been abundantly cleared above, where we shewed, that beleevers in this case would</p>
               <p>1. Be frequent in griping Christ, and closeing with Him as their alsufficient Mediator: and faith
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:44048:227"/>
thus frequently acting on Him, may discover it self at length.</p>
               <p>2. Look to Christ, that hath eye salve, and is given for a witnesse.</p>
               <p>3. Keep grips fast of Him, though they be in the dark, and walk on, griping to Him.</p>
               <p>4. Keep love towards Him and his working, and in exercise.</p>
               <p>5. Beg of Him to cleare up their state by his Spirit, explaining the true marks of grace, and discovering the working of grace in the soul.</p>
               <p>But it will be said (and so I come to the <hi>last</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular) what if after all this, I remaine as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, as unable to judge aright of my State, as ever?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet, thou would continue griping Christ, loving Him, looking to Him, casting a lost dead soul, with all thy wants, upon Him, and minde this as thy constant work. Yea, thou would labour to be growing in these direct acts of faith: and learne to submit to God herein, knowing that those reflect acts are not absolutely necessary, and that thou should think it much, if He bring thee to heaven at length, though covered with a cloud, all thy dayes.</p>

               <p>4. To try if their obedience to his commands be pure and consciencious, and not in a sort merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, because of his lifting - up upon them the light of his countenance: and to see if conscience to a command driveth them to duty, when they are in the dark, and have no encouragement.</p>
               <p>5. To put the graces of the Spirit to tryal, and to exercise; as their Faith, Patience, Hope, Love &amp;c. <hi>Psal.</hi> 13: 5, 6. &amp; 22: 24.</p>
               <p>6. To awaken them from their security, and to set them to a more diligent following of duty: as we see in the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>7. To sharpen their desire and hunger after Him, as that same instance cleareth.</p>
               <p>Even in such a case as this, Christ is life to the soul, (which is the <hi>Third</hi> particular)</p>
               <p>1. By taking away the sinful causes of such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, having laid down his life, and shed his blood: for the remission of their sins; so that such a dispensation is not flowing from pure wrath; but is rather an act of mercy and love.</p>
               <p>2. By advocating the poor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

lively and operative, even in such a winter day.</p>
               <p>4. By supporting the soul under that dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and keeping it from fainting, through the secret influences of grace, which He conveyeth into the soul: as He did to the poor woman of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>5. By seting the soul a work, to use such mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as God hath appointed for a recovery; as to cry, to plead, to longe, to waite, &amp;c. <hi>Their heart shall live that seek Him.</hi>

               <p>6. By teaching the soul to submit to, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in what God doth; acknowledging his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, Greatnesse and Soveraignity: and this quietnesse of heart is its life.</p>
               <p>7. By keeping the heart fast to the covenant of grace. So that, whatever come they will never quite that bargan, but they will trust in Him, though He should kill them; and they will adhere to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, though they should be dragged through hell.</p>
               <p>8. At length, when He seeth it fit and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, He quickeneth, by drawing-by the vaile, and filling the soul with joy, in the light of God's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and causing it to sing, as having the heart lifted up in the wayes of the Lord.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>last</hi> particular, concearning the duty of a soul in such a case, we say</p>
               <p>1. He would humble himself under this dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, knowing that it is the great God with whom he hath to do; and that there is no contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Him: and that all flesh should stoop before Him.</p>
               <p>2. He would justify God in all that He doth;
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:44048:230"/>
and say with <hi>David Psal.</hi> 22: 3. <hi>But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. He would look upon himself as unworthy of the least favour of that kinde: <hi>I am a worme</hi> (said David <hi>Psal.</hi> 22: 6.) <hi>and no man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. He would search-out his provocations, and run away to the fountain, the blood of Christ; that these may be purged away. and his conscience sprinkled from dead works, and his soul washen in the fountain opened to the house of David, for sin and for uncleannesse.</p>
               <p>5. He must also imploy Christ, to discover to him more and more of his guiltinesse, whereby he had grieved the Spirit of God; and as sins are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to him, he would repent of them, and run away with them to the blood, that cleanseth from all sin. This was <hi>Elihu's</hi> advice to <hi>Iob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Cap. 34: vers. 31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend. That which I see not, teach thou me, is I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. He would grip to Christ in the Covenant, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>est there, with joy and satisfaction: he would hold that fast, that he may ride out the storme in a darke night. <hi>Though he make not mine house to grow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> said <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23: <hi>vers.</hi> 5. Yet this was all his salvation and all his desire, that He <hi>had made with him an everlasting Covenant, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all things and sure.</hi> The Spouse took this course, when he could not get a sight of Him, whom her soul loved, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6: <hi>vers.</hi> 3. and assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her interest in Him. <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:44048:231"/>7. He would be intertaining high, and loving thoughts of God, commending Him highly, let His dispensations be what they will. So did the Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5: <hi>vers.</hi> 10 - 16.</p>
               <p>8. He would earnestly seek after Him. The Spouse did so, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5: <hi>vers.</hi> 6. the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she met with at the hands of the watch men did not put her off her pursuite, <hi>Vers.</hi> 7. but she continued, yea was <hi>sick of love, Vers.</hi> 8. and here looks had a prevailing power with him, as we see, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6: <hi>vers.</hi> 5. where the Bridgroom uttered that most astonishing word, <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. This new manifestation, which he is seeking for, must be expected in and through Jesus, who is the true Tabernacle, and he who was represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Mercy - seat. He is the only trysting place, in Him alone will the Father be seen</p>
               <p>10 He would also look to Him, for strength and support, in the meane time; and for grace, that he may be keeped from fainting, and may be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to waite, til he come, who knoweth the fittest season, wherein to appeare.</p>
               <p>But, it will be said, what if after all this, we get no outgate, but He hideth his face still from us?</p>
               <p>I <hi>answere,</hi> Such would know, that life is one thing, and comfort is another thing: Grace is one thing, and warme blainks of Gods face is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The one is necessary to the very being of a Christian, the other not; but only necessary to his comfortable being: and therefore they should be content, if God give them grace, though they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>isse comfort for a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:44048:231"/>2. They would lairne to commit that matter to Christ, who knoweth how to give that which is good, and what is best for them.</p>
               <p>3. They would be hanging on Him, for strength for duty; and, in his strength, seting about every commanded duty, and be exercising, Faith, Love, Patience, Hope, Desire, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. Let the well ordered covenant be all their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and all their desire; and though they should not get a comfortable blaink of God's face, so long as they were here, yet holding fast this covenant they should at length be saved souls, and what would they have more? and when they get this, what will they misse?</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:44048:232"/>1. God presenting their sins unto their vieu, so as they shall cry out, <hi>our sin is ever before us, Psal.</hi> 51: 3. and say, as it is <hi>Psal.</hi> 90: 8. <hi>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance:</hi> and so cause them see the Lord contending for sin, as the Church did, <hi>Esai.</hi> 59: <hi>we roare all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment but there is none, for salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but it is far off from us: for our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us: for our transgressions are with us; and as for our iniquities, we know them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, God may bring upon them the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their youth, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh <hi>Cap.</hi> 13: 26. and so bring upon them, or suffer conscience to charge them with their old sins, formerly repented of and pardoned. And this is more terrible: <hi>David</hi> is made to remember his original sin, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>3. And, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, <hi>Cap.</hi> 15: 17. God may seem to be sealing up all their sins in a bag, that none of them may be lost or fall by, without being taken notice of; and, as it were, be gathering them together in a heape.</p>
               <p>4. He may pursue sore with signes of wrath &amp; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, because of those sinnes, as we see in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Psal.</hi> 4. &amp; 38. &amp; 51. and in several others of his people, chastened of the Lord because of their trangressions; whereof there are many instances in scripture.</p>
               <p>5. Yea, and that for a considerable time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cause them cry out, with <hi>David Psal.</hi> 4: 3.—<hi>but thou O Lord how long!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. And that not only with outward, but also
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:44048:232"/>
with inward plagues. And strokes, as <hi>David's</hi> case cleareth, in the forecited <hi>Psalmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Yea and not only themselves, but even their posterity: as <hi>Davids</hi> childe was smiten with death, and the posterity of <hi>Manasses,</hi> who found mercy himself, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33: 13. was caryed into captivity for his sin, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23: 26, 27.</p>
               <p>8. Further, the Lord may deprive them of all their former joy and comfort, which made <hi>David</hi> cry out <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 12. <hi>restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and grant me thy free Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9. And, which is yet more terrible, write their sin upon their judgment, as when He caused the sword and whoredom follow <hi>Davids</hi> house.</p>
               <p>10. And finally, He may cause them feare utter offcasting as <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 11. <hi>cast me not away</hi> (said he) <hi>from thy presence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this the Lord thinketh good to do (that we may speak a word to the <hi>second</hi> particular) for those and the like reasons.</p>
               <p>1. To discover to them, and to all the world, how Just, Holy, and Righteous a God He is, that cannot approve of or beare with sin, even in his own children.</p>
               <p>2. To make all fear and tremble before this great and holy God, who is terrible in his judgements, even when they come from a Fathers hand, that is not pursueing in pure anger and wrath, but cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening in love: Sure, all must think, that his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations with the wicked will be much more fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and horrible, seing they are not yet reconciled unto Him through the blood of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>esus.</p>
               <p>3. To presse Believers more earnestly in to Christ,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:44048:233"/>
that they may get a new extract of their pardon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and their souls washen in the blood of Iesus.</p>
               <p>4. To teach them to walk more circumspectly afterward, and to guaird more watchfully against Satans temptations, and to imploy Christ more as their Strength, Light and Guide.</p>
               <p>5. To cause them see their great obligation to Jesus Christ, for delivering them from that state of wrath, wherein they were by nature, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and would have lyen-in to all eternity, had not He redeemed them.</p>
               <p>6. To exercise their Faith, Patience and Hope; to see if in hope, they will beleeve against hope, and lay hold on the strength of the Lord, that they may make peace with him, <hi>Esai.</hi> 27: 5.</p>
               <p>7. To give a fresh proof of his wonderful Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Grace, Love, and Compassion, upholding the soul, in the meane time, &amp; at length, pardoning them, and speaking peace to their souls through the blood of Jesus.</p>
               <p>But as to the <hi>third</hi> particular. We may look on Christ, as <hi>the Life</hi> to the soul in this case, upon those accounts.</p>
               <p>1. He hath satisfied justice, and so hath borne the pure wrath of God due for their sinnes: He hath <hi>troden the winepresse alone, Esai.</hi> 63: 3. <hi>He was wounded for our transgressions, and bruised for our sins, Esai.</hi> 53: 5, 10. And therefore they drink not of this cup, which would make them drunk, and to stagger, and fall, and never rise againe.</p>
               <p>2. Yea, He hath procured, that mercy and love shall accompany all those sharpe dispensations; and that they shall flow from mercy; yea and that
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:44048:233"/>
they shall be as a covenanted blessing, promised in he covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89: 30, 31, 32, 33.</p>
               <p>3. And sometimes He is pleased to let them see this clear difference betwixt the strokes they lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the judgments of pure wrath, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the wicked: and this supporteth the soul: for then he seeth, that those dispensations, how sharpe so ever they be, shall work together for good to him, and come from the hand of a gracious and loving Father, reconciled in the blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>4. He is a <hi>Prince exalted to give repentance and remission of sins to Israel, Act.</hi> 5: 31. Yea, He hath procured such a clause in the covenant, which is wel ordered in all things and sure, that upon their renewing of faith and repentance, their after sin shall be pardoned; and besides the promises of faith and repentance, in the covenant, His being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> their receiving of both.</p>
               <p>5. He cleareth to them their interest in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and their right to the promises of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and through their closeing with Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:44048:234"/>
Pardon, according to the gospel consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, though the beleever as yet perceiveth it not. And sin being pardoned before God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to the tenor of the covenant of grace, the man is a living man, whatever feares of death, he may be keeped under for a time.</p>
               <p>7. He helpeth also the soul to a justifying of God, and to a holy submissive frame of Spirit, under that dispensation; so that they are willing to beare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Lord, because they have sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Him, <hi>Micah.</hi> 7: 9. and to waite for an outgate in God's own time: and to kisse the rod, and accept of the punishment of their sin.</p>
               <p>8. When He seeth it fit for his own glory, and their advantage, He speaketh peace at length to the soul, and sayeth, <hi>Son or daughter, be of good cheer, thy sinnes are forgiven thee.</hi> And then is the soul restored to life.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>fourth</hi> particular. The soul that is wreastling with an angry God for sin, and would make use of Christ as <hi>the life,</hi> would do those things,</p>
               <p>1. He would look to Christ, as standing under God's curse in our room, and as satisfying justice for all the elect, and for all their sinnes.</p>
               <p>2. He would eye the covenant, wherein new pardon is promised, upon the renewing of faith and repentance.</p>
               <p>3. He would eye Christ, as the great Lord dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensator of both Faith and Repentance, and hing on Him for both; and thus beleeve, that he may beleeve and repent, or lay his soul open to Him, that He may work in him both Repentance and Faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="371" facs="tcp:44048:234"/>4. He would flee to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things than the blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> that he may be washen, and sprinkled with hysope, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did <hi>Psal.</hi> 51: 7.</p>
               <p>5. He would eye Christ as a prince, to pardon, and give remission of sins, and as exalted for this end, and would fix his eye upon Him, as now exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in glory for this end.</p>
               <p>6. He would close with Christ of new, as his only alsufficient mediator; and, having done this, and repented of his sins, whereby God hath been provoked, he would conclude through faith, that a pardon is past in the court of heaven, conforme to the tenor of the gospel, and waite on Christ, until the intimation come.</p>
               <p>As for the cautions, which I promised to speak to, in the <hi>last</hi> place, take those few</p>
               <p>1. Do not conclude there is no pardon, because there is no intimation thereof made to thy soul, as yet. According to the dispensation of grace, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended upon in the gospel, pardon is had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly upon a souls beleeving and repenting; But the intimation, sense, and feeling of pardon, is a distinct thing, and may, for several ends, be long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>eeped-up from the soul; Sure, they go not alwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes together.</p>
               <p>2. Do not conclude, there is no pardon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the rode, that was inflicted for sin, is not as yet taken off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God pardoned <hi>Davids</hi> sin, and did intimate the same to Him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> and yet the sword did not depart from his house till he died: God can forgive, and yet take vengeance on their in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ions, <hi>Psal.</hi> 99<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:44048:235"/>3. Do not upon this ground, question God's Faithfulnesse, or conclude that God's covenant doth not stand fast: He is the same, and the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant abideth fast and firme; but the change is in thee.</p>
               <p>4. Do not think, that because thou hast once received Christ, that therefore, without any new act of faith on Him, or of repentance towards God, thou should immediatly be pardoned of thy sinnes, as soon as they are committed: for the gospel methode must be followed, and it should satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us.</p>

               <p>THis being added for furder confirmation of what was formerly said, will pointe out unto us several necessary truthes: as</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> That it is most necessary, to be sound and cleare in this fundamental point, of coming to God, only in and through Christ: for</p>
               <p>1. It is the whole marrow of the gospel.</p>
               <p>2. It is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>inge of all our salvation, Christ is the chiefe cornerstone, <hi>Esa.</hi> 28: 16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: 5, 6. and</p>
               <p>3. The only ground of all our solide and true peace and comfort.</p>
               <p>4. An errour, or a mistake here, is most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, hazarding, if not ruineing, all</p>
               <p>5. Satan endeavours mainely against this, raiseth
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:44048:235"/>
up heresies, errours and false opinions, and prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth some to vent perplexing doubts and objections, &amp; all to darken this cardinal point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So doth he muster up all his temptations for this end, at length, to keep poor souls from acquantance with this way, and from making use of it, or entering into it.</p>
               <p>6. Our corrupt hearts are most averse from it, and will close with any way, how troublesome, how expensive and costly so ever it may seem to be, rather than with this.</p>
               <p>7. There are a multitude of false wayes, as we did shew above.</p>
               <p>All which cleare up this necessity, and should teach us to be very diligent to win to acquantance with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to make sure that we are in it, and to hold it fast, and to keep it pure in our practise, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixing any thing with it, or corrupting of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> That it is no small difficulty to get this truth beleeved and practised, that through Christ alone we come to the Father. Therefore is the same thing asserted and inculcated againe, upon the matter: for</p>
               <p>1. Nature will not teach this way, it is far above nature.</p>
               <p>2. Yea our natural inclination is much against it, opposing it, and fighting against it.</p>
               <p>3. This way is altogether contrary to that high esteem, which naturally all of us have of ourselves.</p>
               <p>4. And is opposite to that pride of heart, which naturally we are subject to.</p>
               <p>5. Yea there is nothing in us by natur, that will willingly comply with this way: but, on the contrary, all is opposite thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:44048:236"/>6. And therefore it is the Christians first lesson, to deny himself.</p>
               <p>The consideration of which should humble us, and make us very jealous of our own hearts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and of all those courses, which they are inclineable to, and bent upon. And it should put us to try, if ever we have overcome this difficulty: and have now all our hopes and comforts founded on Him, and on nothing else: and are up or down in our peace and joy, according as we win in to Him, or are shut out from Him: and in all our approaches to God, upon whatsoever account, are leaning to Him and resting on Him alone, exspecting accesse, acceptance, and a hearing, only in Him; and are quieted under all our feares and temptations with this, that Christ is our way to the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> That even beleevers have need to have this truth inculcated often: for</p>
               <p>1. Satan is busie pulling them off this ground, by all the wiles and temptations he can.</p>
               <p>2. Their own corruption within, and the evil heart of unbeleefe, is alwayes opposeing this way, and drawing them off it.</p>
               <p>3. Through the slight of Satan, and the power of corruption, they are oftimes declineing from this pure gospel way.</p>
               <p>4. The experience of beleevers can tell, that when they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e at their best, it is a great work and exercise to them, to keep their heart right in this matter.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Is</hi> it not too oft seen, that they are under the spiritual plague of formality, which stealeth them off their feet here?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:44048:236"/>6. And is it not found oftentimes, that they are too too ready to leane to some thing beside Christ?</p>
               <p>How ought all to be convinced of this, and humbled under the sense of it? And see also how necessary it is to be oft preaching on this subject, and to be oft thinking upon and studying this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> It should be a strong motive and inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement to us to make use of Christ, as the way to the Father, That no man cometh to the Father but by Him: for this may be looked upon as an argument, enforceing their usemaking of Him, as the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fiftly.</hi> It discovereth the ground of that truth, that there are but few that are saved; for none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Father but by Him: few, in respect of the whole world, once heare of Him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of such as hear of Him, few have the true way of imploying and applying him, as the way to the Father, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up unto them: and againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of such as have the truth, as it is in Jesus, preached unto them, O how few go to Him, and make use of Him according to the truth, and beleeve and practise the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixtly.</hi> That in and through Christ alone we must come.</p>
               <p>1. To the Knowledge of the Father: for no man knoweth the Father but the son: and He alone, who came out of the bosome of the Father, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Him.</p>
               <p>2. To the Favour and Friendship of the Father: for He alone is our pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e, and in Him alone is the Father well pleased.</p>
               <p>4. To the Kingdome of the Father here: for He
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:44048:237"/>
only is the door, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10. and by his Spirit are we effectually called.</p>
               <p>4. To the Kingdome of the Father above: for He alone hath opened that door, and is entered into the holiest of all, as our forerunner, and is gone to prepare a place for us.</p>
               <p>5. Through Him alone must we addresse our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Father, in our supplications, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16: 23. <hi>Revel.</hi> 8: 3. in our thanksgivings <hi>Rom.</hi> 1: 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 3: 17. and praise <hi>Heb.</hi> 13: 15. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3: 21.</p>
               <p>6. Through Him alone have we accesse, and an open door to the Father, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2: 18. &amp; 3: 21. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4: 16.</p>
               <p>I shall only speak to one case here. <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXIX.</hi> How should we make use of Christ, in going to the Father, in prayer and other pieces of worship?</head>
               <p>IN short, for answering of this question, I shall lay down those particulars.</p>
               <p>1. There would be a lively sense of the infinite distance, that is betwixt the great God, and us finite creaturs; and yet more betwixt the holy God and us sinful wreatches.</p>
               <p>2. There would be an eyeing of Christ, as the great peacemaker through his death and merites, having satisfied justice, and reconciled sinners unto God; that so we may look on God now, no more
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:44048:237"/>
as an enemie, but as reconciled in Jesus.</p>
               <p>3. There would be, sometimes at least, a more formal, and explicite actual closeing with Christ as ours, when we are going about such duties: and alwayes an implicite and virtual imbraceing of Him as our mediator; or an habitual hanging upon Him, and leaning to Him as our mediator, and Peacemaker.</p>
               <p>4. There would be an eyeing of Him as our great Highpriest, now living for ever to make intercession for us, and to keep the door of heaven open to us: upon which account the Apostle presseth the <hi>Hebre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ewes</hi> to come boldly to the throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4: 14, 16. See also <hi>Heb.</hi> 7: 24, 25.</p>
               <p>5. There would be a griping to Him, even in reference to that particular act of worship, and a laying hold upon Him, to speak so, as our Master usher, to bring us by the hand in to the Father, as conscious of our own unworthinesse.</p>
               <p>6. There would be a confident leaning to Him, in our approching; and so we would approachin Him, without fear or diffidence. And that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that we finde not our souls in such a good frame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as we would wish, yea and guilt looking us in the face.</p>
               <p>7. Thus would we roll all the difficulties, that come in our way, and all the discouragements, which we meet with, on Him, that He may take away the one and the other, and helpe us over the one and the other.</p>
               <p>8. As we would take an answer to all objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from Him alone, and put Him to remove all scruples, and difficulties, and strengthen ourselves
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:44048:238"/>
against all impediments and discouragments, alone, in and through Him, so there would be the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all our positive encouragements from Him alone, and all our hopes of coming speed with the Father should be grounded upon Him.</p>
               <p>9. We would ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>pect all our welcome and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with the Father, only in &amp; through Christ, and expect nothing for any thing in ourselves, not for our graces, good frame, preparation, or any thing of that kinde. So we would not found our acceptance, nor our peace and satisfaction, on our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor on any thing we have, or do; nor would we conclude our exclusion or want of accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, because we do not apprehend our frame so good as it ought to be; so we should not found our acceptance on our right performance of duties, for that is not Christ.</p>
               <p>10. We would quiet ourselves on Him alone, in all our approaches, whatever livelinesse we finde, or misse in the duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are too much tickled and faine, when duties go well with us, and troubled upon the other hand, when it is not so; and the ground of all this, is, because we leane too much to our own duties, and do not quiet ourselvs on Him alone: and hence itis, that we are oft quieted when we get the duty done and put by, though we have not met with Him there, nor goten use made of Him, as was necessary. All our comfort, peace and quiet would be founded on Him alone.</p>
               <p>11. We would look to Him for the removal of all the discouragments, that Satan casts in our way, while we are about this or that piece of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, to put us back, or to cause us advance slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:44048:238"/>
and faintingly: and, casting them all on Him, goe forward in our duty.</p>
               <p>12. We would look for all our returns and ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers only in and through Him, and lay all the weight of our hopes and exspectation of a good ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer only on Him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5: 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>For Caution I would adde a word or two.</p>
               <p>1. I do not think, that the beleever can explicitely and distinctly act all these things, when ever he is going to God; or can distinctly perceive all these several acts: nor have I specified them, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mentioned then thus, for this end; but to shew at some length, how Christ is to be imployed in those acts of worship, which we are called to performe; and that because, we ofttimes think the simple nameing of Him, and asking of things for His sake, is sufficient, though our hearts leane more to some other thing, than to Him: and the conscientious christian will find his soul, when he is rightly going about the duties of worship, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Christ thus, sometimes more distinctly and explicitely as to one particular, &amp; sometimes more as to another.</p>
               <p>2. Though the beleever cannot distinctly act saith on Christ, all these wayes, when he is going about commanded duties of worship; yet he would be sure to have his heart going out after Christ, as the only ground of his approaching to, and acceptance with, and of being heard by the Father; and to have his heart in such an habitual frame of resting on Christ, that really there may be a relying upon Him, all these wayes, though not distinctly discerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:44048:239"/>3. Sometimes the beleever will be called to be more distinct and explicite in looking to, and resting upon Christ, as to one particular, and sometimes more as to another: when Satan is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him to go to God, because He is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite holy one, and he himself is but a sinner: then he is called to act faith on Christ as the mediator, making reconciliation betwixt God and sinners: and when Satan is disswading from approaching to God, because of their want of an interest in God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then should they act faith on Christ, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, according to the gospel, and rest there, and so approach. And when Satan casts up his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthinesse and former sins, to keep him aback, or to discourage him, then he is called to lay hold on Christ, as the great Highpriest, and advocate; and, casting that discouragement on Him, to goe forward. So likewise when Satan is discourageing him in his duty, by bringing before him his sins, he should take this course. And when, because of his sinful way of worshiping God and calling upon him, and other things, he is made to feare, that all is in vaine, that neither God regairdeth him, nor his service, and that he shall not come speed, than should he cast all the burden of his acceptance, and of obtaining what he asketh and desireth, on Christ, and quiet himself there: and so as to the rest: and hence appeareth the usefulnesse of our branching-out of this matter.</p>
               <p>4. In all this, there must be an acting in the strength of Jesus: a looking to Christ and resting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christ, according to the present case and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, in Christ; that is, by his strength and grace
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:44048:239"/>
communicated to us by his Spirit. Then do we worshipe God in the Spirit, and in the newnesse of the Spirit, when all is done in the matter of worship; in and through Jesus.</p>
