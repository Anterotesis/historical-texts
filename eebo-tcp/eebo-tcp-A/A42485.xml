            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter from an Honourable Perſon in LONDON, To a ſmall Friend of his in LANCASHIRE, Conteining the Character of a certain conſtant Practiſer of Rebellion, now pretending to Loyalty.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have lately been injur'd by, ſome indignities of Language, and ſlanderous reports, raiſed by a thing of ſo deſpicable a ſame, and dirty reputation, that tis below an Oyſter-wives Tongue, and a Foot-mans Cudgell to undertake my revenge, and, indeed, there is not any thing infamous enough to be inſtrumentall therein, beſides your ſelf, and the Common Hangman, for this reaſon, I now addreſs to you for juſtice, it being as abſolutely in your power to do me right, as if you had been the Man that had done the wrong, I cannot point him out to you by his proper name, for tis ſo <hi>Ugly</hi> and loathſome, that, ſhould I attempt to write it, my Pen would nauſeate, and diſgorge it ſelf in a blot, but I ſhall repreſent him to you in a character ſo peculiarly his own, that you ſhall know him as inſallibly thereby, as if you beheld him in your looking-glaſs.</p>
            <p>He is one who is by nature the Child of wrath and ſury, of a cholerick conſtitution, ſuddainly anger'd, ſlowly appeas'd, and never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially reconcil'd. He is of a buſie medling humour, which, keeps him in perpetuall motion, and gets him the repute not of an induſtrious, but a pragmaticall, perſon, who applies himſelf to other mens troubles, as flies do to Horſes ſores, to draw a nourishment out of them, or if, by intereſſing himſelf, he chance to prove ſerviceable, is but as dogs heal-wounds by licking them, to which they are moved, not out of charity to the patient, but by the licorishneſs of their own pallate. He is of a haughty imperious diſpoſition, and a violent perſecutor of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man that ſhall dare to live near him, with, a leſſe proportion of Land and power, and a larger Talent of honeſty and ingenuity than himſelf.</p>
            <p>He ſate long at the <hi>Receipt of Cuſtom,</hi> and reſolved to keep the ſeat, as the ſtrong man in the Goſpel kept the houſe, till a ſtronger than he came, and think's that, if St. <hi>Mathew</hi> had understood the Office as well as he, he would not have left it upon a bare call. He believes himſelf to be a perfect Politician, and endeavours to make others of the ſame faith, by the frequent uſe of a ſubtile wink and a nod, ſuch as <hi>Machiavill</hi> tells us were obſervable, in the grand Maſter of policy, <hi>Caſar</hi> of <hi>Borgia.</hi> 'Twas from the ſame Evangeliſt St. <hi>Machiavill,</hi> that he learnt to deport himſelf in point of religion, which is, to carry as much of it in his face as the precifeſt, and as little of it in his heart as the profaneſt. His education was behind the Counter of a certain ſeller of Linnen, whoſe accurſed ſpawn we find in the Liſt of the Brethren in bloud, who decreed the Butchery of their Soveraign. From this young Maſter of his, he learnt the Rudiments of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with much docility; and perceiving it a readier way to riſe by Treaſon, than by his Trade, he relinquiſht this, and practiſed the other with much induſtry. His firſt Eſſay was to betray his Brother in bonds, his fellow Apprentice; and ſoon after, he put near a thouſand pound cheat upon his Father, and Elder Brother, according to the fleſh, and called it good ſervice to God and the State, becauſe they wiſh't well to the King.</p>
            <p>At length to ſhow himſelf a compleat Rebell, he appears one, <hi>tam Marte quam Mercurio, Polemick</hi> as well as a <hi>Politick</hi>: he gets a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to raiſe a troup, and being a Man of a diſcreet Charity (which ever begins at home) he firſt raiſes himſelf, by raiſing ſome hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of pounds, and then about half a hundred men, with whom he deſperately marches to <hi>Cromwells</hi> Camp in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and conceiving it to be two mens office to conduct Souldiers, and to fight them, he pretends to have left his ſpanner behind him, poſts back to fetch it, marries a wife, and ſo could not come any more into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shortly, after he acts the part of a <hi>Mephistophilus,</hi> or a minor intelligencer in his native region, to the grand <hi>Beelzebub</hi> then at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and in that Diabolicall employment he ſhow'd himſelf well vers't in the very Metaphyſicks of knavery, now called Trepannery: he would by, forged Letters, and treacherous meſſengers enſnare men into a diſcovery of their affection to their true Prince, and then perſecute them as Traytors to the Uſurper.</p>
            <p>And he was never ſo dangerous, as when he invited <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to dine with him, or himſelf to dine with you, when he dip't his hand in the dish with you, he was ſure to betray you, but this had like to have coſt him dear, for had his Claſſicall face been, as it ſeemed, true Elder: his noſe had lately been ſequester'd from it by the hand of a <note n="*" place="margin">One of that name pulled him by the note and kick't his breech in <hi>London</hi> streets.</note>
               <hi>Carpenter,</hi> but it proved as right braſs, as Friar <hi>Bacons,</hi> magicall head, and will ſhortly ſuffer, the like confuſion, uttering the ſame laſt and Lamentable words. <hi>My time is paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in his foreſaid office he now affirms that he did his Majeſtie ſervice for he oft times gave in falſe information, and that, indeed, muſt needs be conſes't: but it was only then, when he could raiſe no perſecution to the Cavaliers by any that was true. And though he has hitherto been a <hi>Saul</hi> to the Kings friends, not only in exerciſing his own rage againſt them, but in accuſing and ſupplanting ſuch perſons as were civill towards them, yet now, moved by the turne of affairs, and not the converſion of his own heart, he would needs appear a <hi>Paul,</hi> and, having ſold a horſe to one who appeared in the Cheſhire engagement, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 0.ſ. under the rate, he calls it a ſervice to his Majeſty, and having trepann'd the pens of 2. or 3. Noble perſonages, to ſubſcribe a favourable Certificate; with as much modeſty as merit, he puts in for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as if the King were obliged to do good for evill only, and to love none but his Enemies, and to take the Coats from his friends, to beſtow them on thoſe who have already rob'd them of their Cloaks. By ſuch ſubtile contrivances and artifices he has now got himſelf into a very good condition, though no good condition could ever get into him. Sir, by this time, I conceive, you apprehend who is ſignified by the Character, as well as <hi>David</hi> did by <hi>Nathans</hi> parable: and you cannot but acknowledg, that it is abſolutely in your power to give him a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment proportionable to his guilt, and to diſable him to practiſe any farther miſchief, and that by the preſident of a King-killing Alderman, you may Hoyl him up, and thereby purchaſe more love and fame, then by all the former actions of your Life.

I hope, the prickings of your own, conscience will prevail with you to effect it, and ſo by ſaving my pen the pains of Rhetorick to perſwade you to do it, oblige me to employ it in a panegyprick, when it is done. A word is enough to the wiſe; that is, to you.</p>
