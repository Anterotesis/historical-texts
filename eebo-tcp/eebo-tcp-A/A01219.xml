            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AMong many other laudable
cuſtomes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> noble Vniuerſitie
of Louaine, this one is yearely
obſerued there, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moneth of
December al ordinarie leſsons ceaſe
for the ſpace of one whole weeke, and
in place thereof ſome Learned man
is choſen by common aſſent to be the
Preſident of certaine Diſputations:
wherein he proponeth, to ſuch as are
thereto appointed, diuerſe frutefull
queſtions in Diuinitie, Law, Phyſik
Phyloſophie, Humanitie, and in all
probable matters, making argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
breefly for both partes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and then leauing to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:12999:4"/>
of the Reſpondent to chuſe whiche

asſembled. And in this maner twiſe
a day fower houres are ſpente that
weeke, with greate profite and vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of many good and profitable
maters of learning worth the hering
and bering away, though litle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
commonly afterward come forth
in printe, to the ſight and vewe of

            <p>Amonge diuerſe other, this laſte
December there, a learned man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Law called M. Peter Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin
<pb facs="tcp:12999:4"/>
borne in Andwerp made an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
againſt the Inſurrections of the
Proteſtantes and Sectes of our time,
not without greate commendation,
which, at the earneſt requeſte of his
frindes, he ſuffered to be afterwarde
printed. Anh becauſe I thought it no
leſse profitable and fruteful, that, as
that Oration is in Latine, and like to
be ſhortly in Doutch and Frenche,
ſo it ſhould be in Engliſhe alſo to
warne my deere Contremen of thoſe
mens malice and cruelty: I conferred
with him, and by his aduiſe traſlated
it into our Mother tong, with ſuche
notes and farther additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s as for lack
of tyme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pronounced it, were
omitted and leafte out in the Latine.
VVherein I toke ſuch leaue and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
as the Author, with whome I
<pb facs="tcp:12999:5"/>
conferred, might be bolde to vſe him
ſelfe in his owne doinges, or geue an
other man, and as the Vayne of our
Engliſſhe tong ſeemed beſte to beare
in ſuch kind of talke, leauing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes
the preciſe wordes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Latin,
but neuer ſwaruing any whit from
the truthe. And for the aſſurance
and proufe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter of this whole
Treatiſe, the Author proteſteth that
he vttered nothing in all this oration
againſte any man, but that either he
ſawe with his owne eyes, or harde of
credible perſons that were preſent
at thoſe maters, or read in approued
Writers, or in theyr owne bookes
whom he chargeth, or finally that is
notoriouſly knowen to whole Cities

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12999:9"/>
For in very deed when I conſidered &amp;

thought myne age ſcarſe ripe enough for

this alſo did put me in verie great feare,

            <p>But this needeleſſe doubt, and feare,

of our time haue not done well
in putting them ſelues in armes vnder

haue done therein againſt all law, right

firſt poynt wherof I promiſed to ſpeake.
<pb facs="tcp:12999:11"/>
Whiles in few wordes I declare &amp; proue
this vnto you, I humblie requeſt you, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
diligent attention to mark and geue ear.</p>
            <p>It behoueth alwayes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there be very
great cauſes proued why, before chainge
of lawes ſhuld be in any common weale
procured: &amp; in very deed it ought to be a

ſhuld be attempted. But that either this

by warre &amp; rebellion, by fier &amp; ſwerd, by
murder and bloudſhed of the good and
faithfull Subiectes, there can neuer any
reaſon or ſufficiente cauſe be alleged or

            <p>I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g many other notable

but yet with this condition, that all the
while he ſpake, he ſhould haue a rope tied
with a riding knot looſe inough about
his neck, the which rope ſhould be ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g,
that the other end therof might lie on the

            <p>But alas it was free, without any

God they had ſtaied there, and had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed

peace, theyr Sword coyned war: their
peace ſerued for a guylful cloke to couer
crafte and deceyt, their war was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed

Put vp thy ſword in the ſheth,

ſaied Chriſt to S. Peter: Oute with thy

            <p>It was not (I aſſure you honorable &amp;

But goe to: let it be graunted that, as
you imagine all maner of fonde &amp; abſurd

with no leſſe madneſſe, that the Chriſtian
Faith was loſt, or at leaſt that Chriſtian
Religion being nigh outworne and ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

by ſuch excellent, graue, godly, and

            <p>To be ſhort, your purpoſe was, ye ſay,
to refourme the Chriſtian Faith. Howe
then? When you could not therin preuail,
nor perſwade the people, that was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſtubburn and ſtiffenecked perhaps
as you iudged, did you thinke it the beſt
way by and by with gonneſhot, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels

            <p>Who euer being in his right wit did

they dyd what they could to driue it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>Yea, but you ſaie it was the very true
worde of God they preached, they were
the men of God, the Martyrs of Ieſus
Chriſt, the Apoſtels of Chriſtendome.
Theſe be high Titles. Will they be any
higher? I wil ſpeake for them, to ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

that labored to clyme vp to the North, to

Was it meete that becauſe they could not

               <pb facs="tcp:12999:22"/>
The Apoſtles of Ieſus Chriſte were
wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſuffer, not to geue blowes: to take

Aſſe, the Apoſtles thought it no ſkorne to
goe barefoote: and we embrace gladlye,
with reuerence their patience, humilitie,
vertue, and mild manner in planting the
Goſpel. But you ride to preach on barbd
horſes, &amp; put on the corſelet not of faith,
but of iron and ſteele, to ſet forward your
ſtrainge Religion. Al the world may ſee,
that, as the maner and order of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedinges
is contrary to Chriſt, ſo all the
ſtuffe ye vtter, is likewiſe contrary to his
<pb facs="tcp:12999:23"/>
heauenly Doctrine. What? Could ye
not ſuffer Martyrdome gladly for the
goſpel? No forſoth: ye choſe rather to ſlay
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſlaine, &amp; no maruell. For ye lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
for none other commoditie by your
Goſpel, but a loſeneſſe and liberty to liue
at your pleaſure. And therfore ſuch Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers
for ſuch a Goſpel were very loth
to leeſe their liues. The theefe wil neuer
gladly ſuffer deathe and ſpend his life in
defenſe of theft: for he purpoſeth to haue
none other frute and profite by theft, but
his ſweete life in this world maintained
at pleaſure. He that loſeth his life, ſayeth
Chriſt, preſerueth it into life euerlaſting:<note place="margin">Io. 12.</note>
but you were loth to loſe yours, for that
ye had no hope to haue any euerlaſting
life for it. Ye held it better to be Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers,
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Martyrs: to do, then to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
iniurie: How be it, to ſay the truthe,
ye ſuffred no iniury whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye ſuffred death
for hereſy, for ye deſerued no leſſe. But,
when ye murdred other, ye did great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury,
whether they deſerued to die or no:
For that ye had no authoritye ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Hold ſtil your hands a little while,
lay downe your Swordes and priuye
<pb facs="tcp:12999:23"/>
Daggers, let your fury coole, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to reaſon, and ye ſhall plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
that there is great oddes betwene
the order and due Miniſtration of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that the Emperoure and Chriſten
Princes vſed to execute againſte your
wicked tranſgreſſions: and your impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
boldneſſe, Traiterous Rebellion,
and Bloudy Cruelty againſt Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
By the authority of God allmigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
they beare the ſword,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> and haue power
to puniſhe the wicked: but, as for you,
who made you, I pray you, rulers and
Iudges in Iſrael? O vnhappy dayes, O
wicked manners of our daies, maye we
crye at this time with more iuſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then in his age <hi>Marcus Cicero</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Bondſlaues refuſe to beare the yoke
vnder their Maiſters: Subiectes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine

would be Lordes and raigne ouer all.
Who be robbers, if you be Refourmers?
Yea, who then ſhall be called Spoilers,

Innocentes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:12999:24"/>
To conclude in fewe wordes, what
reaſonable cauſe doe ye alleage for your
ſelues, why ye made warres ſo wicked
and ſo abhominable, why ye prepared
fire and fagot to burne the whole world?
was it becauſe ye were ſometimes bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for hereſie? Truly ye ſuffred not ſo

haue ſuffred it patiently for the Goſpels
ſake, if ye were Goſpellers (for ſo were
the Apoſtles wont to do) at leaſt wiſe ye
ſhoulde not haue reſiſted wyth force of
armes, becauſe ye were ſubiectes, and
were puniſhed by an order of law at the

libertie of the fleſhe by no meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>He ſaied it was neither law, nor right,

(emong whome this vertuouſe Queene

they can not abide, but doe vtterly deteſt
them, and hate them as muche as they

            <p>Out of doubt in one thing this Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peller

may it pleaſe you now to be aduertiſed

            <p>I can ſcarſe abſtaine from wepinge

They builde nothing, they
affirme nothing: the denying and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

and pulling downe of our Churches, is
the building and ſetting vp of their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagoges.

ouertake him on the waye being now
weerie and nighe out of breath. And, as
theſe kind of people are verie ſuſpiciouſe,
wel practized and experte in al miſchiefe,
they aſke and examine him verie dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
what he was, and whence he came.
When by long examination and muche
threatning they vnderſtood at length y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
he was a Prieſte, they brought the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
poore man bound like a theef into
the next Village, and there in the open
market they make an auction and ſale of
him, as if he had bene a bondman, and
aſke, if anie man would geue readie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
for him.</p>
            <p>The inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts there flocked together
&amp; were maruelouſlie amaſed &amp; aſtonied
at ſo ſtrange a caſe, they beginne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate
<pb facs="tcp:12999:57"/>
for him, they praye them, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
vp theyr handes to heauen they
beſeeche them hartelye, that they would
dimiſſe &amp; let goe the innocent &amp; harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
man, and doe him no more harme:
that they would conſider, that he was a
Chriſtian man, the image of God and
anoynted prieſt. But it had been as good
they had told a tale to a tubbe, or whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
in a deaf mans eare. For all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes
haue ſtonie hartes, they can not be
mollified. It is the nature and propertie
of men, and not of diuelles, to be moued
with mercie and pitie towardes ſuche,
as are in miſerie.</p>
            <p>To be ſhorte, firſt they pull out both
his eies, then they cut of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> toppes of his
fingers whiche had been ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted
with holie oyle, and flea with a
knife the ſkynne of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> crowne of his head
whiche was ſhauen (according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Cuſtome &amp; Cannons) Prieſtlike.
After they had thus mangled hym, to the
end the cruell butchers of the Goſpell
might haue ſome more paſtime in moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge
and laughing at him, they leade
him along the ſtreat ſtark naked, ſauing
<pb facs="tcp:12999:58"/>
that he had a poore ſhurte on, to couer
his black, blew and blouddie bodie, and
diſioynted bones that were bruſed and
wel nigh all cruſſhed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> buffets blowes
and wondes. At laſt when euerie man
had his fyll of this vnmercifull, cruell,

conſtant Martyr of Chriſte, with a rope
vpright againſte a tree, and with theyr
gunnes ſhot at him ſo often, that they
perced all his bodye throughe full of
holes.</p>

            <p>There was betwene Paris and Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aus

            <p>There was one of theſe Butchers at

            <p>They broke and burned the croſſe,<note place="margin">An. 1453. Vide Du<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bitantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lindani. pag. 298.</note> and
mocked at it euerie where as the Turkes
did ſometyme at Conſtantinople, neither
were they ſatiſfied with that: they toke
two innocent good Prieſtes and hanged
them vp on eche ſide of the Crucifix like
the two theeues for contempt &amp; reproche.
Other had theyr faces and fingers fleied,
theyr noſes, eares, and priuie members
cut of, theyr heades clouen with a ſword
at one ſtroke in two partes. Some they
burned aliue, and yet moſte commonly
they are wonte to pull vp the dead out of
