            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The aforeſaid <hi>Propoſals</hi> being duly weighed and conſidered, I am perſwaded they will find very few <hi>Objections</hi> (if any) which cannot eaſily be Anſwered: <hi>Due Ballances</hi> are the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of all <hi>Governments,</hi> and not of the leaſt concernment in <hi>Taxes</hi>; The <hi>Body Politick</hi> bearing very much <hi>Proportion</hi> with the <hi>Natural Body,</hi> the one part of it being uneaſie, the whole is affected. The <hi>Mony</hi> of this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> bears a great Proportion with the <hi>Land,</hi> almoſt equalizing it; And yet it hath paid but a very little ſhare of the <hi>Taxes: Land</hi> hath born the heat and burthen of the day: And although it hath been endeavoured by ſeveral <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> to make the <hi>Mony</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom</hi> pay its <hi>due Proportion,</hi> yet how ineffectual have they all proved, not being enforced with <hi>Penalties,</hi> which are commonly better and more effectual means to force <hi>Obedience,</hi> than <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>One Pound Five Shillings per Cent.</hi> on <hi>Mony,</hi> is but <hi>three Pence per Pound,</hi> which is but <hi>One Shilling</hi> more than the intrinſick Value of the <hi>Land Tax</hi> of <hi>Four Shillings the Pound.</hi> For <hi>One Hundred Pound</hi> in Mony, according to the <hi>Eſtabliſhed Intereſt,</hi> brings in <hi>Six Pound per Ann.</hi> And <hi>One Hundred Pounds worth of Land,</hi> hardly brings in <hi>Four Pound per Ann.</hi> all Charges being deducted. And therefore this <hi>Tax</hi> propoſed on <hi>Mony,</hi> can give no juſt Cauſe of Complaint to any, who are <hi>Friends to the beſt of Intereſts,</hi> and willing to Support <hi>the beſt of Cauſes.</hi> Beſides, if we conſider the uneaſie Circumſtances which many are under, who are Poſſeſſors of <hi>Land,</hi> which do not ſo often attend thoſe who command <hi>Mony</hi>; it will appear the more reaſonable, that <hi>Mony</hi> ſhould no longer eſcape paying its ſhare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and eſpecially of ſo ſmall a <hi>Dividend,</hi> ſeeing it's demonſtrable that a <hi>Tax on Mony,</hi> will be a means to <hi>advance the Price of Land</hi>; for the <hi>Taxes</hi> on it, hath occaſioned ſeveral Perſons (and more will follow their Examples) to <hi>ſell their Lands, and conceal their Mony,</hi> not liable to the Inſpection of <hi>Aſſeſſors</hi>; ſo that all Thinking Men muſt grant the Price of <hi>Land</hi> muſt fall, except there is a <hi>Tax</hi> laid on <hi>Mony</hi> or ſome other way prevented by the Wiſdom of <hi>Parliament.</hi>

            <p>The greateſt part of the <hi>Mony</hi> in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> doth <hi>Circulate</hi> in thoſe Particulars before mentioned. And I believe it will be no eaſie Matter by any ſhifts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o avoid paying theſe <hi>Duties to the King,</hi> without great hazard and danger. This will raiſe yearly a very conſiderable Summ, without racking Invention; <hi>Merchants</hi> will have no cauſe to complain, becauſe the product of their Goods return'd home by <hi>Bills of Exchange,</hi> pays nothing at the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe: Mony in Banks</hi> hath no reaſon of Complaint, for its Intereſt and Advantage turns to the beſt Account of any Mony in the Kingdom: <hi>Trades-Men</hi> have no reaſon to think it hard on them, for their <hi>Stocks</hi> have paid little towards the Charge of the War: <hi>Farmers</hi> and <hi>Husbandmen</hi> have as little cauſe to complain of theſe Propoſals, as any, for <hi>They</hi> grew Rich, whilſt their <hi>Landlords</hi> grew Poor, their <hi>Stocks</hi> always eſcaping the Tax. If all Perſons who are herein concern'd, would be Impartial, they muſt confeſs, that nothing is hereby propoſed, but what is for the <hi>Intereſt</hi> both of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and no Impeding, but rather Promoting <hi>Trade.</hi> And if every Man with Cheerfulneſs would part with a <hi>Little,</hi> rather than loſe <hi>All,</hi> we might with Aſſurance, expect and hope for good Succeſs in ſo Juſt a <hi>War,</hi> under the Conduct of ſo Brave a <hi>Monarch</hi>: to Whom, God Almighty grant a long and proſperous Reign.</p>
