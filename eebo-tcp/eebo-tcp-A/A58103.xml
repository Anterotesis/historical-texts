         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Off them that ſhall reſiſt God's mighty pow'r;</l>
               <l>Both high and low, this Judgment ſhall devour.</l>
               <l>God will chaſtiſe, and with his Beeſome ſweep</l>
               <l>Away all thoſe, that hate his Law to keep.</l>
               <l>The ſtuborn-hearted and the ſtrong ſhall reel.</l>
               <l>For thoſe ſad woes and Plagues which they ſhall feel.</l>
               <l>The ſcoffing tongue and lying lips ſhall cloſe,</l>
               <l>For truth no longer now they ſhall oppoſe.</l>
               <l>The Lord in fury to this Land doth call,</l>
               <l>What mercy could not do, his Judgments ſhall,</l>
               <l>Break People hearts, bow down the haughty mind,</l>
               <l>Bring tenderneſs, the Priſon-bands unbind,</l>
               <l>That ſo the Goſpel of glad-tydings may</l>
               <l>Sound forth God's power in this latter day,</l>
               <l>To turn all Souls from darkneſs unto light,</l>
               <l>That they may fear, and do God's will aright.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Awake Oh people, who have tenderneſs,</l>
               <l>Truſt in the Lord, and do not fear diſtreſs;</l>
               <l>Obey Chriſt's light, and it will ſhew the way</l>
               <l>How ye muſt live, that Chriſt may be your ſtay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Be ſtrong all ye that do the living know,</l>
               <l>Let none faint when e're doth come the woe;</l>
               <l>But let all wait in the true patient mind,</l>
               <l>For here true peace and comfort we ſhall find.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Come now dear Friends, who know the living voice,</l>
               <l>Gird up your minds, and let us all rejoyce;</l>
               <l>The Goſpel of the Kingdom now ſhall ring,</l>
               <l>Great flocks to Chriſt the ſound thereof ſhall bring;</l>
               <l>With open hearts much people ſhall embrace</l>
               <l>the Lord's dear Truth, and love his ſaving Grace.</l>
               <l>And ſome, who did not know God's truth, ſhall now</l>
               <l>Believe Chriſt's light, and to God's power bow;</l>
               <l>For now it ſhall be as it was of old,</l>
               <l>The blood of Martyrs ſhall increaſe Chriſt's fold:</l>
               <l>The peace of God ſhall cruelty bow down,</l>
               <l>Oppreſſion ceaſe, and truth ſhall have the Crown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>O happy they who hold out to the end,</l>
               <l>In their diſtreſs the Lord will comfort ſend.</l>
               <l>So bleſs'd are they who for the truth are ſpent,</l>
               <l>Either at home or elſe by Baniſhment:</l>
               <l>Yea happy they who in the Lord ſhall die;</l>
               <l>Whether in bonds or elſe at liberty.</l>
