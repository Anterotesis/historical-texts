         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>HERODOTVS</hi> the father of hystoryans wytnessethe, that there is a regyon, adioynynge to the Thraces, inhabyted by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne people named Trauses: whiche in tymes past were accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that whan a chylde was borne amongest them, incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it was oute of the mothers wombe, the parentes and neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours dyd assemble together, and there receyued hys fourthe comming with cryes, wepynges, and lamentacions, remembrynge howe manye myseryes and calamytes he shulde of necessyte suffre in thys worlde. And to the contrary, when a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ye of them departed from thys lyfe vnto death: they accompanyed him to hys graue, in greate festynge and reioysynge: in synging and ioyfully reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge the multytude of euyls and tourmentes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he was exempted by death. whiche thynge puttynge in consideration, the Ancyent Grekes vsurped in suche sorte, that Ausonus the Porte made or deuysed a prouerbe, whiche sayd, that it were right good for a man not to be borne, or yf he were borne, to dye ymmedyatly: so narowely loked they vnto the incommodities of mans life. And to saye the trouthe, yf that we would dylygently regarde it, we shulde fynde wyth Plyny: that nature hath dearely and at to hygh a pryce, solde vnto vs, the haboundaunce of thynges, which she bryngeth fourth to oure vse, and that we haue no ioye nor swetenes, that maye not be, sadnes and bytternes, which is indyuidently ioyned vnto them. For besyde the incomparable dangier, that we must passe for to come into thys lyghte, albeit that we be borne to haue lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp and commaundement ouer the other beastes, yet none of them commeth vnto the worlde so vnprouided &amp; yll appoynted, as we do, nor so frayle, weake and passyble as we be. And as the same Authour Plyny in the Prologue of the seuenth boke of hys naturall hystorye more largely and subtelly recyteth, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath geuen to all beastes euen from theyr byrthe, lybertye, vesture, haby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacyon and grateful nourriture. But ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alone is he, that assone as he is borne, falleth bare to the grounde, begynneth hys lyfe by beyng bounden or swadled, is constrayned to borowe hys garment of an other, to trauayle hys membres and hys spyryt to buylde hys lodgynge, to get hys foode by sweate of hys bodye and contynuall laboure of hys handes: after the difficultes of hys rysynge vp, and the length of tyme, that he must haue to learne to go and to speake. But yet thys is worse, that where all other beastes, do geue themself by natural instinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon, to that, which properly appertayneth to thoffyce of theyr nature, thone to flye, thother to swymme: It is man alonly that knoweth nothing withoute te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achynge, nether to go, nor speake, neyther to eate, nor fynally to do any thynge, that is in the worlde, without teachyng, excepte it be to wepe. So that thys py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyfull ignoraunce hath geuen place and auctoryte vnto the Prouerbe Italian, whiche sayeth, that a man muste be borne wyse, or els to be borne two tymes. For yf he be borne wyse, he maye escape infynyte inconuenyences, where as
<pb facs="tcp:18267:5"/>
through faulte of experyence, he tombleth dayly duryng the cours of this short lyfe, into greate preiudice of hys wytt. Yf he be borne two tymes, in the seconde lyfe, he maye ayde hym selfe with that, that he shal haue learned in the fyrst and shall not wander in the darknes of erroure, as he is constrayned to do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynge into thys worlde without guyde or lyght of knowledge. Then as it is more necessarye for man to learne, then for any other beastes: and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuynge of knoweledge, consysteth in the spyryt: It semeth very strange to thinke from whence it maye procede, that (seynge that Nature hath fourmed vs of membres and spyryt, and that the membres mortall and weake, make vs lyke vnto beastes, so much in this more auau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is no man of so lowe estate, that he careth not to couerre hys parsone wyth some sorte of clothynge. And the nomber of them is infynyte, that for to geue it more grace &amp; deckynge, be not contended or take it to be suffycyent to be wrappe it in golde, pourple &amp; delicate silkes, except they trauayle straunge countres of the worlde, for to get stoanes, most rare and precyous, and employ them to the curiosite of theyr nyce trymmynge, where maye not a man see that the more parte of men lyuinge, not onely haue not theyr thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true vertue and dutie double rewarded, but also that they kepe it not ones vnder shadowe or coueringe of the lyne or small threde of good conditions?

That whiche more is, albeit, that for hys commoditie and ease, to defende the sonne, snowe, rayne and iniury of the ayer, one lodgynge or Cabayne well closed myght be ynough, yet we loue better to cause strange marbles to be brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght from the furthest regyons of the earthe habytable, for to make, buylde &amp; edifye large and greate pallaces. Where as for the most part, we regarde not wherwith the heauenly part, which is in vs, is repasted and fedde, nor yf his lod<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gynge be conuenyently prepared: and sonner we set afore it the leues of vyce, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moste sauoury and swete fruictes of vertue, holding it more comonly reclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and locked in the obscure and base vsage of sensualytie, then in preferring it, to haunt the clere and hygh operacions of honnestie. Furthermore yf at any ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we fele any parte of oure body dysordered by sy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Shuld this come paraduenture for this cause? that for so much as the body is sene more then the spryt, we thynke therfore that it hath more nede of suche prouisyons? this argument is not suffycyent, for not onely the bodye hath not more apparance, than the spyryt, but also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body is by hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greatly e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

spryt, may be in shorte tyme knowen throughe all the world. And this self bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy continueth but very fewe dayes, where the spryt, whiche is euerlastynge, aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth euerlastingely, and may reteigne by him self through many worldes, that, wherin we accustome ourself, duryng the tyme, that he is with the body. To the which thynges and other infynitt, whiche may be alleaged for this purpose, yf men woulde haue suche consideration, as they ought to haue, it woulde cause better lyfe and more increase at this tyme than it dothe, and we hauyng care suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fycient for our body (but more garnyshing our thoughtes and myndes, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them better, and geuing them more honorable habitacion) shulde be more worthy to haue them, than we be, and shulde take more greate care to conserue them in helthe. And yf peraduenture they chaunced at any tyme to be diseased: we shulde enforce our selfes with moste diligence, to remedy theyr diseases, more then we do. Which be: Arrogance, superfluite, ambition, Couetice, immesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable desyre of lyuinge, and that whiche maketh vs lyke vnto beastes, <hi>IGNO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE,</hi> so contagyous, and pestylent in the mynde of man, that it semeth, that all other spyrytuall infyrmytes, whiche trouble him, do all procede from thys alone, for where she is, God is not duely honnored, vyce ys not exchued, nor any publique nor priuate action or offyce, is rightfully &amp; in order admynistred. So that the sentence vsurped by ancyent men, saying: that euery ignorant personne is euyl, hath bene of good right receyued. And to this approueth that, which Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence had no doubte to cause to be spoken by an olde man of experience, that the earthe beareth nothynge worsse, than a ignorant man. For as he is in all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges rude and vntaught, so in this, he is intollerable: that he thinketh nothing well done, but that, whiche he doth hym self. And truly ignorance is muche vnmete and vnsyttynge in al parsones. but in them of nobilitie muche more re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>proueable and parnycyous. Who lyke as they surmounte the other in dignite of bloude, Riches, apparayll and auctoryte, so this is theyr greate reproche, yf they do not passe other in excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cye of knowlaige, that apperteygneth to theyr vocation, extendynge more to the charges and publique administracions, than to a heape of vnprofytable pastymes and exercyses of recreation, wherin they lose a greate parte of theyr tyme, whiche might muche better be employed to learne the rolle of the parsonage, whiche shulde become them to playe in the courte of the common welthe when theyr tourne or course shulde come. The coste shalbe to deere, yf they be forced to become wyse by theyr expences, as to learne in makynge warre. For warre is a thyng to be vtterly exchued, and wys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is right miserable, that is gotten by vse onely. And it is certaine, that they, whiche lacke prudence and knowlaige, can do no noble actes in tyme of warre nor of peace. Which regarded by Salomon Kyng of Iewry, after that he, which can geue all thynges: had geuen hym chose to deman<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de what he would: he requi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red nothynge, but wysedome. which chaunceth aither by a souueraine priuelege of nature, or ells is obteygned by a great knowlaige of learnyng, ioyned with a naturall wytt, whiche is the rudder of the shyppe. And of such vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacyte, that by meanes of it, as sayth Cicero, there be founde many great and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous personages wythoute learnyng. And the natural man without learning ys more hable to receyue prayseworthynes and vertue, then the learned wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naturel wytt. And at all tymes, for the good that maye be, to trust in it, and to employe it, without experyence, to take part vpon the multitude of dyuers chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, which happenne hourely in thys worlde, is as perilleur, as to say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But whan they, that vnderstande matters, speake of Experience, they arrest not them selues vpon that naturall wyt onely. Whervpon is comme the Prouerbe, which sayeth: In wasting one leeneth. Nother is it in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which is gotten in the onely lyfe of one man. For that is to short, frayle &amp; soden, for to make dewe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uysyon for all the proufes, that we haue to do with, in this worldly pilgremage. And withoute learnyng it is lesse suffycyent for to geue vs good and clere kuow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laige of antiquite. The ignorance wherof, as wryteth Paulus Emilleus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayneth the self same men, which arne becomme aged in studye of other artes liberall, alwayes to resemble chyldren, ignorant of parseuerance and commone lyfe, to lyue as straungers in theyr natyue countreye, and lytle worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led to the gouernaunce of the common wealthe, and to the company of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayls.

And after hys name called the countrey, Peloponese. and sythens hys deathe, hys successours and descente dyd yet get more great lorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyppe. For it happened that Euritheus,<note place="margin">Eurithe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>us.</note> wyllyng to go to make warre, agaynst the Myceniens, lefte Atreus to gouerne hys royaulme of Peloponese,<note place="margin">Atreus.</note> for that he was hys vncle, brother of hys mother, and also tha same Eurithens wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe hym self thyder at that time, when hys father persecuted hym for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of Chrisyppus,<note place="margin">Chrisip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</note> whome he slewe.

And by meane therof, he was Kyng and Lorde of Micena wyth all the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> landes of his said nephieu Euritheus. By meane wherof, the Pelopides, to wit, the discente of Pelops were more myghtye than the Persydes, to wytt, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scente of Perseus. Who before had dominyon of that countreye. Agamenon suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedynge the same Euritheus, which also was a man myghtye by sea, more than any other of the Grekes, assembled in the sayd countreys whiche he helde, thys armie, more by force, than by loue, for it is very certayne, that he came to the said siege of Troye with greater nomber of shyppes, than any of the other, and that he gaue of the sayde shyppes, vnto the Acardyans, lyke as Homerus recyteth, yf we woll take hys testimonye to be suffycyent in thys behaulf. For in speakynge, as a man had geuen hym the Royall sceptre, he saych that the same Agame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, besydes the countreys that he helde in fyrme lande, had rule in many Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. and that coulde no man do that dwelled in fyrme lande (reserued the Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des nexte vnto them, which were not many in nomber) yf he had not bene migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by sea And as touchynge that hooste, that Euritheus brought to Mycena, we maye well iudge, that they myght haue bene they, that were assembled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the countreye of Grece. For Micena was a very lytle towne, and though in that tyme it was taken to be greate, yet nowe it wolde not so be taken, whiche
<pb facs="tcp:18267:18"/>
is an argument euydent ynough to beleue, that he had not there so great nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of shyppes at the Siege of Troye, as Poetes haue wryttonne, and as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome hath ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned sithens. For yf the cyty of Lacedemonie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were not inhabyted, and that there remayned but the temples and comone buyldynges, I beleue, that in successyon of tyme, men woulde not beleue at the syght, that it hath bene so stronge, and so puyssant, as it nowe is. albeit that it holdeth two partes of the lymyttes of all Peloponese for hys terrytorye, and ruleth all the remenant, and that it hath many other cytyes and landes out of the sayd Peloponese in hys al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyance. And neuertheles before the sayd cytye was well peopledde and buylded wyth sumptuous temples and other edifyces (Than whan the people were dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed through the vyllages, lyke as all the other people of Grece were) It is clere and manyfeste that it semed muche lesse. The cytye of Athenes shulde be an other thynge, yf the lyke shulde chaunce, that it were habondoned, for me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ymagyne and iudge in seynge the greatnes and situation of the same, that it had bene double more myghty than it is. And thus I conclude that we ought not holy to beleue that, which Poetes haue wryttonne of the sayd armye of Troye, nor to haue more regarde to the greatnes of cytes, then to theyr power. And that the same hoste was greater then any of them, whiche had bene before, but much lesse then those, that men make at this present, we may well beleue it by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esye of Homer. For although it be very lykely, that he made the thynge more greate than it was after the style Poeticall, for to geue more great lustre or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>autye vnto hys declaratyon: yet were not those same than, so greate, as these in thys present tyme. And that may appere by thys, that of the twelf hundred shyppes, which he reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth, he wryteth that those of the Beotiens caryed euery one, a houndred and twenty men, and they of Philoctete syfty. wyllyng to shew by thys, what the greatest and the lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And also it appereth that all they, whiche were in the shyppes of Philoctete were both warryers and maronners, by that he sayth that they were all men of warre, aswell the maronners, as the other, as he sayth. And also it is to beleue, in so muche that the Kynges and Dukes of the countrey passed the sea wyth theyr puyssance and apparaylle for the sea, that there taryed not many people in the countrey. And also they had not than shyypes couered and stronge, as men haue nowe a dayes. But they were onely small slight shyppes mete for to robbe vpon the sea. And therfor (takyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for meane) betwene the greatest and leaste, he coulde not haue so great nomber of people in them, that men myght saye, that they had bene sente by the common assemblye of all Grece.

Nowe is it very certayne, that after they were arryued, they were the stronger. For elles they of Troye woulde not haue permitted them to close theyr camp vnto the walles. And also they ayded not them selues durynge the siege wyth all the people, that they had brought out. But for faulte of vyctuayles, they were constrained to sende one parte to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure the countreye of Cheronese, and one other parte to robbe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For after that they were myngled together, they coulde not well remoue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, nor drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the one the other. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hope of victory was in them, that fought in the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe castells, rather than in any other thynge. And in effecte they fought more by strengthe and by courage, than by connynge. The fight and conflicte was very great. And the shippes of Athens went to succoure the Corcyrye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where as they sawe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ouercommed, for to feare the ennemyes, and yet they dyd not fyght a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste them, fearyng to disobeye the commaundement of theyr Lordes. So chaunced it, that the Corinthiens that were on the right wynge, were so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged by theyr ennemies, that they toke them self vnto flight and were chased and followed by tenne shyppes of the Corcyryens vntyll the lande, where theyr campe was. and they landed after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in suche sorte, that they toke &amp; pillaged al that, that they found within. and afterwardes set fyer therin.

The Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s than seynge the Corcyryens so ouercharged and put to rebuke, beganne to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure them earnestly and wythout dissymulation. and yet inuaded not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians at the begynnyng. But after that they sawe the Corcyryens in flight, and the other that chased them: they bent them selfe to fyght, and to resiste, the beste that they coulde, wythoute makynge any dyfference of the one, or of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For that, that necessytye requyred it, so that the battaylle remayned betwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Athenyans and the Corynthyans, the Corcyryans beyng in flyght. neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles at the last they were constrayned to wythdrawe them selues after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so the Corinthyans followed the chase. And taried not to bynde, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten to theyr shyppes the barkes of the shyppes that they had beaten downe, nor yet to cause them, that they had taken, to be towed to lande, but in sayling &amp; chasynge, they indeuored themselues more to slaye the ennemyes, then to take them alyue. whiche doyng they slewe many of theyr frendes, that they founde in theyr waye vpon theyr shippes and on the bottomes of them of theyr syde, that had bene dyscomfyted, thinking, that they had bene enemyes. For so great nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of shyppes beynge assembled, aswell on the one syde, as on the other, and all Grekes, after that they were myngled togeder, they knewe not well the one, the other. And they coulde not tell, who were the ouercommers or ouercommed. Also truly, this was the greatest assemblye of shyppes, that euer in tymes paste had bene made of Grekes, agaynst Grekes. After that the Corinthians had had chased the Corcyriens to the entrye of the sea, they dyd retourne to receyue their shippwrackes and shyppes skatered abroade and brused, and also theyr people that were hurte. So they founde a greate nomber whiche they brought vnto the poorte that is oueranempste from the Islande of Sybota in the fyrme lande, which is holy deserte in the regyon of Thesphrotyde, where the straungers that were comme to theyr ayde, dyd tary them on la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de.

some entry into their lande. Nowit was than late and very nyght, and they had nowe begonne to geue token that they woulde fyght. Whan the Corinthians perceyued, a farre of in the sea, twenty shyppes, that the Athenyans hadde sent a freshe vnto the Corcyryans. fearyng that the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, which they sente them furst, were not suffycyent ynough to saue and defende them, lyke as also it chaunced, by occasyon thereof, the Corinthians begonne to take their oores, and by litle &amp; lytle to retourne backe, for that principally, that they knewe not whyther there came a greater nomber after the same that they sawe or not. whereat the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyryens, which coulde not yet see theyr sayd succoure, were all abasshedde, seing theyr ennemyes so to retourne, and coulde not thinke wherfore it was, vntyll that some of theyr people perceyued the sayd twenty shyppes, and signifyed to them, that they came directly vnto them. Then beyng nowe also night, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyryens lykewyse wythdrewe themselues, and in thys manner, hauyng foughte vnto darke night: they departed. And anone after, the sayde twenty shippes, ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at the porte of Leucine where the Corcyryens were wythdrawen, passynge ouer the deade and the broken peces of the shyppes, that were brused &amp; drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. of which twenty shyppes Glauco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of Leager &amp; Andocydes sonne of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogorus had the conducte.<note place="margin">

But hauynge certen knowlayge of them, they receyued them with greate ioye. The morowe after, the thirty shyppes of the Athenyans, wyth them, that were lefte hoole vnto the Corcyryens, wente out of the poorte wyth theyr sayles displayed and came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the porte of Sibota where the Corinthians were, to see yf they would come agayne to battayle. Who, whan they sawe them so to come, departed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the porte into the mayne sea all in good order, and there kepte themself sure on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to defende them, not willing to go to assayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For that, that they feared the sayde shyppes newely comme, which were all freshe and hoole, and theyrs were greatly hurte or empayred at the battayle the day before. and theyr people were busyed to kepe the prysonners that they had taken in the sayde battaile. and also they coulde not refreshe themselues wyth any thynge in the place of Sibota where they were, for that, that it was deserte and barayne. So they cared not, but howe they might honnestly wythdrawe them self into theyr quarter, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng that the Athenyans wolde not suffer them to departe from thence, vnder coulour that they hadde broken the peace, by that, that they came to assayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daye before. So they deuysed to sende vpon a brygantyne some of theyr pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ople towardes the sayde Athenyans, withoute any heraulte, for to espye what they wolde do. Who spake vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this maner.

But before theyr departure, they sett vp theyr Trophee in token of victory in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me lande of Sibota. And after theyr departynge, the Corcyryens gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geder theyr brokenne shyppes, and deade people, whome the wynde, from of the marreys, had in the nyght dryue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the shore of the sea, euen as they aryued. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes they set vp an other Trophee in signe of victory in the Islande of Sibota, directly agaynste that same of the Corinthians. For bothe parties pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to haue had the victory. To wytt the Corinthians for that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they kepte the sea vntyll nyght, and gathered many shipwrackes of the shippes drowned, and also great nomber of their deade people, and further had taken more than a thousande prysonners and drowned aboutes threskoore &amp; tenne shippes with ennemys. And the Corcyryens, for that they had drowned about .xxx. shyppes with ennemys, and gathered together the shipwrackes and theyr deade bodies aswell as they. And moreouer for that the daye followyng, hauing had the new ayde and strengthe of Athenyans, they had offred them battayle, and they durst not marche forwardes, but were retyred.

But the warre was not yet fully declared. so that there was some respitt, for that the questyon was not yet generallye agaynste all the Peloponesians,

And on the other syde, the Agenytes came thyder not publiquely and openly, for they durste not for feare of the Athenyans, but secretely, they perswaded warre, as the other dyd. For that that they complayned, that the Athenyans wolde not suffre them to enioye their lybertye, as it was
appoynted by the sayde treatye of peace. when all the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours of the confederated townes, whiche were comme for thys matter, were arryued at Lacedemonye, the Lacedemonyens assembled theyr counsayle, and caused it to be declared wyth loude voyce, that yf there were any parsonne that pretended to make any complaincte agaynst the Athenyans, he shulde speake publiquely, as the custome was.

For as touchinge the shippes, we hadde lytle lesse than foure houndredde, whych were two partes of the hole armye. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge the Capytayne, we gaue youe Themistocles, whiche was principal author and mouer, that the battaile was made in the discreate of the sea, which without all doubte, was the saufgarde of Grece.

And if our Empier came into other mens handes, we thinke, that they shulde better parceue yt. Althoughe that for this oure boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and gentlenes, we gett more reproche, than prayse. whych is a thinge very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resonable.

And yet in this case they durste not ones haue murmured or grudged, but being our subiectes by wylle, they would haue thought it a great offence to disobey vs. For we see euyde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that the people take it to be more greuous and are more angry, whan they be wronged, than whan they be forced. Also wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speketh to defraude one, or to do hym wrong, it is sayde, that the iustyceys comone: but whan a man speaketh of constrayninge, it is vnderstanded that there is a superiour, vsinge wille. Of this cometh yt, that they, whych presently be our subiectes, whan they were in subiection of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, indured paciently thair Empyre, and now ours semeth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be harde.

For youe do not comunycate your lawes and youre customes to othere. And moreouer whosoeuer is sente by youe to be Duke or Capytayne in any armye, he vseth not other manners, than he was wonted to bifore. Nor such, as all the remenant of Grece doth vse, but by all facyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s doth make strange par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularites and differente fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other. wherfore, lordes, vouchesaulf to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider, that the matters wherof ys question, be waightie and of greate importance. And be well worthy to be longe consulted vpon. And geue not somuche faythe to the connsaille and accusacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the other people, that you take this charge so great, vpon youe. But thinke well before the begynning of thys warre, of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is, and the daungers that may chaunce. For by lengthe or contynuance of warre, happenne many hazardes. From whyche, we yet arne clere, bothe youe and we. But whan it shalbe bigoune, yt is not knowin, vpon whiche of vs they shall fall. Also it is certayne, that they that be to desirous and hasty to begynne warre, do peruerte the order of reasone. For they begynne by execution and by force. whyche shulde be laste, after that it were well consulted. whyche faulte no man shall fynde in vs, and also we see not, that it is yet in youe. For this cause, whiles the thinges be entier and hole, we woll well admonishe youe, that youe take good aduise, nother to breake the peace, nor to falsefie your othe.

And after that the Lacedemonians had harde aswel the complayntes of the Peloponesians, as the declaracyons of the sayde Athenians, they caused them all to go fourthe, and put the matter into deliberacion amonge them selues. So the more parte of them, were of opinion, that the Athenians dyd wronge and that it was expedient to moue war against them wythout longer tariyng.

And if we consyder this same, wherof questyon ys presently had, we shall not take yt to be smalle. For if question were to make warre agaynste the Peloponesians our neighbours, our strength shulde be lyke vnto thairs. For that, that we might leade our armye subdainly agaynste euery of them. But to make warre againste them, that be farre from vs, and that be greatly expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the sea, and fournished habundantly of all thinges necessary, to wytt, of ryches, aswell in particuler, as in comone, of shippes, of horses, of harnnes &amp; of people, asmuche and more, than any othere cytie of Grece, and also haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer many allyes, trybutours vnto them, howe shulde we enterpryse yt or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what hope?

For if the question be of an armye by sea, we arne much more weake tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they, so be we of siluer, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we haue none in general, nor meane to recouer it by and by, of particulars.

And also we may not afterwardes departe with oure honnoure frome warre, specyally beinge thauthours of yt. And we oughte not to hope that by hauynge pyllaiged and wasted thaire landes, we haue the sonner fynished the warre. But I feare rather that in this doing, we leue yt vnto oure children. For it is not to bileue that the Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s haue to small harte, that for seing thair ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytorie wasted, that they woll render them subiectes vnto vs, or that they be so afrayde of warre, as if they did not knowe what it is. And yet notwithstandinge I am not so destytute of wytte that I woll counsaile youe to suffer your frendes &amp; allies to be iniuryed. And that youe cause not the wronge and deceytes of the sayd Athenyans to be parceyued. But I saye truly that youe ought not yet, to take armure and make warre agaynste them. But youe shulde sende towardes them, and sommon them to do right. Shewinge them, that we be not minded to suffre suche thinges. And that rather we woll fyght, than indure them, wythout alwayes to shewe that we be to soore chased to beginne the warre. And in the meane tyme, we maye prepare our case, drawinge to our amytie newe people, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Grekes, as straungers from all parties. Whereby we maye haue ayde of shippes and of monney. For yt is lawfull for them, that by thaire allyes be euill

handeled, (as we be by the Athenyans) to take allyaunce, and to make amytie with all people, for to saulfe and to kepe thaire estate. And also we maye in the meane tyme assemble oure particuler forces. And if they obey vnto the deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des that our Ambassadours shall make vnto them, it shalbe a right good thing. And if they do it not, we shall haue, (by puttinge this practique in vse) two or thre yeares space, for to fournishe vs of that, that ys nedefull. And we may after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, if we thinke good, begynne the warre.

For that, shall cause questyon for to determyne, how they shal saue thair goodes, bifore they be pilledged by thair ennemys. And I do thynke, that we shulde repute and holde that same thair territorye (so long as it shall be entier in thair handes) as for a sure hostage or pledge.

But we haue the prudence to thinke, that the fantasie of men that arne not exceadynge farre from vs, ys lyke vnto ours, and that the hazardes of warre be not compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in narrations of many woordes. Wherfore we ought alwayes to geue order to our busynes in effecte, and not by woordes, and to presuppose that we haue to do with suche ennemys, as vse good counsell.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion myne aduyse is, that we shall sende towardes the Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for to shew them declarations touchynge Potyde, and the other complaynctes &amp; querells, that arne made agaynste them.

               <p>TRuly, lordes, I cannot vnderstande, what the Athenyans will to say by the longe talke, wherwith they haue kepte vs here, for they haue done nothinge but highly praised and sett fourth thair puyssance and thair dedes, without excusinge themselfe in any manner of the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and oultrages, that they haue done to oure allyes and to hole Peloponese.

And it is not nedefull that any man teach vs, how we shulde consulte and deliberate in this case, seing that we be thus oultraged. For it is for them, that are mynded to wronge other, conuenyent, to make thies longe consultations. And therefore, lordes Lacedemonyans, iudge manfully and declare warre, in shewynge and defendinge youre dygnitie and maiestye Spertayne. And suffre ye not, that the Athenyans make theirs more greate, nor to destroy oure allyes. But hauinge the goddes to helpe vs, lette vs warre againste them, that do iniurie vs. After that Stenelaides hadde thus spoken, he sayde and ordonned that the matter shulde be putte into deliberation of the counsayle, to be determyned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greater voyce.

and there kepte thair winter. The wynter passed, they all departed frome Helles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponte, the countrey beynge habandoned of the strangers, and the Athenyans wente to take agayne thair wyues chyldren and moueables that were in the cyties, wherin they had bestowed them to be kept, at the begynning of the warre. After, they retourned vnto Athenes, &amp; determyned to make agayne and buylde thair walles of the towne, the more parte wherof were beaten downe. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse the howsen. some of them in very small nomber resarued. whiche the chiefe of the straungers had kepte for to lodge in. Whyche thinge vnderstandynge the Lacedemonyans, they sente thair Ambassadours to empesche and lette them to doyt. Aswell for that, that they not wyllingly did see, that they nor other shulde haue walles to thair townes, as also at the instigatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thair allyes, that feared the puyssance of the same Athenyans, seing that they had a muche more greate nomber of shippes, that at begynning of the warre. And that sens the same, they had conceyued a great audacytie. So the sayd Ambassadours requyred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they wolde not make agayne thair walles, but rather plucke downe all those of the other townes, that were out of Peloponese, that remayned hole. And yet not withstandynge did not declare vnto them the cause that moued them to make this requeste: but shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that it was for feare that if they made again thair sayd walles, &amp; the straungers shulde retourne, they shulde haue an other place to receyue them, wherin they myght warre agaynste them, as they did than in the cytie of Thoebes, whyche they did holde. For they sayde, that Peloponese was a place sure and defensible, suffycie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the retreate of all the Grekes. Whan the Athenyans had harde this Ambassade, they aunswered that they wolde short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sende of thair people to Lacedemonye for to make them aunswere. And with this answere sent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again incontynently.

And after that he had shewed them this, and what he intended to do, he went to Lacedemonye. At whyche place beynge aryued, he went not to the officers, nor to the counsel in many dayes.

For all hys entente was principally, to the affayres of the sea.

               <p>IT nedeth not more, Lordes Peloponesia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to blame nor charge the Lacedemonyans, that they wyll not enterpryse warre agaynste the Athenyans, consyderynge that they haue assembled vs here, for thys cause. Also it is reasonable, that they, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouerne (as they be preferred to honnours before all the other) that they haue such regarde to thaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres of particulers in generall, that all may be egally gouerned and enterteig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But as touchyng vs and other, which lately be departed from the Atheny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it is no more nedefull, to admonish vs, to beware of them. But onely they must be admonyshed, that dwell in the meane lande farre from the sea portes, where be the feares &amp; staples of marchandyses. For it is very nedefull that they vnderstande, that yf they geue not ayde and succour to them which dwell in the base countreys nighe the sea, the fatchyng of theyr goodes and of theyr marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And herefor is it, that thys present consultacyon is made, aswell for them, as for the other. For thys cause, they oughte not to be nyece and negligent to enterpryse this warre, for to haue afterwardes peace. For as it is conuenyent, for graue &amp; prudent people, to lyue in peace and reste, whan they be not wronged, and that no violence is done vnto them: Euen so it is conuenient, for vertuous and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragyous people, to tourne peace into warre, whan they be oultraged. And after that they haue wel prouyded for theyr affayres, to come agayn to peace &amp; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de. And nother to be proud for the prosperitie of the victorye, nor also, for couety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se of peace and of reste, to suffre the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self to be oultraged. For he, that for to muche loue of reste, is nyce, &amp; not forcinge to reuenge him self, parceyueth hym selfe very sone depryued of the voluptuousnes, that he taketh of the reste. Also that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, that hath oftentymes good aduentures in warre, forgetteth hym selfe by vnassured and vnfaythfull fiercenes and crueltie, in suche sorte that he thinketh not what he ought to do. For oftentymes, foolyshe enterpryses chaunce well, for that, that the ennemyes dyd conducte theyrs, more folyshly. And also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye enterpryses, that semed, to haue ben well begonne, haue myshappened. For that, that the thynges in suche matter be neuer executed in the sorte, that they were purposed vpon. Also men haue alwayes good and certayne hope of thynges to comme, that they do enterpryse. But whan it cometh to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te them, they fayle oftentymes, for feare. Nowe as touchyng vs, who haue bene greatly oultraged by the Athenyans, we purchase and enterpryse warre against them vpon good and iuste quarell, to the intent to lyue alwayes in peace and reste, after, that we shall haue ben reuenged of them. Of the which warre, we oughte to hope to haue the victory for many reasons. The furste for that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue greater nomber of people, and better warryours, than they haue. And the other for that we be all, wyth one wyll, delyberated to do that, which
<pb facs="tcp:18267:41"/>
shalbe commaunded vs. And for that, that they arne more mighty with ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes than we, we woll supplye to that, aswell so much of our particuler monney, that we woll furnyshe euery one for hys rate a portion, as also of the Syluer, which is in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Delphos, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same of Olimpus, which we may coigne. And by that meanes, we shall easely w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawe &amp; reteigne their maronniers &amp; also theyr men of warre, which be more straungers and mercenaries or huyred soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours, than borne in that countrey. which thing is otherwyse with vs. For we be more mighty of people, than of monneye. And
yt we maye haue the victorye ouer them, it is to beleue, that they shalbe discomfyted. And also, howe much the more longer that they resiste, so muche the more our people shall exercyse &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self to the sea. And so muche, as they be people of more harte, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theirs, whan that they shall haue ben exercysed, they shalbe alwayes more strong. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hardynes that ours haue, cometh vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature. which the other may not acquyre or get, nother by arte nor by learnynge. But we maye well by exercyse acquyre the industrie or trauayle, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue, more than we, and also we shall fynde moneye ynough for to fournyshe thys affayre. For yf theyr allyes refuse not to paye them trybute for to be in theyr seruytude and subiectyon, we shall not be so wretched, that we refuse to contrybute with theirs, goodes for to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge vs of oure ennemyes, and to saue oure lybertye. For also, whan they shall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue taken them from vs, they woll intreate vs worse by cause of our goodes. We haue on the other parte many other meanes to make warre agaynste them. The furst is, that we woll practyse theyr allyes and subiectes, and woll cause them to rebelle agaynste them, and by thys meane we woll cause them to lose the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, that they haue more than we. Also we maye destroy theyr countreys and territoryes, whereby monney groweth vnto them, and many other occasyons &amp; meanes maye happen to vs, wherof we nowe take no aduyse. For there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer warre made holy by the meanes, and accordyng to the preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was deuysed from the begynnynge, but of it self, it causeth others to comme to the vnderstandyng of men, accordynge to the accydentes and chaunces, whiche do occurre and happen. And in that, they, that haue most hygh and entier courage, be in greater suertie, than they which be in sadnes and in feare. And euery one of vs ought to thincke and imagyne, that yf he had questyon of hys lymites or boundes wyth hys neyghbours, that were as myghtye as he, that he woulde not suffre hym selfe to be oultraged.

So they were all of opynyon to make warre, whyche was by them concluded and determined. But there was no meane at that tyme to begynne yt, for they were vnprouyded of all thinges. For thys cause, it was deuysed that euery one of the sayde cyties shulde contry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.

After that Pausanias had receyued the said lettres, notwithstanding that he was in great reuerence w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the Grekes, for the charge &amp; authoritie that he had, he toke much more great hart &amp; greater audacytie.

by the Lacedemonyens, and after he came not againe to Sparte, but withdrew himself into certayne villages of Troade. And being there, it was signefied vnto the Lacedemonyens that he treated w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Barbarous or strangers, some euille matter, so they thought it good no more to dissymule. And sent a sargeant with his mace from one of the Tribuns of the people, whome they calle Ephores. whoe gaue hym in commaundemente that he shulde incontynently come to Sparte as faste, as he,, and not to departe from his company, vpon payne to be reputed rebelle &amp; ennemy of the cytie. And mynding not to make himselfe more suspected, hopinge also by monney to iustefye and purge him from crymes, that were layde vpon him, wente to Sparte with the sayde sargeaunte. But fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with as he was arryued, he was putt in prysone by ordenance of the sayd Epho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. Who haue auctorytie to cause to be brought thider, the kinge hymselfe. Yet he came fourth incontynently by meane of certayne, whome he had corrupted by monney, &amp; came to present himselfe to the counsell, ready to make aunswere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that wolde charge him. Nowe neither the Citezeins nor his ennemys had no apparant wytnes or accusation for to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pne nor punishe him. Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially beinge a man of the lignage of kynges, and also of greate dygnite and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacion. For he had bene tutor of Plistarcus,<note place="margin">Plistar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note> sonne of kinge Leonydes, and in hys name had, as tutor, the admynistration of his roialme. Howebeit the insole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and fiercenes of his lyfe, and that he folowed in many thynges, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of strangers, made him muche suspected to haue intelligence with them, &amp; to Imagine some thinge to rule amonge them, that were hys. And consideringe many thinges that he had done against the lawes and customes of the cyte, they made yt a great matter amongeste other, for that, that beinge in the temple of Delphos, through a maruaillous audacite &amp; arrogancye, he wrott in a table of brasse, whyche the Grekes hadde there offredde of the spoille of the Medes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne verses of this substance. After that the Duke of the Grekes, had descomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the army of Medes, Pausanias gaue this offeringe to Phebus. which verses, the Lacedemonyens caused incontynently to be taken awaye, and to be defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And caused to be put in place of that, that Pausanyas attrybuted only thys glory vnto hymselfe, the name of all the cytes confederated, whiche had bene at the battaile against the strangers. And furthermore, he was charged and accused of an other matter, which sarued better to the present accusation. That is, that he had as some sayde, made greate secrete treaties and coniurations with the prisonners of the cytie, promysinge to geue them lybertie, and to make them Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tezeins, if they wolde ryse in armure wyth hym, and wolde do that, whyche he wolde commaunde them. whiche was a true matter. But yet it was not lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to iudge agaynste him by accusation of prysonners, accordinge to the lawes. By whiche it was prohybited to procede to any execution diffinitiue agaynste any Cytezeine of Sparte, without vndoubtfull and certayne wytnes and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. So it chaunced in thies procedinges, as it is sayde, that one his domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call seruante of the cytie of Argille, whom he had abused carnally in his yougth whyche was that same, that had charge to tary to Artabasus the laste lettres, that that same Pausanias had wryttone to the kynge Xerres, came to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the case vnto the Ephores. And the occasion, wherfore he did it, was for a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he had, bicause that he had sene none of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other messengers, that the same Pausanias had sente vnto the sayd Artabasus, retourne agayne. Wherfore fearynge that it shulde myschaunce him, he caused to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeate the seale, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the letters were sealed, that he might seale them agayne after that he hadde redde them, if he founde therin nothynge of that, whyche he had fantased, and to
<pb facs="tcp:18267:44"/>
the intent also that the sayd Artabasus shulde not parceyue that they had bene opened. Hauinge than openned and redde theym, he founde amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that, wherof he doubted. That is, that by the same, Pausanias did write to Artabasus, that he shulde slaye him. whiche he incontyne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly brought to the said Ephores. wherby they were greatly instructed accordinge to thair imagination, that they hadde agaynste the sayd Pausanias. But yet the better to knowe the trouthe, they wolde gladly vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de it by his mouthe, and so did vse this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tele. They founde meane, that the sayd seruant came to render himselfe within the temple or place of Tenarus, as one man, that hath offended his maistre. And putteth him into franchise or sanctuary. And did him to vnderstande, that he came thider to speake with him. whiche thing he did. And on the other syde two of the Ephores were hidde within a very secrett place, so that they might heare and vnderstande all that, whiche Pausanias and his seruant saide togither, with out beinge perceyued. Pausanias beinge than come to his man, and hauinge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him what was the cause, for whyche he had putt him into franchise, he declared to hym that he had opened the letters, and shewed him all the tenour, lamentinge hymselfe for that, that by the same, his sayd maistre had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded hym to be slayne, notwithstandinge that in all the treaties that he had hadde with the kinge, wherin he trusted in hym, he neuer founde in hym faulte, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he thought it vnreasonable that he had ordeyned that he shulde be slayne. As the other messengers had bene, whome he had sent thider bifore, which were but commune people. Wherunto Pausanias aunswered, confessinge the whole to be true, and yet went about to appayse and kepe him, that he shulde not take it angrely, swerynge to hym by the temple, where he was, that he wolde neuer do hym harme. And prayinge hym that he wolde with all diligence goo towardes the sayd Artabasus, to the intente that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter were not empesched. All which thynges the sayde Ephores, hauinge well vnderstanded, and by this meane, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge the case to be very true and well wytnessed, did ordeyne that the said Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanias shulde be apprehended within the cytie. But as the two Ephores came alongest the strete agaynste hym, he perceyued by the countenance of the one, and by the token, that the other, that was hys frend, made vnto him, that they came to take hym. And so he ranne awaye for to gett the temple of Pallas, bifore that they might take him. But bifore that he came to the sayd temple, withdrawing himselfe into a litle house whiche was therunto adioigninge, for to haue repoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself a litle, he was ouertaken by them, that folowed hym. Who descoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the toppe of the same house, and lett kepers to the gates, in suche sorte, that he coulde not comme fourth. But he was kepte there so longe, that he dyed for hunger. But bifore that he gaue vp the ghoste, they, that kepte hym, seinge that he dyed, dyd drawe hym oute of that place whyche was halowed, euen so beinge in a traunse, as he was. Who incontynently dyed bitwene thair handes. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deathe, the Ephores were of opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to caste him into a great caue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were caste all the cariong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But a certayne tyme after, by reuelation and aunswere of the god Apollo of Delphos, they were commaunded that they shulde take hym out of the sayd pytte and shulde bury hym in the place where he yelded vp the ghoste. whiche thinge they did. And yet at this present day, the sepulcre may be sene bifore the temple, lyke as appeareth by the letters that be grauen in the stone of the sepulture. And moreouer they were commaunded by the oracle of the god, that, for to purge the sacrilege that they had committed by violating of

And the remedy is that thou suffre not any of them that be in the ship to go fourth, but kepe them here at ancre vntill we haue winde for to departe. whiche thinge the patrone graunted him, and laye at ancre a daye and a nyghte.

But I dyd him much more saruyce afterwardes, whan yt was laufull for me to do yt. For he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden vnto me for his retourne, which was right daungerous. And this said he, for that, that after that Xerxes had lost the battaille by sea at Salamyne, that same Themistocles wrott vnto him that he shulde haste to retourne, fayninge that it was enterprised to breake the bridges where he shulde retourne, and that he had empesched it.

               <p>THough that I knowe, lordes Athenyans, that men make not warre with that same ardor &amp; desire, that they enterprise yt, but accordinge to the cases that happenne, do change thair wylle: yet I contynue stil in my opynyon, not to geue place to the Peloponesians. For I do see this, wherof we must presently determyne, like &amp; approchinge vnto that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I haue had opynyon bifore this tyme. wherfore I thinke it a thinge reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they amonge youe, that shalbe of my aduyse, if there chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce herafter any myschance against the comon opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people, that they ought than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse it. And if it happen well (as we do hope) not to iudge it thair prudence for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is so chaunced. For it is commonly sene, that the chaunse of thinges to comme, be as vncertayne, as thoughtes of men, which ys the reason, wherby if any thing, vnloked for, do chaunse vs, we accuse fortune.

And so posses by thys meane that, whyche we holde alway in feare. For into as great bondage &amp; subiection a man putteth himselfe by obeyinge to the comaundement of his Egalls &amp; neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours without any iudgement, in a small matter, as in a great. And if yt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that we come to warre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one against the other, euery w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all his power, there ys great apparance for him that woll naroly consider all thinges, that we shuld not haue the woorse.

men &amp; labourers, who haue no monney in general &amp; veray litle in particuler. And also they haue not experyence of longe warres, &amp; specially of those, that be made by sea. And euen whan they haue any warre amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe, they may not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue it long, by cause of thair pouertie. And if there be question to send to the sea, they haue no meane to replenishe thair shippes with men, nor yet to sende out a puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sante armye by lande. For that, that by that meane they shulde eloigne or absent themselfe fro thair domesticall affayres and shulde lose thair exercise and ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of lyuinge. And furthermore youe knowe that warre ys more susteigned by ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ready monney, than by violent exactions. Nowe if we occupye or kepe the sea, they woll be more ready, being ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy craft people &amp; labourers, to sarue w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thair bodies, than with mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ney. Hoping that they may alwayes saue thair bodies fro dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers of the warre, where they cannot excuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe to contribute to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of it, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it shall be bigon vntil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time that it shalbe acheued &amp; ended. And for to speke of thinges passed, the Peloponesians haue bene egall to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes in one onely battayle, but throughly to contynue warre, they haue not bene like vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wer better prouided, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they. For that they vse not one only cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saille, but many. By occasyon whereof, that, whyche they haue to do, they do yt soubdaynely. And though they be much different of faculties, of power and of all other thynges, yet euery one man hath his opynyon, aswell the one, as the othere, and euery man tendereth his particuler proufytte, whereby it comethe not comonly, that any thynge ys done, that auaylethe. For if some be safly inclyned to fyght wyth any, and to ronne hym ouer, the other feare greatly to spende thair particuler good. And furthermore, for somuche as they come euyll willingly to thair common assembles, they determyne in a momente of tyme of thair generall affayres, and employe the more parte of tyme, to thair pryuate busynes. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of them thynkethe that the comon wealthe shall not be endommaged by his absence, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shall haue some ther, that shal do somuch for him, as if he were there. And by thys meane hauynge euery man thys opynyon towardes hymselfe, they parceyue not, that the common wealthe perishethe by them all togyders. And if at any tyme they delyberate to attende thereunto diligentely and at lengthe, they cannot for lacke of monney. And yet the affayres of warre nede no longe deliberations. And we must not feare thair edifices nor thair ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye by sea. For as touchinge the edifices or buyldinges, though that they were in peace, yet shulde yt be very harde for them to make a towne so stronge, as thys here, and therfore they shal make yt much lesse in time of warre. And spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyally there, where we shall make oure rampares and munytyons to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. And whan nowe they shall make agaynste vs a towne firmed or closed with walles, and that they shall strengthe yt with people, yt ys true that they maye endomage vs aswell in makynge courses and pillage in some places of our land, as in drawing to thair party some of our subiectes, yet by thair buildinges they shall not defende, that we go not into thair lande by sea, wherin we arne moste stronge. And also we haue by our contynuel excercise in the sea, more experience in the warre that ys made by lande, than they haue by vsage of the lande warre, in the fight or battayle by sea. To the whiche they cannot easely appoyncte nor frame themselues to be experte. For we ourselfe that haue contynuelly vsed this crafte, sens the warre of the Medes, be not therin parfaictly instructed. How shal they than do it, that were accustomed to laboure the lande, and not to trauaile the sea. And on the other parte, by hauinge contynually a great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of shippes, laying watche for them, we shal kepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> well fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accustomyng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to that busines, &amp; fro doing any thing of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

perceyuinge that they were so fewe people, they deuysed, that they might easelye defeate and ouercome them, yf they set vpon them. So they determined to assay it. For they departed agaynste theyr wyll from the allyance of the Athenyans.

Afterwardes they tourned theyr charettes ouerthwart the stretes, for to serue them for rampartes, and made all other prouysyons, suche as they thought reasonable and conuenyent according to the tyme. And after that they had ordeyned theyr case, accordyng as they had hadde leasure, and made more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer watche all that nyght, aboutes one houre before daye, they yssued oute of theyr houses, and came to sett vpon the Thebayns. altogeders that yet were in the sayde market.

For seyng that they were deceyued of theyr thoughte, and that they were assaulted, they dyd furste ioygne themself all together. and parforced ones or twies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues all with one strength for to passe through some strete, but they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes dryuen backe.

And so they were empesched for to saue them, by those, that pursued them, whereby many were slayne. By this chiefly, that one of the citezeins came to the gate wherein they were entred, whiche onely was open and dyd shut it, castynge the shalte of a dart ouerthwarte the locke in stede of a barre. So that they coulde not passe fourth that waye, and so, some mounted v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the walles, and threwe themselfe from a hyghe, downe to the grounde, the more parte of whome dyed. Some other came to haue passed at an other gate, wherat there was no warde, and with a hatchet that a woman deliuered them, brake the locke and yssued fourthe. But there coulde not passe any greate no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, for that, that the thynge was incontynently knowen. The other were beaten donne in the stretes. But the greater parte and chyefly those, that were wygned togeders, came to rushe into a greate edifyce or house which was wignyng to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles of the towne, wherof they founde, by chaunse of aduenture, the dore ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thynkyng that it was one of the gates of the towne, and that they myght saue themself by the same. And than the cytezeins, seing that they al were closed with in, were in dyfference, whyther they shulde set it in fyer for to burne them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, or that they shulde cause them to dye of an other sorte. But fynally they there, and all the other that were yet wythin the towne, rendred themself wyth theyr armure to the wille of the cytezeins. Durynge that these thynges were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the cytye of Platee, the other Thebayns, that shulde with a greate bende haue folowed all the nyght, those, that were furste entred, for to succour them, yf it were nede, had in theyr waye newes, how they were assayled.

For there is frome Thebes to Platee .lxx. stades, and the great rayne that was fallen that nyght, had greately kepte them backe. For the ryuer of Asopus,<note place="margin">The ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Asopus</note> which they must passe, was by cause of the sayd rayne not easy

So they deuysed amonge them to take the paysans of Platee, that were without the cytie (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there was a great nomber) together with a great quantyte of beastes and of moueables, for that, that there were yet no newes of warre, to thintent to buy agayne (by meane of those there that they shulde take) them of theyr people, that were yet within the towne, and that were lyuynge. And they being in thys dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, the Plateans which greatly doubted the selfe thynge, sente with dyly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a herault vnto them. Shewynge that they had done nought, to go aboute durynge the peace, soubdaynely to take theyr cytye. And neuertdeles to shewe &amp; denounce vnto them, that yf they dyd any euyll to theyr citezeins that were in the feldes, they wolde slaye all them that they had prysonners in the towne, but yf they departed oute of theyr lande wythout doynge anye harme, they wolde render them vnto them in lyfe. and thervpon they made theyr othe, as the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayns dyd saye. But the Plateans saye, that they promysed them not symplye for to render them the sayde prysonners incontynently, but onely, yf they agrede with them, after that they had spokenne together, and that wythoute makynge any othe. But howe so euer it was, the Thebayns dyd retourne into theyr citye, without doyng any euyll in the terrytory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Plateens. And yet those Platee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s dyd incontynently w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawe the persones, &amp; the goodes that they hadde in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. And after caused the prysonners that they hadde to dye, which were about nyne skoore. Among whom was Eurymachus, who admynystred the practyse of the trahyson. And thys done, they rendred vnto the Thebayns, theyr deade men, and fournyshed theyr cytye wyth that, that they thought necessarye for the tyme. The Athenyans, whan they had harde what was done at Platee, gaue order to cause to be takenne all the Beotians that were founde in the countreye of Athenes. And fourthwyth sente towardes the Plateens a trompet to defend or commaunde them that they shulde do no euyll nor dyspleasure to them that they had prysonners, vntyl suche tyme, as it were deuysed, what shulde thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be done. For they were not yet aduertised that they were slayne, for that, that the furst messenger, that came vnto them, departed frome Platee at the begynning, as the Thebayns were entred, the seconde after that they were vainquyshed and taken, and than they sente theyr trompett. Who whan he was arryued, founde that the prysonners were all slayne. Anone after, the Athenyans came thyder with theyr armye or hoste, and brought corne for to victuayle the towne. And w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that, lefte there a good garnysone of men of warre, and ledde away with them, women, chyldren, and other people vnmete for the defence.</p>

And many there were, that were dyspleased, and not well contented wyth the Athenyans. Some for that theyr empyre was taken from them, and the other fearynge to come into theyr subiectyon.

And that parte of the cytye, that is aboue the castell in the hyghest parte of the towne, is yet at thys daye by the Athenyans called the cytye, for memory of the antiquite.

By reasone wherof, it was very greuous and not easye for them to drawe into the towne.

And on the other parte, it greaued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> greatly and was molestuous, that they shuld leaue theyr temples and theyr particular Goddes, whiche they hadde in the vyllages and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And also it was mete for them to leue and chaunge all theyr manner of lyuynge. Whereby in effecte it semed vnto euerye of them by departynge from theyr vyllages, that they habandoned theyr citie. And after that they were come wythin the cytye, there were veray fewe that had houses.

And also there were that lodged themself wythin the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple named Pelasgeque, which was all aboue the olde cytie, though that it were not laufull to dwell there, lyke as it was conteygned in the ende of a verse of an aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of Apollo Delphicque. whiche sayde in thys manner.

For the calamytie chaunced not to the cytye, for that, that the temple was prophane by the habitacyon of the people, as some woll vnderstande it, but to the contrarye the necessytye to dwell there, came through the calamyte of the warre. For the oracle of the Godde, foreseynge the warre that shulde comme, shewed before, that whan men shulde inhabyt there, it shulde not be for any goodnes.

And committed the charge of the said armye to Euphamydes,<note place="margin">Eupha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mydas</note> sonne of Aristomynus to Tymoxenus,<note place="margin">Timox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus.</note> sonne of Tymocrates, and to Eumachus,<note place="margin">Euma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus.</note> sonne of Chrisis. who beinge come by sea to the sayd cytie, sett the same Euarchus within yt. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced and aduaunced themselfe in that voyage, to subdue certayne townes of Acharnanie, whiche were alongest the sea. But parceyuynge that they coulde not do yt, they retourned fromthence, &amp; passinge by, bifore the Isle, they landed nigh to the cytie of Cranye, thinking to take yt by composition. But they of the towne fayninge to intreate with them, came to assayle them, beinge vnprouyded, and dyd slay one parte of them, and the other were constrayned to retyre into theire barques, and to retourne into thair countrey. That selfe same wynter, the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans,<note place="margin">The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall &amp; publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies in Athenes</note> followynge the auncyent vsage of the cytie, made thair publique or ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne obiites or obsequies for them, that were deade in that same warre. And they were made in this manner. Thre dayes bifore, there was made a greate taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle, within the whiche, was putt the boones of them, that were dead, and their parentes &amp; frendes might laye vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what they thought good. Afterwards, euery lignage of the towne or trybe, had a great coffer of Cypres. Into whiche they did putt the boanes of them, that were dead of that trybe, and they dyd ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that same cofer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a charrett. And after all the cofres, was caryed vpon an other charrett, a great bedde ready made, beinge hooly voyde, whyche represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them that were dead, whose bodyes coulde not be founde. And the sayd Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryottes were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted and acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panyd by all sortes of people, Citezeins or other, (those, that wold co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me) vntill the sepulcre, wherat were the wyues and parentes of the deade, makinge greate weapinges and Lamentacyons. And afterwardes they dyd putt all the sayde cofres in a publique graue or monument made for that purpose in the fayrest suburbe of the cytie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same sepulcre or graue is called Ceramico<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherin was accustomed to be buryed all they, that were dead in thair warres, reserued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were slayn in Marathone. To who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of their singuler vertue, they wylled to make a particuler sepulcre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the self place.

And afterwardes, euery man departed. In this manner, the Atheny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans buryed them, that dyed in theire warres, so often, as the chaunce happened.

               <head>¶ The funerall declaration of Pericles. ☞The .vii. Chapter.</head>
               <p>MAny of them, that haue herebifore declared in this place, greatly haue praysed this custome to reasonne and speake bifore all the people in the praise of them, that were dead. But it semeth to me, to be ynough, to declare by deedes, the honnours and the prayses of theym, that by high actes haue meryted them, as youe haue sene, that hathe bene done in this present solempnyte of publique funeralls. And that men shulde not commyt to the discretion of one only man, the vertues and prayse of so many valyant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nother yet bileue that, whiche he therin sayde, were yt good or euyll. For it is a thinge very harde and difficile, to kepe the meane and reasone in speakinge of suche thinges, wherof skarcely may be hadde a certayn opynyon, of the trouthe. For if that he, that heareth it spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath knowlaige of the dede, and loueth him, of whome is spokenne, he thinketh alwayes that there is lesse spoken, than ought to be. And that he willed not. And by the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, vnto him, that hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laige, it semeth for enuie that he hath, that all that, whiche is spoken of an other more further, than his oune strengthe, and vertue can atteigne to, ys withoute trouthe. For that, that euery man thinketh that none shulde prayse nor esteme an other more, than himselfe, and if a man passe further, he is enuied and in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge bileued. But sithens it hath bene approued and allowed of a longe tyme, that it ought to be this done, it becommeth me, obeynge to the lawe, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate &amp; apply my speking to the opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; wille of euery one of you, the most y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I maye, begynnyng to prayse our auncesters and progenitours, for that, that it is a thinge raisonnable and honneste to render in this place, this honnour, for the memory and recordation of them, that furst inhabited and peopled this region. And from hande to hande, by thair vertue, haue lefte &amp; delyuered yt, vnto thaire discent, franke and free, vntill this present daye. And if they herefore be worthy of prayse, our fathers whiche came after, be yet more worthy, who aboue that, that thair auncyentes hadde lefte vnto them, haue acquyred and added, by thaire la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and vertues, all the empire and seignyory, that we presently do holde. And yet, aboue them, there in we that be lyuynge, specyally in competente aage, haue incresed and amplefyed it, and also haue prouyded and fournished our cytie with all thinges, that be necessary aswell for peace, as also for warre. And yet I intende not to reherce the great prowesse and valyauntnes, that we and our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters haue vsed, in defending vs, aswell agaynst the straungers, as againste the Grekes that haue warred vpon vs. By meanes wherof, we haue acquired &amp; got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonne all our landes and lordeshipps, For I wil not be prolixe in those thinges, whiche youe do all knowe. But after that I shall haue declayred, by what witt, by what industry and laboure, and by what arte, our empyre hath bene establis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and augmented, I wyll come to the prayse of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heare, of whome, we haue to speke. For that, that it semeth to me, not to be without purpose, to remember at this presente, thies thinges, and that yt shall not be vnprofytable to all them, that be here present, be they originall cytezeins or inhabitantes. For we haue the rule of a publique weale, whiche folowith not the lawes of cyties nighe vnto it, but we geue rather lawe and exemple vnto other, the whiche we followe not. Also our gouernment ys called Democrotie, whiche ys not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a fewe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but for many. By reasonne wherof, euery of vs, of what qualitie that he be,
<pb facs="tcp:18267:56"/>
(prouyded that he haue some qualitie of vertue) hathe asmuche righte to come to honnors of the cytie, as the other. And it is not regarded of what house, nother of what parte of Citezeins, he is, but onely what vertue he hath. for what poore man it may be, or of what rase or distente, howe vyle or vnknowen that it be, so that he maye proffytte the common wealthe, he is not impesched to haue charge and publique office. We procede furthermore, franquely and symply to the feates of the comon wealthe, and to thaffayres and ymagynations, that we haue euery daye wyth oure neyghbours withoute mouinge ourselfe, or beinge angry, if any of them reioyse of any violence, that they haue done vs. And there as they reioyse, we kepe an irreprehensible seueritie, dissimulinge oure heuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And neuerthelas we ioyefully comunycate our particuler goodes. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge them, that appertaigne to the comon wealthe, we do not mysuse them, aswell for feare of the officers, as of the lawes. And chiefly of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that be made or arne to make, to helpe them, that haue bene deceyued, whyche bringe a many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feste infamye v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of the other parte we haue many things for to refreshe and recreate the sprittes, that be trauailed by labours, to wytt, the playes and holly exercises, and the yearely sacrifices, whiche be made with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and plaisant apparaile, through delectation wherof, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he heuynes and malen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coly of the people ys abolished and lessened. Furthermore men do bringe hither for the greatenes of the cytie, from all landes and countreys, all soortes of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, so that we vse not, more of the goodes that increas and growe in our land, than of them, that be growen in other countreys. And as touching the mylitary or warly excercises, that be done in the cytie, we be different from our ennemys. Forsomuche as we make and suffer our cytie comon to all people. And forbydde not any persone, be he cytezeine or straunger, to take yt or to biholde that, which he thinketh good. For our thinges be not hyd or kept secrett, though that they might proffitt the ennemys, whan they see them. Also we haue not somuch affy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in our apparaile for warre, nor in our subtelties a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d cawtels, as in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of our hartes, which we may alwayes shewe in all affaires. And though that we lyue more at our ease, than many other, which fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beginning of their yougth excercise themselfe in learninges incessantly vntill they be made men, yet we be not for that, lesse hardy and ready for to experymente all daungers, whan it is nedefull. And that may wel be knowin by thys, that the Lacedemonyans alone, durst not enter into our land without they were acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paignied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all their allyes. And yet we, wythoute ayde of other, be entred into the lande of our neighbours, and also haue right often, without great difficultie subdewed them, that defended themselfe very well in thair howses. And yet neuer none of the ennemys durste aduenture themself to resiste oure foorce, whan we haue bene altogiders. Aswell for the experyence and exercise, that we haue in the sea, as for the men of warre that we holde in dyuers places. And if our ennemys haue any tyme the victory againste any bende of our people in one of the sayd countreis, they auaunte them selfe that they haue vainquished vs all. And lykewyse if they be defeated by any of the said be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, they say y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, that was done by vs all. And in infect, we loue more reste, whan we be not constrayned by any necessitie vnto trauaile: than to be, in contynuall labours. And to exercise vs in good manners and comon wealthes, rather than to lyue alwayes in feare of lawes. For also it is beste, not to serche the myseries and myschaunces, vntill that they happenne, and whan it is tyme to enter therin, to shewe, that we go therunto, as bolde, as those, that be always in the busynes. Yet may this cytie be had in admyration, in one thinge, aswell as in all the other, that is, that we vse with our allyes, an honneste &amp; meane socyetie
<pb n="lv" facs="tcp:18267:56"/>
and fellishypp. And on the othere parte, we play the Philosopher, that is to saye, that we indure pouertie, without losinge the harte to gett goodes: and vse riches, more for the commodyte, whan it is tyme: than for Pompe and for glory. And there is noone, that holdeth it for shame, to confesse his pouertie, but wel rather, not to parforce himselfe, for to exchue it. Further, there is none, that hath not care aswell for the comon affaires, as for his owne particuler. In suche manner, that those, which be occupyed in their pryuate busynes, haue not therfore lesse know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laige of the estate of the comon wealthe. For we haue that for synguler, that he, whyche hath no knowlaige of the comon wealthe, we repute him not onely to be slouthful and necligent, but also we take him not, for a cytezein. we also alone, iudge the causes, whan we conceyue them, accordinge to reasone. For we repute nor thinke that raysoning and declarynge, noyeth or is hurtfull in causes, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it hurteth, not to learne &amp; to be infourmed by sage sentences and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the manner, that they shuld be done, bifore they be executed. And ther of it cometh, that we vse in all thinges that we haue to do, more of audacyte and hardynes and of reasonne, than any other. For the other sometyme haue through ignorance, more confydence, than reasone willeth, and sometyme for to gronude themselfe tomuch in reasons, be slacke to execute their affaires. And yet, he ought to be reputed to haue reasonable and vertuous iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that knowith redely and clerely, the harde and noysome thinges, aswell as the pleasaunt. And by this meane, not to withdrawe himself from daungers, whan they happen. we vse fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thermore the offices of vertue, by contrary reasone and manner, that the othere people do. For that, that we attempte and goo aboute to gette frendes, more by doinge them some pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sire and benefytt, than in receyuinge it, of them. Also in kepinge the amytie and benyuolence, he that receyueth the plaisir and benefytt, is in worse condition, than he that doth it. For, for him that doth it, it is ynough to conserue it by benyuolence. But he that hath receyued it, vnderstandeth this that in rendringe the like, he gratefieth not, but rather dothe render the plaisir, whyche he hath receyued. Also we alone do gratefie nobly and liberally our fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, more for to proffitt them, than for to shewe, that we vse our liberalitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them. And for to speake all at one woorde, I thinke that this cytie, is the myrroure and the doctryne of all Grece, and one body mete and suffycient to be made mynistre of hys membres and suppostes in all manner of thynges wyth good grace and honneste. All the whyche thynges be not shewed and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refyed by wordes nor by declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: but by the apparance of the trouth, as may be sene &amp; knowin by the puissa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this cytie, which hath bene established by this meane in suche reputacion, as it is sene by experyence, that this same our cytie is reno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med through all the world, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any other. And it is that cytie alone, that geueth not occasion to hys propre ennemys, to runne vpon it for to hate it, though that they receyued thereby shame and damage, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideringe of what peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they receyued it: nothere is it blamed of his subiects, as vnworthy to gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. And also it cannot be sayd, that, that our puyssance sheweth not itself but by tokens and signes, for there be sene so greate experiences, that bothe those that be present, &amp; also those that shall come after, shal hold them for myracles. And we nede not to couett to haue an Homere, nor other poete of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> be lyuinge, for to exaulte or extol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for this cytie than, thies, whose exequies we celebrate, died in fighting

vertuously, for that, that they thought it a thinge tomuche harde to be depryued from it. whiche opynyon and wyll, we other, that be suruyuing, ought alwayes to haue. Whiche hath bene cause, wherfore I haue more prolixe and largely spoken of thys cytie, aswell to shewe, that we fyght not for a thinge like vnto othere, but for that same, vnto whome none othere is like: as also to thintent that the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singes of them, of whome we speake, shulde be more manifested and opened. Of whiche thinges, we haue nowe sayde the pryncipal parte. For the prays of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and of the greatnes of this cytie, wherof I haue bifore spokenne, ys dewe vnto them here and vnto thair like. whiche thinge, very fewe of the other people of Grece may reasonably say, of thair feates. And I thinke that the chiefest iudge of vertue in a man, is the vertuous lyfe: and the last confirmator, is the honno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable deathe, as that same of thies here hath bene. For it is a thing iuste and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that they, that cannot do othere ayde nor othere seruice to the common wealthe: that they shewe themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For that, that this doinge, they acquyte themselues right well in suche comon af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faire towardes the cytie, where they had euill acquited bifore tyme, by atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to thair particuler busynes. And by this meane reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pense that same fault, by this seruice. And there hath not bene he, of thies here, that withdrewe himself or retyred for his goodes or ryches, desiringe more the enioyinge therof for the tyme to come, than the goodnes of the partie, nor also, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> spared himself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for pouertie, hopinge to become ryche: but rather semed, that they had lesser care for theire welth, than for the same, of their ennemyes. And in effect, they were willing, in auenging themselues of ennemys, to come to this, wherunto they be come. For that, that yt was the most fayer experyence that they coulde make of thair vertue, in hope, to acquire and gett the glory, whiche they had neuer sene. For the which, it semed to them, by that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had sene of other, that they ought well to aduenture their lyues. And that yt were better to indure death, in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge themselues valya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, than to eskape by recuilling or drawing backe. wher vpon not for to incurre this dishonnour &amp; this shame, they haue suffred in theire bodyes, and in a right small space of tyme, haue for a right greate glory, willed rather to indure fortune, than to obey vnto feare. In whiche doinge, they haue shewed themselues towardes the partie, to be suche, as they ought to be. And as touchinge the other that be suruiuinge, they ought well to couett to haue their intente sett lesse vnto daunger, but not to haue lesse of harte, for to resiste the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemys. And consyder, that the proffitt and the vtilitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth not onely somuch in that as I haue shewed youe: for there be many amonge youe that vnderstande &amp; knowe yt, which may more amply expounde &amp; declare what goodnes foloweth by repoulsing of ennemys. But it consisteth more, and youe shall knowe it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if that biholding always the greatnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cytie, by his workes, ye take daily more and more loue in it. And somuch that it shall seme more greate vnto youe, ye maye thinke, that there haue bene noble people. who, knowinge reason and honestie, haue gottone by thair vertuous workes all thies thinges. And whan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer that the affaires came otherwyse, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they desired, they were not mynded to defraude the cytie of thair vertue, but rather they haue offred and geuen vnto it, the fayrest trybute or stipe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de that they might pay, that is to wyt, their bodies. wherby they haue particulerly acquired for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selfe eternall glory, and also right honorable buryall, not onely to be therein ingraued: but that theire vertue and their glory, bee in the same celebrated and magnefyed for euermore, whan tyme shall require to speake of thair feates, or for to ymitate and followe them.

And loued better to putt and sett fourth themselfe to manyfest danger, than to faile them at thair necessitie. Yet fynally they forsoke all, and were ouercome by the vehemency of the pestelence.

By meanes wherof, they were reputed to be righte happy. And they themselfe for the ioye that they had of thair present helthe: had a folishe and vayne presumption to eskape afterwardes, from all other sickenes. Besides this pestilence, the citezeins were molested &amp; anoyed by the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyte and dyuersyte of grosse moueables, whyche those that were retyred into the cytie had brought thider. For that, that the lodginge beinge small and yet occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyed with suche moueables &amp; necessaries, they knewe not, where to tourne them self, and specyally at that same tyme of sommer, and by this meane, they dyed, cowched, where as they might, wythout any honnestie, some tyme the one vpon the other. And many were sene half dead in the stretes (chiefly aboutes the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes) which wallowed on the earth, for the desire that they had of water. And the same temples where they had holden theire lodginges and abydinge, were full of dead corpses. For through the violence of the sickenes, they knewe not what they dydde, and hadde loste the knowlaige and reuerence of religion of the hollynes of places. And the righte of the graues, whiche they vsed in tyme paste, were all troubled and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fused. For euery man buryed his, there, as he might. So that many housholdes, there graues beinge filled by the multitude of them, that were deade of their lignaige &amp; familye, were constrayned, to caste the bodies of the other that dyed, into fylthy and dishonnest graues.

But all that, which for the time, they founde playsant and delectable for mans appetyte, they reputed profytable and honneste, wythoute any feare of Goddes or of lawes. For that, that they thought it to be all one to do yll, or good, consydered y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> aswell dyed the good, as the euyll, and also they hoped not to lyue so longe, that punyshment might be taken on them for their mysdedes by iustice, but they wayted a greater punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the sentence of Goddes, which was nowe geuen, to wytt, to dye of that same pestilence. Whervpon, sythens it was so, they thought that it was beste, to employ the small tyme that they had to lyue, in makyng good chere and at their pleasure. In this calamyte than were the Athenyans, that dyed within the citye of the same pestylence, and withoute, the enemyes put all to fyer and bloude.

For al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>though that they were nowe weakened by the euyls and dammages that they had suffred in particuler: yet in thynges, that concerned the weale and gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the common wealthe, they knewe that they had nede of hym, and that he was the most suffycyent man, that they had. Also for trouthe, so longe as he had the gouernaunce, durynge the peace, he admynystred moderately and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it intierly, and also augmented and amplefyed it greately. And afterwardes, whan there was questyon of the warre, he knewe and vnderstoode ryghte well the strength and puissance of the cytye, lyke as it appereth by that, which therin hath be done. But sithens hys death, which was two yeares and a halfe after the warre begonne, men knowe muche more hys prudence and prouidence. For he had alwayes shewed them, that they shulde haue the victory of that warre, yf they kepte themselfe from fayghtynge agaynste the enemyes on lande, and dyd execute theyr feate by sea. wythout alwayes to searche to gette a newe seignyory, and wythoute puttynge the cytye in daunger. wherin, after hys deathe, they dyd the whole contrarye.

And also, whan he sawe them afrayde for any incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenyent, he put them agayne in courage.

In whiche worke, they contynued .lxx. dayes contynuallye, daye and nyght, wythout cessyng from theyr busynes. For whan they one departed for to go to eate or slepe, they other came thyder, euerye one in hys tourne. And for to sollycite and cause the sayde worke to be auaunced &amp; sett forwardes, were deputed and appoincted, the Lacedemonyans, whiche had charge of the huyred souldyars, and wyth them the Dukes and capytaynes of all the cytyes. Whan they of the towne sawe the mounte so to heighynge and aryse, they beganne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly agaynst it in the ynner syde wythin theyr walle, to make an other wall w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> stoanes with brecque, whiche they dyd take of the next houses, that they pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked downe for to do it with, and for to susteygne and vpholde it, they meddled it with pieces of woode, and withoutefourthe they armed and fensed it wyth hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, to the intente that in workynge they shulde not be hurte, and also that yf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fyer were caste agaynste it, it shulde not take in the woode. In suche maner, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the workynge arose greatly on bothe sydes. And neuertheles they of the towne, for to retarde and slacke the workynge of thennemys, they deuysed one suche mete practique and meane: that is. That they persed the wall at one part ryght anempste the mounte, wherevnto the ennemies hadde from the same forged an other Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare wyth woode and wyth earth, which came to ioigne to the walle, for to comme in couert, and secretely vnto the foote of the same walle, after that the sayd mounte had bene acheued. And through that same hoale, that they had made, they drewe and conueyed awaye the earthe vnderneath, which the other did caste into it. Whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, after that the Lacedemonians had parceyued it, they made greate panyars, and fylled them with soft and moist earth, and afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des dyd caste it in stede of that, whiche was drawen awaye, in manner, that men coulde not easely drawe more away. Also whan the Plateans sawe the remedy, they studyed no further in that partye, but they made greate mynes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductes wythin the earthe throughe vnder the walle that wente to aunswere vnto the mounte. Throughe whiche mynes, they drewe wythout ceasyng, the earthe from the mounte, &amp; dyd it long before the enemyes parceyued it, thoughe that they were all abashed to see that theyr mount dyd not greatly heyghenne, for the maruelous quantite of earth, that they dyd caste into it, and that it dyd falle and syncke in the myddelle. yet the citezeins, consyderynge that at lengthe they coulde not drawe awaye so muche of the earthe, as the other, that were in greater nomber wythoute comparysonne, myght caste therin: and therfore consideringe that they trauaylled in vayne, they deuysed an other remedye for to resist. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at the same part of their walle, where the enemys had approched w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare for to assaulte, they raysed &amp; erected w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in wardes, an other walle, in maner of increasing or adioyning, one vnto the other. For the two endes came to ioyne vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wall, directly anempste the two endes of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies &amp; went fromthence, enlarging inwardes, into the towne. To the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yf the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies did take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quarter of the wall, they shuld yet there finde an other, against which, they shulde of necessitie make an other mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, which shulde be their dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="lxiiii" facs="tcp:18267:65"/>
trauaile. &amp; also shuld be in greater dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger. On the othersyde, the Peloponesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had erected two Engynes vpon their mount, where w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they battered in two partes to witte, wyth the one the walle, that they of the towne dyd make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whiche decayed it greatly, wherof the Citezeins were greatly astonyed: and the other did batter the principal wall. Against which engynes the citezeins vsed two remedies. The one was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had great snares of bigge coardes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which they dyd breake the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The other was that they had great rollers of woode, which they fastened at two endes to chaynes of yronne, whiche kepte the sayd rollers at the top of the wall, hanged ouerthwart. And whan they sawe the stroke of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>minge, they lett slyppe the endes of the chaynes, that were fastened to certayn Engynes, in such sorte, that soubdainely the said rollers came to fall vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ende of the Engyne that battred, and did breake hys stroake. Wherupon, the Peloponesia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, seing that after all attemptates, they could not by that meane ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely batter the walle, and yet though that it were battred, that there was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wall within, &amp; by that meane, they shuld with payn take the towne by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: they determyned to enclose it rounde aboute with a walle. But afore they dyd that, they wolde assaye if they might do it by fyer, whiche thinge semed easy ynough vnto them, if that the wynde serued them, consyderynge that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry smal. For they studyed all thinges, wherby they might haue it without great expe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; without long sieage. And therfore they filled with fagotts &amp; with wood all the dyche, that was betwene the mounte &amp; the walle in a veray shorte tyme, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greate multitude of people, that were at doinge of it. And caused it to be caryed and extended, so farre, as they might within the towne, &amp; afterwardes in the height did put in fyer wyth soulfer and wyth powder. Wherby ther issued fourthwith one so greate a flame, as had neuer bene there sene afore, that hadde bene kindled by mans hande. For sometyme the fyer toke by itself in the woodes by the mountaynes, through the vehemente confrication, freatinge and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge of the trees, whyche happened by force of wynde, wherby arose a greater fyer &amp; flame. And that same fyer was so great and so sharpe, that it faylled very litle, that it had not burned all the towne, with them that were within, for there remayned but one small part therof, where as the fyer had no course. And if the fyer had chased, as the ennemys thought, it had bene done. but it chaunced clene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. For ther soubdainly came a great rayne with great tho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders, as it is said, that quenched it. The Peloponesians, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> seing that they were frustrated &amp;
disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poineted of that their enterprise after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, they determyned to leue one parte of thair people at the siege bifore the towne, &amp; that the other shulde retourne, but furst they wold enuiron &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passe about all the sydes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles. And for to haue it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonner acheued, they departed it amongest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by quartiers, geuing to al the bendes of euery cytie, his quarter, &amp; also made dyches, all alonge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said walle, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in as without, &amp; with the earth, that they drewe out &amp; cast vp, they made bricque. After that they had acheued y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same worke, they left a sufficient nomber of thair people for to kepe the half of that same walle, &amp; they left the other halfe, to be kepte by the Beotyans, and after, the other departed about the saison that the starre named Acturus doth appere, &amp; euery man retourned from thence vnto his house. As touching the Plateans, they had now afore, sent away their wiues y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> aged people, the children, &amp; al those, that were not mete to sarue for the warre. In such sorte, that there were abydinge in the towne, but foure houndred and foure skore Athenyans, and ten women alonely for to make them their bread, and more there were not of any estate nor condityon. The whiche determyned for to defende the towne. Such was the preparation of the siege of Platee.</p>

               <p>WE do well vnderstande, Lordes Lacedemonyans and you other con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>federates, that it is accustomed amonge the Grekes (whiche is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray raysonable) that whan they wythdrawe in tyme of warre, anye, from the allyance of theyr ennemyes, vnto theyrs: they intreate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very welle, so farre, as they serue for theyr proffyt. But afterwardes, consyderyng that they haue betrayed theyr furste and auncyent frendes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute them for to be vnhappy or naughty people, and thynke that they wolde do worser vnto them. whiche thynge were very raysonable, yf the thynges were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galle on the behalfe of them, that do rebelle, and on the behalfe of those, whom they forsake. For yf they be egall of force and preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of wylle and amytie there is no reasonable cause whye they shulde habandone nor leaue the one, the other. But that hath no place betwene the Athenians and vs. The which thyng we wyll gladly declare, to the intente that youe esteme vs not for noughtye and wycked. And iudge, that we do dyssolutely and cowardely, yf we forsake them in tyme of warre, hauynge by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bene honored in tyme of peace. For inasmuche as we come hytherfor to requyre to be receyued into your allyau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, we woll gladly before all thynges both iustyfye our case &amp; also do our vertue to be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that the amytye amonge the partycular people, and the confederatyon amonge the cytyes cannot be honnorable nor pardurable, yf there be not a mutuell opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon of vertue on both partes. And in the reste, a coniunction and a conformitie of manners and of wylle. For where the wylles be dyscrepante and dysagreynge, the actes and operations be lykewyse. Wherfore to the intente that youe shulde vnderstande, howe we haue proceded with the Athenyans, we made allyaunce wyth them, whan youe departed frome the armys after the warres of Medes, &amp; that they pursued the reste of the warre and of the ennemys. Whiche allyaunce we made not wyth them for to subdue the Grekes, but for to delyuer them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the seruytude of the Medes. For thys cause, so longe as they contynued in good compaigny, we haue followed them with good and entier wylle. But whan we knewe that they hadde forgotten theyr enmyte agaynste the Medes, and that they wente aboute to reduce and brynge theyr compaignyons and allyes into theyr subiectyon: we were afrayde. Neuertheles for so muche, as it was not lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full nor an easye thynge to those confederates to reallye themselfe togeders, for to wythstande the vyolence, whiche the sayde Athenyans wolde do vnto them, for the multytude and dyuersyte of opynyons, that must be hadde in suche case: all the other confederates, excepte vs, and them of Chio, haue bene by the sayde Athenyans subdued and brought into theyr subiection &amp; obeissance. And though that we haue sente of oure people to theyr assemblyes and commaundementes, as theyr allyes and confederates, and be takenne and named for suche, yet for truthe we neuer dyd take them for oure laufull dukes and headdes. For that it was not to be beleued, sythe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that they had reduced into seruytude the other, that were comprysed in the selfe allyaunce, that we haue wyth them: but that they wolde do the lyke vnto vs, whan they shulde see theyr oportunytie. For yf we had bene all yet in oure lybertye, we myght haue had more faythe in them. But hauynge subdued the more parte, it is to beleue, that they wolde take it
<pb n="lxxiiii" facs="tcp:18267:75"/>
more dyspleasauntlye, that we woulde repute oure selfe egall to them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affayres, and that we alone wolde accompanye our selfe wyth them, where all the other obeye them. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sydered chiefly, that howe muche they arne become more myghtye, we do remayne so muche the worse accompaignyed. Nother there is anye thynge that maketh so muche the allyaunce to be faythfull and pardurable, as doth the mutuell feare, that one of the allyes hath of the other. For he that wolde vyolate and breake it on hys partie, whan he consydereth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other is as puyssant as he, he feareth to assayle it. And that they haue permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and suffred vs vnto thys presente to lyue in libertye, it hath not bene for any other reasonne, but for that they wente aboute to establyshe theyr princyyalitie, rather vnder couloure of some reasone and of counsaylle, than by manifest force. And also to the ende, that yf they made warre agaynste any of them (that they had subdued for any faulte, which they had done agaynste the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) they myghte iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifye them selfe, sayinge that yf the same warre had not bene reasonable, we and the other that were yet in lybertye, and hadde lyke auctorytie as they: wolde not haue gone thyder. For thys cause, they haue many tymes assembled a great puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance agaynste people, very weake. To thyntente, that hauynge by a lytle &amp; lytle reduced the one after the other, they that remayned, shulde be so muche more weake. There, where yf they had begonne wyth vs (the other, stylle beynge in theyr entier and not subdewed) they coulde not haue done it so easelye. Also they wolde haue had some feare of oure shyppes, and wolde haue doubted, that y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But yf that thys warre had not bene begonne, that coulde not longe haue endured, as it maye appeare by thexample of other.

And so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, whiche amytie and beneuolence hath made stable and faythfull amonge other allyes: causeth feare betwene vs. And for effecte, we haue parseuered and contynued in thys allyaunce and socyete for feare, and not for loue. In suche manner that the same of vs, that sonnest had founde meane to breake it wythout feare of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier, was readye to declare hymselfe, to be the furst. And yf any iudge vs, to haue done euyll to preuent and comme before, and that we shulde haue taryed vntyl they had declared theyr yll wylle, whiche we thought that they had had, consy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derynge that yet they had not shewed it: he taketh it not welle. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But consydered that they had alwayes the meane and power to enterpryse vpon vs, whan they shulde haue wylled, it was reasonable that we shulde furste take it, whan we dyd see oportunyte. Thies be than the causes Lordes Lacedemonyans and confederates) for the whiche we depart our selues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which we thinke clere &amp; raysonable to al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnderstande the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; sufficient on our behalfe for to put vs in dreade &amp; feare.

Persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge oure selues that oure reuolte and tournynge from them is iustyfyed by two great reasons. The one to the intente, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not perseuering on the partye of the Athenyans, we shulde not be aydynge to subdue Grece, but rather wyth youe the other, we shuld helpe to defende hys lybertye: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, for to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de our lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty specyally, &amp; that in tyme to comme, we be not subdued, as the other. And yet neuertheles we be declared to be to swyfte or to hasty. Wherfore it is nedefulle, that youe vse the more dylygence to succoure vs, and that youe shewe in effecte at thys poyncte, that youe wyll both defende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that youe oughte. &amp; also that youe wylle noye youre ennemyes, in all sortes that youe can. whiche thynge to do, youe haue nowe greater oportunyte, than euer men had. For that, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyans be vnprouyded, of men, by meanes of the pestylence: and of monneye, by meanes of the warre. And also theyr shyppes be dysparsed, some of them into youre quarter of Peloponese, and the other into ours, for to watche vs. In such manner, that it is not to beleue, that they can rayse anye greate nomber, yf youe go to assayle them presently at begynnynge of thys sommer by sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the warre shalbe made by thys meane not after the sorte that they thynke for. But it shalbe made in the place, from whence, Athens it selfe taketh &amp; rayseth the monney and proffit. For theyr reuenues is taken vpon theyr allies. which yet wolbe greater, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shal haue brought vs to theyr subiectyon.

But yf you succoure vs redely, ye shall haue in your power a cytye habun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dante wyth great shyppes, wherof youe haue nede.

Be abashedde than Lordes, to defraude &amp; frustrate the hope, that the Grekes haue of youe, and also the religyon of the God Apollo.

yt in the manner as foloweth. They made ladders of the heigh of the sayd wall, whiche heith they toke by seing &amp; calculatinge the greatnes and thyckenes of the brickes, wherw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the walle was made. nombrynge the rankes thereof, frome the toppe to the bottome, whiche thinge they mighte easely do by succession of tyme, there, where the walle was vncouered on their side. And likewyse they did calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate that whiche might transcende and be ouer the ioynters or byndinge togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the sayd bricques. And forsomuche as in that poinct one only man might well faille, many enterprysed to do yt at sundry tymes. In suche sorte that they made their ladders of that same highnes. Nowe the sayde walle was double, to wytte, the one towardes the towne to kepe them that they shulde not issue out, and the other towarde the felde to defende, that the succours of the Athenyans shulde not therinto enter, Distant the space of .xvi. foote, the one from the othere. wherein bitwene bothe were the lodginges and sheddes of them that kepte yt, separated the one from the other, but so thicke and so nighe, that the two walles semed to be but one, resarued that they had creueaulx all alonge, and from tenne into tenne Creuaulx, there was a greate tower, whiche helde the one walle wyth the other, so that one coulde not passe bitwene the walles, but through the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the sayd towers, wherein, they that kepte watche in the night, withdrewe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whan yt raigned or was fowle wether. For that they were there couered, and also they were not farre from the Creueux or Looupe hooles. Than they of the towne, knowinge the manner of the watche, espied a night whan it greately did rayne and blow, and that there was no moone shyne. And vnder the conduict of those same, that had bene inuentours of thenterprise, they passed furst the dyche that was on their syde, and came vnto the foote of the walle, without being par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyued of the ennemys, by rayson that the obsturite and darkenes of the nighte did lett them to see, and the noyse or brute of the wynde and rayne, to heare. Also they went alonge, and separated the one from the other, that their harnois shuld make no noyse by touchinge togither. And also they were light armed, and they had but the lefte foote hoased for to kepe them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sticking in the mudde. Nowe whan they had raysed vp their ladders againste the Creueux, where they parcey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that no body was, they that had broughte those ladders did furste clyme vp. After, a dousenne other did amounte armed onely of their bodys wyth harn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and with a dagger in their hande. Of the whiche .xii. the furst and the chiefe was Amneas,<note place="margin">Amnea.</note> sonne of Corebus. And sixe of the said .xii. that came after hym, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to the toppe of the two towers, bitwene the whiche, were the Creueux right against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ladders, that were raired vp. After thies twelue, other did amou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te being armed as aforesaid, and did moreouer cary with them, dartes fastened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde their backes, that they shuld not empesche, nor hynder them to clyme vp. Some other, caryed after them, targats or shildes to delyuer them, whan they shulde be wyth thennemys hande to hande. But after that many were mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vp, they that watchedde within the towers parceyued them, by meanes that one of the Plateans in skailinge, did caste downe a tyle from one of the Creuesses, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the noise whereof, the watche did crye. At whiche their cry, the campe was so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayed, that they came all to the walle not knowynge what it was, by meanes of the night, or of the fowle whether. And on the other syde, the Plateans that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the towne, issued fourth and came to assaulte the walle, in othere pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, clene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the other where they skailed, for to deceyue thennnemys, in such manner, that they were all abashed what it mighte be, and did not remoue themself. Also they that watched within the towrs dust not issue fourth, studying and debatinge amongeste themselfe what it might be. Yet the thre houndredde
<pb facs="tcp:18267:78"/>
that had the charge to succour the watche, did light fyer on the coste of Thebes for to signefie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nemis. But they that remayned within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne, preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, did likewyse light a great qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie therof vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wal, which they had prepared to the ende, that thennemys shuld not knowe, wherfore thyes fyers were made. And that their compaignyons might by this meane saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bifore that any succour came vnto the watche. Duringe this tyme they that were furst mounted, dyd winne the two towers and did kille the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de within, for to kepe them, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nemys shuld not come there. afterwardes they caused the other to amounte, whiche yet were not mounted, &amp; so repoulsed with strokes of dartes, and of stones, them, that came to succour the walle, aswell by lowe as at the toppe. By meane whereof, they that were not yet amounted had leasure and occasion to rayre vp a greater no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ladders. And moreouer they that had gaigned and gotten the height of the walle, didde beate downe the Creuesses withinfourth, to thintent that they, that mounted, mighte more easely leape vp. And euery of them after that they were aboue, did cast sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and other dartes againste thennemys, that came vpon the dyche side on the outside, for to succour their people, that were vpon the walle. In suche manner, that all they, that shulde passe fourth, did amounte. though that the laste hadde therin greate payne. Afterwardes they all went downe from the towers to the dyche wythoutfourth, where they founde on the othere syde the three houndred that had charge to succour the watche, &amp; that had lighted the bekens. By meane wherof they were in playne sight, by light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sayd bekens, &amp; also it did let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to see the other that were on the other syde: wherupon beinge by occasion hereof in faire sight, and also that they were vpon the syde of the diche in discouert: they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in, did repoulse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> force of dartes &amp; so did hurt many. Thus they all did passe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diche, though w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> greate difficultie, for that the water was halfe frosen so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther were great flakes of Isse. And also it coulde not beare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that was by meane of the south wynde that had thawed it. It rayned also, by reason wherof, the water was so increased that it came in a manner vnto their chynne. And they pourpously had chosen y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> same tyme. After that they had passed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dyche, lockyng or ioygninge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self togiders, they toke the way, that leadeth to Thebes, leauing on the side of the right hande the sepulcre of Andocratus. And this they dyd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideringe that the Peloponesians wolde neuer thinke that they wolde take that same way, that did leade vnto their ennemys, and also for that they did see that the said Peloponesians had lighte wyth fyers and beakens, all full vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the way towardes Athens. But after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had gone sixe or seue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> stades towardes The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes they lefte that way, and toke on the syde the way, that goithe to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne of Erithre and of Nysie, and throughe that countrey of mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taignes, they came vnto Athenes and were two houndredde and twelue in all. For the other, seinge the difficultie, retyred into the towne of Platee, excepte one, that was slayn in the dyche. The Peloponesyans, after that the bruyt was paste, retyred euery one vnto his lodginge in the campe. And as touchinge them of the towne, they knewe not if their compaignyons were in saulftie, or not. And for that, that they of their bende that were retourned, had saied that they were all deade, they sente whan yt was daye, their Heraulte towardes them of the siege for to haue the deade bodys, but vnderstandinge that they were saulfe, they made no furthere poursute. In this manner, parte of them, that were within the towne of Platee, did passe all the fortes and rampares of the ennemyes, and saued themselues.</p>

               <p>ABoute the ende of that same wynter, the Lacedemonyans did send in a light galley one Salethus vnto Mytylene.<note place="margin">Sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</note> who beinge landed at Pyreus, came a fote well nighe vnto the campe. and entred by nyght into the towne through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shallowe of a streame, which passed ouerth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wart the rampers of thennemys, wherof he was aduertysed.

By meane whereof, the Mytilenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were slacke or retarded to make any appoinctement with the Athenyans. And so passed the fourth yeare of this warre. In the beginning of the sommer following the Peloponesians, sendinge Alcidas their Capytayne general by sea wyth forty shippes for to succour the Mytylenyans,<note place="margin">Alcidas.</note> they, wyth their confederates, entred a freshe into the lande of Athens, to thintent, that Thathenyans, seinge themselfe assayled and thronged on both sides, shulde haue lesse occasion to sende renforte or newe strength by sea to the siege of Mytylene.

For somuche as the ennemys, attendinge newes, that their armye by sea had done some greate exploicte in the Isle of Lesbos, where they thought it was than arryued, they dydde pillage and destroye alle, asmuche, as they founde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. But vnderstanding afterwardes, that their enterprise of Lesbos fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, hauinge also lacke of victuailes, they retourned euery one into his quartier.

And whan they had receyued the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, they wolde no lenger obey the officers, but they made greate assemblies &amp; came to the gouernours and riche people of the towne, sayinge, that they would that all the goodes and victuailes shulde be putt in commone and parted by the hedde, and that if they so dyd nott, they wolde delyuer the towne vnto the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans. whych sene by the said gouernours, and principallest: and fearing that the comon people shulde make an appoinctement a parte, withoute includinge them therin (whiche thinge they might do at their will for that they were the stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger)

For it is to bileue that we shall fynde many thynges yll warded and kepte, as it comonly chaunceth in a towne newly takenne, and specially on the sea side, wherby they doubted not that anye succours shulde comme, and we be very stronge. It is also to beleue that their souldyars be disparsed and ronne out of order throughe the lodginges, as men haue accustomed, whan they haue the victorie. wherfore I thinke and haue good hope that if we go to lande there by night, &amp; assayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> soubdainly, wyth the ayde of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the towne (if there be any that be affectioned to our partie) we shall haue honnour of oure enterpryse. And we oughte not to feare the daungier. But oughte to remember that, that is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly said of the feates of warre, whyche ys that they be varyable.

For if the Capytaine do kepe hym self at his defence, and espieth his ennemye and canne assaylle hym w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his aduauntaige, he commeth oftentymes to the beste of his enterpryses.

Pissuthnes wolde tourne to their parte.<note place="margin">Pissuth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> But Alcidus was not of this opynyon, nor yet of the othere bifore. And vnto his, the gretest parte of them, that were in that same counsaille, did agre. whiche was, that sithens they had faylled of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise at Mytilene they shulde wythoute longer taryinge, retourne into their countrey. whiche thinge they did. Beinge than departed from the porte of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batus, they came to arryue at the Isle of Myonesus,<note place="margin">Myone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</note> whiche is bilonginge to the Teyens. At whiche place he caused to be slayne manye prysonners that he had taken in that same sayling on the sea. By reasone wherof, whan he was arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at Ephesus, the Ambassadours of the Enyens,<note place="margin">Ene.</note> that be in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Isle of Samos, came vnto hym, and shewed him that the lybertie of Grece was not well maig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigned to kille them, that were not ennemys, and had not taken armure against them, but were allyed onely with the Athenyans through necessitie. And that if he contynued so to do, he shulde neuer withdrawe the confederates frome the Athenyans to the allyance of the Peloponesians, but rather their frendes wold bicome their ennemys. Throughe whiche declaration, Alcidus gaue lycence to many prysonners, that he yet had of Chio and of other places, whyche he hadde takenne ryghte easely and wythout resistence. For that, that whan they didde see the shippes vpon the sea, they fledde not awaye bifore them, but came towardes them, thinkinge that they had bene Athenyans. For they neuer thought that the Athenyans kepinge the sea, the shippes of the Peloponesians euer durste passe Ionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. After that, Alcidus departed in haste, and as flyinge frome Ephesus. For he was aduertised, that he, yet beinge at ancre at Clarus, was sene and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by two ships comminge from Athenes. To wyt, by that same of Salamyne and by that other of Parale.<note place="margin">Parala.</note> wherfore, fearynge to be pursued by the armye of sea of the Athenyans, he went into the depthe of the sea, to the intente not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche to any lande with his good wille, vntill he arryued in Peloponese. Herof were aduertised Paches and the Athenyans on all sides. And specially, by one cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayne messenger, that was sente by them of Ethreus. For the cytes of Ionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that were not closed with walles, were in greate feare that the armye by sea of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponesians, passynge a longe their countrey, though they were not willinge to arrest or tary there, that yet they wold lande for to pillage the townes, that they founde in their waye. Likewyse the ship of Salamyne and that same of Parale affyrmed to haue sene the armye of thennemyes at Clarus. For thys cause, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches sayled for to pursue Alcidus, and followed him with the greateste diligence, that he might vnto the Isle of Latmos.<note place="margin">Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos.</note> But seinge that there was no hope to tary him there, he retourned backe. And he thoughte that he had gott on inoughe that he founde them not in the meane sea, for than he shulde haue bene forcedde to haue assaulted them, and to kepe great watche ouer them. And in retourning, he wente vnto the cytie of Notion in the countrey of the Colophoniens by this occasion.<note place="margin">Notion.</note> The Colophoniens holdinge that same cytie, Itamenes and certayne strangers wyth him,<note place="margin">Itame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> had by meanes of one debate that was amonge the Cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeins occupyed the fortres of the towne, whiche was in fourme of one Castelle, separated from the walles of thother body of the towne.

At departure from Notio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Paches retourned vnto Mytylene, &amp; brought agayne to the obeissance of the Athenyans, the cyties of Pyreus and Eresse. And found Salethus, who had hydde himself in the towne of Mytylene. And sent him to the Athenians wyth the Mytylenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he had sent to The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedon, with all the other, that he coulde vnderstand to haue bene the authors of the rebellyon. Afterwardes he sente away the greatest parte of his armye, that he had brought thider, and with the reste taryed there to geue order to the cytie of Mytilene, and to all the Isle of Lesbos. whan they, that Paches had sente, were arryued at Athens, the Athenyans caused Salethus incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to dye, though that he promysed to do many thynges. And amonge other, that the siege whiche the Peloponesyans did holde yet bifore Platee, shulde be raysed.

For they estemed the faulte of the sayd Mytylenyans, to be inremissible and not to be forgeuenne. For that that they rebelled, though that they were not entreated as subiectes, as the other were. And yet they had greater despyte, for that the shippes of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponesians had had the audacytie for to comme to succoure the sayd Mytyle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans, to passe the sea Ionum with greater daunger. whiche was a tokenne that the sayd Mytylenyens hadde pourposed, and by longe circumstance prouyded afore, for that same rebellyon. So they dispatched a galley to signefy to Paches the decree of the Senate, of Athenes, and to commaunde him to execute yt. Yet the morowe after, they abhorred and repented themselues, consydering the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie of the decree. And they thoughte it to haynous to destroy and kylle all the people of a cytie, and not to extinquishe them, that had bene authors of the euill of other. whiche thinge, beinge knowin by thambassadours of the Mytylenye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and by the Athenyans that fauoured them, they wente with all diligence to the chiefeste of the cytie, and wyth greate wepinges and lamentacions, perswadedde them gentely to putt the matter ones agayne into deliberation.

And ye parceyue not, that the faultes that youe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytt, do suffre youe to be seduced by their speakynges and persuations, orelles by greate pytie doo putte youe in daunger. And also youe gette not, for all that, their good wylle.

And that your force and the feare that they haue of youe, do make them obeissant, and not the goodnes and mercy that you vse towardes them. But the woorste that I see in oure affayre ys thys, that in matters determynedde and concludedde, there ys no fyrmenes nor stabilitie. And we vnderstande not, that there ys better gouernemente in a cytie that vseth his lawes fyrmely and wythoute reuocation (yea though they be euyll) than in that same, that hath good lawes and doth not kepe them inuiolablie.

Frome whyche erroure, I wyll take payne to wythdrawe youe, in causinge it to appere vnto youe, that the cytie of Mytylene is that same, that hath done youe a singuler oultrage and displeasure.

               <head>¶ The proposition and opynyon of Diodotus, contrary to that same of Cleon. ☞The .vii. Chapter.</head>
               <p>I Prayse not the opynyon of them, that reproue thys, that men putt agayne into deliberation the matter of Mytylene, and that thinke yt not good, that men consulte many tymes vpon waightie affaires. But me thinketh that there be two thynges much contrary to good conn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saille. To wytt, hedynes or haste, and wrath or anger. For the one doth thinges
<pb n="lxxxi" facs="tcp:18267:82"/>
folishly, and the other furyously and rashly. And also me thinkethe, that he that wyll empesche and lett men to shewe thinges by woordes, ys wythoute vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standinge. Or that he hath some conceites and deuyses, that be not wel knowin. for if he thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the things to come, which be not yet parceued, may be otherwise vnderstand than by wordes, he hath no vnderstandinge. And if he woll perswade any dishoneste and euill matter, &amp; for that, that he thinketh, that he cannot make it good by woordes, wol astony and choke with iniuries and villenies those, that wyll saye the contrary, it is a great signe, that he affectith or fauoureth the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But yet they be more to blame that charge the againesayers, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> corruption. For if a man obiecte againste him, whose opynyon the greatest parte of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell haue not alowed, that he vnderstandeth not well the causes, he shalbe repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely ignorant, and not a noughty parsone. but whan it is obiected, that he is corrupted and brybed, though men allowe his opynyon, yet shall he be neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelas suspected. And if it be not holden, he shalbe not onely reputed ignoraunte but also an noughty parsone. whereby, the publique welthe shall susteigne dom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maige, for that the people dare not speake nor counsaille freely for feare thereof. And it semeth, that it shuld be better for the wealthe of the comon weale, that there were no man in the cytie that had the vnderstandynge and knowlaige to speke wel, than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there were any, as if by this, the people had lesse occasions to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende, whiche is hoole contrary. for a good cytezeine that speaketh his opynyon, ought not to empesche nor feare the other, that they shulde not speake againste hym, but in all equalytie and modestie shewe by reasone that hys opynyon is the better. And moreouer me thinketh that a cytie that gouerneth itselfe by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonne, oughte not, nother to do more honnour to hym that counsaillethe welle aboue all the othere, nor yet lessen hym of that, whyche he hadde bifore. And li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewyse shulde do no shame to hym, whose opynyon was not allowed, and yette lesse to punishe him. For by that meane, he, whose iudgement shalbe found good shall not care to saye any thynge, but that, whyche he thinkethe to sarue him to get the honnour or fauour of the people. And by lyke raysons he, whose opynyon ys not approuedde, shall not be moued to chaunge yt for to gratefye the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. wherin we do clene contrarye. For if there be anny that maye be charged to haue bene subournedde or brybed by gyfte or by promes, thoughe that he haue good opynyon and counsailleth the wealthe of the cytie: yet throughe suspytion of the sayd corruption (wherof there is none apparance) we wol reiecte and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake yt. And whatsoeuer thynge he sayth, be yt good or euil, yt is suspected. wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it is necessarye that he, that wyll persuade any thinge to the comunaltie, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well good as euyll, vse lyes and cautels, wherby it followith, that bicause of thies disguysings &amp; chalenges, no man may proffytt him, that shuld speke of an open and manifeste matter, except he deceyue. For if any geue hym any thynge openly he shalbe suspectedde that he was wyllynge to gayne yt. whyche is not raisonne. For yt ys expedyente that we that be in this offyce, and that haue the charge for to delyberate and determyne greate and waightieste affayres, shulde parceyue further, than youe othere, that mynde not but thynges presente and at hande. Consyderedde specyally, that for that, whych, we saye, we muste shewe raysonne, where as youe that heare vs, do render no accompte of that youe heare. And if it were ordeynedde that he that heareth and suffreth himselfe to be perswaded, shuld be asmuch punyshedde, as he that speakethe and perswadethe, cetaynelye youe shulde iudge wyth the more modestie and more raysonne. But whan the matters be desperate vnto youe, youe punyshe throughe anger and wrathe, hym onely, that hath geuen the counsell, &amp; not youe the other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue followed it

And yet in that doinge youe trespasse asmuche, as he that hath spokenne yt. As touchinge me I intend not to speake in the fauour of Mytyleniens for to speake againste or for to accuse any parsonne. And if we be in our good wyttes, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth no questyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their mysdede, but alonly, to consulte well for our selues. For albeit, that it appereth vnto vs that they haue trespassed, yet woll I not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saille that they shalbe put to dethe, except it be expedyente for vs. And likewise, if they merytte to haue grace, I wolde not be of the opynyon that it shulde be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended vnto them, excepte it might be profytable vnto vs. And forsomuche, as oure consultation is more to haue regarde vnto the tyme to come, than to the tyme passed, &amp; Cleon hath said that it is requisitt, for to wythstand the rebellyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fromthesfourth to follow, that thies here shulde be punyshedde by death, I am of a contrary opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; that it shalbe better for vs to do otherwyse.

For I parceue well, that all hys reasons, beinge conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to rigoure of iustice, they maye more moue youre hartes and thoughtes (whiche be nowe full of wrathe and anger) than myne.

Nowe youe knowe, that in many cyties, payne of life is ordeyned, not onely for so greate offenses, but also for muche lesser. And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelas there are people that putt themself in daunger of that payne, trusting that they shall eskape yt. And there was neuer manne enterprysed suche preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and rebellyons, that thoughte not that he mighte acheue them. And there was neuer cytie that rebelled, that thoughte not to haue greater force and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preparatyon, than yt hadde of itselfe, or of his frendes and allyes. But it is a naturall thing to men for to offend, and there was neuer law so rigoroux, that coulde let it. Although that newe paynes and punyshmentes haue dayly bene made &amp; added for offenses, to see, if by feare therof, the people might be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drawin from trespassinge. And also it was not without reasone that in the begynnynge, the paynes were more lighte and easie, than they nowe be. Whiche, throughe the contynuall transgression of the people, bene in a manner at this presente all broughte to the extremest punishement.

And moreouer euery man, parceyuyng hym selfe to haue the confederatyon and compaigny of one people, hath greater hope of hym selfe.

Truly we ought not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede here to the punyshment of offenses, as iudges to oure oune dommage, but we ought to remember for the tyme to comme, howe we maye drawe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the reuenue and trybute of oure cytyes, in mulctynge them moderatly, and to kepe and conserue them, more by gentlenes and good intreatinge, than by ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goure of lawes.

Consider moreouer that a great parte of Grekes do at this presente day, esteme and repute youe to be the true example and the mirrour of vertue &amp; wysdom. wherfore you ought well to feare to geue an wrongful sentence against vs. For in that doinge (which cannot be hydde) ye shall purchase great blame, hauinge determyned and iudged of vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be good people, otherwyse than accordyng to reason. euen youe that arne reputed the beste, and to haue sett in your temples the spoiles of them, that haue so well meryted towardes all Grece.

For we arne come to suche calamyte and perplexitie, that if the Medes hadde vainquishedde, we hadde bene destroyed: and hauynge hadde the victorye agaynste theym, we be at this presente vainquished towardes youe, that be oure greate frendes, through the Thebains. And so we haue incurredde two extreme daungers and calamytes, to wytt, to dye for hunger than, in resistinge to yelde vs at the wyll of the straungers, and nowe to defende oure lyfe in iudgemente. And we that haue more hartely tendredde the honnour of Grece, than our force mighte susteigne, be habandonned, dispysed and for sakenne of all. And there ys not one onely of all the Grekes, that were than presente, oure allyes, that maye ayde vs. And specially we feare greatly, that you other lordes Lacedemonyans, in whome wee haue putte oure pryncipalle truste, be not stable and constante inough in thys matter. Therefore we praye you for the honnour and reuerence of the Goddes, whych were than fauourers of oure societie and fellishipp, and in remembrance of all the seruices and merittes towardes all the Grekes: that you wylle appease and mytigate youre hartes towardes vs. And if youe haue at the persuation of the Thebains, determyned any thynge agaynste vs, to reuoke yt. And the pleasure, that youe haue graunted them, to slaye vs all, repeale it for to saulue vs. In whiche doinge, youe shalle purchase an glorious and honnora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grace, in stede of an cruell naughtynes. And also yt shall not be youre shame, for to geue ioye and pleasure to an othere. For it is ryght easye for youe to slaye vs, but yt shalbe very harde afterwardes, to abolish the infamye, that youe shall incurre by that deede, for to slaye vs vniustely, that be your frendes, &amp; not your ennemyes, but throughe necessitie.

But it is to youe (lordes Lacedemonyans) for trouthe, to whome we be rendredde, puttynge oure truste in youre faythe. Wherefore if wee cannot obteygne oure requeste, reasonne wylle, that ye serte vs agayne in that state, wherin we were, to wytt, in daunger of that, which might chaunce vs, puttynge youe agayne in remembrance, that frome youre handes youe doo, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytt into the same of the Thebayns, oure mortall ennemyes, vs the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teens, whyche haue bene alwayes affectyonedde to all the Grekes and that haue rendredde themselfe vnder youre parte, and to youre mercye.

And afterwardes they dyd sett vp their Trophee in token of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye, but as touchinge the lycence to depart, they woolde not graunte it openly, but refused and denied it generally to all.

Than they that were in the town, hauynge engraued and buryed their deade, with the most hast that they might, those that had obteigned lycence to departe, treated togithere secretely the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their departure. Durynge this tyme, Demosthenes and the Acarnanyans were aduertysed that the Ambracyans, whyche were departed from their cytie for to comme to the succours of their people, that were at Olpas, accordinge to the comaundement geuen vnto them at the begynning, lyke as hath bene bifore sayde: were vpon their iourney for to come thider, throughe the countrey of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philochiens, wythout that they had knowlayge of the newes of the destruction of their sayd people. So he sent parte of his menne to kepe the passages and the stronge wayes.

Mantynyans alonely, had the saulfconducte, they suffred vnto them to passe &amp; kylled the Ambracyens. But there was greate questyon &amp; difficultie to discerne the one from the other, so that in the same tumulte, there were slayn about two houndred. The other saued themselfe wyth greate difficultie wythin the towne of Agride.<note place="margin">Agrais.</note> whiche was nexte vnto them there. whome Salynthius,<note place="margin">Salyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius.</note> kynge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>griens, did reteigne as their frende.

The greatest wherof, those, that Demosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hadde sente bifore did take and occupie in the night seasonne, wythout that the Ambracyans did apperceyue them. who did saise themself of the lesser, wher they kepte them all that same daye and night following, without doubting any thynge. In the meane tyme, Demosthenes, beynge aduertised of their cominge, departed from his campe after supper at the entrynge of the night wyth al hys hooste, wherof the one half he ledde wyth hym. And the other halfe he causedde to go through the mounteignes of Amphilochie, &amp; vsed soo good diligence, that at breake of the daye he came to rushe vpon the sayde Ambracyans, whome he founde yet all slepinge, as people assured, and that knewe nothing of that, which was happened. But thought at the begynning that they had bene of their owne compaigny. For that, that Demosthenes, the better to deceyue them, had caused the Messenyans to marche bifore the othere, and had commaunded them, that they shulde speake in languaige Dorique with those, whiche they founde furste in the watche, whiche thinge they did. So that the said ennemys thoughte, that they had bene their owne people, the rather for that, that they coulde not wel see them, insomuch as it was not yet day, vntill that the bend of enemys were ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And they than did stryke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them all at ones, and did slay a great parte of them. The other did flye by the mountaignes, of whome yet the more part was slayne. For that they founde the Amphilochians that hadde gottone and kepte the passages. And forsomuche as they were lyghtely armed, and thies here well armed, they ouertoke them inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynently.

For though they did knowe that they were vesselles of the ennemys, yet they had rather fall into their handes (albeit that they had desarued to be slayne of them) than into the handes of the straungers or of the Amphilochia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that were their mortal enemys.

And also grauntedde to Demosthenes, who hadde sens hys retourne frome Acarnanie tarryedde at Athens wythoute any charge, and desyeredde greately to haue some, to vse the saide foorty shyppes aboute Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponese, as he shulde thincke good. Beynge than arryued in the countreye of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caonie, in passynge theire iourney, and vnderstandynge that the saide Pellopone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians shyppes were alreadye arryued in the goulphe of Corcyre, they were of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers opynyons amonge themself. For Eurymedon and Sophocles were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myned to go fourthwythe to Corcyre. But Demosthenes saide that they shuld furste go to take Pylus, and hauinge geuen order there, to drawe vnto Corcyre, and yet neuerthelas, seinge that the other two persysted and contynewed in their opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he commaunded them so to do. In thys debate, there came soubdaynly a tempeste of the sea, that constrayned them to drawe to the sayde place of Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus. And than Demosthenes shewede vnto theme that yt was nedefull to close that place wyth a walle, sayinge, that yt was the pryncypall cause that he was come wyth them for, in that voyage. And moreouer that yt was veary easye to do, for there was power, stones and matter for to acheue shortely their worke. And that the scite of the place was stronge, and also had aboute yt a greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarte countrey. For fromthence vnto Spartus, there were well foore houndred slades. And ys sytuated in the terrytorye, whiche was sometyme of the Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and was calledde Seraphasie. To thies reasones, the other two aunswered hyme, that yf he woulde grounde vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>, there were aboute Peloponese many promontoryes, that were desarte, whyche yf he wolde fortyfie, shulde be to make the cytie of Athenes emptye of monny. But neuerthelas he replyed vnto theme, that the same there was of an other ymportance, than the othere, for that, that yt had a good hauone, and moreouer that the Messenyans, that had some tyme kepte yt beynge sett into yt agayne, myght do greate annoyance and dyspleasue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res vnto the Lacedemonyans, by cause of theire communycacyon of language, and shulde kepe the place dylygently and faithfully. And yet notwythstandyng, seynge that he coulde not perswade yt, nother to the souldyars in gennerall, nor wythe the Capytaynes, wythe whome he had debatede the matter a parte: at length he helde hys peace and dydd speake no more. But durnige the tyme that they tarryed theire ydle and vnoccupyede, attendynge that the sea was appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedde, the souldyours deuysedde a gayne amonge themeself. And desyere tooke them to enclose the sayde place wyth walle, and so they determynedde to do yt. And hauynge no masons nor yrone tooles for to cutte the stones, they toke the
<pb facs="tcp:18267:100"/>
stones that they fonnde vpon the place, &amp; sett them one vpon the other, so as they might best hewe them, and ioygned them togider with earth in stede of morter. And for that, that they had no baskettes nor other instrumentes for to carry it, they did beare it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their back. Holding their visage downe towards the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to the ende that they might carry it y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better. And for to kepe it there, they ioigned their handes behinde vpon their backes. and in effecte they vsed all industrie &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, that they coulde for to fortefie the place with sides, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it might be assailed bifore that the Lacedemonians coulde send thider succoures. For on some sides it was not to be battred nor to be taken. Now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lacedemonians did celebrate a veary greate solempne feast in the cyte, whan they were aduertised of the same chaunce. through occasyon wherof, they did not greately passe on it. For it semed well to them that after they hadde acheued and fynished their feaste, whan they shulde go to that parte, that the ennemye woolde flye frome thence: or if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And on the other part, theire armye that was yet in the lande of Athenes, dyd somewhat retarde and slacke theym: in suche manner, that the Athenyans hadde respyte to fortefie the place on the lande side. And hauyng therin trauailled the space of sixe dayes, they left Demosthenes there wyth fyue galleys for to kepe it. And they with the other wente their way towardes Corcyre and towardes Sycille. During this tyme, the Peloponesians, that were in the lande of Athens, vnderstanding the takinge of Pylus, came agayne diligently into their lande. aswell for that, that it semed to the Lacedemonians and to Agis their kynge, that they had warre eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their house, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemys being at Pylus as also for that they were entred to sone into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de of Athens, to wyt, bifore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> corne was rype. through occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wherof, they had great lacke of victuailes. And moreouer the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pests had bene, during the tyme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were there, more great, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the season required. By meanes wherof, the men of warre were all troubled. wherby it happened, that though some other yeares, they had made no greate taryinge in that lande, yet that same yeare they made yt more shorte, for they taryed there, but fyftene dayes. In that same seasonne, Symonides, Duke of Athenyans, hauynge assembled a certayne small nomber of their menne of warre, that were in the garnysonne in the countreye of Thrace, and a good nomber of their allyes estrangers, toke by secrett contract, the towne of Eone in the countrey of Thrace. whyche was a Colonie or a towne founded by the Medes, but than was theire ennemy. Notwithstandynge the Chalcydes and the Beotyans, beinge aduertysedde of the case, came to the succoures of the towne, and fourthwyth dydde chase hym away wyth great losse of hys people. The Peloponesia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, being retourned out of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Athe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Spartains and their next neighbours assembled togiders incontinently for to go to recouer the place of Pylus. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Peloponesians went not thider so sone. For that, that they were but newely come out of the countrey of Athens. And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelas it was commaunded by generall decree &amp; proclamacyon in all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey of Peloponese, that euery man shulde sende to the succoures of Pylus, and also commaunded three skoore shyppes that were aboute Corcire, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shuld come to that partie. Which passing by the distreate of Leucade, vsed so good diligence, that they arryued at Pylus, bifore that the Athenyans shippes, that were at Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthus, did perceyue theym. And on the othere side by lande the armie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> saide Peloponesians was there ready. But yet that notwithstandinge, bifore that the said ships arryued, Demosthenes had sent two brigantynes to Eurymedone, &amp; to the other that were at the sayde place of Iacynthus, that they shulde comme to succoure him, shewynge hym the daunger, wherein he was. who, immediatly,
<pb n="xcix" facs="tcp:18267:100"/>
as they had the newes, toke their iourney for to come thider. Duringe this time, and bifore that they arryued, the Peloponesians prepared themself to assaile the place, aswell on the sea syde, as on that same by lande, trustynge to take it easely. bothe for that, that the walle was freshly &amp; newly made, and also for that, that there were small nomber of people to kepe it. And yet neuerthelas for that they doubted that the shippes wyth Athenyans, that were at Iacinthus shuld come to succoure theym, they determynedde, if they coulde take the place before the suc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cours came, for to inclose the entrye of tht hauon, in suche manner that the sayd Athenyans shippes shulde not enter therin, whyche thinge semed vnto them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry easy to be done, for that, that there was directly against the rocke, wherupon was sytuated the place of Pylus, a small Islande named Factoria, whiche exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all alongest the hauon, and by that meane made the hauon suer. And neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelas the entringes therof was straight, so that on the towne side, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians had made their rampars, there could enter but two ships on fronte, and on the other side towards the lande, eyght or nyne. which Island was holy baraine, &amp; by that meane not inhabited, and in maner not freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, conteigning fiftene stades or forlonges aboute. Than for to empesche and stoppe the entrye of the sayd hauonne from the Athenians, they bestowed suche nomber of shippes ther, as they thought necessary for to occupy all the fronte. whiche had theire former parte of the hauonne and the remenant wythin. And moreouer fearynge that the sayde Athenyans shulde lande people wythin the sayde lytle Islande, they sette there one parte of theirs. And the other abodde in the lande, to the ende, that the ennemyes might not lande, nother in the land, nor in the Islande. And to the rest it was not possible to succour the place by any other wayes. For on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side, by the whiche it was enuironned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the sea, there were no good depthes where the shippes mighte arryue surely. And by that meane they thoughte, that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faightinge and wythout puttinge themselfe into daunger and hazart, they might take that same place in shorte tyme, beinge ill furnished of victuailes and of people. Nowe they had ordeyned, that for to bestowe and putte wythin the sayde Islande, a certaine nomber of all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paignies, shuld be taken, that shuld be changed euery daye. And so it happened, that the laste that were sente thyder, were to the nomber of foure houndred and twenty, of whome, Epitadas sonne of Molobee had the charge. Demosthenes, seinge that the Peloponesians prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themselfe for to assaylle aswell by sea, as by lande, preparedde hymselfe to defende, And furste he causedde the galleys that remayned wyth hym to retyre vnder his rampares and inclosedde them wyth pales. And he armedde the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronners that were wythin them wyth mischeuous targottes or shieldes made in haste, the more parte of wyllos. For in suche a desarte place, there was no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion or hope to haue armure. And the same that they had there, had bene got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tone by force, from a galley and in a brigantine of the Messenyans, that they had takene, passinge that waye wyth forty men of the saide Messene, wyth whome they sarued themselfe at that nede wyth the othere. Hauynge than placedde one parte of hys people, aswell armed as naked, to the kepynge of the places y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> were assured, by reasone that the place, was not to be gottone or gone vnto, and the other parte, that was greater, to the defence of the quartier that he hadde forte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied towardes the lande: he commaunded them, that if the fote men came to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayle them, they shulde defende themselfe and repoulse them. And he wyth thre skoore of the beste armed and a nomber of people wyth shott, issued de fourthe of the place, and wente oute on the sea syde, where he thought that the ennemyes wolde parforce themself for to lande and to passe through the rockes and harde

places: on whyche the walle of the towne was moste weake and feable, for to battre and breake it, it they coulde. For it was not greately forcedde to make a stronge walle on that syde, not thynkynge that the ennemyes shulde euer haue bene strongest by sea. And he knewe well, that if it were the strongest, so that men myghte by that coste goo into the lande, the place shulde be loste. For thys cause he wente to that syde of the sea for to defende yt, wyth the nomber of people as afore, whome he orderedde and sette battaylle, the beste that he coulde, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes dydde speake vnto theym in this manner.<note place="margin">The ora<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But it is necessarye that we mynde to assaille valiantely oure ennemyes with a good couraige and wythe a good esperance to repoulse theym, and to escape frome all the daungers, wherein we be. Forsomuche as in all causes of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as thys same is at thys presente, men muste not oftymes serche after rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone, but they muste be soubdaynely hazardedde. And yet I doo see in oure af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayre manye thynges that be for oure aduantage, if we wyll to stande to theym and forsake not, for feare of the greate nomber of oure ennemyes, the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that we haue agaynste them. For I esteme one parte of the place that we holde to be, not to be comme vnto, and suffycyent for to ayde vs, if wee woll de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende yt. But if we habandonne and forsake yt (howe dyffycyle and harde soeuer it be) it shalbe easye to wynne, not beynge defendedde. Trewe it is, that we shalle haue the ennemyes somuche more sharpe to fyghte wyth, if we sette on theym whanne they be landedde, for that they shall parceyue that they maye not retyre withoute greate daungier. But consyder youe, that soo longe as they abyde in their shippes wythout landinge, they be easely resistedde. And if they do lande, thoughe they be in greate nomber, they be not to be feared. Forsomuche as the place is very difficille and vneasy for them, and the platt, where they muste fight, shalbe ryghte strayght and very lytle. And by that meane, if they come on lande, the nomber shall in nothynge sarue theyme for the incommoditie and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the place. And if they tary vpon their shyppes, of force they muste fyghte in the sea in whyche fyght there be many difficulties. Wherfore I compense and esteme to be egall asmuch, the difficulties &amp; dangers that they haue, as our smal nombre. For thys cause I praye youe (my frendes) that bringinge to youre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that youe be Athenyans, &amp; lykewyse that you be people all expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentedde to fyght wyth shyppes and on lande: youe woll consyder that he that remoueth not for feare of a wawe or sourge of the sea that maye comme, nothere of shypp, that maketh vnto hym: shalle neuer be repoulsedde frome one suche a place as thys. And lykewyse that youe wyll stande by it and repoulse your enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys in thies rockes and harde passages, and defende and kepe thys place, togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wyth your parsones. The Athenyans discouraged, beinge recomforted by thies short encouraigings and declarations, disposed themselfe to defende euery one in his quarter. On the other syde the Lacedemonyans, that were in campe on the lande side, came to assayle the rampares, and on the sea syde, those that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the shippes, whyche were .xliii. in nombere, wherof Thrasymelides,<note place="margin">Thrasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melidas</note> sonne of Cratesicles Spertayne was Capytayne, came to inuade the quarter, where Demosthenes was wyth his men. The Athenyans also defended themself very manfully on both sides. And as touchinge the quarter by sea, the Peloponesians came wyth small nomber of shippes by tournes or courses, one after the othere for that, that it was not possible to brynge thyder a greate nomber for to lande in the place, where Demosthenes &amp; his people were for to repulse them, if it were
<pb n="C" facs="tcp:18267:101"/>
possible. And amonge othere Brasidas, who was Capytayne of one of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, seynge that the place was difficile and daungerous to aboorde, and that for that cause the patrons of the galleys durste not approche, fearynge to bruse the vesselles: cryed wyth a lowde voice. It is greate shame to spare youre vesselles, where you see bifore your eyes those, whych haue fortefied yours, euen your la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de with walles. And commaunded them that they shuld rushe to lande, &amp; in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge their said vessels, they shuld sett on their ennemys &amp; not to be agreued to lose their shipps for to do saruice to the Lacedemonians, who had done them so many playsirs. But rather that they shuld fasten them on some parte that they might aboorde &amp; going a land might wynne the place and the ennemys. Insay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge thies woordes, Brasydas constrayned the patrone of the galley, whertin he was, to rushe against the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. But parforcing himself to la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de by a pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke of a ship, he was by the Athenyans hurt in many places of his bodye, so that he felle back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde amongeste the rowers, starke deade. But his shielde did fall into the sea, and afterwardes was caste by the wawes on lande. Whiche afterwardes the Athenyans dyd hange in the trophe or token, that they sett vp for that same vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye. The other Lacedemonyans had a ryght good wylle to lande, but it was tomuche daungerous, aswell for the difficultie of the place, as for the greate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that the Athenyans made, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out feare of any daungiers. And fortune was so farre ledde on both sides, that the Athenyans empesched or lettedde the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonyans to enter into their lande, or into that same, specyally of Laconia: and that those Lacedemonyans forced themselfe to lande in their proper lande, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was than in the handes of ennemys, though that in that season by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reporte, the Lacedemonyans were more puissant and more exercysedde in fyghtinge by lande, and the Athenyans in the same by sea. And the same endured all that same daye and on parte of the daye followynge, not contynually, but at dyuers tymes. The thyrde daye the Peloponesians sent one part of their shipps into Asinus for to fatche woode and stuf for to make and rayse vppe a walle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainste that same, that hadde bene made by the Athenyans aboute the poorte, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styng, that they might by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meane beate it downe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Engynes or instruments, though yt were than hyghe, for that, that yt myghte be battredde on all sydes. But thys indurynge, arryuedde the succours w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> shyppes of the Athenyans, that were at zachinthus, to the nombre of .lx. by meane that there were comme to the succurs somme frome Naupacte, and four frome Chio. whyche seinge the lande and the Islande shut or locked vp wyth fote men of the enemys and their ships, beinge wythin the poorte, not wyllynge to yssue fourthe, were in doubte what they shulde do. Yet they wente to ancre nighe vnto the desarte Island, and ther remaynedde that same daye. The morowe followynge they yssuedde into the mayne sea wyth all their shippes in battaille for to fighte, if the ennemys wolde haue yssuedde oute of the poorte, and for to sett vpon and assaille theym wythin that poorte, if they wolde not yssue fourthe. But those ennemyes, nothere ys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suedde fourthe at large into the sea, nor also fournyshedde the entrynge of the poorte, so, as they hadde determined at the beginning. But wythout remouinge frome lande, replenishedde their shippes that were by the sea syde, and kepte themself all ready to fyght wyth them that entredde into the porte, whych was suffyciently greate. Whiche knowin, the Athenyans came wyth force of oores di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly against them from sides of the entrynges of the poorte for to charge vpon the galleys of the sayd enemys that were formest in the sea, &amp; soo dyd put them to flyght. And for that, that the place was strayght and narrow, they did breke one great parte therof &amp; did take fyue, whereof one was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the people in it.
<pb facs="tcp:18267:102"/>
And moreouer they pursued the other that were retyred towards the land, wher of they dyd breake some that were emptie, and fastened them, and caried them awaye wyth theirs in the sight of the Peloponesians. who, seinge that, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge to great sorowe for that same losse, &amp; specially that their people that were in the Islande, shulde be loste, did caste themselfe on their fete, all armed, as they were, into the sea and came to wythdrawe their shippes for to kepe them that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Athenyans shulde not cary them away, with so greate courage, that it semed to euery one of them that al was lost, through his fault, if he wente not thider. And so the tumulte was great on both sydes. And in all partes newe and contrary to the accustomed manner, both on the one parte and on the other. For the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s through the fear y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had to lose their people, did in maner, as to say, fight fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the land in the sea. And the Athenians for the desyre y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had to ensue their victory, did fight out of their ships hand to hande, as though they had bene on lande. And fynally after a longe fight, wherin there was a greate nomber of dead &amp; hurt men on both sydes, they retired and departed. And yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyens saued all their ships, except the fiue, that were taken at the beginning. And euery man beinge retourned into hys campe, the Athenians did restore vnto the other, their deade. And after sett vp a Trophe in signe of victory. And that done they enuironned and compassed aboute all the Islande wyth their shippes, wher in the four houndred &amp; twenty Lacedemoniens were. whome they kept and did holde, as captyue and takenne. On the other syde, the Peloponesians that were from all partes arryuedde for to succour Pylus: kepte the towne assieged in the quarter towards land, whan the newes of this ouerthrowe were vnderstanded and declaredde at Sparte, it was determyned by the counsaille, that the officers of the cytie shulde go vnto the places for to viewe and descryue, and afterwards to aduyse what was to be done, like as they were accustomed to do, whan they had receyued anny greate losse. who hauinge viewed the whole, and considering that there was no remedy to succour their people that were in the Islande, and that there was danger lest that they shulde be aither takene, or dead through fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myne, or by force: consyderedde the greate nomber of people that were agaynste theym they concluded to treate a peace wyth the Capytayne of the Athenyans. Duringe the whyche, those Lacedemonyans shulde sende vnto Athens, for to treate the appoinctement. Hopinge by that meane to recouer theirs. And soo the truse was accepted by the Athenyans vpon suche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions, that the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans shulde geue and delyuer them all the shyps, wherwyth they had foughte at Pylus, and all those that had bene there assembled out of all the countrey of Laconie, and that they shulde nother assayle nor doo annye dommage vnto the walles and ram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To wytt, somuch for euery free man, and the half for the sklaues, and as touchinge the fleshe to be at the discretion of the Athenyans. Withoute that, that it was liefull vnto them to carie thider, nor any shipp to passe thider, secretly.

And by thys meane that they shulde be all aised to haue yt, by delyueryng the people, that were in the Islande in their power.

By whose opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon, it was answered to the sayd Ambassadours, that furst &amp; bifore all things, they, that were in the Islande, muste render themself wyth their armure, &amp; shuld be brought prysonners vnto Athens, And that done, whan the Lacedemonyans had rendred vnto the Athenyans, Nyse, Pege, Trezene and the countreye of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaie, whiche, they had not loste by warre, but by the former appoinctment, that they had made wyth the sayd Lacedemonyans, whan they were very lowe: had bene constraynedde to leaue and forsake them: the saide prysonners might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and some reasonable appointment made to the contentacyon of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

After their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the treuese were incontyne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly expyred that were made at Pylus. By reason wherof, the Lacedemonyans demaunded that the Athenyans shulde render to them the shippes, that they had delyuered by the treatie of the treuese according to that, whyche therby was appoyncted. But the said Athenyans refused that to do, sayinge, that the sayd Lacedemonyans had done agaynste the sayde treatie, forsomuche as they had made assaultes vpon the garnysons of the sayd Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And charged theym wyth some thynges, where there was no apparance of raysonne, but all theire foundation and grounde was for that, that in the sayde treatie it was concluded, that if one of the partyes dyd fayle or do againste anny thinge therin, howe lytle soeuer yt was, that they shulde not helpe themself with the sayd treatie.

And said right gloriously, that he feared not the Lacedemonyans, and that he wolde goo thider w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out taking one man of Athens. But he wold cary the soldyars of Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne and Imbricie, whiche were than in the cytie, all well armed, and some othere armed wyth targattes, whyche were sente from Ene, with a certayn nomber of Archers, whome he wolde take in other places, to the nomber of foure houndred. Wyth the which, and those that were already at Pylus, he auaunted himself that w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in twenty daies, he wolde bryng the Lacedemonyans that were in the Island, prysonners into Athens, orels wolde slaye theym. At whyche so glorious spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, the Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s did laughe: and yet they were glad therof, thinking y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one of two things shuld happene: aither that they shuld by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meane be delyuered from the importunitie of Cleon, who was tedyous vnto them already, if he failled to do the thynge, wherof he auaunted hymself (as the moste parte thoughte, that yt shuld so be) orells if he did it, that he shuld bringe the Lacedemonyans into their power. Beinge than the thinges so deliberated and concluded in the assemblie of the common people, Cleon was by the voyce &amp; opynyons of them chosene, made and created Empereur and Capytayne of the armye, in stede of Nycyas. And he named Demosthenes to be his adioyned compaignyon, who was in the campe, for that, that he parceued that he was of opynyon to go to assayle, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the Isla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, those, that were there. Also the souldyours, seyng the incommodytie of the place, and that they were more assieged, than those, whiche they did assiege, desired to hazarde the matter. And this also gaue them couraige therunto, that they parce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Isla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to be already discouered in many places, where the woodes were

burned. whiche at the beginning, whan the siege was there layde, it was so thick with woode, by reason that no man had haunted it, that it was in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to passe through it. whyche was the cause whye Demosthenes feared at the begynning to enter into it. For it semed vnto him, that it was the aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage of them, that were wythin. for somuche as whan he had landed there wyth great puissance those, that were within hydde &amp; in couert in dyuers places mighte doo greate do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maiges to hys people, whyche he coulde not do vnto them that were hid through the wood, and dyd know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> passages &amp; paths therof.

And besides all thies reasons, that moued Demosthenes, yet the ouerthrowe, whych he had at Ethiole, whiche chaunced him partely by lyke occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of woode, caused him mooste to feare.

After that, whan the daye beganne to be clere, the rest of the army, that was yet the in the shipps whyche were arryued at the Islande, that were to the nomber of foore skoore or theraboute, landed all in the Islande. To wytt, those whiche were at the furste siege, and those, that Cleon had brought, those resarued, that were lefte to kepe the campe and the munityons. Amonge whome, there was about eyght houndred Archers and as many caryinge targattes lightly armed, whyche De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes did appoincte all in that same sorte. For he did sett theym in dyuers bendes, the one distant from the othere, at two houndred men for the bende, &amp; in some parte lesse accordinge to the capacytie of the places. And he caused theym to gette euery where the hyghest of the place for to do the mooste displeasure to the ennemys. Compassing them on many sydes, to the ende, that they shuld not knowe on what parte to tourne themself for the great multitude of people, that they shulde see charged vpon them on all parties. For if they tournedde agaynst them, that assaylled them at their backe: they that were afore them, wold ronne vpon them. And the lyke thinge did those that were behinde, if they marchedde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste them that were afore. And whan they tournedde vpon them that were on the sydes, they were assailled both by those from afore, and also by those, that were behynde. And by that meane on euery parte where they tourned, they were alwayes compassed behynde wyth those that were lightly armedde. who didde attainct and sett vpon them inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tynetly. And the Archers did hurte them afarre of wyth arrowes, wyth dartes, wythe stones, caste wyth hande, and with slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And also they kepte not their standinge whan men charged on them. For it is their custome to vainquishe by flyinge, for that, that they did shote and caste without cessinge. And whan the ennemys did retourne, they were at their backe. Suche order dyd Demostenes kepe, aswel at the entry into the Islande, as also after that he was entred, in all that same fyght. whan Epitadas and those that were wyth him in middes of the Islande, whiche was the greatest nomber, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceued that their watche, and those that were in the former strength were discom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyted, and that all the company came hastely agaynste them, they dyd putt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But they coulde not come hande to hande, nother shewe their valyantnes against them. For the Archers &amp; throwers, and those that were lightly armed, who came on the sydes and wynges, did empesche them. wherby, they parceyuynge that, marched not against the sayd Athenyans. But kept them selfe in theire order and remoued not, but whan the said light armed did appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che nighe vnto them.

In suche sorte they didde fyghte a certayne space of tyme, in maner of a escharmushe. And afterwards the light armed, parceyuinge that the Lacedemonyans were already wery and slowe to follow them so oftene, did take more couraige and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For than they wente muche in greate feare agaynst them, for the greate renomme of their hardynes, and so they rushed wyth greate cryes, all at ones vpon them, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stynge arrowes stones and othere shotte, suche as they hadde euerye one in his hande. At whyche crye and manner of combate and fighting, the Lacedemony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb facs="tcp:18267:107"/>
who hadde not bene therunto accustomed, were all astonied. And on thoder parte, the powder of the ashes, that came from the places where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyer had bene, was so greate in the ayer, that they coulde nother see, nor by any meane auoyde the shot that was cast agaynst them. In maner that they were in great perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itie. For theire sallettes and cappes of yrone coulde not couer them fro the shott, theire speares were brokene and frushed wyth stoanes that were caste agaynste them, and moreouer they beynge enuyroned and assayled on all sydes, dyd nott see those, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> assailed them, nother they coulde heare what thinge they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to do, for the greate crye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thennymys did make. So that they knewe not what to do, and also did not se any meane to saue themselfe. Fynally y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more parte of them being alreadie hurt, they retyred all togeders towardes the castell, whiche was in the ende of the Islande, where there was one part of thair people. whiche parceyued by the light armed, they approched yet more boldely withe greate cryes and strokes of shott, and those that departed fro the trowpe, were slayne incontynently. But one great parte saued them self through the woodes, and came to ioygne wyth them, that were at kepynge of the castell. And all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geder prepared themselfe for to defende that syde thereof, that was assaultable. The Athenyans followed theym veary nighe. And neuerthelas seyng that they coulde not assiege the place on all sydes, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature &amp; dyficultie therof, bestowed them selfe in a place more higher. Fromewhence wyth force of shott, and by all meanes that they could, they parforced themself to chase y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other out of the castel. But they defended themself veary hardely. In such sorte that the combate endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the greater parte of one day. Through occasion wherof, they were all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed of the one part and of the other, wyth heate, drough and trayuaile. For the Lacedemonyans, had meane and power to defend themselfe, for that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they coulde not be enuyroned nor assayled by the sydes. The matters, beyng in thies termes, and the duke of Messenyans, seyng that there was no ende, came vnto Cleon and to Demosthenes and sayde vnto them that they trayuailed themself in vayne to thincke to take thennymies in that same sorte. But yf they delyuered hym a certayne nomber of footemen lightly armed and of Archers, he wold take payne to enter secreatly vpon the ennymies at their back in some maner. Whiche thing they dyd graunt hym. Who, hauyng the people that he had demaunded, ledde them the most secretly that he coulde throughe the rockes and through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brokene places of the Islande, tournyng vntill he came to the quarter, whyche was not kept nor defended, for that, that yt semed to the Lacedemouyans, that yt defended yt self, by yt self, &amp; wythe the most payne of the worlde, he mounted &amp; skaled vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> height. Wherby, the Lacedemonyans, seing them to be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hynd them, were greatly astonyd &amp; in maner withoute hope. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Athenians, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> assailed them afore, did all reioyce, as certayne of the victory. In this estate the Lacedemonyans founde themselfe enclosed &amp; slayne on all sydes, as those, whiche did fyght agaynst Perses at Thermopiles, if comparyson may be made of grete thinges, vnto small. For as those, being there surprised by smal passages &amp; paths of the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teigne on all sydes, were al slayn: so thies, being here hurt on all parts, defended themself no longer. But perceyuing themself in so small no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber agaynst so great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of enemis, &amp; being moreouer faint &amp; ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> famine, droughe and wyth trauaylle: lefte and habandonned the defenses.

And whan one partie did caste on the grounde their shielde clappinge theire handes, whyche was a tokene, that they accepted the partie. And so made treuese for a small space.

And so caused with all diligence workemenne to come frome Athens, togiders with Ironne and other necessarye matter, with suche expedition that within a veray small tyme they acheued the walle. Whiche they beganne at the ende of that same, whiche they hadde takene frome the syde of Megare. And frome thence, they wrought it on bothe sydes of Nysee, into the sea, and fourthwith dyd close it with dyches. For whan the one was busyed at the walle, thoder were occupyed at the dyches. And dyd take the stone, the bricke, and the woode in the suburbes. Also they dyd cutte downe the trees, that were there aboute. And where there lacked matter, they ramparde in, earthe with pynnes of woode.

And the Athenians, hauyng wonne Nisee, and broken the longe walle, that came frome the cytie vnto Nisee, they prepared themself for to assiege and assaille the cytie of Megare. Nowe it chaunced that in that same seasone, Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidas, sonne of Tellides Lacedemonien, was in the quartier of Corinthe and of Sicione for to assemble people of the countrey of Thrace. who vnderstandyng the takyng of the walles of Megare, and doubting that the Peloponesians, that were at Nisee, were in danger: he sent vnto the Beotians with all diligence and commanded, that they shulde come towardes hym inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test bende that they coulde vnto Tripodisque. Whiche is a burgage in the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Megare, vnder the mountaigne of Gerania. From whiche place, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe came with two thousande seuen houndred Corinthians well armed, foore houndred Philasiens, and seuen houndred Sycioniens, besyde the other, that he hadde already assembled, not knowing yet of the taking of Nisee, the whiche he vnderstode there. And forthwith, bifore that the ennemyes were aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of hys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng, for that, that he was ariued by nyght, he wente with foore houndred of the best of hys compaignie, straight to the citie of Megare, faig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, that he would take Nysee by stealth. But for trougth, hys pryncipall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente was to entre into the citie, if he hadde coulde, and to haue furnyshed it. And whan he was come vnto the gates, he demaunded of the Megarians that they should lette hym in, geuyng them good hope to take incontinently Nysee. But bothe the bendes, fearyng hys commynge, to wytte, the one for doubte, leste he shulde brynge agayne the bannyshed into the towne, and chase them from thence: and the frendes of the bannyshed, leste the other for feare there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, shoulde fyght agaynste theym, and that throughe occasion of their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the Athenyans that were nyghe, there vnto them, shoulde take the Cytie: they were of opinion not to receyue the sayed Brasidas, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to see, who shoulde haue the victorye, of the Athenians or of the Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponesians. For the partakers, of aither of the parties, dyd attende to declare

themself to fauoure that parte, that shall haue hadde the better. Brasidas than seyng, that by no meane he coulde enter: returned towardes the other people of his army. And the same day bifore that it was clere, the Beotians arryued, who, bifore that they hadde receyued the letters from Brasidas, vnderstandyng the commynge of the Athenians, were come fourth with all their strength, for to succoure the Megarians. For that, that they estemed the danger to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnto them. But whan they were in the lande of Platee, hauyng there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued the letters from Brasidas: they were muche more assured. And so dyd sende twelue houndred foote menne and sixe houndred horsemenne, vnto Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidas, and the other retourned euey man vnto his house. After that they were all ioigned togider with Brasidas, they were aboute sixe thousande. On the other syde, the Athenians kepte themselfe in battaille aboutes Nisee, resarued the fote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lightly armed, who being disparsed &amp; skattered abrode in the fieldes, were assailled and repoulsed by the horsemen Beotians euen vnto the sea, bifore that the Athenians did knowe the coming of the said Beotians. For they came neuer bifore, to the succours of Megare. Wherefore they doubted them not. But anon as they sawe them, they issued agaynst them, and there was a veray longe fight among the horsemen, so that it coulde not be well iudged who hadde the better thereof. And although that on the Beotians parte, the Capitaine &amp; some other were slaine, whiche aduentured themfelf, euen vnto the walles of Nisee, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion whereof, the Athenians hauing rendred the carkasses by appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So and in suche wyse, that one coulde not attrybute the victory more to the one, than to the other. And so the Beotians retyred to their compaignie, and the Athenians to Nysee. After that, Brasidas hauyng chosen a comodious place by the sea syde and nigh inough to Megare, lodged there his campe, and remoued not, attending that the Athenians shoulde come to assaille the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For he thought that they of the citie would regarde and marke who should haue the better, and that beyng there ready to fight without assailling the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes or putting any thing in hazarte, he should haue the victorye. And as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng the citie he thought to haue done ynough. Forsomuche as if he hadde not come, the Citezens durst not haue assayed the fortune of the battaille agaynste the Athenians, and by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane shuld haue lost the citie. But seyng the succours to become, &amp; that those Athenians durst not fight, it semed vnto hym, that they would accept him and his bende into the citie, and by that meane without effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of bloud, &amp; without daunger, he shuld haue that, that he was come for. Lyke as it happened afterwardes. For the Athenians did rancke themself in battaille nyghe to the longe walles, hauing the selfe opinion that the Athenians had: to witte, not to fyght, except he came to assaulte them, for that, that they thought, that there was greater apparance and raisonne for them not to begyn the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taill, than for the other, considered, that they had had already manye victories. Wherefore, if at that houre being in lesser nomber they had hazarded it and the other had had the victory, he would so haue followed it, that the citie shuld haue been lost thorugh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or that they shuld lose one great parte of their army. And also they persuaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self that the other shuld rather begyn. For that, that they were of dyuers cities, whereby they presumed that they shuld not haue pacience to refrayne, as they that were all Athenians. In this manner, hauing longe atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the one syde and on the other, they retyred and did withdrawe themself to wytte, the Athenians to Nisee, and the Peloponesians to the place, from whence they were departed. Than the Magarians those that were frendes of the exiles,

parceyuyng that the Athenians durst not assaille thoder, they dyd take courage, and with the pryncipallest of the towne, openned the gates vnto Brasidas: and receyued hym into the towne, as hauyng the victorye. And came to parlamente with hym, whereby those of the other bende, were in greate feare. And anone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the people that were come at commandement of Brasidas retourded euery man into his quarter.

The Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s also retourned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence into their countrey. By occasion whereof, those, that had been of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuracion and conspiracie and of the treatie, for to cause them to come: parceiuing that they were discouered, withdrewe themself secretly out of the citie. And the other, hauing spoken with the parentes of the exiles, called agayne those, that were at Pegne, with greate othes neuer more to remember the innuries passed. But rather to geue themself with one accorde to the common weale of the citie. But within a certaine tyme after: they being chosene to offices and gouernance of the towne: whan the musters of the people were made, knowyng the armure of them that had bene the chief of thintelligence with the Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the nomber of a houndred, whom they caused to dye by iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the sayed people.

In this manner Brasidas trauersed the countrey of Thrace, bifore that any tyme was had for to empesche or lett his passage. And he went vnto Perdiccas, who was in Chalcide, whiche Perdiccas &amp; the other Thraciens that were reuolted &amp; turned against the Athenians, vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding their prosperitie, &amp; fearing to be by them assailled, had required succours of the Peloponesians, principally those of Chalcide, forsomuche as they feared that the Athenians would come first vpon them. And also for that they did vnderstande y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the other cities, their neighbours, that were not rebelled, did coniure &amp; conspire already againste them for to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. And as touchinge Perdiccas, albeit that he was not their ennemye declared, yet he feared the ennemyties, that he had had with them in tymes pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; for that cause demanded ayde, of the Lacedemonians against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so against the king of Lyncesters, whome he had determyned wholy to subdue. An other occasion there was for the which that armye came out of the countrey of Peloponese. Whiche was, that the Lacedemonians, parceiuing the euyl chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were happened to them, and that the Athenians had done many enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises in their countrey: they thought that there was nothyng more expediente to diuerte and tourne them, than to make some alarme to their allyes.

For we other Lacedemonians, thynkyng of the occasion and chance of thynges, that we haue made to come hither, as to oure good frendes, and to those, that shulde desire oure comyng: we haue enterprised this voiage, without hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde to da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, wherein we did putt our self, by passyng through so long space of lande and of strange countreis, for to shewe the good wille, that we haue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you.

Wherefore if any one among you were heretofore of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyse, that they shuld not be fought with, lett hym change fromhensfourthe his opinion.

For after that we had vainquished them at Cheronee, whan they did possesse oure lande through the sedicion and diuision of oure people, we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes holden all our countrey of Beoce in greate suertie.

In whych case, whan there ys true warre: to those that be in necessitie, it is conuenable that God do pardone them: that whyche they be constrayned to do of necessytie. For recours is had to the goddes and to the aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for to obteigne remyssyon of synnes, whyche be not commytted wyllingly. And those be estemed euyll and synners towardes them, whych synne wyllingly, and not those, that do any thynge of necessitie. But those oughte muche more to be estemed euyll and contempnors of goddes: whyche for rendrynnge of deade corpses, wold haue the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples: rather than those: which for not rendring of holly thynges: refuse to take that whyche raysone wolde to be rendred vnto them. And thys they declared that they were not determyned to departe oute of the lande of Beoce. For they pretended to kepe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, wherin they were wyth good right and not by force. And yett ueuertheles, they demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of the said Beotians, that they shulde permytt them for to fetche away their deade men accordynge to the custome of Grece. To thys demaunde and proposition the Beotians answered, that if the sayd Athenyans dydde take it to be in the lande of the Beotians, they shulde departe wyth their baguage. And if they pretendedde to be in theirs, they knewe what they hadde to do. For the lande of Oropie, wherin their people were slayn, was in the iurisdictyon of the sayde Athenyans. wherefore those Beotians, not kepynge their deade men agaynst their will, they were not bounde to render them vnto them, but departinge from their lande, yt was very raysonable, that that thynge, whyche they demaunded, shulde be delyuered. In this manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned the heraulte of the Athenyans wythout doynge any thynge.

For the which hardynes and magnanymytie, he iudged them to be people, for to beare and endure valiantly and vertuously any other great affaire, if it happenned vnto them. And also he toke it welle, that they shulde be alwayes good and faythfull frendes of the Lacedemonians. And by that meane shuld be in all thinges pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and honored by them. Through whiche woordes &amp; declarations, the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onians dyd conceyue and take greate courage: in suche sorte, that they all with one accorde (aswell those, that toke the matter to be euil at the beginnyng, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the other) determined to susteigne warre agaynste the Athenians, if the case chaunced. And aboue manye honors whiche they dyd to Brasidas, they sette a crowne of golde vpon his hedde: as to the deliuerer of Grece, and as to a man priuately theyr frende and well doer: they dyd geue hym a Chapelette or small garlande of vigne, and went to visett hym in his lodging, as was vsed to them, that had had the victorye of a battaille.

To thintent to assaye, if he myght with their ayde, gett Me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and Potydee, bifore the Athenians shuld come to their succours, as he doubted, that they would do. But hauyng already made the treatie with certayne of the sayd townes, bifore that he executed it, there came vnto hym out of a galley Aristonymus.<note place="margin">Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus.</note> from the partie of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. And Atheneus from the partie of the Lacedemonians, who notefyed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym the trefues. By occasion whereof, Brasidas retourned fromethence to Torone. At which place the sayd Ambassadours declared vnto hym more amply the tenour of the tratie. Whiche was approued and receyued by all the allyes, that were in Thrace, aswell on the one partie, as of the other. But Aristonimus, though that he approued all the sayd treatie, yet he sayd, that the Scyonyans were not therein comprised, forsomuche, as they rebelled after the date of the trefues. Whereunto Brasidas did replye, and maignteigned that they rebelled bifore. And for effect sayd, that he would not rendre them, so that the matter or thyng remayned, as broken. And after that Aristonymus hadde reaported that same at Athens, al the Athenians were of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to begyn warre against the sayd Scyonians and dyd prepare themself, for to make it. Whiche thing being come to the knowlage of the Lacedemonians, they sent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ambassade, shewyng them, that they went agaynst the treatie. And that wrongfully they would reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the sayd ctie of Scyone. vpon the reasons that Brasidas did shewe, and that if they would go thider by force, those Lacedemonians and their allyes would defende the sayd Scionians. But if they would that the matter were putt and referred to knowliage and into iudgemente, they were there with well contented. whereunto the Athenians made answere, that they would not putt their estate in hazarte of iudgemente, but were determyned to go agaynst the sayd Scyony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, as fast as they coulde, thinking and holding it for certaine, that if they of the Islandes would rebelle, the succours of the Peloponesians by lande, coulde in nothyng sarue them. And for trouthe the Athenians had good quarelle, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng
<pb facs="tcp:18267:126"/>
that. For it was certaynly founde that the rebellion of the Scioniens was two dayes after the conclusion of the treatie. This was the decree, of the greater parte and opinion of the Athenians made, in followyng thaduys of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that men shoulde go to take Scyone, and slaye all the Citizens. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto they prepared themself. But in the meane tyme the cytie of Mende rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lykewyse,<note place="margin">Menda.</note> whiche is in the countrey of Pallene, inhabited and founded by the Ericrians. Whiche Brasidas receyued lykewyse, perswadyng hymself to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thynge agaynste reasone, though that it was done duryng the trefues, forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as the Athenians dyd lykewyse the contrarye. Whiche was the reasone, whereby those of Mende hadde takene boldenes for to rebelle, knowynge the wylle and deliberacion of Brasidas, and also seinge the experyence of the Scio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, whome he would not forsake. And also considering that though that they: that hadde brought to passe the treatie of the rebellion were in small nomber, and had greate feare to execute it: yet they lefte not to essaye it, and fearyng to be discouered, had wonne the other, that were the greater partie, albeit that it was contrarye to theyr expectacion. The Athenians, beinge aduertised of this rebellion, were yet more prouoked and stirred, and prepared themself for to go to destroy the sayed two rebelled cyties. But in the meane tyme, that they made their preparacions and afore that they aryued, Brasidas hadde withdrawen the women and childrene out of the same two cyties.

And lykewyse if there be any vertue in the enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, whereof we be not aduertised: lette vs assaille them the more assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye. Wherefore as touchyng thies here, that come agaynste vs, they bee to be feared of people, that knowe them not: for the greate nomber that they be of, whiche ys fearefull to beholde, and also horrible to here: for the greate bruyte, that they make, aswell by cryinge, as also by shakynge and clatterynge of their harnesse. Whiche be all but only menaces and threatenynges. But whan they come to fyght agaynste the people, that be not thereof abasshed, they shewe themself not to be suche. For they be not ashamed to recuyle and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandone their place, whan they be straightly charged vpon. For that, that they kepe no order. And by this cause it is asmuche honoure for them to flye, as to assaulte. Wherefore no man canne iudge their hardines.

And for conclusion ye see all the feare that is to be hadde of them. Whiche is greate to syghte, and to the hearynge: but in battaille it is very smalle. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yf ye susteigne and withstande theyr power, whan they come to charge vpon you, and afterwardes doo retyre by lytle and lytle in good order, youe shall ryghte shortely comme in faulftie into a sure place. And shall knowe for the tyme to comme, that the nature and manner of this people: is to make a farre of, very great craakes and menaces, and to shewe great hardines to them, that they do parceyue to be ready to receyue them: and to retourne and shewe themself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonyed, whan men ioigne nere vnto them, and that they wolle fyght hande to hande. For in this case, they shewe their valyantnes, in sauyng and kepyng them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in suertie.

               <p>IN the begynnynge of wynter those, that were wyth Ramphias pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedde furthere vnto the mounte Pierie, whiche is in Thessale. But they of the countrey denyed them their passage. By occasion wherof &amp; also hauynge vnderstande the death of Brasidas to whom that bend shulde haue bene brought, they retourned home. For they also thought, that yt was no tyme to renewe the warre, consideryng that the Athenyans were retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and that they were not people for to parfaicte and acheue the enterpryses of Brasidas. And on the othere syde they dyd know that at their departure from Sparta, the Lacedemonyans were more enclynedde to peace, than vnto warre. And in effecte after the conflycte at Amphipolis and the retourne of Ramphias frome Thessale, there was no exploicte of warre bitwene the Athenyans and the Lacedemonyans, for both parties desired rather peace than warre. To wytt, the Athenyans by cause of the losse that they had had at Delos furst, and sone after at Amphipolis. By reasone wherof they estemed not their force, somuch as they did at the begynnyng whan it was spoken of the appoynctment, whych they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, for that that they trusted tomuche in their prosperytie, and also greatelye feared leste their allyes seynge their case and chance to declyne and decaye, shuld reuolte and rebelle, and therfore repented the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self hartely that they dyd not make peace fourthwyth after the victorye, that they had at Pylus. On the othere syde the Lacedemonyans desyred yt, forsomuch as it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced otherwyse in the warre, than fro the begynninge they thought yt wolde haue done. For they dyd thinke that wastynge the terrytorye of the Athenyans, in short tyme they shulde haue destroyed them and brought them vnder. And also for the greate losse whyche they hadde made at Pylus. whyche was the greateste that they of Sparte had euer had. And somuche the more, for that that the ennemyes that were wythin Pylus and wythin Chitera ceased not to ouerronne and pillage their countrey there nexte adioygninge. And besydes that, their sklaues oftentymes rendredde themself to the sayd ennemyes, and also were contynuelly in feare, leste the other wolde do the lyke, by encouraigemente of those, that were gone fro them. There was also an other reasone, that is, that the trefues whyche the sayde Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans had made for thirty yeares wyth the Argyues shulde shortely expyre, the whyche they were not mynded to contynue, excepte the sayd Argyues wolde ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to them the lande of Cynuria.<note place="margin">Cinuria</note> And also they parceyued theymselfe not to be puissant inoughe for to make warre both agaynste the Athenyans and againste them, and somuche the moore for that they fearedde leste some of the cyties that dyd take their partie in the countrey of Peloponese, wold tourne from their side, lyke as afterwardes it happened. For thies respectes and reasons both the one &amp; the other partie desyred to haue peace.

By meane whereof all the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages that were afterwardes happenedde to the Lacedemonyans, were impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedde vnto him. And furthermore he was chargedde that he and Aristoteles his brother hadde entysedde a dyuyneresse that was at Delphos,<note place="margin">Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</note> and pronouncedde the aunsweres of the god Apollo, so that shee in the name of that god and as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spyredde by hym, hadde answeredde vnto the Messengers whiche the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyans hadde sente thider for to vnderstande and knowe the wylle and opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon of the god touchinge the warre, in this manner and substance.

Chapter.</head>
               <p>DUrynge the sommer, whereof we speake, the Athenyans dyd take the cytie of Sycione, and dyd slay all the men of .xiiii. yeres and vpwards, and dydde delyuer theire lande to the Plateans for to laboure, &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer dydde reduce and brynge agayne to Delos the Cytezeins that were dryuene and chasedde fromthence, hauynge regarde aswell to the dommai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which they had susteigned throughe the warre: as also to the oracles of the goddes. The Phocyans also and the Locrians beganne to warre among them. And the Corinthians and Argyues that already had made allyaunce togiders, came to the cytie of Tegee,<note place="margin">Tegea.</note> hopyng for to wythdrawe it from the obeissance and allyance of the Lacedemonians. And by meane thereof (considered that it hadde a great terrytorie) to withdrawe all Peloponese. But the Corinthians parceuing that those of Tegee wolde not departe from the Lacedemonyans for anny euyll wyll that they bifore tyme had had agaynste the same Lacedemonyans, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned very quickly, for they feared that no othere woolde afterwardes render themselfe vnto them, sens that those there had refused yt. And yet notwythstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge they sente vnto the Beotians, for to require them, to be wylling to reallie themself wyth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and with the Argyues, &amp; to the reste that they shuld gouerne themself by common accorde. And moreouer for somuche as the sayde Beotians had takene a trefues of tenne dayes wyth the Athenyans, soone aftere the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syon of the peace of fyftie yeares, wherof we haue spokene here bifore: they requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that they woolde sende an Ambassade wyth theym to the Athenyans, to whome they wolde go for to compryse theym in the sayde trefues: and in case they woolde not do ytt, that the sayd Beotyans shuld renounce the said trefues, and shulde not afterwardes make annye treatie of peace nor of trefues wythout the sayde Corynthyans. whereunto the Beotiens made aunswere, that as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge the allyaunce, they woulde consulte and determyne vpon yt. And as for the reste that they woolde sende of theire people wythe theyme to Athenes and woolde requyre the sayde Athenyans to be wyllynge to compryse the sayde Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthyans in the trefues of tenne dayes. But the Athenyans made aunswere that if the sayde Corinthyans were allyedde wyth the Lacedemonyans, they were suffyciently allyedde wyth them, and that they nededde no other thynge. Parcey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge whyche aunswere the sayde Corinthyans made instance vnto the Beoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans that they shulde renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the trefues of tenne dayes, but they woulde not for all that do it. And finally, the Athenyans were content to make trefues with the Corinthyans wythout anny allyance. That same sommer the Lacedemonyans wyth their armye vnder conducte of Plistoanactes, their kinge, went agaynst the Parrhasiens whyche be in the countrey of Arcadie,<note place="margin">Parrha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sii.</note> subiectes of the Mantynyens called thider by certain of the cytezeins, by meane of a seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; mutynery which was amongest them: &amp; also to thintente to rase downe the walles, whyche those Mantynie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> town of Cypselle,<note place="margin">Cypsele</note> wherin they had put garnison. whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che towne was in the countreye of Siritide,<note place="margin">Siritiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb n="Cxxxv" facs="tcp:18267:137"/>
the sayd lande they dyd pyllage and waste it. Whiche perceyued by the Mantyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they lefte the garde of their cytie vnto the Argiues. And they with their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issance went for to succour their subiectes, but seyng that they coulde not defende them bothe they retourned fromethence. And by that meanes the Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans restored the Parrhasiens into lybertie, and rased downe the sayd walles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes they retournedde fromethence into their houses. And they beynge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tournedde the men at armes arryued, whiche were gone with Brasidas into the countrey of Thrace, whome Clearidas broughte agayne by sea after the peace made. And it was by decree publisshed and declared that all the esklaues whiche hadde bene in that same warre with the sayd Clearydas shoulde be franke &amp; free, and might go to dwelle where they woulde. Whome he sone after did sende with certayne other for to inhabitt in the towne of Leprea in the territorye of Eliens in the countrey of Lacedonia beynge alreadye in warre wyth those same Elyens.

Durynge all the same somer the Athenyanes and the Peloponesians v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and traffiqued merchandises togiders, although they suspected the one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Chifely the Athenians and the Lacedemonyans frome begynnyng of the peace, forasmuche as they had not rendred nothere on the one syde nor of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that, whiche was accorded and agrede vpon. For the Lacedemonyans, who shulde first haue restored, had not rendred Amphipolis nor the other places, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also had constrayned their allyes in the countrey of Thrace for to accept the sayd tratie of peace, nother lykewyse the Beotians and the Corinthians, though that they sayd continuallye, that if the sayd confederates woulde not accepte the treatie, they woulde ioigne themself with the sayd Athenyans for to constrayne them thereunto, and thereupon had assigned and prefixed a daye. But there was no mention thereof in wrytyng, that those, that would not ratefie and accept the sayd treatie, should be reputed ennemyes bothe of the sayd Athenians &amp; Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyans. But the Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s parceiuing that the sayd Lacedemonyans did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme nothynge of that whiche they had promysed, in effecte they had no good opinion that they woulde kepe the peace. And for this cause they likewise delayde to render Pilus vnto them and also repented that they had delyueredde the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners that they had takene in the Islande. And so reteigned lykewyse the other townes whiche they shulde haue rendred by the sayd treatie, vntill the tyme, that the Lacedemonyans had accomplished on their partie. Whiche Lacedemonyans did excuse themself, saying: that they had done all that they coulde. For they had rendred the prysoners whiche they had and also hadde withdrawin al their men of warre whiche were in Thrace, and for effecte obsaruedde all that was in their power, but as for to restore Amphipolis, that the same was not in their puissa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And to the surplusage, promysedde that they woulde parforce theymself to cause that the Beotians and Corinthians should enter into the treatie &amp; that Panacte
<pb facs="tcp:18267:138"/>
should be rendred to the sayd Athenyans. And lykewyse all the Athenyans, that were prysoners in the countrey of Beoce required the same Athenyans that they would be willyng to re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the citie of Pylus, or at the least, if they would not re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, that they shoulde withdrawe the Messenyans &amp; the esklaues, whiche they had put within it, lyke as the same Lacedemonyans had withdrawin their men of warre, whiche were in Thrace: and that they shoulde kepe the place with their oune people, if they woulde. In this manner durynge the same somer, passed all their affaires, to witte chiefly by dissymulacion, and neuerthelas dydde lyue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out warre: communicatyng or entremedlyng the one with the other.</p>

And by meane therof begyn againe afterwardes more easely the warre against the Athenians.

But bifore that they arryued, two of the chiefe offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of Argos came to encounter &amp; mete the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon the waye, &amp; had many deuyses with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for to vnderstand if it were possible that the Beotians would enter into their allyance, lyke as the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, the Mantiniens and the Eliens had done. Saying that, if that were done, they should be hable for to make warre againste the Athenians, orels welle by meane of the sayd Beotians and other their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates: for to come to some good appoynctmente wyth them. Whiche thynges were ryght agreable to the Beotians for that they dydde agree vnto thesame,
<pb n="Cxxxvi" facs="tcp:18267:138"/>
that their frendes of Lacedemonye had charged theym, and that those Argiues consented to the thing, whiche the other desired. And so they stayed vpon resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wyth theym, that they woulde sende their ambassadours into the countrey of Beoce, and that done they departedde. The Beotians beyng aryuedde in their countrey, they reapported to the gouernors of the cytie, all that, whiche they had vnderstandedde, aswelle of the Lacedemonyans as of the Argiues, wherewith those gouernours were welle pleasedde for that, the amytie bothe of the one and of the other was very mete and conueniente for them, and that of themselfe, the sayd parties dydde agree vnto one self ende, wythoute knowynge the one of the other. Soneafter came the ambassadours of the Argyues. Unto whome, after that they hadde bene heard, they made aunswere, that they would sende ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours vnto them for to treate of the allyance. In this meane tyme, those Beo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, the Corynthians, the Megarens, and the ambassadours of them of Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce assembled themselfes togiders, and concluded amongest them an allyance, for to succoure the one the other against all those, that woulde warre against them, and that they myghte not make warre, peace nor other treatie with any parsone, the one wythoute the othere. And also it was appoynctedde that the Beotians and Megarens, who were alreadye allyedde, shoulde make allyaunce vpon the same condicions, wythe the Argiues. But bifore that the Gouernours of Beoce shoulde conclude the sayed thynges, they shoulde make reapporte thereof to the fower counsailles of the sayd countrey: who hadde all the auctorite, perswading theyme that they shoulde be wyllynge to consente to the allyance with the sayd cyties and wyth all the other that would ioigne wyth them, and shewing them that it was for their proffytte. Whiche thyng the sayed counsaylles would not at the firste brunte agree vnto, fearing that it should haue bene against the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyans, if they shoulde haue allyed themself wyth the Corynthyans, who had rebelledde and were departedde frome theym. For the sayed gouernours hadde not aduertisedde them of the deuyses, whiche they hadde hadde with Cleobulus, Xenares and their other frendes of Lacedemonie. Whiche were, that they shulde furste make allyance with the Argiues and the Corinthyans, and afterwardes should conclude it with the Lacedemonyans. For the sayd gouernours thought assuredly that without declaring that same vnto the comons of the sayd fower counsailles, they woulde haue done that, whiche the sayd Gouernours woulde haue counsailledde them. But seing that it chaunced otherwyse therein, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inthyans and the ambassadours of Thrace retournedde fromethence withoute doinge any thynge. And the gouernours of the Beotians (who were determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, if they coulde haue obteignedde and perswadedde the same furste vnto their people for to essaye afterwardes to haue made allyance wythe the Argiues) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that they coulde not obteigne it, dydde speake nothyng therof. Also the sayd Argiues, who shoulde haue sente their ambassade, dydde not sende it. So that the thynges remaynedde vndone by a necligence and throughe defaulte of solly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cytynge. The selfe same wynter, the Olynthians dydde take the towne of Mecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berne with assaulte,<note place="margin">Mecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berne.</note> wherein the Athenians kepte their garnysone and pillaged it. After that, manye parlamentes beinge made bitwene the Athenyans and the Lacedemonyans, vpon the obseruaunce of the articles of the peace, specially vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condicion of the places on the one parte and of the other: those Athenians, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyng that if they dydde render Panacte vnto the Lacedemonyans, they woulde haue restoredde vnto theyme Pylus: sente an ambassade to the Beotians, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge theyme that they woulde delyuer the sayed towne togiders wythe the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners that they hadde of theirs. Whereunto the Beotians made aunswere that
<pb facs="tcp:18267:139"/>
they woulde not doo it, excepte the Lacedemonyans woulde make particuler allyance wyth theym, aswelle as they hadde done wyth the sayedde Athenyans. Whereupon the Lacedemonyans, thoughe they dyd knowe, that it was agaynst the allyance that was made with the Athenyans, whereby it was prouydedde that the one shoulde not make peace nor warre wythoute the othere, yett for the desier that they had for to recouer of the Beotians, Panacte, hopynge, by meane thereof to haue Pylus: and also for the inclynacion, whiche the officers than had, more to the sayed Beotians than to the Athenyans, to the intente to breake the peace: they made and accordedde the sayd allyance aboutes the ende of the wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. After the whiche made, in the begynnynge of the furste sprynge tyme, whiche was the .xi. yeare of the warre, the Beotians rasedde and vtterly destroyedde the sayed towne of Panacte. The Argiues parceyuynge that the Beotians had not sent vnto them the ambassadours for to make the allyance, lyke as they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysedde, and that they had beaten downe Panacte and made particuler allyance wyth the Lacedemonyans: they hadde greate feare least they alone shoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in warre wyth the sayed Lacedemonyans, and lest all the other cyties of Grece woulde reallye themself with theym. For they thought that that, whiche the Beotians had done at Panacte: was by knowlaige and with wyll of the sayd Lacedemonyans and also of the Athenyans, &amp; that they were all of one allyance. With whiche Athenyans those Argiues hadde no more hope of appoynctmente. For that same, whiche they hadde thereof hadde was, thynkynge that the ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance whiche was bitwene theym and the Lacedemonyans, shoulde not haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. For this cause being in greate perplexitie, &amp; fearyng leste that they should be forced to susteigne warre bothe agaynste the sayed Lacedemonyans and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyans and also agaynste the Theagites and Beotians, forsomuche as they hadde byfore tyme refused the appoynctemente with the sayd Lacedemonyans, &amp; coueted the Empyre &amp; the authorytie ouer all Grece: they sent their Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to the sayd Lacedemonyans, to wytt, Eustrophus and Eson,<note place="margin">
                     <p>Eustro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.</p>
                     <p>Aeson.</p>
                  </note> whom they thought to be great frendes and very agreable to them, for to treate the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tement. For they thoughte that whan they shuld be allyed wyth them, to what souer ende y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matters shuld falle or come, they shuld be well assured for the time that than ranne. Beinge than the sayd Ambassadours arryuedde at Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, they made theire proposition to the counselle, demaundinge peace and ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And for to treate yt, they dydde requyre that the difference that they hadde wyth the Lacedemonyans, by cause of Cynurie (which is in the terrytorie of the Argyues, and hathe vnder ytt woo cytyes, to wytte, Thyree and Athenye, and also ys peopled wyth Lacedemonyans) myghte be commytted to some cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being newter, or to some notable parsonage trusty to both parties. wherunto the Lacedemonyans dyd incontynently make aunswere, that they shulde speake no moore therof. But if the Argiues woolde, they were contente to make a new treatie wyth theym, in all thynges, suche as the former was. Whereupon the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giues made a certayne refusall, saynge that they were well contente to make the appoyntemente, suche as aboue: prouydedde that yt shulde be liefulle to aythere of the sayde partyes, notwythstandynge the sayde appoynctemente, to make warre agaynste the othere whan yt shulde seme good, throughe cause of the sayd Cytye of Cynurie, excepte that the othere partye were empeschedde wyth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stylence or wythe othere warre, lyke as at othere tyme yt hadde bene conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntedde betwene theyme, than, whan they hadde a battaille, whereof aythere of the partyes pretendedde to haue hadde the vyctorye, and so, that the warre shoulde not exceede the lymyttes of the sayede Cytye, and of hys terrytorye.
<pb n="Cxxxvii" facs="tcp:18267:139"/>
Whiche requeste semed at the begynnyng to the Lacedemonyans, very folyshe, but neuerthelas in the ende they dydde agree vnto it. For that, that they desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redde the amytie of the sayd Argiues. But bifore the concluding of any thynge, albeit that the ambassadours hadde full power and might, yet wylled they that they should retourne frome thence to Argos, and that they should propone and declare the sayd treatie to the commons, for to knowe if they were agreable vnto it. And if they were, that they shoulde comme againe at a daye appoynctedde for to swere to the sayd appoynctmente. So the ambassadours departed frome La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemony. But in the meane tyme that they shoulde haue retourned, the Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours that the Lacedemonyans had sent to the Beotians, for to recouer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacte, and the prysoners beinge Athenyans: to wytte Andromedes, Phedimus and Antimenides, they founde that the sayed Panacte was rasedde and plucke downe by the Beotians vnder colour, as they sayed, that there was an auncyente treatie bitwene them and the Athenyans, confirmedde by othe, by which it was ordonneide that neyther of the parties, shoulde inhabitt in the sayed place. And as touchinge the prysoners, they rendredde those that they hadde of the sayd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyans. Unto whome those ambassadours dydde sende them agayne. And as concernynge Panacte, they shewed them, that they shoulde no more feare that any their enemye shoulde abyde there, insomuche as the towne was pluckedde downe, thynkynge by that meane that they had welle acquited the promys that they hadde made for to render it. But the Athenyans were not therewith conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and shewedde theym that they had not accomplyshedde that, whiche they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysedde in rendrynge of the towne being destroyedde: and moreouer in hauing made allyance with the Beotians. For it was directly against that whiche was spoken and agrede vpon bitwene them to wytt, that they shoulde ioinctly togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders constraigne all the confederatedde cyties for to accepte and ratefie the sayd treatie of peace, to wytt, those, that would refuse it. By meanes of which thinges and of manye other they vsed the sayd ambassadours with grosse woordes, and sente them agayne withoute other conclusion. The Athenyans and the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyans being than in this difference: they that were not contente to haue peace with the Athenes, they sought meanes to breake it incontynently through occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion thereof. And amongest other Alcibiades sonne of Clymas (who thoughe he was yett yonge, yett for the memorye of his progenitours, whiche were men of worshyppe, was greately bilouedde, and hadde greate auctorytie in the cytie) the same counsailledde the people, for to make allyance with the Argiues, aswell for that, that it semedde prossitable for them, as also for this that through the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and fiercenesse of his harte, he was not content that the peace had bene made with the Lacedemonyans by Nycyas and Lachetes, without makynge estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hym for that he was yonge.

was mynded for to haue made one on the syde that was towardes the coste of Achaia, but the Corynthians &amp; the Sycynians, whiche parceyued that the same shulde make against them, did empesche it. In the same somer was great warre bitwene the Epidauria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and the Argiues, vndercouleur of this, that Thepidau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians hadde not sent an offeringe to the temple of Apollo Pythius, as they were bounde to do, the whiche temple was in the iurisdiction and power of the Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues. But in trouthe it was for this, that the sayed Argiues and Alciabiades dyd searche some occasion for to take and occupie the sayed towne, if they myghte, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welle for to be more sure agaynste the Corynthyans, as also for this, that frome oute of the porte of Egyne, they myght trauerse thider more easely and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: than for to go frome Athenes to enuyrone the promontorye of Scellea.<note place="margin">Scellea</note> And so the Argiues preparedde theymself for to go into armure and with force to recouer the sayed offrynge of the Epydauryans.

But in sacrefyinge for their voiage, they coulde not fynde that the goddes woulde be propice or fauorable to theym therein. By reasone whereof, they retournedde fromethence, euery man into his house. And neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las bifore their departure, they concludedde amonge themself that they shoulde assemble togiders agayne in the moneth followynge, whiche was the moneth of Iune. And after that they were disassembledde or disseuered, the Argiues yssued with all their power aboute the ende of May. And hauynge iourneyedde all that same day, they entred into the lande of Epidaure, and so didde piliage and waste it. Whiche parceiued, the Epidauriens sent vnto the Lacedemonyans and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other allyes for to haue succours. Of whome, some excusedde themselfes that the moneth, whiche was to them assigned for to reasse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble themself, was not yet come.

Wherfore it was reasonable, that the men of warre shulde retyre on bothe sydes, and after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, the treatie of peace shulde be renewed. Wherunto the ambassadours of the Athenians did accorde, &amp; by that meane caused their people, which were in the lande of the Epidauria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to retyre. And afterwardes they reassembled themself altogiders for to create of the peace. But being departed without conclusion, the Argiues marched afreshe in armure to ouerrone &amp; pillage the countrey of Epidauriens. And in the self time the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s yssued for to go against the Carya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but not hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sacrifices propice or fauourable for the voiage, they retourned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thence.

Wherefore it was resonable that the Mantynyans and their sklaues shulde passe in their shippes and be transported vnto Pylus. And that doing otherwise, they shulde do them wrong.

Neuertheles they woolde not do it, aswell for that, that they were already nighe hande to hande wyth the ennemyes, as also the tyme was very shorte for to do that, whyche they were commaundedde, through occasyon wherof, they were afterwardes bannyshed oute of Sparte, as nyce and slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.

But it was not possyble for them so to do, nother for those of that poynct, fromwhence they were departed, to receue them, beinge alredy all locked togider and nigh vnto the ennemyes.

Who parceyuinge that the armye, whyche they had lefte there was small, in comparyson of the othere, that was departed fromethence: they sente Demosthenes,<note place="margin">Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes</note> for to cause their people to retyre. who beinge there ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued, faygned to make a tourney wythout the towne, and by that meane caused the other that were in garnyson wythin, to issue fourth, and whan they were with out, he locked the gates agaynst them, and afterwards caused them of the towne to assemble togider, and renewed the allyance, whyche they had wyth the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans, and in that doinge, rendred the wall vnto them for whyche the question was. After that the allyance was made betwene the Lacedemonyans and the Argiues, the Mantynyans refused at the begynnynge to enter into it: but seynge that they were to weake for the Argiues, sone after they made appoynetemente wyth the Lacedemonyans, and lefte the townes that they helde in their lybertie.

meane tyme the people of Argos, who had already conspyredde to recouer and take agayne the gouernement, espying the tyme whan the Lacedemonyans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercysed themself all naked accordinge to their custome: they arose vppe againste their gouernours in armure, and some of them they dyd slay, and the other they bannished, who, bifore that they were chased or dryuen fromthence, had sent vnto the Lacedemonyans, to haue theire ayde, but they slacked tomuch their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming through cause of their sayde excercise or playes, notwythstandinge they sone after deferred or put them of, and issued fourth into the feldes for to succour the said gouernours. But beinge arryued at Tegea, and vnderstandinge there that the said gouernours were driuen away, they retourned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>thence &amp; acheued or made an ende of their said playes.

And after that the thinges were at lengthe debated, it was declared, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours were wronfully and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cause bannished, and was concluded to go thider in armure, and by force to place the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agayne wythin the towne, but the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution beinge to longe delayed, they, that were wythin the towne, fearynge to be ouercomme and takene, reallied themself afreshe wyth the Athenyans. thinking to be by them garded and defended: and that done, they caused soubdainelye the walls to be made from the towne vnto the sea, to the ende that if they were em<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pesched or lett to haue victuails by lande, they might yet haue them by sea, and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thys they dyd (hauinge intelligence wyth some of the Cyties of Peloponese) in so great diligence, that there was not man nor woman, yonge nor olde, small nor great, that imploied not himself therin.

And afterwardes they dyd take a small towne, that was in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytorye of the sayde Argos, named Hysias, by assault, and dyd slaye all the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or beste men that they founde wythin it, and afterwardes retourned frome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence into their houses. And sone after the Argyues yssued fourth of their town wyth all their force agaynste the Phliasians, &amp; pillagedde alle their lande, for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as they hadde receyuedde their exiles or bannyshedde men: of whome some had there, houses and heredytamentes, and afterwardes retourned from<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence into their towne. That same wynter, the Athenyans made warre against Perdiccas in Macedonie, vnder colour of thys, that they sayde, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against them w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lacedemonyans and the Argiues, and that whan the same Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had prepared their army for to sende them into Thrace against the Chalcydes and the Amphipolites vnder the conducte of Nyrias, he hadde dissembled wyth them, in suche sorte, that the sayde enterpryse coulde not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and by that meane he was declared their enemy. And in thies entrefaicts passed that winter, which was the ende of the fourtenth yere of that same warre.

But there ys one thynge that semethe vnto vs contrarye and repugnante to this, &amp; that is, that ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me not to speake of warre to follow, but of the same that presently is already. wherefore we parceyue well, that youe wolbe iudges of thys presente communycation.

It standethe with all reasone, and also to be licencedde, that people that be in suche perplextie, shulde shewe many reasons, and change many purposes, hauing regarde to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thinges, considered, that the question is of oure wealth. Wherefore it it please you, we wolle debate togider in suche sorte, as you haue reherced. The Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, Sithens than it is conuenient so to talke, we wolle not vse doubtful termes, as if that by ryght, the gouernance ouer you bilonged vnto vs, by reasone of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, that we sometyme had against the Medes, nor by long wordes, for to shewe you, that we haue iust cause to moue warre agaynst you, for the iniurye that we haue receyued of you. Also it it not nedeful that ye declare vnto vs that ye be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geoses of the Lacedemonyans, and that ye haue in nothing offended vs, hopyng by that meane to perswade vs to desist and leue of oure enterprise. But ye muste treate of possible thinges accordingly as we and you vnderstande the affaire and busynes that presently is in hande. And to consider that among people of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the iust and reasonable causes be debated by reasone, whan there is no necessitie on the one syde, more than of the other. But whan the more feoble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate matters, which the stronger parte doth demaunde of them: it is conuenient for them to accorde vnto the lesse euyll. The Melyans, Sythence than, that ye wolle, that, without debatynge wyth reasone, men speake, to make the beste, that may be, according to the estate of thynges: It is reasonable, not being hable to do better, that we consarue that, wherein consisteth our comon welth, to wytt, oure lybertie. Also it shulde be conuenient and honorable for a man, that is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in danger, so that he perswade an other, that he shulde contente hymself with that, that he may aduantage and saue by his witt, and by his diligence according to the tyme, and to accepte it lykewyse himself, wherefore you other Athenyans, ought welle to take hede, for this, that forsomuche as ye be of more power, than the other, that if one suche aduersitie chaunced vnto youe, somuche youre ruyne sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Athenyans, we feare not the abolyshynge of oure em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and seignorie. For those that haue accustomed to rule other: as the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyans haue done, be not so cruell towardes them whome they vainquishe, as they be, that haue bene accustomed to be ruled, whan they rebell, if they haue the victory against them, to whome they were subiect. But as the danger therof resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth to vs, so leue it to our parelles and fortunes, &amp; lette vs speake of that, which apperteigneth to the augmentacion of oure empire, for whiche cause we become hider, &amp; for the welth of your citie. And as touching that, we woll tell you plainly our intent. Whiche is, that we wolle gouerne you, and yet not be molestuous nor importunate vnto you, and in this doynge saue youe, aswell for youre welth, as for ours. The Melyans, howe may that be, that it shoulde be asmuche our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytt to be your subiectes, as to yours to be our Lordes? The Athenyans. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye it is your proffytt, to do rather so, than to suffre all the extremyties of warre. And ours, to haue you to our subiectes, rather than to slaye you. The Melyans: And if we be newter withoute medlynge wyth the one partie or wyth the other, and that we be your frendes in stede of thies questions, being nowe youre enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes, wolleye not be therewith contentedde? The Athenyans: No trulye, for it
<pb facs="tcp:18267:150"/>
shulde be more damage to haue you for frendes, than ennemyes, for this, that if we shulde accepte you for frendes, it shulde he a argument or declaration of our weakenes &amp; ympotency, wherby the other, ouer whome we gouerne, shall esteme vs the lesse. The Melyans: Than those, that be vnder youre empire, be of this mynde that they desire that those, whiche haue nothyng to do with you, shulde be your subiectes as they be. And also, that your colonies, if there be any of them that haue rebelled against you, that they shulde be brought againe into your sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. The Athenyans: And wherefore shoulde they not haue that opinion, for they thinke not, that the one nor the other wythdrawe themself frome our obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance by any reasone, but only whan they parceue themself to be puissante inough for to resist vs, and that we for feare dare not assaille the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whereby, besydes this, that whan we shall haue subdewed you, we shall haue greater nomber of subiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: Oure empire shalbe also thereby more puissant &amp; more assured, for that, that you be islanders and people of the Islande, and be reputed puissant by sea, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we subdue youe, ye shalbe afterwardes moste feoble. The Melyans. And you, do not you put and repute youre suertie to be in youre force by sea? but inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you perswade vs, that we shulde leue aparte reason for to obey to your intent and proffitt, we woll lykewise shewe you &amp; take paine to do you to knowe, that the thing whiche we demande for our proffytt, shall redounde to yours, for you may well vnderstande, that by subduing vs without other quarelle, yt shall cause all those of Grece, that haue bene newter, to be your ennemies, for that, that seing what ye shal haue done, they shal feare leste afterwardes, you would do the lyke vnto them, by which doing you augment your ennemyes, &amp; constraine those to be aduersaries, that were not wiliynge vnto it. The Athenians. It is not so, as you do vnderstande it, for we thinke not that those, which lyue in lybertie, be it in maine lande, in any parte that it may be, or in any Islandes, that be not subiect to any other parsone, as you be, may be so sharpe or so to be feared, as the other, that be subiectes &amp; obey by force, whan they be yll mynded: for that, that they, whiche lyue in lybertie be more necligent to defende themself, but those that be subiectes, through their disordered passions, for a smalle occasion, do put oftentymes their estate &amp; ours in danger. The Melyans: If you than, for to encrese your empire, &amp; those, that be in subiection, for to exempt themself out of saruytude, do put your self in so many dangers: truly it shulde be muche more great shame and greater slacknes to vs, that be yet in lybertie, for to suffer it to be loste. The Athenyans. That is otherwyse, and you shall not do wysely if ye followe that counsaille, for your forces be not lyke vnto ours, so that ye shulde not be ashamed to submytte your self vnto vs but insomuche as ye be weaker than we, ye shoulde deuise for your welth. The Melians. It is true, but also we knowe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fortune of warre is most often comon or indifferent, aswell to the weake, as to the strong, &amp; that it standeth not alwayes with the greater nomber. And on the other part, he that re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth himself subiect, nother hath hope, nor recouery: wheras he that standeth at defense, hopeth alwaies well. The Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: hope, which is the comfort of them, that be in danger: though y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she bringe damage to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that vse her, where there is apparance or lykelyhode of recouerye: yet doth she not vtterly destroy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as she doth those, that putt all their trust in suche thing, as of his nature is dangerous and full of hazarde, for al at one time she causeth herself to be knowin by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that truste to muche in her, and leueth theyme no manner meane to defende theyme. Wherby you, that parceyue youre self so weake and in in suche danger: ought to kepe youre selfe, frome ytt, and not to doo as manye haue done, who hauynge some good meane to saue theymeselfe: whan they parceyue that they be withoute
<pb n="Cxlviii" facs="tcp:18267:150"/>
apparence of hope, retourne to other incertain abusions, as be visions, diuina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, Oracles and other lyke, whiche by vayne hope, brynge men vnto perdition. The Melyans, we knowe ryght well that, whiche you vnderstande clerely. And that is, that it shalbe a harde thing for to resist your puissance and your fortune, whiche is muche greatter than ours, and that the thynge shall not be egalle, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelas we trust in fortune and in the grace of God, consideredde that ye haue nother reasone nor good quarell againste vs, and also we hope that if, of our self we be not puissant ynough for to resist, that yet we shall haue succours from the Lacedemonians, wyth whome we haue made allyance, who shalbe constrayned to do it, though that they haue had no other interest, than for their honoure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be their burgeoses &amp; parentes, by which reasons ye may knowe that we haue not hitherto bene ouer muche bolde. The Athenyans, we also doubt not the benignitie and goodnes of the goddes, forsomuche as that which we do, and repute to be iust: is not against thopinion of men, and also is according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and wyll of the goddes towardes men, and of those men, the one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the other. For as touching the goddes, we beleue that, whiche other do comonly bileue of them. As concernyng men, we knowe, that by naturall necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he that hath ouercome an other, remaigneth his lorde. The whiche lawe we haue not made, nother haue we bene the furst that haue vsed ytt. But rather we vse it so, as we haue sene, that other haue vsed yt. and we wolle leaue it perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allye vnto them, that shall come after vs. And we be full certaine, that if you and the other had power and facultie to do it, as we haue, that ye would do the like. Wherfore as touchyng you, we feare not, but that we be stronger, than you. As concernyng the Lacedemonyans, we knowe that ye take in good parte the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that you haue of them, as people finally experymentedde of euylles, that for their honnoure, they wolle come to succoure you, but neuerthelas we prayse not your follye. For the same Lacedemonians, amonge themself and in thinges that concerne their lawes and domesticall customes, vse oftentymes vertue, But of suche sorte, that if they gouerned with other, men myghte alleage manye exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples therof. Notwithstanding for to shewe you the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marie: they be the people of all those, of whome we haue knowlage, that moste repute that, whiche pleaseth them, to be honest, and that, whiche is for their proffytt, to be reasonable. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it shall not be youre commoditie, to rest or trust in their fantasies whiche be without any reasone, in this question, that is of your welth. The Melyans, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer you do saye: we do bileue certainly: that although their honour dydde not moue them, yet for their singuler proffytt, they woll not habandone nor forsake this cytie, whiche is their colonie. For by that meane, they shulde be desloyall and vnfaythfull vnto their frendes and allyes of Grece, and shulde procure the prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytt of their ennemyes. The Athenyans, ye presuppose than and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, that there may be nothyng proffitable, that is not suer: and also that no man shulde enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryse for his proffytt, if therein were not suertie: but rather for honour, that is to be done, whiche is honnest &amp; reasonable, ye, though that there were danger ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: the which thing the Lacedemonyans do least regarde of al men in the world. The Melians: verely we hope, that they woll take thaduenture and putt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in hazart for vs. For they haue cause to do it more for vs, that for any other, both for that, that we be nexte neyghbours to Peloponese, and thereby may best ayde themself by vs in their affayres: &amp; for this also, that they may moste trust in vs, for parentage, that we haue with them, beinge discendedde of their cyetzeins. The Athenyans, it is true. But the certaintie of succours consisteth not to be had frome them, that ought to geue it, for the confidence and benyuolence that those

The Melians. Lordes Athenyans we be of none other opinion than lately we were, and we cannot be willinge to lose in so shorte time: the lybertie whiche we haue kept and enioyed, from seuen houndred yeares hitherto, whiche arne passed sence
<pb n="Cxlix" facs="tcp:18267:151"/>
our cytie was founded: but rather wyth the fortune, whiche hathe ayded vs vnto this present daye, and with the ayde of our frendes, chiefly the Lacedemonyans, we be determyned for to defende and consarue our cytie, prayinge you neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las to be content, that we may be youre frendes, without beinge ennemyes of the other, &amp; in this manner making treatie with vs, afterwardes to withdrawe you out of our lande. And whan the Melyans had thus spoken, the Athenyans, who had withdrawin themself, from the conferring or comunication, answered them in this manner. The Athenyans, we see well that you alone, through youre opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and euill counsaille, do holde the thinges to comme, for more certayne than those, which you se bifore you eyis, and you thinke that you see in effect, alreadye, the thinges that lye, in the determynation of other, as though they were in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherby through to muche trustinge in the Lacedemonyans and in fortune and puttinge youre cause in vayne hope: ye shall fall into greater ruyne. In this manner the ambassadours of the Athenyans retourned fromethence into their campe, without hauing concluded any thynge: Whereupon the Dukes and capy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes parceiuinge that there was no hope to wynne the towne by composition preparedde themself to take it by force. So they departedde themselfe by bendes into the townes borderinge nighe aboute, and enclosedde the cytie wyth a walle, rounde aboutes, and that done, leauinge a good garnisone aswelle of their people of Athenes, as of their allyes and bothe by sea and also by lande: the more parte of the armye retourned fromethence. In that same tyme, the Argiues being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tredde into the lande of the Phiasians were circumuented by them of the towne and by the bannyshmedde men of the sayed Argiues, who were in an embusche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, in suche manner that there were slayne foure skore of their people. And on the other syde, the Athenians, that were within Pylus, made a course bifore the cytie of Lacedemony and caryedde awaye fromethence a good bouttye. And yet for al this the Lacedemonians reputed not the trefues broken, nother would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn warre, but only they made a decree, by which they permytted, that their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might likewise ouerronne &amp; pillage the lande of the sayd Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And there was not of al the cyties of Peloponese, one, that made warre against the sayd A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, but onely the Corynthians, who made it for their particuler quarelles. The siege than being bifore the cytie of Meleas, they that were within yssuedde fourth in a night vpon them, that kept the siege next to the syde of the markette place, and did take the wall that they had made in that quarter, and slewe a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that kept ytt, &amp; moreouer caryed away a good quantitie of corne and of other victuailles into the towne, &amp; afterwardes locked themself againe within without doing any other thing during that sommer, Wherupon the Athenyans were afterwardes more vigilant to kepe better watche in the nyght. And in thies enterfaictes that same somer passed. In the beginning of the wynter followynge the Lacedemonyans, hauing determyned for to enter into the lande of the Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, in fauour of the banysshed men, for that they had not the sacrifices propice or fauourable, they retourned to their houses, but that notwithstandynge, some of the Argiues, that attended their coming, were takene vpon suspition by thoder cytezeins, some other of their oune will bannysshed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self, fearing to be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In this season, the Melyans also yssuedde an other tyme, out of the other syde of the cytie, and did lykewise take the walle that the Athenians had made in that same quarter, by meane that there were fewe people for to kepe it, by occasion whereof, the Athenyans sente thider a greater strength: vnder the conduct of Philocrates sonne of Eudemus, who hauing made great preparations for to geue assaulte to the towne, they that were within, by meane of a mutyne and trahisone that was amongest them, yelded themself to the wyll of the Athenyans, who dyd putt to

For the same Isle conteigneth in circuyt, somuche, as a great shyppe may saylle in eight dayes. And notwithstanding that it is so great, yet is it not distance frome the firme lande, but twenty stades or thereaboutes.

I wylle shewe you, that this your soubdayne enterpryse is not at this tyme in seasone, and that the thynges that ye enterpryse, be not so easye as they be geuene to be vnderstanded, for it semeth vnto me, that in dooynge this enterpryse, youe leaue in thies parties mannye ennemyes, and also go aboute to cause theyme to comme fromethence hider more largely, for this, that if youe grounde youreselfe vpon the appoynctemente, that youe haue wyth the Lacedemonyans, and that there be annye suertie therein, I aduertyse youe that so longe as we remayne in prosperitie, the name thereof shall endure.

Wherfore good aduise ought to be taken herin, and not to repute our cytie to be so puissante, as therby we shoulde put it ayther into danger, nother to couett an newe empire, vntil we shall haue well established the same, whiche we presently haue. And if we be not of power to subdewe the Chalcides in Thrace, our subiectes, tha the rebelled against vs, nor assure our selues of any other in the mayne lande, of whome we be not welle assured: howe wille we so readely go to succour the Egestains, vnder coulour that they be our allyes, nowe being in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Whome (forsomuch as they be of so longe time departed from our allyance) we may pretende to haue iniuryed vs. And though well that, hauynge the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye against their ennemyes, we shall recouer them, yet shall we not by theyme be greatly ayded, aswel for that, that they be farre from vs, as also for this, that they be many in nomber. Wherfore it semeth to me that it is an folie, for to assaille and assist them there, whome, though we shall haue vaynequished, we nother shalbe hable to defende and kepe as frendes, nother enterteigne in our obeysance.

For this, that they maye welle thynke, that whan the Peloponesians shall haue, through their ayde, destroied and extinguished our estate and empire: they wylle also afterwardes destroy theirs. Moreouer the Grekes, whiche be in that same countrey: be in a maruaylous feare of vs, so longe as we be not there, and yett shalbe in greater, yf that we shalle shewe theyme oure armye in their viewe and afterwardes do withdrawe it. But if we enter into their countrey and receyue there anye shame or damage, they wylle no more esteme vs, but rather wolle ioigne theymeselfe wyth the other Grekes for to comme to assaylle vs in oure countrey.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere Sycille, though that they be our ennemyes. Which is not wisely done, for no man ought to extole himself, nor to take tomuche courage for the aduersitie of hys ennemy: but rather refrayning his courage and his glorye to trust in hys puissance. And also ye ought to consyder that the Lacedemonians for the shame, which they haue receiued of vs, do study, no other thing, but how they may cause vs to comytt some folly: by meane wherof they myght reuenge their shame &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer their honor, &amp; somuche the more, as they be more couetouse of glory and of vertue, than any other people. Lykewyse (Lordes) we ought to consider that this questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not here moued for the Egestains, which be strangers and Sycilians, but howe we shall kepe our self from a cytie, whiche for that, that it gouerneth it self by a small nomber of people, is ennemy to ours, that is gouerned by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie. And also we ought to thynke, that we haue a smalle respite for one so great a warre and greuous malady: whiche maye brynge vs into greate sorowe.

For there be so many good wytnesses in thys so greate an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, that thou shuldeste not feare to be reprehended for hauinge agayne deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the opynyons herin, insomuche as it is the medecyne of a cytie euill counsail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And the manner, of a good offycier for to rule and gouerne well, ys to do for his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey all the beste that he may, or at the leaste to hys knowlaige, not to do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thinge that may be preiudicial vnto it. Thus spake Nycias, and after him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny othere Athenyans dyd speake, wherof the more parte were of opynyon that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enterprise of the warre shulde be executed, ensuinge the furste deliberation, some were of the contrary opynyone, but aboue all, Alcibiades perswaded the sayd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedytion, aswel for to contrary and inuey agaynste Nycias, whome he hated, as for other reasons, whyche mouedde hym, concernynge the admynistration of the comon welth, and specially for that, the same Nycias had made mention of him in an euill sorte, though that he had not named hym vnto theym by name. But principally for the desire that he had to be chief of that same armye, hopynge by meane therof to subdue furste Sycille, and afterwardes Carthage, and also to acquyre glory and rychesse in that same conqueste, if it chaunced well accordinge to thys expectation. For beyng in greate estymation and fauour of the people, &amp; by hys ambition wyllyng to kepe a greater trayne than hys reuenue myght sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte, he nouryshed horses, whyche was afterwardes, in parte, cause of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the empire of the Athenyans. For many cytezeins, seing hys superfluytie, aswell in hys fedynge, as also in hys appareille and garmentes, and moreouere hys arrogancye and highnes of his harte in all thynges, that he admynistredde: became hys ennemyes, estemynge that he woolde make hymselfe lorde and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. And although that he conducted the affayres of warre valyantlye, yett for that, that the particulers were the more parte contrary to hys woorkes and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler enterpryses, they wente aboute to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytt the admynistration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affayres into the handes of an othere, whereupon did followe the ruyne of the cytie.

In thys that

the Grekes, whych haue bene at the feastes and solempnites of Olympus, seing the magnificence and sumptuousnes of my facyon of lyuing, estemed therby our cytie to be most puissant, most opulente, and ryche of itself, where as bifore they thought, that they might easely haue subdewedde it. For I was laste at the saide feaste with sixe chariots well appoincted. whiche thing no man hath yet done w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> suche a nomber, and also I dyd wynne the firste pryze of the course, the seconde and the fourthe.

And albeit that suche woorkes and other lyke, for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che I am estemed, ingender greate enuye by the other cytezeins agaynste me, yet to the wayfayringe men and estrangers, they shewe a greate argumente of puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance and rychesse. And also me thynketh that the fantasie of him: that goith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute by suche meanes and at hys expenses, to do honnour, not to hymself only, but also to thys cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey: is nother hurtfull nor preiudiciall to the comon welth.

For he that ys vnfortunate, fyndeth no man, that therein wylle be hys compaignyon, if than we be dispreasedde of the othere, whan we be vnfortunate: they oughte also to endure and suffre, yf we esteme theym not muche in oure fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycitie, and to wayte to doo the lyke, towardes vs, if they thynke good, whanne they shalle be in lyke estate. Neuerthelas I am not ignoraunte that suche people and othere, whyche excelle in anny honnoure and dignytie be greatelye enuiedde. Specyally of theire egalles and matches, and also somewhatte of othere, whiche haue accompaignyedde wythe theyme: but that ys, for the tyme that they be in thys lyfe onely. For aftere theire deceasse, the renomme and prosperytie, that they haue hadde, ys of suche effycacytie to theym that comme aftere, that manye glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refye themselfe to haue bene theire parentes, and specially somme saye, that they be of them, whiche be not, and many other repute themselfe honnouredde to be of the lande, towne and countrey, whereof they haue bene, and for to name them their fellowe Burgeosses &amp; countrey men. And though, for the honnorable thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that they haue done, I haue attemptedde to imytate and followe suche par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonaiges, and for this cause haue lyuedde more honnorable, than the othere: yet ye see for all that, that I beare myselfe in the affayres of the common welthe no woorse than othere of the Cytezeins. And trulye ye shalle fynde, that the puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of the Peloponesyans beynge assembledde, I haue wythoute youre greate daungier and expense, constraynedde the Lacedemonyans one daye at Manty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea to putte all theire estate in hazarte wyth one battaille. Wherof though that they hadde the victorie, yet the hazarte was soo greate, that vnto thys presente, they haue not recouered suffycyente audacytie agaynste vs. And thys my yongth and ignorance, whyche semed nothere by reasone nor by nature, to be of power, to resiste the puissance of the Peloponesians: hath caused, and aptly to speake, hath geuene suche opynyon of my audacytie, that at thys presente there oughte noo doubte to be hadde of yt, nother feare that it shulde be dangerous to the partie. but rather so longe, as I shalbe in vigoure and auctorytie wyth this audacytie, the fortune and admynistratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Nycias shall seme good and prosperous. And ye maye serue yourself bothe with the one and also the othere, as ye shall thinke good. And for to come to the matter, whereof is questyon, it is not nedeful that ye reuoke youre enterpryse of Sycille, for feare to haue to do with many people.

And also they haue not so many men of warre, as it is reported, for suche thynges be alwayes made more greate tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they be.

For though it hath bene all in armure, yet skarcely coulde it bringe to the campe such nomber of people, as was suffycient. Being than the affayres of Sycille in suche sorte as I saye, like as I haue hearde spokene by many people, the enterpryse shalbe the muche more easy for you, and chiefly for thys, that there be many Barbarous and strangers, who, for the ennymytie, that they haue agaynste the Syracusains woll ioygne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wyth vs in thys warre: and also we owe not to feare such busynes here, that it empesche vs in that same there, if we woll prouyde reasonably in our case. For it is fully certayne, that our progenytours (hauynge those for enemys, which are named, that they wyll declare themselfe agaynste vs, whan oure armye by sea shalbe in Sycille) and also the Medes: haue neuerthelas acquiredde and gott on thys empire, that we nowe haue, and that by none othere meane, but in beinge puissante by sea, whyche is the onely occasyon, through whyche the Peloponesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue lost their hope to vainquishe vs, and moreouer if they shal determine for to enter into our lande, they may do it, although that we shall not haue sente thyder thys armye by sea. And also they cannot thereby hurte vs wyth their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye by sea, for that same of ours, whych shall remayne, shalbe yet so puissant as theirs. Wherfore beinge required by oure allyes and frendes to go to their ayde, we cannot shewe them any reasonable cause, wherfore we shulde not do it: and in not doinge it, why they shulde not reproue vs and say, that ayther it is greuous vnto vs to do yt, orells that we haue vnder vayne and fryuolus excuses, refused the ayde, whyche we be bounde to delyuer them by our othe. And also we cannot pretende agaynste them, that they haue not succoured vs in oure warres, for we ayde them not in their countreye, to the intente that they shulde comme to ayde vs in oures, but to the ende that they shulde busye oure ennemyes, whyche be there wyth them in warre, and do them somuche anoyance, that they haue noo power to comme to assaille vs in thies parties. And by suche meane, we and all other, that haue acquyred greate empyres and seigniories, haue encreasedde and maygnteyned them, in geuinge promptely and liberally succours, to them that haue demanded yt of theyme, were they Grekes or Barbarous. For if we refuse to geue ayde to them, that require it of vs, or if we woll debate, to what sort of people we shulde accorde or refuse: in that doynge, we shalle not obteigne greate thinges. And thys, whyche we haue acquired, we shall putt in dangier. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more men ought not to attende to defende theire fortresses, vntill he that is the

And also it lyeth not in our free will to appoinct an limit to our Empire, for to say, that one shal passe no further.

For as farre as I vnderstande, we go agaynste many cyties bothe greate and puissante, the which be not subiected the one to the other, and which desyre not to change their estate and manner of lyuing (for thys is to be done of those, that be in greate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitude, for to comme to more lybertie and ease and that hope to be delyuered fro subiection) and somuche the lesse, they beinge franke and free, will bicomme oure bondmen and subiects.

For besydes thys that they haue there force &amp; strength of warryours and Archers: they haue moreouer greate nomber of shipps, and be all full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners and of people for to sarue in them. And also haue great quantytie of gold and syluer, aswell in common in the temples, as in partyculer. And furthere, ouer and aboue thys that they haue in the countrey: I vnderstande that certayn Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous or estrangers, be contrybutours vnto the Syracusains.

But we must passe alwais through contreis &amp; seigniories, and skarcely in four monethes in winter, we maye haue newes of them, nor they of vs. whyche is the reason, wherefore I say, that it behoueth vs to sende greate nomber of people from amonge vs, both of our subiectes and allyes, yea and of the Peloponesyans, if we maye recouer or gett any of them, ayther for practique or for monney, and also a greate nomber

And also I wyll tell yowe one thynge whyche semethe to me mooste necessary and conuenyent. That is, that we shulde require all the Sycilians (if youe thynke it good) or at the the leaste the mooste parte of them, that they come wyth all their shyppes victuailledde for two monethes, to ioygne themselues wyth vs to goo to encounter the Athenyans at Torrente or at Lapigea, for to declare vnto them, that it ys not a questyon for them to come so easely into Sycille, but that they muste fyrste passe the Sea Ionum. By whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che doynge, we shall putt theym in greate feare, and into greate thoughte. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch specially as we shall issue fourth of the lande of oure allyes bifore them for to defende ours, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tarentins woll receue vs into theirs, as frendes.

For some of the shyppes maye not in faste followe the othere. And if they wyll discharge those, whyche be the heuyeste, for to haste theym to ioygne wyth the other, whan we shall assaulte them: of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sytie they muste do yt wythe oares and wythe sayles, and by that manner, that the maronners shalle trauaylle themself beyonde measure. Wherby they shalbe

And on the other parte, if they comme wyth a small prouision of victuals, as for to geue onely one battaylle by sea, hopynge afterwardes fourthewyth to gette the lande, they shall haue greate nede thereof whan they shall fynde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be in desarte places.

And if they enforce theymself to passe furthere, they shalbe constraynedde to forsake and leaue one parte of the apparaylle of theire sayde shyppes, and also besydes thys, not beynge assuredde to be receyuedde by the othere Cyties, shalbe in great sorowe. Whyche causethe me to beleue, that if we encountredde theyme and that they parceyuedde that they coulde not lande here as they thought: they woll not departe from Coreyre But rathere in consultynge togider vpon theire affayre, and in sendynge espyes for to knowe what nomber of people and of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes we haue, and in what place we be, the wynter shalle comme vpon them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che shalle aythere breake of and vtterlye lette theire passage: orelles seynge oure preparatyon greatter, than they thoughte, they shalle desyste and leaue of theire enterpryse.

And therefore I pray you Lordes, that ye wyll beleue me herein, what is the beste that ye maye doo. And that is, that ye take couraige to doo that, whyche I haue sayde. And if ye wol not that, yet at the leaste prepare wythout further prolonginge, all thynges, whyche shalbe necessary. And conceyue in youre mynde in that doynge, not for to esteme the ennemye that commeth to assaylle youe: whyche thynge cannot be declared, but by shewynge yt by fayer and notable feates. And those feates be declared, if that fearynge the ennemy, preparatyon were made agaynste hym in suche sorte, that men myghte be in suertye.

And of fotemen they cannot also be in so great nomber as we haue of theym, sithens that they must transporte theyme by sea. For it is ryghte harde and dyfficille that so greate nomber of shyppes, as be necessary for to carye victualles and other necessities for so greate an armye, as is requyred for theym that woll to subdewe and and ouercome, one so puissant a cytie, as ours is, may comme hider in suertie.

               <head>Howe the armye departed from Corcyre, and howe yt was euylle receyued aswelle in Italye as in Sycille. ☞The .ix. Chapter.</head>
               <p>IN the meane tyme that thies thynges were debated at Sarragosse, the Athenyans and their allyes were all assembled at Corcyre. And bifore their departure fromethence, the Dukes and capytaynes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng made their moustre, dyd determyne in what order they would passe the sea, &amp; after that they were landed, howe they would departe their hoast. And so they departed all the sayd army into three partes, of the whiche three, the Dukes shulde haue the conduct, so as shulde happene to euery of them by lotte. And that they did, fearynge that if they shoulde go all togiders, they shoulde not fynde a porte sufficiente for to receyue theym, yea though nother water nor other victuales shulde not fayle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And besides this the same bendes, beyng so depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, shulde both make the greater shewe &amp; also shulde be more easye to conducte &amp; gouerne hauing euery one his capitayne a parte. Afterwardes they sente there shyppes, to wytt of euery bende, one, bifore into Sycille &amp; into Italy for to lerne what cyties would receiue them as frendes, &amp; comanded them that they shulde come agyne to mete them by the waye to make them answere what they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto them that they would do. After that all the same was so done and ordeyned, the Athenyans with that great preparation departed for Corcire, and toke the way towardes Sycille, hauyng in all one houndredde thirty and foure galleys wyth three oares, and two Rhodiens wyth twoo oares. Of the whyche with three oares, there were one houndred of Athens, wherof three skoore were light galleys, &amp; the other caryed the men of armes. Those of Chio, and the other allyes of the sayd Athenyans did fournishe the rest of the shyppes. As touchyng the nomber of people, that were in the sayd army, there were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hole some fyue thowsande &amp; one houndred fotemen, wherof fyftene houndred were Athenyans, who had seuen hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred seruantes for the nauigation or sayling &amp; of other, aswel allyes, as subiectes, &amp; speciallye of the Argiues fyue houndred, of the Mantyny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and other Mercenaries or huyred souldiers two houndred and fyftie, and of archers in all foure houndred and foure skore, whereof the foure houndred, were Rhodyens &amp; the foure skore of Creta. There were also sixe thousande men lyght armed, of Megara, and thirty horsemen, vpon a barke, for to carie horses. Such was the Athenyans armye by sea at the begynnynge. And besydes thys there were thyrtye marchandes shyppes caryinge vituailes and other thynges neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarye for the sayedde armye, besydes a greate nomber of other, of dyuers sortes, whiche followedde the sayedde armye for feate of marchandise, whyche were at Corcyre, and all togiders passedde the goulphe of the sea Ionium. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, they departedde theymeselues and aboorded one partie at the promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torye of Lapigea, one other partie at Tarente, and the other in dyuers places in Italye, so as they perceyuedde the landynge propice, and mete for them. But yet neuerthelas they dydde not fynde any cytie, that woulde receyue theym for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise nor otherwyse, but rather dydde onely permytt them to lande for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh themself w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> water and with other thinges, excepted the Tarentyns and the Locryans, who suffredde them not to make any descente in their lande. In such manner they passedde wythoute restynge themself vntyll they came to aboorde at the promontorye of Rhegium in the extremitie of Italye. In whiche place beynge refufedde to lande, and beynge alreadye strongelye assembledde, they
<pb n="Clxi" facs="tcp:18267:163"/>
lodged themselfe without the towne, nyghe vnto the temple of Diana, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they of the sayed towne sente vnto them victuailes and other necessaries for their monney. And there hauynge brought theyr shyppes into the porte: they for a certene tyme soiourned, and in the meane tyme spake vnto the Rhegyns per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadynge theyme that they woulde ayde the Leontyns, consyderedde that they were Chalcydes, lyke as they were. Who aunswered that they woulde not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle wyth the warre of the Sycilians, but they woulde earnestly do in al thinges as the other Italyans comonly woulde do. Notwythstandyng the whiche aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, the Athenyans, desyrynge to execute their enterpryse of Sycille, attended the aunswere of the shyppes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In thies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfaictes the Syracusains had newes frome many quarters, and pryncypallye by the Brygantins (whiche they hadde sente for to espye and discouer) howe the armye of the Athenyans was arryued at Rhege.<note place="margin">Rhegiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> So they were no more harde of bileue, but rather vsed all diligence that they coulde, for to make al preparations for to defende them, &amp; sent vnto all the other Sycilians, to some ambassadours, and to other, people, for to defende and kepe theyme. And moreouer they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe into their tycie all the shyppes, that they myght, frome all coastes for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence thereof, and made monstre of their people, and a description of their harn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and of their victuaile, whiche they hadde in the cytie. And for effecte prepared all other thynges that was possible for theym, euene so, as yf the warre had bene alreadye bigonne. In this meane tyme, the three shyppes, whiche they had sente to Egeste, came agayne to them to Rhege, who made reaporte vnto them: that there was none other monney in the sayed cytie of Egeste, than the same, whiche they hadde promysedde, whiche myght amounte to the some of thyrty talentes onely, wherewyth the Dukes Athenyans were all astonyedde and discouraiged, seing that at the Aryuall the pryncipalle dydde faile them, whereupon they were foundedde, and that Rhegians refusedde to enter into the warre wyth them. Who were the furst that they had aboorded, and those, whome they myght hope sonnest to wynne, aswelle for that, that they alwayes hadde bene parentes of the Leontyns and of one selfe nation, as also for that, that they were alwayes affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyonedde to the partie of the Athenyans. Whereby Nycyas was in nothyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused. For he had neuer other opynyon of the Egestayns, but that they woulde abuse the Athenyans, but the other two capytaynes founde theymselues decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, who had been abusedde by the cautell and crafte that the Egestayns hadde vsed, whan the furst ambassadours of the Athenians was sent vnto them for to see their treasuer. For after that the sayed ambassadours were landed and come into their cytie, they brought them into the temple of Uenus, whiche is in Eryce. and there shewed them basyns, the censars and other hallowedde vesselles that were in the sayedde temple: togiders wyth the offerynges, vowes and other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable riches, whiche were of greate valeur. And for that they were of iyluer, they made a great monster and apparance, that there had bene a great some of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in that same cytie insomuche as beinge so smalle: there was somuche in that same temple. And besydes this in diuers houses, where the Athenya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that came in that ambassade were lodged, and vpon their shyppes, their hoastes shewedde them greate quantitie of vesselles of golde and of syluer, aswell for saruice at the table, as for the kytchyne, whyche they hadde for the moste parte borowedde of their neighbors, aswell of the self countrey, as of the Phenicians &amp; of the Grekes

                  </gap> and that it was their manner of lyuynge. Whereupon, the sayd Athenyans perceyuing so great quantitie of vessell and so ryche in all their houses, and as all of one sorte, were all astonyed. And after that they were retournedde to Athenes, made reaporte that they hadde sene a merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse quantitie of golde and syluer. And by that meane the Athenyans were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, whereby, after that the men of warre, that were at Rhege vnderstoode the trouthe to be contrarye by the messengers that they had sent thider, they became hatefull and seditious agaynst them. And thereupon the Dukes consulted togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the affaire. And the opynyon of Nycyas was that they altogider shoulde go fromethence to Selynunte. To whiche place it was pryncipally ordeynedde that they shulde go in fauour of the Egestayns. And if being there the Egestains made whole paymente of all the armye, that they myght consult what they had to do. And if they made not the sayd payment, that than it shulde be demaunded of them, that at the least they shoulde victuale the three skoore shyppes whiche they had required for their succours. And in that doyng that men shoulde abyde there vntill that they had reconcyled the sayd Selynuntyns with those Egesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yns aither by frendeshyp or by force. And after that, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shulde passe through bifore thother cyties of Sycille for to shewe the puissance of the Athenyans, and also to geue courage and hope to their frendes, and that done to retourne from<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence all into their houses wythoute otherwyse to soiourne in that same quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter except that in short tyme or by some oportunitie and occasion, they myghte doo some aduantage and saruice to the Leontyns, and withdrawe any of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cyties to the allyance of the sayd Athenyans. For it semed vnto him that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing othewise, they shoulde putt the estate of Athens in danger by that expences onely. But Alcibiades was of contrary opynyon, saying that it shulde be tomuch great shame, to be come with one so great a puissance into a countrey so farre of, and to retourne fromthence without doing any thinge there. Wherfore he was of aduyse that heraultes and trompettes shoulde be sent vnto all the cyties of the countrey except Sarrogosse &amp; Selynunte, for to aduertise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their comyng, and to essaye for to wynne theym, to wytte, for to cause the subiectes of the sayed Syracusains and Selynuntyns to rebelle agaynst them and to withdrawe the other vnto the allyance of the Athenians. And by that meane to haue victuailes and people of theyme, and bifore all the other they shulde essay to gette the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mertyns, for that that they were moste nighe to the ryght landynge for to come out of Grece, and also there was a great porte and ryght suer, wherunto the said Athenyans myght wichdrawe themselfe and retyre in suertie: and fromethence practise wyth the other cyties. And after that it shulde be learned what they were that would be ernest against the said Syracusains, and those, that would be to the contrary: to go agaynst the Syracusains and against the Selynu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyns for to constrayne them, at the least, to wytt, the Syracusains, to apppoyncte with the Egestayns, and the Selynuntyns, that they shulde permytt the Leontyns to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde in their cytie and houses. As touchynge Lamachus his opynyon was that men shulde go as sone as they myght agaynst Sarragosse and assault them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnprouyded, bifore that they myghte prepare, for to resiste, and whilest, that they were astonyed, lyke as wythout fayle, they woulde haue bene at the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nynge, for that, that an armye is alwayes fearefull<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> at the aryuall. But if it delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to go to assault his ennemyes, they consulte, vpon their affaire, and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge doo recouer their courage. In suche manner, that afterwardes they despyse those, whiche were fearefull, vnto them, wherefore he concluded, that those men that would fourthwith, and wythout delaye, come to assaulte the foresayd Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusains
<pb n="Clxii" facs="tcp:18267:164"/>
whileste they were, in that same feare, shoulde haue the better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and shoulde putt the sayedde Syracusayns in greate tremblynge and feare, aswelle for the vieu, of the same armye whiche shoulde seme at the furste syghte to be of muche more people than there was, as also for feare of the euylles which they shoulde consider to be lyke to happene, yf they were vainequyshedde in the battaille. And somuche the more that it was to bileue that manye of the citize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins shoulde be in the feldes whiche doubted not the comynge of the sayd armye, who retyrynge hastely into the Cytye shall leaue behynde theyme muche of their goodes in the feldes, and also many of them shalbe takene bifore that they may retyre, whereby, hauyng afterwardes assieged the cytie, men shall not lacke mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. And on the other parte, by this doynge the other cyties of Sycillle, vpon that poyncte shall choose the rather to make allyance wyth theyme, than wyth the sayedde Syracusains wythoute taryinge or attendynge whiche of the twoo, shall haue the victorye. He sayedde moreouer that in all euentes and chaunces (were it that they retyredde, or that they assaultedde) that they shoulde make the station and soiourne of their shyppes at Megare, for that, that it was desarte and nyghe ynoughe to Saragosse, aswelle by sea, as by lande. Thus Lamachus, dydde speake, and neuerthelas he came agayne to the opynyon, of Alcibiades. Who, after theis thynges, sailledde wyth hys shyppe to passe bifore the cytie of Mamertyas, and requyredde theyme to enter into allyance wyth the Atheny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whereunto they woulde not consente, nor suffre hym to enter into theyr cytye, neuerthelas they offredde to cause victualles to be delyueredde to be solde wythoute the cytye for hym and hys people, who perceyuynge that, wythoute restynge there, retournedde fromethence to Rhege. And after that he was ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedde, wyth other the Dukes, they causedde incontinentlye one parte of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye to be embarquedde wythin three skoore shyppes whiche they victuailledde sufficiently. And leauynge the reste of the people, and of the shyppes at the porte, of Rhege, wyth one of the same Dukes, the other two went wyth the sayed three skoore shyppes strayghte to Naxe,<note place="margin">Naxus.</note> whereinto they were receyuedde by the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeins. And fromethence they wente to Catane but there they were not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedde, for that, that there was one parte of the cytizeins, whiche toke partie with the Syracusains. For this cause they were constraynedde to retyre vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremounte, of the ryuer of Teria,<note place="margin">The ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of Teria.</note> where they soiournedde all the same daye. And on the morowe after, they altogether wente fromthence tylle bifore Syracuse. hauynge their shyppes in order in fourme of a cornette, whereof they sente tenne bifore towardes the greate porte, for to see if there were anye shyppes of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes. And after that they were nyghe the entrynge of the sayed porte, they causedde it to be cryed wyth the sounde of a trompett, that the Athenyans were come thyder, for to restore the Leontyns into their houses, bycause of the amytie and parentage, that they hadde wyth theyme. Wherefore they declaredde to all those of the sayed natyon of Leontyns, that were wythin Syracuse, that they myghte retyre to the sayed Athenyans, as their frendes and bene factors. And after that they hadde made that crye, and welle regardedde and consyderedde the Syte and the facyon aswelle of the Cytye as of the poorte, and also of the countrey rounde aboute, for to knowe on whyche syde they myghte beste assiege yt, they all retournedde frome thence to Catane, and agayne demaundedde the cytizeins, that they shulde suffer them to enter into the cytie, as their frendes, who, after that they had holden their counsaille, made aunswer that they would not suffer the armye to enter but if the Dukes and heddes would enter in their symple estate: they would receyue them wyllyngly and shoulde heare what they

And it semeth not vnto me to haue any apparance, that if Hipparchus, had bene slayne, possessyng the Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyorye: that Hippias incontmently after coulde haue obteigneddde yt, and also exercise it the selfe daye, that the other dyedde, but rather hauyng already a longe tyme vsedde hys auctorytie imperially towardes the subiectes, and lyued fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely and discretelye wyth hys adherentes and frendes: feared not to reteigne and kepe hys Seigniorye and pryncipalytie, whatsoeuer thynge had happenedde to hys brother: euene so, as hys sayed brother woulde happely haue done, if that the chaunce hadde happenedde to that same Hippias, for that, that he was alreadye exercisedde and accustomedde, in the Seigniorye. But that, whiche geueth thys reaporte to Hipparchus and causeth theyme, that came after to bileue, that he had obteigned, the pryncipalitie and Seigniorye of Athens: was through cause of the myschance, whiche happenedde vnto hym, by occasyon of that, whyche is bifore sayed. For parceyuynge that he coulde not wythdrawe or bryng Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius to hys wyll, he ymagined agaynst hym one suche woorke and despyte. The same Hermodius, hadde a yonge suster, a maydene, who comminge in an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of other maydens, of her estate, to a certene solempnytie that was made in the cytie, carying a paynyer or baskette, as the other dyd: Hipparchus, by hys mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, causedde her to retyre and to be putt oute of the sayedde compaignie, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that she was not calledde, to the sayed solempnytie, for she was not woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be there, wyllynge to doo it to be vnderstande, that she was no maydene, whereby Hermodius, was more and more, grudgedde and spitefull, and Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitonne also for hys sake. And so, they cogiders wyth the complices of that same conspiratie determyned, whan it shuld be expedient for to execute it, but they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryedde the daye of the feaste, whyche ys calledde, the greate feaste of Panne, for that, that on the same daye yt was permytted to euerye man, withoute any sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spycion, to weare harnnes, throughe the towne. And so yt was concludedde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeste theyme, that on the sayedde daye: the same Hermodius and Arystogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, shoulde charge vpon Hipparchus, and the other complices, vpon the garde or sargeantes. And albeyt that the same complices were in smalle nomber, yet for to kepe the thynge secrettt, they perswaded theymselfe that whan the other cytezeins, that should be assembled, should see them charge vpon the tyrantes or gouernours, thoughe that they knewe nothynge of the enterpryse, beynge yet in armure, they all woulde ioigne wyth theyme for to recouer their lybertie. Than, whan the feast daye came, Hippias was in a place, a parte, namedde Cerannicus wyth the souldyars of hys garde, and ordeyned the ceremonies of that same so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lempnitie as it apperteigned. And as Hermodius and Aristogiton came directly
<pb n="Clxiiii" facs="tcp:18267:166"/>
vnto hym wyth their daggers for to slaye hym, they parceyued one of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, that was speakynge with the sayedde Hyppias very famyliarlye (for that, that he was gentle to geue audience) whereby they were afrayed that their sayd compaigny on hadde discouered the enterpryse, and leste they shulde be inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently takene. And so determyned bifore that they would be empeigned or layde hande vpon, to take vengeance on hym, that was cause of their conspiracie. To wytt, Hipparchus, if they coulde. And fourthwith entred into a place, called Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus, wherin Hipparchus was.

In this manner, throughe foolyshe loue, the furste conspiracie was bigonne and enterprysedde agaynste the Tyrantes of Athens, and executed foolyshly for the soubdayne feare, whiche they had, that enterprysedde yt, to haue bene discouered, whereby greate euylle insuedde afterwardes to the Athenyans.

Neuerthelas three yeares arter this, whiche we haue spokene, Hippias was chasedde by the Lacedemonyans and by the Alemonides oute of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igniorye and tyrannye of Athenes.

And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded themself that the sayed excesse and mysdedes had bene done to the same entente. By occasion whereof many greate personages of the cytie were putt into

prysone. And the persecution and wrath of the commons encreasedde dayllye to apprehende, and imprysone men, vntylle that one of theym that hadde bene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kene and was reputed for moste coulpable, at perswation of one of the other pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, discoueredde the thynge, were it truely or faulselye, for the trouth coulde neuer be knowyn nother than nor afterwardes. But somuche there was, that he was perswadedde, that if he discoueredde the case, by accusynge of hymselfe and of some other, he shoulde putt the reste of the cytye oute of suspition and of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And also by so doynge shoulde be in suertie for to escape and to be delyue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redde. By this meane he confessedde the case of Hermes or pictures, as touchyng hymself, and also accused a compaignie of other, whome he declared to haue bene partakers therof, whereby the comons, thynkyng that he had sayed the trouthe, were ryght ioyfull. For they were tomuche angry, that no knowlaige coulde be had of a dede, done by so great nomber of people. And so he, that had confessedde the matter, togiders wyth the other, whome he had not chargedde: were fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyth delyuered. And of those, which he had charged, al they that might be taken were putt to execution by sentence or iudgemente. The other, that fledde frome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence, were condempnedde of contumacye to death, and a huyer was lymytedde and appoynctedde for all men, whiche dydde slaye theyme. And yett was it not knowyn for trouthe, whider that those, whiche had bene executed, were gylty or not. Neuerthelas in all the rest the cytie reputed itselfe to haue gaigned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytedde greatly. But the comons were displeasedde, wyth Alcibiades, who was accused of this chance, of the ymages by his ennemyes, to wytte, by those same, that had charged him therwith bifore his departure. And takyng it to be trewe that he had bene gilty of the case, of the Hermes or pictures, they easely perswaded themself, that he likewise had bene partaker of the other case of the sacrefices with the other complices &amp; conspirators against the comons. And the suspection didde growe somuche the more, that a certene small nomber of warryours beyng La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonyans, did in that self time come vntill the distreate of Peloponese, for to appoynte and intreate of some matter, with the Beotians. Wherby the Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had suspicion, that it had bene through consent of the said Alcibiades, vnder cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the sayd treatie, and that if the same Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, had not preuented to take the sayd citizeins, whome they had taken vpon suspition, the cytie had bene in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In this manner, Alcibiades was suspected, on all sydes.

Thys dependinge arry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the horsemen of the Egestains, wyth whome the fotemen Athenyans came by lande wythin the Isle, pillaginge and robbinge vntill Catana, and their ships came vnto them coastynge alongeste the sea, wherin they charged their butyes &amp; pillage, aswell of beastes as of the other.

And the lyght horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Syracusains, whych ronned daylly vnto the campe of the said Athenyans, among other reproches, whiche they vsed, demanded of theym, if they were not more comme to inhabitt rather an other mans lande, than for to restore the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ontins into theirs. The Athenyans, knowinge suche thyngs, essaiedde to wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe those Syracusains so farre, as they coulde, from their cytie, to the intente that the more wyth their ease, they myght in one nyght wyth their shipps, saille to lande before the towne, and lodge theire campe in place, where they shulde thinke most mete. For they knewe well, that if at landing out of their ships, they founde the ennemyes in order and prepared for to defende theire landinge: or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els if that they woulde take their waye fromthence by lande vnto the sayde cytie: they shuld haue much more difficultie.

That is, that they sente one (whome they right wel trusted) vnto the Dukes of Syracusains, knowinge also that they wolde geue fayth vnto that, whyche he shulde shewe them, fayninge to be sente from certen of the princypalle of the cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Catana, wherof he was, whom the said dukes did well knowe) saying that they yet helde their partie, and that if they wolde, they wold cause them to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victorie against the Athenyans by such meane: for one partie of the armye of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> said Athenyans kept the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the towne without armure.

Some other by occasions of warrs &amp; questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that they had amongest themself &amp; the other vnder suche other coloures as they did finde for their purpose, whan they dyd see oportunitie. In suche maner that it may be sayd for trouth, that the Athenyans made not warre agaynste the Medes for the lybertie of Grece, nor the other Grekes to enioye their owne, but rather they dyd make it to the intent that the Grekes shulde sarue to them and not to the Medes. And those self Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes for to change the lorde, and not for to change him that ruled moste stronge for the same that ruled more weakely: but onely him that imagined moste euil, &amp; how he shuld gouerne hym, that intended beste. And albeit that the same Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Athenes be greately worthye of reprehension and reproche: yet we be not come hyder to procure it before people, whych knowe ynough of their wyll: but rather for to rebuke vs other Syciliens, whyche haue before oure eyes the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the other cyties of Grece, that they haue subdued: and yet notwithstanding thynke not to defende ourselues from them, nother to reiecte and caste of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces and sophemes, that they wolde delyuer vs, to wytte, that they be come for to ayde the Leontins, as their cowsins, and the Egestains, as their allyes. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me thinketh that we shulde the sooner thinke on our case, and doo them to knowe, that we be not Ionyens, Hellespontyns nor Islanders: whyche haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accustomed to be subiects of the Medes, and also of other, so that they do but change the lorde, into whosoeuer handes they fail. But we be Doriens of a free nation and come oute of Peloponese, whyche is a franke countrey and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byting in Sycille. And ought not to abyde vntill we be taken towne after town, knowynge that by thys onely meane we maye be taken, and that for this cause they haue prepared themself, and by that meane they goo about to separate and set vs asonder, some by their practices and vnder the colour of their alliance, to set some to warre against the other, and in speakynge gracyous and ioyful words, to do all the euyll that they maye vnto vs all accordinge as they shall fynde oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion. And if there be any one amonge vs, that perswadeth himself that the euil, which cometh to an other, that is not his next neyghbour, is yet very farre frome hym, and that it shall remayne there w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out coming to him, and that it is not be, to whome the Athenyans be ennemyes, but well they be the Syracusains, and that by this meane it shuld be follie to put his part in dangier, for to saue myne: I say vnto him, that he vnderstandeth not well, and that he ought to consider y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> defending myne, he defendeth his owne propre asmuch as myne. And somuche he doth it more assuredly and more to his aduantage, that he hath me in his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Also, whosoeuer hath suche fantasie, he ought to consyder, that the Athenyans be not comme for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge themself of the Syracusains for any ennemytie that they haue to them, but rather vnder coulour herof, to confirme their amytie with youe. And if there be any, which enuieth vs or that feareth vs, for that, that it is the custome, that the more puissant be alwaies enuyed or feared of the more feoble, and therfore it semeth to him, that if we receyue any dammage, we shalbe moore tractable and more gracious, and that he neuertheles shall remaine the more in suertie: trulye he trustethe in the thinge that is not in the power of hys intente and wylle. For men haue not fortune in their power, euen as they haue their wyll. And therfore if it happene otherwyse, than he thynketh: whyche hath suche fantasie, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that for the grief of the euyll that shall come vpon himselfe, he shall desire at an other tyme to enioye me and my goods lyke as he hath done before tyme: that shalbe impossyble for hym: sithens that he shall haue forsaken and refused to be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> me in dangiers of fortune, that were asmuche hys, as myne, not in name

Whiche is the thinge that they attempte for their power, for that, that they be come into thys countrey not onely agaynste vs, but rathere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste all. And yet they haue not done agaynste vs that, whyche they wylledde, though that they dydde vaynquishe vs in battaille, but after their victorie, they wente fromthence. Wherefore it may be clerly knowin, that whan we shalbe ioig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togiders, we ought not greately to care for them, and chiefly attendyng the succours that is to come from the Peloponesyans, whyche be better warryours than thies here. And truly yt ought not to seme to anny to be good for youe, not to busye youreselfe or not to meddle, nother for theym nor vs, and that the same shalbe reasonable as touching vs, consyderinge that ye be allyed togyder, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the more suertie for you.

Therfore lordes, it shalbe muche better done for to ayde those, whome men wolde oppresse, whiche be your parentes and neyghbours, in defending the comon welth of all Sycille, and not to suffer the Athenians to offende: than not to meddle wyth nother partie.

               <head>¶ The Oration of Euphemus the Athenyan to the Camerins. ☞The .xv. Chapter.</head>
               <p>WE were comme hider, Lordes Camerins, onely for to renewe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent amytie &amp; allya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that we haue with you. But sithens that this same Syracusaine hath charged and maliciously spoken agaynst vs, It is here nedefull to speake of our Empire, and howe, by good and iuste cause and reasone, we haue obteygned it: whereof thys same here, who hath spoken, beareth good wytnes by that, which he hath said, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ionyens haue al waies ben enemys of the Doriens: but it muste be vnderstande, how it is. We be truly Ionyens, and the Peloponesyans Doriens. And for that, that they be in greater nomber than we and our neyghbours, we haue trauailled to kepe oure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that they shulde not bringe vs into their subiection. For this cause, after the warre of the Medes, hauinge our army by sea, we wythdrewe ourselfe from the Empire and conducte of the Lacedemonyans, which were capytaines of all the armye of Grece, for that, that it was not more reasonable that we shulde be vnder them, than they vnder vs, but for that, that they haue bene more puissant than we. And consequently beinge made prynces and superiours of Grekes, who before tyme were subiectes vnto the Medes: we haue kepte and maignteigned oure reygne: knowynge that whan we shall haue asmuche puissance as they, for to resyste their force, that than we shall in nothynge be bounde vnto them. And for to speke more clerely, we haue vpon good cause brought into our obeissance and subiection the Ionyans and the Islanders, though that they be oure paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, as the Syracusains do say. But it was for thys cause, that they came wyth the Medes agaynste our cytie, whyche is their Metrip olitaine and from whence they be descended, for feare of losynge of their houses and domestycall goodes, &amp; hadde not the hardynes to forsake their townes and Cyties, for to conserue and kepe their lybertie, as we dyd, but rather they loued better to be bondemen and subiectes of the Medes for to saue their goodes, and also to comme wyth them agaynste vs, for to brynge vs into the self seruytude and bondage. For thies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons we haue well deserued to haue the seignyorye and rule ouer the other. For also for trouthe and wythoute anye difficultie we fournished in that same warre more ships, and shewed more harte &amp; courage, than all the other cyties of Grece. And chiefly we desarued to haue the rule &amp; dominyon ouer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ionyens, who did vnto vs the euyll that they coulde, beynge ioygned wyth the Medes. Wherefore if we desire to encrease our force agaynst the Peloponesians, and not to be more vnder the conducte and charge of others: we truly desarue to haue and obteigne Empire and lordeshyppe, as they, whyche all alone chasedde awaye the Medes,
<pb n="Clxx" facs="tcp:18267:172"/>
or at the leaste for the generall lybertie, haue taken and susteigned the dangier of other, aswell as of ours, and specyally of those here. And moreouer it is lawfull &amp; without reproche for euery man to serche his welth by all meanes that he may: which is the cause wherfore we be come hider vnto youe, knowing also that that, whyche we demande of you, ys asmuche proffytable for youe, as for vs: and for to shew you what it is, wherfore thies here do blame vs, and wherof they wold make youe afrayde. For we knowe well that those, that for feare haue suspytion of anny thynge, be ready to perswade at the begynninge by swete woordes: but afterwardes whan it cometh to the dede and busynes, than they do, as they fynd if for the beste. And in effecte we kepe and enterteigne oure Empyre and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytie, for feare, as we haue sayde, and for the same cause we be comme hydere for to conserue oure frendes, not for to putte theym into subiectyon and seruytude, but for to defende, that othere shulde not brynge theym into theirs. And men shulde not be abalshed, that we haue made so greatte an armye for to ayde and defende our frendes, nother ought yt to be said that we wold not make to great coste for a thynge that touchethe vs but lytle. For we doo repute and thinke that whan ye shalbe of power for to resiste the Syracusains: oure estate shalbe in muche moore suertie from the Peloponesyans: for that, that they shall haue somuche the lesse succours fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Syracusains, and that is the principall thing, for whyche youre allyaunce and amytie saruethe, for the whyche also it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and conuenyente that the Leontyns be restoredde and sette agayne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theyr howses, and that they be not subiectes, as their parentes the Eubeyans be: but puyssante for to susteigne warre agaynste the Syracusains for vs, for we be puyssance ynoughe of oureselfe for to susteigne warre in Grece agaynste oure neighbours. And the Chalcydes, who be oure subiects, and for whom thys Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusaine blaymeth vs (sayinge that it is not to be bileued, that we be wyllinge to sette agayne into lybertie thies here, holdynge the othere in subiectyon) shall sarue vs well, for in exemptynge theym frome delyuerey of men for the warre, they shalle fournyshe vs wyth monney: and lykewyse the Leontins shalle ayde vs that be in thys countreye of Sycille and oure other allyes and frendes, chif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those, whyche lyue in lybertie. For it muste be vnderstande, that a man that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by tyrannye and a cytie that hath Empire, repute nothinge dishoneste, that maye be proffytable vnto theym, and estemeth nothynge hys, that he hathe not in good suertie, and in all thynges he reputeth the othere, hys frendes or hys en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes accordynge to the chances and occurrantes of tymes and of affayres. Nowe it shulde not be proffytte for vs at thys present for to anoye our frendes, but rather to enterteigne them in power and authorytie, to the intent that oure ennemyes may be thereby more feoble. And thys ye may and ought to bileue by the fourme of lyuinge, which we vse with oure otherallyes in Grece. For we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate them so, as we parceue it to be for our moste proffit. To witte, of those of Chio and of Mantinea, we take ships, and as for the reste we leaue them in their lybertie. Some other we handle more rygorously and constrayne them to paye vs monney. And some other we treate symply as frendes and allyes, and not as subiects in any other maner of thing, although that they be Islanders, &amp; also easy to subdue for that, that they be nigh to Peloponese and by that meane lye opene to all inuasions. Wherfore by that, whych we do there, men may beleue what we wol do here, and that, for our proffit chiefly, we woll make you stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge for to kepe in feare the Syracusains, that would subdue you, and not only youe, but all the other Sicilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.

For we shall haue no more meane to passe into thies parties, seynge theym so puyssante. And wythout vs they shalbe tomuche puissante for you.

And to consider that this thynge shall not damage egally vnto all, but shall brynge proffytt vnto manye Grekes wythoute any damage. For throughe the puissance, whiche we haue readye, for to succoure, and reuenge the opppessedde, thoughe they be not oure subiectes, the other, that lye in wayte for theyme, and woulde do theyme violence and wronge, be forced to forbeare, and lyue in reste. And by this meane, those, whiche be in doubte to be oultraged, and wrongedde, be in suertie, wythoute annye their expense. Therefore, lordes, forsake not this suertie, whiche is comon to all those, whiche shoulde be oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedde, and necessarye at this presente for youe, but rather wyth oure ayde, render to the Syracusayns, that whiche they haue done to other, bryngynge theyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, vnto the equalitie, of their neyghbours, and sette vpon theyme sharpely, hauynge oportunytie: that ye be not alwayes in payne to defende youe, frome theyme. Thus dyd Euphemus speake? Nowe the Cameryns, were in suche dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position at that tyme, that they louedde the Athenyans, and woulde wyllynglye haue takene their parte: but for that, that they suspectedde them to be wyllynge to trouble, and vsurpe the Empire of Sycille. And as touchynge the Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayns althoughe that they hadde hadde difference and variance oftymes wyth theyme, for this, that they were so nygh their neyghbours: yet for that selfcause, they hadde sente vnto theyme some of their people, horsemen, to the intente, that if they hadde hadde the victorye, they shoulde not haue reprochedde theyme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes, that it had bene done wythout them, and also in tyme comynge they were wyllynge for to ayde theyme, rather than the Athenyans, thoughe it were but smally. But after that the Athenyans hadde hadde the victorye, for to shewe that they estemed the sayed Syracusains no lesse, than those that had bene vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisshed, after that they hadde consultedde and debatedde the matter amongest theyme, they made vnto theyme bothe one selfe aunswere, egall asmuche for the one as for the other.

But bifore that they approched, Gylippus sente an heraulte for to declare vnto theyme, that if they woulde departe out of Sycille wythin fyue dayes, he was contente to make treatie wyth them. Which thynge the Athenyans regardedde not, but sente agayne the heraulte wythoute annye aunswere. Than both parties preparedde theymeself to come to battaile, But Gylippus, seynge that the Syracusayns were in disorder: &amp; that he coulde not welle brynge theyme into renckes, he deuysedde for the beste to wythdrawe theyme into a place more spacious. Nycyas also on the other syde caused not his people to marche fourthe, but rather made theyme to kepe all in bataylle ray vpon their walles and rampares.

And the same day the Syracusayns toke a galley of the Athenyans, as it would haue entred into the greate porte. After that, the Syracusayns begonne a walle from the cytie vntil the heigh of Epipole. And they reysed an other fromthence o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart that same of the Athenyans, for to lett and defende the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (if they would suffer theyme to acheue and fynyshe it) frome enuironynge and enclosynge the towne on all sydes.

For that cause they prepared for to sende thider ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte or newe succours of men in the platt Barques, and the Lacedemonyans wyth the reste of the Peloponesians did the lyke. So the Corynthyans armed xxv. galleys for to accompaygnye their Barques, and to defende them agaynste the galleys of the Athenyans, whyche attended and lay in wayte for them in the passage at Naupacte.

For thys cause yt semedde to the Lacedemonyans, that as the fault &amp; offence of the breache, which was in the former warre, was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mytted on their bihalfe, so was i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And they of the towne, that were come oute of the towne agaynste the walles of the Athenyans dyd the lyke. The morowe after the Syracusains did nothynge, and also shewed that they would do nothing. For this cause Nycias, hauing sene that the daye precedinge they were egall, doubtinge least that they would haue ones againe essayed fortune, he comanded the patrons &amp; capitains of his shippes that they shulde repaire their shipps, those whiche had bene by any meanes crus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed or brused.

Than Ariston Corynthian, whiche was the beste maronner and patrone that was in the armye of the Syracusayns causedde yt to be knowin vnto the other capytaynes of the shyppes, that they shulde sende with all diligence of their men into the cytie and he woulde do the lyke for to geue order that men shulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayne those whyche had victuailles ready to brynge them to be solde to the sea syde, to the intente that they myghte cause all their people soubdaynely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasted, and fourthwyth to mounte agayne into their shyppes and to assayle the ennemyes vnlooked for or vnprouyded, whiche thinge was done, and in a right shorte space, greate habundance of victuailles hauynge bene brought to the sea banke, they retyredde faire and easely for to dyne.

Demosthenes, after that he was arryued, dyd immediatly geue order for to execute his enterpryse and to employ his force as sone as he coulde, for auoyding the erroure whiche Nycias had bifore comytted, who, beyng come into suche reputation that all Sycille was thereby afrayde, yet neuerthelas for that, that at the arryuall he came not bifore Sarragosse, but consumedde many dayes at Catana, he bothe loste hys reputacion, and also Gylippus, by meane of his retardance &amp; slackenes had had time for to bring to Sarragosse, the succours of Peloponese bifore his aryual.

Demosthenes consideryng whyche thynges, and also that thennemyes shoulde be greatly afrayedde of hys commynge, he woulde, that selfe daye that he arryuedde, doo some feate. And seynge that the walle, whyche the Syracusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yns hadde made ouerthwarte, that same of the Athenyans for to empesche and lett that men shoulde not fynyshe yt, was all syngle and that one myghte easely beate it downe: after that he had gottene Epipole, and the rampares that were there made, wherin were noe people, that might resist his strength: he hasted for to assaulte it, trustynge in a small tyme to see an ende of the warre, for he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed aither to take Sarragosse by force, orelles to leade and carye agayne all that same armye into hys countrey wythoute any more trauaillynge all the Atheny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, aswelle those that were there, as the other that remayned.

But afore that they had fully repoulsed the ennemys, they were repoulsed furst by the Thebayns, who furst susteyned their force and afterwardes by the othere, so that they were putt to flyght, wherein there was greate disorder and losse and manye dangers and difficultes whyche myght not welle be sene for that, that yt was nyght. For euene of thynges, whiche be done in the day tyme, men cannot knowe for trouth the certaintie of the whole by those that were thereat, for that, that skarcely any one man can declare what was done where he was and moste nyghe vnto hym, wherefore it ys impossible to knowe distinctly what hathe bene done in a conflicte by night bitwene twoo greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes.

For the ennemyes and those that were wyth the Athenyans, as the Argyues, the Corciriens and al the other Doryans dydde sounde and synge all of one facyon, whereby at all and asmanye tymes as that was done, those same Athenyans knewe not on whyche syde ytt was done nothere to what purpose.

Whereby yt chancedde that there were manye of them, that tombledde downe of the rocke into hollowe places, and where the waye failled theyme, beynge pursuedde and oppressed by the ennemyes dydde slaye theymself, for that that the place of Epipole was very hygh, and there were fewe comynges and wayes thereunto, the whyche were also verye straight, so that yt was verye

Duryng this time, the Dukes and chiefeste of the armye of the Athenyans were in greate sorowe, consideryng the ouerthrowe that they had receyuedde by the incomoditie of the campe, and of the armye whiche was in suche necessitie, that all generallye were greued and werye of that same siege, specially bycause that it was all full of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, and diseases, by twoo reasons.

And moreouer he hadde yet somme hope, for that that he knewe the affaires of the cytie better than anny of hys collegues and compaignions, and considered that the length of the siege was more to the disaduantage of the Syracusayns than vnto theirs, for that that they consumedde so muche monney, markedde specially the greate armye, whiche they susteignedde by sea. And also that same Nycyas hadde secrete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellygence and confederation wyth some of the towne whyche wylledde hym se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, that he shoulde not dislodge. For all the whyche respectes he maignteig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedde the matter and interruptedde the opynyon of those, that woulde that the siege shoulde haue bene reysedde, attendynge what myghte chance, and sayed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly that men oughte not to breake yt, and that he would neuer consente ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to forsomuche as he knewe welle, that if they shoulde doo yt wythoute lycence of the Athenyans, they woulde not be therewyth contentedde. And that those whyche shulde iudge vpon them whyder they hadde done wellle or euill, shulde not be of theyme that hadde bene in the campe, and that hadde sene the necessities of the armye: but they shoulde be othere people, whyche woulde not geue fayth to that, whyche the souldyars woulde saye: but soner to those, whyche shulde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse theyme and charge theyme by sought or studyed meanes. And chiefly the moste parte of those same souldyars which were there and cryed that men ought to departe, whan they were retourned to Athens, would saye wholy otherwyse, to wytt, that they hadde not bene of the opynyon for to departe, but rather that the Dukes had bene corrupted for money, wherfore he, whiche knewe the nature of the Athenians, would not put himself in hazarde to be condempned, as slouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and naughty but he loued muche better to endure the danger of his parsone agaynste the ennemyes, if nede requyred it. And besydes that, he shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the ennemys were in muche woorse estate than they, forsomuch as they were at great charge and expences for to waage huyred souldyars and also for to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigne one so great an army by sea which they had already susteigned one whole yeare for to warde, and defende the townes of their allyance, &amp; also were in great necessities of victuailles and of all other thynges, in suche sorte, that it shulde be impossible for theym to susteigne longer that charges. For he knewe for trouthe that they had already spente more than twoo thowsande talentes and also were yet in great debte, and that if they failled neuer so lytle in payment of the huyred souldiars, they shoulde be destroyed, for their force was more of estrangers than of their oune people, whiche thing was all otherwyse among them, wherfore he concluded that they oughte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to continue the siege and not to departe frome yt, as though they were most nedy and lacking monney, where as they were much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fournysshed therof.

And for conclusion, it semed not to hym that in any whatsoeuer manner, they shulde tarye longer there, but that they shulde incontinently departe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute longer tarying Eurymedon agrede to his opinyon. But notwithstandyng that which he made, Nycyas caused the thynge to be delayed.

But youe, that be here Athenyans, men experymented in so many warres, and also youe other our allyes and perpetuall frendes: ought to consyder that the yssues and chances of warres, be vncertayne, and to thynke that the fortune may aswell comme in our fauour, as she hath bene of the other.

Neuerthelas leste there be anny that vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not fullye the affayre, I wolle well declare yt vnto hym. The Athenyans came frome the begynnynge hyther to the intente to subdewe Sycille furste, yf they myghte, afterwardes Peloponese, and consequentlye the remanaunte of Grece. Who, albeit that they hadde a great and puissant Empyre, and that they hadde bene moore puissante than all the othere Grekes that hadde bene byfore thies, whyche presentlye be: yet youe haue many tymes vainquishedde theym by sea, whyche was whooly in their power: whyche thinge no man euer dydde, and yet at thys presente youe shall vaynquishe theym, as it is fullye apparante. For whan any people doo fynde theymselfe vainquished in the thynge, wherein they perswadedde themselfe to excede the othere, they loose greatelye theire reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyon.

And after that he had spoken all those wordes, the whiche he alwayes reputed more necessary than suffycient, he went with theym and ledde the footemen to the shoare of the sea: and so caused theym to kepe the beste order that he coulde, for to geue couraige to those, that were within the shippes. And Demosthenes, Menander and Eurymedon that were chiefest of the armye by sea, made with their shippes straight to the mouth of the poarte: the which the ennemys had already garnished and possessed, to the intente to breake the order of the sayde ennemys, and for to skatter their shippes for to gett into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depth of the sea. But on the other side, the Syracusains &amp; their allyes came in a manner wyth a lyke nomber of ships, partly against the mouth of the saide poarte, and partly aboute the same, for to empesche them on all sides, hauynge moreouer their footemen in the shoore of the sea for to succour theym to whatsoeuer parte theire sayde shippes shulde come to lande. Nowe Sicanus and Agatharcus, whyche kepte the twoo poinctes, were Capytayns of the army of the Syracusains, to wytt, of the ryghte and the lefte, and in the myddest were Pythen and the Corinthyans. The Athenyans than as they came to the mouth of the poarte, at the furst arryuall repoulsed the shippes, which were there ioyg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togiders: for to defende them not to yssue, and parforced themself to breake their lyens and chaynes, wherwyth they were fastened togiders. But the Syra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cusains and their allyes came on all sydes to russhe vpon them, not in the mouth of the poarte onelye, but euene throughe wythin the same. And so the combate was mooste cruell and moore dangerous, than annye of the othere former had bene: and men did heare the cryes of the chiefest and capytains, that comaunded the maronners to saile wyth greate strength. And euery one on his side enforced himself to shewe his arte and hys industrye, and lykewyse the men of warre, that were in the castells and vpon the deckes of the shippes, parforced themself to do their endeuour, aswell as the maronners, and for to kepe wel and defende euery one the place, that was appoyncted to hym. But forsomuche as the combate or battaille was made in a veraye strayghte and narrowe place, for that, that there was both of the one syde and of the othere fewe lesser than two houndred ships, whiche foughte togiders all wythin the porte or in the mouth therof, they could not oftene come wyth greate strengthe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For none hadde meane to retyre nor to recharge themself, but rather dyd myngle the one shyppe wyth the other, so as they encountred, were it in flyinge or in assaulting. And as oftenne as the one shyppe assaultedde the othere, those, that were in the Castelles and planchers of the same, did caste plenty of dartes, shott and stoanes the one agaynste the othere: but as they ioygned themselfe togyders, they came to fyghte hande to hande, and enforcedde themself to enter the one into the ships of the othere, whyche thynge chancedde in many of them, for that the place was narrowe: and in some places there were twoo agaynste one through constraynct, &amp; the gouernours and patrones studyed the one to warre vpon those of thenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mys, and the other to defende theirs, and that not by courses or tourns one after

the other, but all at one istant and on all sydes, wherby the bruytt was so great and maruaillous, that it was great horror and feare vnto those, whyche dydde fight, and also they coulde not vnderstande, the one the other, although that the Chiefe and Capytaynes of the one syde and of the othere made exhortations to theire people, aswell for sylence, as also for the instructione of the sea and for the greate ardor and desyre that euery one hadde for to vaynquishe. For the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans cryedde to theire men, that they shulde breake the order and the bandes of the shyppes that stoppedde the yssue of the poarte, and yf that euer they hadde had vertue or couraige, they shulde shewe yt at the same houre, if they hadde care for theire proper wealthe and to retourne into their countrey. And the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racusains, and their allyes declaredde vnto theirs, that it was the howre for to shewe their vertue for to defende that the ennemyes shulde not saue theymselfe and for to consarue and encrease the honnoure and glorye of theire nation. And the Capytaynes themselfe whan they parceyued anny to goo slackelye, or those that were wythin, not to do their endeuour: they called the patrones by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and demaunded, to wytt, the Athenyans, whider that it semed vnto them that the lande, whyche was the mooste ennemy that they hadde in the worlde, were more suer, than the sea, which they myght get and purchase wythin a short tyme. And the Syracusains, whider that they wolde flye before those, that did not fyght, but only for to flye away the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self, in whatsoeuer maner that it were. In the meane tyme, that this combate or battaille was made by sea, those, that were on lande at the shoore of the sea, were in greate and dyuers thoughtes and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies. For the Syracusains parceyued that it was questyon of gettinge muche more greate honnour, than they thoughte on from the beginning. And the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans feared, leste it shulde yet chaunce vnto them woorser, than to them that were in the sea, for that, that all their baguages were in the shippes, whiche they feared maruayllously to lose, and howe muche the more the combate or battail was variable and the victorie vncertayne, they were constrayned to haue dyuers opynyons, &amp; to make dyuers countenances or gestures. For beinge so nygh, that they might see manyfestly: those, that did see in any poinct their people, that had the better, lifted vp their handes to heauon, and prayed the goddes wyth a lowde voyce, that they woolde not defraude nor frustrate them to the victorie. And to the contrarye, those, that dyd see theirs to be vaynquished, dyd wepe wyth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playncte and pytuous cryes. And whan the combate was doubtful and sharpe, so that one coulde not iudge, who shulde haue the woorste therof, they made ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures and signes wyth the body suche as their desyre imported, as though that, helped their men, for feare that they hadde, leaste they shulde lose: and for effecte they did almoste suche actes wyth their bodies, as if they themself had foughten, and they were in the selfe sorowe, as they that did fighte. Also they perceyued in that same conflict many, that for a small occasyon saued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self, where they were discomforted. And specyally the Athenyans, being on lande, so long as their men did fyghte hande to hande in the sea, perceyued not onely the combate or faigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, but forsomuche as they were nighe, they hearde distinctlye, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainctes, lamentations and clamors, aswell of those that vaynquishedde as of them, that were ouercome: &amp; all other lyke thyngs that men might see and heare in a ryght sharpe conflicte of twoo puissant hoastes. And those, that were in the shippes had and suffred besyde the combate, the lyke sorrow and trauaille, Fynal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after that the storme had longe endured, the Syracusains and theire allyes did put the Athenyans to flyght, and as they did see them tourne the backe, with great cryes, and wyth greate force they chased them vnto the lande. And those

of the Athenyans that myght saue and caste themself on lande, wth the most dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that they coulde, they retyred into their campe.

And shortly the feare and the fraye was so greate at that same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, that neuer before that tyme, they had had the lyke. And the Athenyans did suffer and receue woorthely, that, whyche they had caused the Lacedemonyans to suffer and receue at Pylus: where, after that they had vainquished the armye by sea of the same Lacedemonyans, they destroyed them. And as the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nyans dyd than enter into the Islande, euen so the Athenyans retyredde at thys tyme to lande, wythout hauinge alwayes any hope for to saue themselfe, except that it were by some case or meane vnthought on.</p>

               <p>AFter thys so sharpe and cruell a battaille, wherein there was greate nomber of shippes takene and destroyed, and of men slayne: The Sy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>racusains and other their allyes hauinge the vyctorie, recouered the shippwrackes and the deade bodies, and beinge retournedde into the towne, they dyd reyse vp their trophee. As concerning the Athenyans, they were so astonied of the euilles that they hadde sene, and did see byfore their eyes, that they had no mynde for to requyre the shippwrackes and dead bodyes, but only studyed howe they myghte incontynently saue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>self that presente night, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were in dyuers opynyons. For Demosthenes was of aduyse that they shulde embarque themselfe in the reste of the shippes, whiche were lefte them, and that they shulde at the breake of the day eskape through the selfe poarte yf they myghte. For they had yet greater nomber of shippes, than the ennemys, to wytt, aboutes .lx. where the ennemyes had but fyftie. To the whyche counsaille and aduyse, Nycias agrede. But whan they woulde haue caused the people to be embarqued, the maronners refused yt, for the feare, whiche they yet had of the combate, wherin they had bene vaynquished, and yt semed not to them that they coulde any more haue better, wherfore they were forced to change opynyon, and all wyth one accorde determined to saue theymselfe by lande. Hermocrates the Syracusayne doubted greatly the same:<note place="margin">Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</note> and therfore consyderyng that yt shuld be a dangerous thinge, if one suche an hoste dyd retyre aud ioygnedde togider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne in any parte on lande, wherby they might begynne a new warre: he wente vnto the officers of the towne and sayde to them, that there ought to be hadde good regarde that same night, vnto the departure of the ennemys: declaring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by many reasons, the dangers, which might therby happene. And that it semed to him that all the men that were in armure in the towne, aswelle of the countrey, as strangers shuld yssue fourth and go to gett the passages, by whiche the saide Athenyans myght saue themself. And of that same opynyon were the othere, knowinge that he dyd say the trouthe: but they consydered that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignyons, which had fought all the day, were trauaylledde and desyred rest and

therfore wold not wyllingly obey vnto that, whiche shulde be commaundedde them touchinge the same, and somuche the lesse as the morowe followyng was the feaste of Hercules, in the whyche were prepared great sacryfices for to render vnto hym thankes for the same so greate a victorie: which doynge many, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge to the custome, were mynded to reioyce and refreshe themself by eatinge and drynkinge: wherefore, any other thinge shulde haue bene moore easy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, than to yssue fourth that same day in armure, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which reasons, they agrede not to the opynyon of Hermocrates: who, seinge that he coulde not brynge them vnto it, and consyderynge that the ennemyes that same nighte by retyrynge, might gett the passages of the mountaigns, which were stronge and difficille, deuysed one suche a sutteltie. For he sente some of hys compaignyons horsmen very nighe vnto the campe of the Athenyans, so that they myghte well heare them and faygninge to be of those of the towne that affectioned the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyans (wherof there were many that certefied newes to Nycias) and that they were come thider for to do it, saide that it was to be signefied vnto him, that he shuld not remoue for that night.

Those, whyche had hearde thies words, sent them to the Dukes and capytayns of the campe. who, not thinkinge that there had bene any deceite therin, determyned for to soiourne there that same nyght, &amp; also the morowe followynge. So they did it to be knowin to all the warryors, that they shuld ordeyn and make ready all their case for to departe wythin two dayes, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out carying any thing but only that, which shuld be necessary for them for the vsage of their parsonnes. During thys tyme Gylippus, and the Siracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sains sent to fournishe the passages, by the whyche they thought, that the sayde Athenyans shuld passe. And specially at the passage of the ryuers, they sett good garnysons, and also lykewyse in the other straight or narrowe places. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther syde, those of the towne issued fourth into the porte, &amp; recouered the shippes of the Athenians, wherof they burned some: which thinge those same Athenians had bifore determyned to do &amp; of the other, euery man did take, what he woolde &amp; wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After that, Nycias &amp; Demosthenes, hauing ordeined their case, as they did thinke good, departed fromthence the fourth day after the battaill, which was a thing right greuous &amp; right heauy to them all, not only for this, that they had lost all their ships, &amp; that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great hope, which they had had in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning for to sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>due that same cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, they were brought into a great danger, aswell of themself as of their cytie: but also for thys, that it was an harde &amp; myserable spectacle or sight to forsake their campe and their baguages, wherby their harts and all their spirits were ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and adnichillated, and thought made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> right heauy and astonyed.

Although that considerynge the greate euylles, whiche were chanced vnto theym, and that they feared to come vnto theyme, dyd putt theyme into greate sorowe and care, and muche more yet than they made semblante for. And besydes this that they were all sorowfull and afrayde, they were moreouer angry, the one agaynst the othere.

Wherfore you ought to take greater couraige, not blaymynge yourself beyonde reasone, be it for the losse that you haue made, or be it for the shame, whiche you endure. For as for me, I am in nothing in better condition, than any of youe the other be, nother in force, for that, that ye may see howe that I am weakened with my disease: no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet in goodes.

Howbeit forsomuche as I haue made greate sacrefices to the goddes and vsed greate goodnes and curtesie to men, ytt geueth me yet audacytie to hope welle hereafter. But I do see you estonyed and

But being repoulsed by the greate nomber of ennemyes, that were in the aduantagious place, to wytt, on hygh on the rocke, fromwhence they might the more sturdely, cast their dartes and their shott: they were constreyned to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and plante themself there, without doing any thyng, for that chiefly that in that same warre, there was greate thondrynges &amp; rayne, lyke as comonly it dyd in the same countrey after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haruest tyme, which was already bigon, wherof they were greatlye astonyed, and somuche the more, that they iudged, that the same was a prenostication of their destruction. Gylippus than perceyuynge that they were planted there, he sent one partie of his men by a syde waye, for to reyse vppe soubdainely a wall, in the waye, wherethrough the Athenyans were come, to the ende to enclose theym at their backes, but they, that parceyuedde it, sente thider a a bende of theirs, which empesched and repoulsed theym: and that done they also retyred nigh to a felde, which was nigh to that same passage, where they soiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that same night.

By meane wherof the water was incontynently troubledde, aswell with bloude of those, that were hurte, as with the mudde whiche they remoued by passing. And yet neuerthelas they ceased not to drynke for the greate thurste, that they had, but rather they did fight amongest theymeselfe for drynke, where they dyd see the water moste clere. Fynally the ryuer beynge replenysshed wyth deade men, whiche tombled the one vpon the othere, and all that same armye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, to wytt, some by the ryuer, and the other that were eskaped by the hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Nycias rendred hymself vnto Gylippus, trusting more in him, than in the Syracusayns. And submytting himself to the will of hym, and of the other Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loponesians, he prayed hym that he woulde not suffre, the othere men of warre, whiche were not yet deade, to be slayne. Whiche thyng Gylippus graunted vnto hym: and defended, that no man shoulde slaye anny more of the Athenyans, but that they shulde be takene prysoners. And so all those, that were not hydde (of whome was a greate nomber) were taken prysoners, and the three houndredde whiche were skaped in the night, were lykewyse taken by the horsemen, whyche were afterwardes sente vnto them, but whan they were all togiders, there was no greate nomber, of them. For the most parte vnclothed theymselfe and fledde fromthence by diuers wayes, whereby all Sycille was replenyshedde, for that, that they rendred not themself by composition, as those with Demosthenes: but a greate partie of them did dye. And in effecte, that same slaughter was so great or greater than any other that had bene made in Sycille at any tyme bifore du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge that same warre.

For suche or the veray nigh lyke cause, Nycias was slayne, a man of all those, that hath bene of my tyme, that least desarued it, for that, that al the mischief that had happened to him, was for hys vertues, wherein he dyd bestowe and applye all hys mynde. As touchyng the prysoners, that were ledde and caryed into Lythotomie, they were veray ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely entreated at the begynnynge. For beynge in so greate nomber in a lowe and narrowe place beynge opene, they were destroyedde, furste wyth the heate of the sonne in somer, and afterwardes Antumpne commynge, by cause of the nightes, whiche beganne to be colde, by the soubdayne change of the tyme: they felle into greate diseases, ioigned, that in the same straight place, wherein they were all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giders, they were constrayned to doo all their necessites, and chiefly those that dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edde, aswell of woundes as of sickenes, were all there buryed the one wyth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whereby the stenche was intollerable.

Afterwardes, they were all solde, resarued certene nomber of them whiche were Athenyans, and a certene small nomber of Italians, &amp; of Sicilians, whiche they founde to haue bene in their compaignie. And although that yt be difficille to shewe the nomber of all theyme whiche for trouth were prysoners, yet it is full certene that they were more, than seuen thousande.

And also they had no shyps in their hauone, nother monney in their treasure, nor maroners ne workemen for to make newe shyps, and for effect they were in a totall despeir of their welth.

And howe ambassadours were sente by the sayd Athenyans vnto Thissaphernes for to conclude yt. ☞The .viii. Chapter.</head>
               <p>DUryng this tyme, and bifore the rebellion of Rhodes, after the death of Chalcideus, and the battaille, that was made at Milet: the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonyans had Alcibades in greate suspition, so that they did wryte to Astyochus, to cause hym to dye, for he was ennemye of Agis their kynge, and in the reste he was reputed a man of lytle fayth. But he beyng aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised herof, had withdrawin hymself, euen at begynnynge as he had knowlaige of yt, towardes Tissaphernes, with whome, he had practised, all that he coulde agaynste the Peloponesians, and had declared vnto hym all that he had lerned of their affaire, and also he was the cause to make hym to abate and dymynyshe the soulde or wages that he payde vnto the souldiars, and in stede of a groate of Athenes, whiche he shulde haue payde them for the daye: to delyuer theym three half pence onely, whereof he also dyd oftentymes faille the paymente, and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the sayd Alcibiades, he excused himself, saying that the Athenians, whiche had better vnderstandyng in the feate by sea than they, dydde paye vnto their maronners, but the sayd wages: and that he would not bryng them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, aswell for to space the monney: (not for annye lacke that he had therof) as also not to geue them occassion, to abuse ytt, and to become more lascyuious and delycate, somuche the more, that the surplusage of that whiche shulde be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye for them to lyue wythin their vesselles, shulde not by theym be expended in superfluous thynges, whereby they shulde be the more weakened. And where that he deteigned from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a certene tyme, one parte of the payment, yt was to the ende that they shulde haue no occasion to departe &amp; habandone the shyps, if nothynge were due vnto them, whyche thynge they durste not do, whan they shulde perceyue themself contregaiged with any parte of their soulde. And for to be hable to obteigne and perswade this same vnto the Peloponesians, the same Tissaphernes, by the counsaille of the said Alcibiades, had gotton all the patrons of the shyppes and all the capytaines of the townes for monney, resarued, that same Hermocrates of the Syracusayns, who onely dyd resiste agaynste yt with all hys power, in the name of all their confederates. And moreouer the selfe Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades, speakynge for Tyssaphernes, dyd with reasone confute the cyties whiche demanded monney of the other confederates, for to kepe and defende them. And furst he said to the Chiens, that they ought to haue shame for to demande mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, considered that they were the richest of Grece, &amp; also that they were sett into lybertie and exempted from the subiection of the Athenyans, throughe the ayde of the Peloponesians, wherfore there was no apparance to demande that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cyties shulde brynge into danger their parsones and also their goodes and monney for to consarue the lybertie of that same cytie. And as touchynge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cyties, that were also lykewyse rebelled agaynste the sayed Athenyans, that they dyd greate wronge not to be wyllyng to paye for the defence of their lyber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that, which they had accustomed to pay to the Athenyans by ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e or by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedie. And moreouer he sayde that to the surplusaige, Tyssaphernes had reasone
<pb facs="tcp:18267:211"/>
to spare the monney in that manner for to susteigne the charges of the warre, at the least vntill he shulde haue newes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the kynge, whider that he intended that the soulde shuld be entierly payde or not, and than if he comanded him to pay the whole, there shulde be no lacke therin, &amp; also shulde recompense the cyties parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly euery one accordinge to his deserte. And moreouer the sayed Alcibiades counsailled Tyssaphernes, that he shulde not go aboute to make by any meanes an ende of that same warre, &amp; also that he shulde not cause the ships that he had caused to be tacled in Phenice to come, nother those which he had caused to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Grece to ioigne with the same of the Peloponesians, for in that doyng he shulde make them lordes both of the sea, &amp; of the lande. But rather that he shuld maignteigne them alwayes in strife &amp; in warre, forsomuche as by that meane he shulde be alwayes in his puissance to prouoke the one of the parties againste the other, which shuld haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him. But if he suffred that the one of the parties were destroyed, &amp; that the other might haue the dominion in sea and in lande: he shulde fynde none, that might ayde him againste those same, if he would chastise them, and it shulde be forced y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he himself in that case shulde onely take the adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with greate danger &amp; greate expences. Wherfore it was better, with smal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to enterteigne them in controuersie, &amp; by that meane to haue hys estate in full suertie. And also he shewed further to the sayed Tyssaphernes that the ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Athenians shulde be muche more comely for the king, than the same of the Lacedemoniens, for that, that the same Athenians went not about to rule on lande. And their intent and facyon of making warre, was muche more proffy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the kyng, than the same of the other, for this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Grekes, whiche they shulde subdue in the sea, beynge his allyes, shulde redute and bringe them partly into their seruitude, and those that were in the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, inhabyting in the prouynces of the king, shulde remaine his subiectes, where the Lacedemoniens proceded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to a contrary ende, to wytt, to restore all the Grekes into lybertie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was to beleue that those, whiche went about, to bring the Grekes oute of seruitude of the self Grekes, that they would not suffre that they shulde remayne in the lyke bondage of barbarous or estrangers, &amp; so would go about to sette in lybertie all those, that bifore tyme were not restored therunto, which tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were in the subiection of the kinge. Wherfore he counsailled him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shulde suffre the one partie to weaken &amp; destroy the other. For after that the Athenians shal haue lost the greatest parte of their force, the Peloponesians shuld be so weakened, that he shulde easely chase them out of Grece. Tyssaphernes did easely agree to thies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and knewe suffyciently that Alcibiades had tolde him the trouth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuche as he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehende &amp; perceiue it by the affaires that occured. And insuing his counsaille, he furst payde the soulde to the Peloponesians. But for al that he would not suffre theym to make warre, but rather, he sometyme shewed them that they must attende the ships of the Phenecia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that shulde come, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme that they were to hoate &amp; to ayger to fight. And by that meane he troubled all the enterpryse, and made the same armye, that was so fayer and puissante, in manner as vnproffitable. And also in other thynges he declared moste openly wyth woordes, sayinge that he vnwyllyngly made warre in compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And somuche the more, whan men shulde vnderstande that he had greate amytie with Tyssaphernes, lyke as it happened.

Wherupon Pysander, seynge the greate multitude of the Againesayers, he went thider, where the greatest preasse of them was, and takyng theym by the hande the one after the other, he demaunded of theym if they had any hope of victorye agaynste the Peloponesians by other meane, seynge that they had so greate an armye by sea, as theirs, and greate nomber of cyties of Grece in their allyance, and moreouer the kynge and Tyssaphernes, who fournysshed them wyth mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, wherof the Athenians had no more, nother coulde hope to haue, but on the kynges bihaulf. Wherunto al those, whome he demaunded, aunswered him that they perceyued none othere meane.

For afterwardes, wyth the tyme, it shoulde be in their facultie and power for to change yt, if they thought good.

Through thies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and perswations of Pysander, the people, whiche at the begynnynge dyd take this change of the estate and gouernance to be strange, vnderstandyng by the proposition of the same Pysander, that there was no other meane to saue the Empire and the cytie, partly in feare and partly in hope, they were contente that the gouernance shulde be commytted into the hande of a smalle nomber of men. And the decree was made, wherby the people dyd geue charge and comissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Pysander, wyth tenne other cytizeins for to go to Tyssaphernes and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades, for to create and accorde wyth them, touchyng the same, in suche sorte as shulde seme vnto them moste proffitable for the cytie.

And the combate was sharpe &amp; dangerous on both sydes, wherin the Chiens shulde not haue had the woorse, but the night came vpon theym which departed them, and the Chiens retourned into the towne. In the self time Dercilidas being arryued by lande in Hellesponte, the towne of Abide, did fourthwith render it self into his handes &amp; of Pharnabazus, and twoo dayes after, the citie of Lamsaque dyd the lyke, whereof, Strombichides, who was afore Chio, beynge aduertised, he came soubdaynly with, xxiiii, Athenians shipps for to succour and defende that same quarter, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest the which ships, there was barques that caryed me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at armes, Being tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arryued at Lamsaque, &amp; hauing vainquisshed in battaille those of the towne, that yssued fourth againste theym, he did take euen at one comynge, the sayd towne, for that, that it was not walled, togiders with all those whiche were within the shipps, afterwardes hauinge restored the free men into the towne, he sailled fourthwith vnto Abyde. But seinge that there was no hope to take it nor apparence for to assiege it, he departed and did go to Seste,<note place="margin">Sestus</note> which is a cytie in the countrey of Cheronese, situated directly foranempst Abyde, the whiche the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des had holden for a certene time, and therin he did putt a good garnison for the saulf garde and defence of all the countrey of Hellesponte.

               <head>Howe a greate deuision happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongest the Athenyans, aswell within the cytie, as wythout, chiefly in the army that was in Samie, by meane of the change of the estate and gouernance of the same, whiche did greatly endomage them. ☞The .x. Chapter.</head>
               <p>THe differente and controuersie of the sayd Athenyans was for that, that in the same tyme, the estate and gouernance of the towne, had bene changed at Athens, oute of the power of the comon people, vnto a smalle nomber. For Pysander and hys compaignions, beynge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned to Samie, brought the army that was there, to their wylle and obeys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, and one greate parte of the Samiens, chiefly they exhorted the prycipalle of the towne to take the gouernance thereof into their handes, althoughe that there were manye, whyche were wyllynge to maignteigne the common estate, wherby happened greate deuision and sedition bitwene them. Also the Athenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that were there in the armye, hauynge consulted vpon the thyng amonge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and seynge that Alcibiades was not earnest in the matter, they concluded to forsake hym, and not to calle hym agayne, for that, that it semed to theyme, that thoughe he dyd come agayne into the cytie, yet shulde he not be conueniente nor mete, for to order and gouerne the affaires vnder the gouernance of a small nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but rather was expediente that those that were there, of the estate, whereof was question: shulde deuyse the manner, howe that practique shulde be conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedde, and also howe the feate in warre shulde be pursued. Whereunto euery man of theym dyd readely offer to contrybute of hys oune monney and all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges necessarye, knowynge that they shulde no more laboure for the comons nor for any other, but for theymself. And so they sente againe Pysander and the moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the ambassadours whyche had bene sente towardes Tyssaphernes, vnto Athenes, for to geue order there in the affaires, and charged them, that through al the cyties whiche they shulde passe, of the obeyssance of the Athenyans, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they shulde comytte the gouernance into the hande of a smalle nomber of the pryncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palles, and the other parte of the sayd ambassadours also departed &amp; euerye one dyd goo into sondry places for to do the lyke. And also they ordeyned that Dyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes,<note place="margin">Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.</note> who was tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the siege of Chio, shuld go into the prouince of Thrace, which was delyuered into his gouernance, who, in his departure from the sayd siege, passing through Thasse, abolisshed the comon estate, and comytted the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance into the handes of a small nomber of men. But being departed oute of the cytie, the greate parte of the Thessyans, hauing enclosed their towne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wall aboutes one moneth after his departure, perswadedde themself to haue no more nede to be gouerned by those, which the Athenians had sett there, nor by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> meane to remaine vnder their obeyssance: but rather hopedde within shorte time to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer entier lybertie through the ayde of the Lacedemonyans, for that, that their cytizeins, which were bannisshed by the Athenians, were withdrawin to Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and sollycited with their power, that shyppes shulde be sente vnto theym and that the towne myghte rebelle. So it chanced vnto theyme hooly in that same, as they desyred, whiche is, that the cytie wythoute anny danger was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytted into their lybertie, and the commons, whyche were bente to speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste the estate of a smalle nomber, were wythoute hurte rebuke or offence

depryued of the gouernance, and to those that toke partie wyth the Athenyans, and vnto whome Diotrephes had betaken the gouernement, yt chaunced whole contrary to their thinkinges. And the lyke was done in many other of the cyties subiected to the Athenyans, which, consyderynge (as it semeth to me) that they shulde haue no more feare of the Athenyans, and that the same fourme of lyuing in their obeissance vnder the coulour of pollecie, was for trouth but a couloured seruitude or bondage, they attended al for a true lybertie. As touching Pisander and hys compaignions, that were gone w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym, they comytted the gouernance of the cyties, through whyche, they passed, into the hande of a small nombere, at their pleasuer: and oute of some of the same, they dyd take souldyars, whyche they caryed wyth them to Athenes, where they founde that their complices and frendes, hadde already done many thynges, redoundinge to their intente for to abolishe the comons estate. For one Androcles, who had greate authoritie wyth the comon people, and that had bene one of the chiefest, that were cause of the ban<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishmente of Alcibiades, was slayne by a secrett conspiratie of some yonge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignyons of the cytie for twoo purposes. The one for that, that he had tomuche authoritie wyth the comon people, the other for to acquire and gette the good wille of Alcibiades: who as they thoughte shulde haue comme agayne into au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorie, trustinge that he wold make Tyssaphernes their frende. And for the selfe purposes they had by lyke meanes caused some other to be slayne, whyche semed vnto them, to be contrary vnto that practique: &amp; also they had shewed vnto the comons by studyed and apparante narrations and reasons: that there shulde be no more wages payde but to those, that sarued in the warrre, and that in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mynistration of the como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> affayres, no greater nomber shulde entermeddle, than of fyue houndred men, and chieflye of those, that were hable to sarue the comone weale, both wyth bodyes and wyth goodes: whyche thynge semed honnorable to the comon people, and those same, whiche were cause of the brynging downe of the comon estate, thought yet by that change to haue authorytie. For also the auncyent facyon of assemblynge the people and the counseille in alle affaires, of hearynge the opynyons of all men, and of followynge the greater nomber, didde stylle remayne. But nothing might be proponed or declared wythout delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the small nomber, whyche hadde the authorytie. Amongest whom, there were that conferred a parte of all that shulde be proponed and sette fourthe for their intente: and whan they had said their opynyon, no man durst speake against yt for feare: seinge the great nomber and authorytie of the said gouernours. For also, whan any dyd speake against yt, meanes were founde for to cause him to dye: also they dyd no iustice, nothere make inquyrie for manquellers or murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: wherof the people were so afrayed and abashed: that they durste not saye a worde: and they thought that they dyd gett very muche by holdyng their peace or kepynge sylence, in that they receyued no other incomodytie and violence. And somuche the more they were in greater feare, that they doubted, leaste there had bene a much greater no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people in that same conspiracie, for it was not very easye to vnderstand, who were the coniuratours and accomplices or parttakers in that same secte, aswell for greatnes of the cytie and multytude of people, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that the one dyd not knowe the intent of the other, and also dyd not complaine the one to the other, nother to discouer his secret vnto hym, nor to treate to take secrete vengeance therof. For the suspition and mystruste was so great through oute the people, that a man durste not truste, no not hys acquaintance and fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, doubting leaste they had bene of the same co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spiratie, for that, that there was in yt suche thynges, as neuer were doubted. By reason whereof a man coulde no

more knowe, to whyche, of the comons he might truste, wherby the estate of the coniurators or parttakers was greatly assured, pryncypally bycause of the said diffidence or mistruste. Pysander and his compaignions than being come in the tyme of that same trouble, they brought to passe right easly, &amp; in a small season, their enterpryse. And furst hauyng assembled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, they caused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to consent to chose tenne grephiers and secretayries, the which shulde haue full power and auctorytie to pronounce to the people, that whyche shulde be deuysed to be putt in consultation for the welthe of the cytie at a daye, which was named.

And who soeuer shulde wryte that the pronouncer did againste the lawes, or otherewyse did him oultrage or empeshemente, shuld be greuously punished. Afterwardes, the saide decree was published, whiche was of this substance, that all the officers whiche were than in authoritie by the chosynge of the comons, shulde be abolis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed and sett of, and that no wages shuld be payde vnto them: &amp; that they shuld electe fyue presedentes, who shuld afterwards name an houndred men, and eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of those, shuld choise three other, which shuld be in the whole foore houndred: who, whan they shuld come vnto the court, shuld haue full power &amp; ample auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torytie to execute that, which shulde be determyned to be for the welth of the co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon weale: and moreouer to assemble fyue thousand cytezeins, at all and asmany tymes, as they shuld thinke good.

                  </note> who was in great reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For truly there was not at the same tyme in the cytie any man that excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in vertue, and also he was very well aduysed and prudente for to fynde &amp; counsaill in good, expedient &amp; comon affayres: &amp; moreouer he had a great grace to speke and declare them: and albeit that he neuer wolde come to the assemblie of the people, nother to any other co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregation, except that he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: yet the comon people had him in suspition for the effycacitie &amp; elegancie of his speakinge. And though that he wolde not entermedle in causes, yet euerye man that had any matter, were it iudiciall or touchinge the comons, he reputed that he had great fauour, yf he might haue hym for counsaillor. And aftere that the estate of foore houndred was abragated &amp; that men proceded against those, whiche were the pryncipall authors therof, being accused as the other, he defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his case and answered therein in my conceyte better than anny man, to my re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrance, euer dyd. Phrynicus also shewed hymself greatly fauorable to the same comons estate, for feare of Alcibiades, whome he knew to haue vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which he had treated w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Astiochus being at Samie: for it semed to him that he wold neuer retourne so long, as the said gouernance of foore hou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured. And also he was estemed a man vertuous &amp; constant in great aduersities for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had sene by experyence, that he neuer shewed himself that his herte failled him.

yeares after that the tyrantes or euyll rulers were bannished. And they had not only bene exempted out of the subiectyon of all other: but also for, more than the halfe of the foresaid tyme, they had gouerned ouer other people. The assemble of the people beinge departed, after that they hadde approued and ratefyed the sayde decree, the foure houndred gouernours were afterwardes broughte into the courte, in thys manner. The Athenyans were contynually in armure by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the ennemyes, whiche were in Decelea, to wytte, the one for to warde the walles, the other the gates and other places, whereunto they were appoyncted. And whan the assygned daye dyd come for to do the sayde acte: those that were not of that coniuration or secte: were suffred to goo into their howses, as the cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome was. And to those, that were of yt, was comaunded that they shulde tary, not in the place of their watche, and where their weapons were, but in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parte therby, and that if they perceyued any that woolde resyste that, which was done or empesche or let yt, that they shulde repoulse suche wyth their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons if nede were. And those, whiche were deputed and ordeyned therunto, were the Andrians, the Thenyans, three houndred of the Caristiens, and those of the cytie of Egyne, whyche the Athenyans had caused to come for to inhabitt there. The thynges beynge than so ordonned, the foure houndred chosen to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, euery of them bearyng a dagger hydde vnder his habillement or clothing, and wyth them sixe skoore yonge men for to assyste and strengthen them, whan it shulde be nedefull: entred all togiders into the pallays, where the courte was holden, and enuyronned the senatours, whyche dyd sitt in counsaill. Who aftere the custome declared their opynyons by blacke and whyte beanes, and so sayde vnto them that they shulde take their payment, for the tyme, that they had ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and departed. Whiche payment the same foure houndred had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as they yssued fourthe of the counsailles chamber, they delyuered to euerye of them their duties. And by that meane, they departed out of the court without makynge any resistence, and wythout that the reste of the comons ones styrred. And than the foure houndred dyd entre and choyse amonge themselfe certayne threasouriers and receyuours, and that done, dyd sacrefyce solempnelye for the treatinge of the sayde newe offycers. And by that meane the comone gouernance was hooly changed, and a greate parte of that, whyche was done byfore that ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, was reuoked, resarued, that they did not calle agayne the bannished men, for that Alcibiades shulde not be comprysed therein. In the reste, the sayde gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours dydde all thynges at theire wylle, and amonge othere caused some of the Cytezeyns to dye, doubtinge leaste that they shulde haue bene placedde in theire steede, for that they semed to them not to be for their purpose. Some other they dyd put into prysone, and some they bannyshed. That done, they sente vnto Agis kynge of the Lacedemonyans, who was at Decelea, an Heraulte: signefying that they woolde reconcyle themselfe wyth the Lacedemonyans, and shewynge hym that he myght conceyue and take more suertie and truste in them, than in the va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ryable and vnconstant comons. But he, whiche thought wel, that the cytie could not be but in trouble: and that the comons woolde not suffre their authorytie to be easely abolished, specially, if they parceyued any great army commyng byfore their towne: and that the estate of the sayde foure houndred was not so establis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, but that it myght well be troubled, he made them no answer touchyng the appoynctement. But wythin fewe dayes after, he caused to assemble a greate no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men of warre, in the countrey of Peloponese, &amp; wyth them and those, that he had Decelea, he came vnto the walles of the cytie of Athenes, trustynge that they wolde haue rendred themself to hys wylle, aswell for the trouble, that was
<pb facs="tcp:18267:217"/>
amonge them, both wythin and without the cytie, as also for feare, seing so great puissance at theire gates. And though that they woolde not doo yt, yet yt semed vnto hym, that he myght easely take the great walls by force, for that, that they were solitarie and required euer great watche and warde. But it chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced wholy otherwyse, for the Athenyans dyd make no tumulte nor insurrection amongest themself, but they caused their horsemen and also one parte of their fotemen, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well well armed, as lyght armed to yssue fourth, the whiche repoulsed inconty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently, those, which were approched next vnto the wals, and did slay a great part of them, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> spoiles of whom, they caryed into the towne. Wherupon Agis seyng, that his enterprise did take no good effect, he retourned to Decelea, &amp; certen days after hys retourne, he sent backe the strange souldyars, whych he had caused to come for that same enterpryse, and reteygned those, that he hadde furste there. And neuerthelas the foore houndred sente eftsones vnto hym for to treate the appoynctement, the whyche he did take in good parte, so that he perswaded them to sende Ambassadours vnto Lacedemonie for to treate the peace, whyche they greately desyred. On the other syde, they sente tenne cytezeins of their faction or secte, vnto those, that were at Samie, for to shewe them, amonge many othere charges, whyche they had, that the same, which they had done in changing of the comons estate, was not to the damage of the cytie, but for the welth therof, and that the auctorytie, was not in the power of foore houndred onelye, but of fyue thousand, and therby that it was asmuch in the handes of the comons, as bifore time it had bene: for somuch as at no affayre, that euer was treated vpon in the cytie as domesticall, nor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>in the self countrey as foreyne, there was neuer fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de vnder the comons gouernance so great a nomber, as fiue thousand men.

Wherefore they sayde that he shulde delaye them no moore, but saylle to assaulte the sayde Athenyans, and the Syracusayns moste instantely requyred hym thereunto. Astyochus and the other Chiefz that were there for the confederated cyties, being aduertysed therof, determyned to faight, vnderstandinge specyally, that there was greate mutyne and sedytion at Samie.

And the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, that he made for that, that he hadde not broughte the shippes: declared eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently his malice &amp; deceyte. For he sayd, that it was not for that, that the Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians had not fournyshed suche nomber of shippes, as he had appoincted them. And yet neuerthelas it is to belieue that the kynge wolde haue bene ryght ioye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulle that he myghte haue done the selfe effecte wyth lesser nomber, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente wyth lesser expences.

Whereupon, and throughe occasion of that same newes, Theramenes, Aristocrates, and the other, whiche were of their confederatie, aswell of the nomber of foore houndredde, as other, were the more chaffed and heated in their enterpryse. And somouche the more, that the armye by sea, the whiche was at Ye, hauyng takene the poorte and soiourne at Epidau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, made manye coursynges and pillages, in the lande of Egyne. Wherefore The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramenes sayd, that it was not to be bileued that if the sayd armye had bene wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge to saille into Eubea, that it woulde haue come coursynge vntyll the goul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe of Egyne, for afterwardes to retourne to Epidaure, except that they had bene called by those whyche helde and fortefyed Pyreus, lyke as he had alwayes said. For this cause, after manye declarations made vnto the people for to cause the comons to reise agaynst theym, it was fynally determyned to take Ye, by force.

               <p>THe people, beyng at the day assigned, assembled in the temple of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus: bifore that any thyng had bene proponed and declared, newes came, that, xlii, shyppes were departed frome Megare, for to comme to Salamyne, vnder the conducte of Agisandridas. Which thyng se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the people, to be the effecte of that, whiche Theramenes and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had sayd bifore, that the armye by sea of the ennemyes, would come straight to the walle, whyche was in buyldynge, and that for the same cause it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediente for to rase it downe. And yt myghte be, that Agisandridas, kept hymself aboutes Epidaure, and other nygh places of a sett purpose, knowyng the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion wherein the Athenyans were, for to execute some good thynge, if he myghte see occasion and oportunitie. The Athenyans vnderstanding than theis newes, departed all ronnyng into Pyreus, reputyng the same domesticall and intestyne warre, more greate and more dangerous, than the same of the ennemyes, and beyng bifore their poorte, more than if it had bene in anny other place further of. For thys cause some dyd caste theymself into the shippes, whiche were ready and tacled within the poorte: the other they did bringe to shoare, and trymmed those whiche were not ready: and the other mounted vpon the walles, that were at the entrynge of the sayd poorte, for to defende it. But the Peloponesyans shyps, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge passed Sunie saylled or kepte their way, bitwene Thorice and towardes Prastie, and came fromethence to aboorde at Orope. Whiche parceyued, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenyans did soubdainly apprehende and take the maroners, which they founde readye (lyke as the custome is to doo in a cytie, whyche is in Ciuille warre, and in greate danger of ennemyes) for to wythstande yt. For also all the comforte and succours, whyche they than had, was oute of Eubea, the coaste of the lande be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge occupyed by the ennemyes. And so they sente Tymocrates, with the shyps that they coulde than make readye into Erithree, whyche after, that he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryued hauynge in all, xxxvi, shypps, those same comprysed, which were bifore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readye in Eubea: he was constrayned to fight, forsomuche as Agisandridas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge already dyned, was departed frome Orope, and dyd come agaynste Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrie, whiche is not distante from the said Orope but three skoare stades by sea. The Athenyans, than seynge the armye of the ennemyes comynge in battaylle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste theym: they mounted soubdaynly into their shypps, thynkynge that the souldyars shulde haue fourthwith followed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but they were skatered through all the quarters of the towne, for to make prouysion of victuailles, for that, that the burgeoses of the same had maliciously founde meane that there were no vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuailles to be solde in the markett, to the ende that the sayd souldyars, being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed to serche victuailles through the towne, they myght not in tyme mount into the shyppes, and by that meane that the ennemyes myght betrapp or soub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynely take them. And also they in the reste conuenanted wyth the ennemyes to make theym a signe, whan they shoulde perceue that yt were tyme, for to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile the sayd Athenyans shypps. Whyche thynge they dyd. And notwythstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge all this, the Athenyans, that were in the shyps wythin the poorte, susteig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a good whyle the force of the enemyes, but at the ende they were constrayned to putt theymself in flyght. So they were followed by the ennemyes euene vnto
<pb facs="tcp:18267:224"/>
the shoare of the sea, whereupon those, whyche retyredde into the towne as into the lande of frendes, were by the burgeosses, villaynously slayne. But those, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che retyred into the fortes, that the Athenyans helde, were saued. And lykewyse the shyps, that coulde saylle vnto Chalcide were saued. But the other that were to the nomber of, xxii, were takene, with all those, that were in them, maronners and othere, whereof some were slayne, and the other deteigned prysoners, and by reasone of the same victorye, they reysed vp there a Trophee and wythin a small tyme after, they brought all the Islande of Eubea, into their obeyssance, excepte Oree,<note place="margin">Oreum</note> whiche the same Athenyans dyd holde, and also compounded with all the places borderynge thereaboutes. Whan the newes of the same ouerthrowe, dyd comme to Athenes, all the people were afrayde asmuche or more, than of annye thynge, that had euer happened vnto theym. For although that the ouerthrowe, whyche they had receyued in Sycille had bene of greate ymportance, and many other losses whyche they had had at dyuers tymes: yet the hoste whyche was at Samie, beynge tourned and rebelled agaynste theym, and not hauynge nother more shyps nor men to putt in theym, and they theymselues moreouer in suche dissension in the cytye, that they dyd but attende and watche the houre for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade the one the othere: to haue presently loste, after so manye calamyties and myschances, euene at one instante all the Islande of Eubea, oute frome the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che they had more succours than oute of their oune lande of Athenes: it shoulde haue bene a ryght strange thynge, yf they had not bene thereof astonyed. And so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche the more that the sayd Islande beynge so nyghe vnto the cytie, they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red greatly leste the ennemyes in the furye and heate of the same victory, would haue come fourthwyth, all wyth one power, into Pyreus, the whych being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye vnprouyded of shypps, if they had had couraige, they myght well haue done, and chiefly they myght haue assaulted the cytie, the whiche by that meane shulde haue come yet into greater deuysione, or at the leste assieged it. By whych doynge those that were in the armye by sea of the Athenyans in Ionum, thoughe that they were aduersaries, and agaynste the gouernemente of the foore houndredde, shoulde yet haue bene constrayned for their particuler interest and for the welth of their cytie to habandone &amp; forsake the sayed countrey of Ionum, for to come, to the succours of their cytie. And by that meane all the countrey of Ionum, of Hellesponte, and the Islandes that be in that same sea aboutes Eubea, and in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte all the Empire and the seigniorye of the Athenyans shulde haue come into the power of the Athenyans. But the Lacedemonyans, bothe in the same and in manye othere thynges were muche proffytable to the Athenyans, and prynci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallye throughe the multytude and dyuersitie of people that there in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignie, who were muche differente, contrary and disagreynge, bothe in wylle &amp; in manner of lyuing. For some of them were hasty and dyligente: the other slacke and loyterynge, some hardye and the other fearefull, and specially touchyng the feate by sea, they were in great discorde, whych redounded to the greate proffytte of the Athenyans. And that myght be welle knowyn by the Syracusayns. Who, for that, that they were all of one accorde and of one wylle: dyd greate thynges, and had faire victoryes. And for to retourne to the hystorye, the Athenyans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge lerned theis newes, in whatsoeuer manner and necessitie that they were, they neuerthelas armedde twentye shyppes, and fourthwyth at the selfe houre, they assembled togider in the self place of Pyreus, and at an other tyme, in a place whyche they name Picne,<note place="margin">Picne.</note> wherein they had at othere tymes accustomed to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble theymself, and it was concludedde in the same assemblies that the foore houndred shoulde be deposed, and that the auctorye shoulde be in the handes of

In thies enterfeates, Pysander and Alexicles and some othere of the nomber of foore houndred wythdrewe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to Decelea. But Aristarchus, whiche was their chief wythout other compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignie of theyme, dyd take a certene nomber of Archers, whyche were there of the moste barbarous or estrangers, and departed fromethence to Oenoe,<note place="margin">Oenoe.</note> whyche ys a castelle that the Athenyans helde in the frontiers of the Beotiens, whome the Beotiens dydde kepe assieged by cause of certene murthers, that those, of the sayd castelle had commytted and done to their people, and there were wyth him certene Beotians that were comme of their oune mynde. Aristarchus being there arryued, he treated wyth the sayd Corynthians and Beotians to cause the place to be rendred vnto theym. And so he dyd parlamente and speake with those that were wythin yt.

And on the othere syde, Thrasibulus, who had bene aduertised at Samie, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of the sayd bannysshed men to Erese, was already come thider bifore with fyue shyps, and moreouer two other shyppes dyd arryue there after the comyng of Thrasillus, whiche came out of Hellesponte, and sailled fromethence home to their houses, in suche sorte that aswelle wyth the shypps that were at Methym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, as wyth the other, that were come thider, there were to the nomber of, lxvii, which caryed, men, artillery and Engynes, for to take Erese.

But after that the breake of the daye appered, they dyd sone see the shyps of Myndarus.

And that done, hauynge assembled the same day aswell of Abyde as of other places, the nomber of foore skoore and syxe shyps, they dyd comme straight to Eleunte, thynkynge to take it by force, but seynge that there was noo hope therin, they sailled to Abyde. In this meane time the Athenians, thynkyng that the armye by sea, of the ennemyes, coulde not passe, but that they shoulde knowe yt, they were styll bifore Erese, and made there preparations for to assaulte the walle.

                  </gap>e towardes the mayne lande. On the other syde that same of the Peloponesians, perceyuynge the other to come forwardes, departed from Abyde, for to encounter it. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both parties did see, that it was nedefull to fight, they extended themself into the sea, to wytt, the Lacedemonyans, who had, xlviii, shypps, enlarged themself fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Abyde to Dardane, in the ryght poyncte whereof were the Syracusayns, and Myndarus helde the lefte, wherin the lightest shyps were. The Athenyans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended themself towardes Cheronese: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idaque to Archiane, whiche were in al foore skoore and sixtene shyps, in the left poyncte whereof was Thrasyllus, and Thrasybulus in the ryght, and the other capytaynes, euery one in the place, that was appoyncted for hym. So the Peloponesians auaunced theymself to fyghte and furst to geue the assault, to the ende to haue enclosed with their left poyncte, the ryght poynct of the Athenians, if they myght, in suche sorte, that they shulde not haue bene hable to enlarge theymselfe in the sea, and that the other shyppes, whyche were in the myddeste shoulde be constrayned to retyre to the lande, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was not verye farre of. Whereupon the Athenyans, perceyuynge frome the coaste that the ennemyes woulde comme to enclose them, they assaulted theyme lyuely, and hauynge takene their charge of the sea, they saylled and gouernedde their shyppes more galiardly: than the othere. On the otheresyde, their leafte poyncte had bene passed already the rockye place, whyche is called, the sepulchre of the dogge,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcre of the dog.</note> by meane whereof the shyppes, that were in the myddeste of their battaylle, remayned nakedde and disseparated frome those of the two poynctes, somuche in the greater danger, that the ennemyes hadde the more nombere of shypps, and farre better fournysshed wyth men. And moreouer that same rockye place of the sepulchre of the dogge, extendeth alongest into the sea of suche sorte, that those that were wythin the goulphe and retreatte therof, coulde see nothing of that whyche was done wythoute. For thys cause the Peloponesians, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge those same, separated and feobled in suche sorte, came to geue charge vpon theyme and repoulsed theyme vnto the lande, and those same Peloponesians, seynge theymeselfe to haue the vyctorye, a greate nomber of theyme landed for to followe the Athenyans, whyche coulde not be succouredde by their people, to wytte, by those, that were in the ryght poyncte wyth Thrasibulus, for that they were oppressed wyth greater nomber of shyppes, than they had. Nothere wyth those, whyche were in the left poynct wyth Thrasillus, for that, that they coulde not see what those same dyd there, by cause of the rockye place or promontorye that was bitwene both, and moreouer they hadde muche to do for to resiste the shyps of the Syracusains and a greate nomber of other, whyche oppressed them greatly, vntill that the Peloponesians, perceiuing themself to haue the victorye, bigonne to putt themself into disorder for to followe the ennemyes shipps, so as they skattered themself abroade. For Thrasybulus, which perceiued it, wythout more contending to saille with those, that were bifore him: russhed wyth all his ships and with all his strength vpon them, so that he put them to flight. And fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge those, whiche had brokene the myddeste of hys battaylle into disorder, he brought them in such feare, that many of them without tarying did put themself
<pb n="CCxxiii" facs="tcp:18267:226"/>
into flyght. Whiche parceyued, the Siracusains, and the othere that were wyth them, whyche had bene already greatlye oppressed by Thrasillus, dyd lykewyse putt themselfe in flighte: in suche sorte, that all the armye of the Peloponesians fledde straight towardes the ryuer of Pydia, and fromethence towardes Abyde. And albeit that the Athenyans dyd not take a greate nomber of the ennemyes shippes: yet that same vyctorie dyd come very wel to their purpose: for that, that they were bifore tyme in greate feare of the Peloponesians by sea, by cause of ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny losses, whiche they had made in many places wyth them: but aboue all, for the same of Sicille. Wherby, after the victorie, the feare cessed, whiche they had of the said Peloponesyans by sea, and also the murmuration that was amongest their people, by cause of the same. And neuerthelas they dyd take of the enemys ships those, whyche dyd followe eyghte of Chio, fyue of the Corynthians, two of the Ambraciotes and twoo of the Beotians: and of the Leucadians, Lacedemony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Siracusains and Pellyens of euery of them, one: &amp; they loste fyften of theirs. So they receyued after the battaille the shipwrackes and the cariongns. Where of they dyd by appoynctement render to the ennemyes, theirs: and afterwardes, hauynge addressed and reysed their Trophee vpon the rocky place of the sepulcre of the dogge, they dyspesched a brygantyne, by the whyche they aduertysed the Athenyans of that same vyctorie. Through the which newes, the Cytezeins that were in muche greate feare and dyspayre by cause of the greate inconueniences, that were happened vnto them, aswell in Eubea, as in the cytie it self, throughe their seditions: recouered theire spirittes, and dyd greatelye take agayne theire courage, hopynge to be yett hable to haue the vyctorie agaynste their ennemys, if there case were well and diligently conducted. Foore dayes after the same vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, hauinge in thys meane tyme, wyth greate diligence repaired their shippes, whych were brused and crusshed at Seste, they departed fromthence for to saille to recouer the cytie of Cizice,<note place="margin">Sicum.</note> whiche were rebelled frome theym.

And fromthence they sailled to Cizice, and also did take it easely for that, that it had no walles, and they recouered of the burgeoses a good somme of monney. Duringe thys tyme the Peloponesyans departed out frome Abyde, and sailled to Eleunte. Where they dyd take of the shyppes, whyche had bene gaigned and wonne of the ennemyes those thereof, that they founde whole and entier: for they of the towne had burned a greate nomber of them.

On the other syde, Tissaphernes, hauinge vnderstanded, howe the armye by sea of the Peloponesyans was departed from Mylet for to passe into Hellesponce, departed from Aspende for to saille into Ionum. And in the meane tyme that the Peloponesyans were occupyed in the affayres of Hellesponte, the Citezeins of Antandrie (which is a towne of the Eoliens) hauing takene a certen nomber of people in Abyde, caused them by nyght to passe through the mounte

Who, whan they were chased out of the Isle of Delos by the Athenyans, vnder couloure of relygione, they beinge wythdrawin into a towne nyghe vnto Antandria, named Atramyrtum:<note place="margin">Atra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myrtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> that same Arsacus, whiche dyd beare them certen hatred, dissimuled or cloked hys euill wyll, and faigned w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the pryncipalles of them that he wolde vse their saruyce in warre, and geue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wages, and by that meane caused them all to yssue fourth into the feldes. And one day, as they were at dynner caused them to be bisett rounde aboutes by his men and wyth stroakes of dartes to be slayne righte cruellye. For this reasons than and for not beynge of power to supporte the charges that were exacted of them, the Antandryans chased away his men. Wherby Tyssaphernes found him self greatly offended, besyde that, whyche had already bene done by the Pelopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syans at Mylet and at Cnydus: from whence they had lykewise chased hys men. And fearyng leaste it shulde happen worse, and also hauing in great despyte, that Pharnabazus, hauinge wythdrawin them to wages shuld with their ayde, doo wyth lesser charges and in lesser tyme, more in effecte than he could do wyth the Athenyans, he determyned to saille vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into Hellesponte for to complayne to them of the sayde oultrages that had bene done to hym, and also for to excuse and discharge hymself of that, wherewyth men charged hym, specyally tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge the Phenycians shippes. So he toke hys iourney, and beinge arryued at Ephesus,<note place="margin">Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</note> he made hys sacrefice in the temple of Diana.
