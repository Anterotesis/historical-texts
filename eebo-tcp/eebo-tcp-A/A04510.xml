            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

&amp; transitory treasures are

thistles, and rugged heth,
and natheles in digging deaper

fynde we in Lazarus, botches
outwardely, but withinwarde,
substance beyonde estimation, a

<pb facs="tcp:3893:3"/>
spirite, in whom that saieng
of the apostle is fulfilled: <hi>howe
well the vtter man is corrupted,
so well the inner man is renewid.</hi>
And truly I might this day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
wade in the same parable, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futyng
suche heretikes, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
the olde Testament, with
the Patriarches, yea and spare
not to whette theyr tounges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
god the maker of al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
But for I wolde not my
wordes all of one thyng, shulde
to muche glutte you, these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations
refer I to an other
season, and now let vs see, what
we can saye in a newe matter.
Parde ye knowe, that euer one
kynde of meate, soone squaymy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
the stomak, wheras cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge
quickeneth a continual apetite.
<pb facs="tcp:3893:3"/>
To the ende therfore we vse the
like in our sermon, let vs after a
longe space, loke backe agayne
vpon saynt Paule. For as this
present day is red vnto vs very
apoyntedly a place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apostle,
and handesomely agreeth that,
that now we intend to say, with
that we haue afore sayde. Ye
haue herd then Paul declaring,
and sayeng: <hi>Brethren, I wolde
not haue you vnwyttyng what is
become of those that sleape, least
ye-make dole, and mourne, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do that want hope.</hi> That,
of Lazarus, was a strong sinew
of the gospel, and this nowe is
the voice of thapostle, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their tunes accorde. For as
in that parable I treated much
of the resurrection, &amp; of the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemente
<pb facs="tcp:3893:4"/>
to come: so hathe this
text brought me backe now into
the self same argument, because
if we digge out well this place
of the apostle, we shall not misse
of the very same treasure. For
then, my hole oration tendid to
this effect, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hearers might
be taught, how nothing in thys
worlde was to be reputed for
goodly, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rather in our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
we shuld marche on further,
hauynge dayly before our eyes,
the dome of our iudge, howe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doutable
his iudgement is, &amp; of
what sterne grauenes we shuld
fynde him. And doth not Paule
with these wordes counseill vs
the like? But herke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ye. <hi>Of those
that slepe I wolde not haue you
ignorant, to thend ye mourne not</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:4"/>
as other do, who haue no hope:
For and if we beleue that Iesꝰ is
dead &amp; vprise<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so those that in Iesꝰ
do slepe, god shal lead with hym.
But in chiefe, this is worth the
serche to be knowen. why? when
he speketh of Christ, his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out of life he calleth death,
and where he speaketh of oure
deathe, he doth name it a slepe,
and not deathe. For he said nat
of the deade, what then? of those
that slepe, &amp; a litle after, so those
that in Iesus do slepe, nat those
that in Iesus are deade, god shal
lead with him. And then agayn.
We that liue, that are left til the
commynge of Christe, shall nat
preuent them that ar on sleape.
Nat somuch as here said he, that
ar dead, but thrise making men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:3893:5"/>
therof, thrise death he called
a slepe. But nat so of Christ, as
for and if we beleue that Iesus
is dead, he sayde nat is on slepe,
but deade, and wherfore calleth
he it Christꝭ deth, and our slepe?
For nat rashely &amp; at all auentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,
but rather vpon some great
and depe respecte, hathe he vsed
this obseruation of wordes. So
speakyng of Christe, he called it
his deathe, to the ende the same
myght be thought a passion in
him, and as to vs he qualifieth
it with the name of slepe, that
therby he myght comeforte our
sorow. For the cause wherof pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cedeth
the resurrection, boldely
he called death, but where all is
grounded on hope, that nameth
he a slepe, seming with the veray
<pb facs="tcp:3893:5"/>
worde to comforte vs, and geue
vs good hope. Inasmuch as he
that slepith shal ryse againe, and
death is naught els but a longe
slepe. For do nat obiect me with
this, that the deade heare nat,
speake nat, see nat, nor fele nat,
seing that a slepyng man hathe
no parte of all these. But if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates
I must reherce some won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dre,
howe say you to this? That
the soule of hym that sleapeth,
dothe after a maner slepe also, &amp;
the deade do wake. But a dead
man (saiest thou) putrifieth, and
rottith, chaungid into duste and
asshes, what therof my freind?
that makith the more for vs.
For incase a la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dlord, purposing
to reedifie an olde and ruinous
house, shuld (as he must) fyrst of
<pb facs="tcp:3893:6"/>
all transport the tenauntes some
where els, then plucke down the
olde buyldyng, raysyng it more
stately the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer it was, this dede
(trowe I) in nothing offendith
the tenauntes, but muche more
cheareth them, bycause they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
nat somuch the present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing,
as with theyr mynd they
comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the plat of the house
that shalbe, but nat as yet, to be
vewed at eye: Euyn so doth god
after lyke rate dissolue our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes,
deductyng our soules the
tenauntes as out of an house, to
thend the same beyng ones new
repayred, he may with greatter
glory repossesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> again therin.
Lette vs nat therfore somuche
counte vpon this present, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
defasyng, as on the gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes
<pb facs="tcp:3893:6"/>
that our house shalbe of.
For admitte one hadde a copper
ymage fordone with longe age
and rustynes, parde he breaketh
it, and in the fornace newe mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith
it, to make it semelier then
euer it was. And as that dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
in the fornace, is nat thut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
distruction of thimage, but
rather a renewyng to the same:
So is the dissolution of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
nat an vndoing, but rather
a new refresshing. When thou
seest therfore this fleshe of ours,
as in a fornace melting and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifieng,
stay nat thy selfe at that
sight, but rather haue an eye to
the mouldwerkes proporcion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Neither suffice thy self herwith,
but wade on yet further. Inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
as an ymage <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

he castith a bodie of brasse, he
doth nat new make it of gold, or
euerlastyng, but brase<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as before
it was. Wheras god on thother
side casting this our mortal and
earthly bodie, restorith it golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and immortall. For the earthe
that receiuith our bodies fraile,
and vnpure, rendrith the same a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gayn
immortal, and right pure.
Why shuld we then somuch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
on the corps lieng speche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
and with eies closed, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it riseth againe, partaker of the
glorie passing mans vttrance, to
be astonnied, and wondred at?
For thus must we from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng to that hope that
is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng. Yet some wyll saye,
they longe, and desyre, after the

deades felowshyp, and therfore
mourne, and lament they. But
what is that to purpose? For &amp; if

but the great excesse therof
wold I take from the. Inasmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
as to mourne it is a kyndely
thyng for vs, beyng men, but to
doo the same outrageously, is a
veray madnes, a signe of doting
and an womannishe tendrenes.
I admit therfore thou wayle, I
admit thou weape, but nat that
thou do stomake at it, or beare it
heauily, nay rather geue thanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
vnto god the taker, that so,
thou maiste worshipefully sette
furthe thy frende, goyng out of
this life, and yeld vnto him these
honest funerals. For and if thou
takest it greuousely, thou bothe
violatest the dead, ꝓuokest god
the taker, yea and hindrest thine
own selfe. But in geuing than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb facs="tcp:3893:8"/>
therfore, so hast thou set him
furthe, glorified the taker, and
done thy self a great good turne.
Weape therfore: but as the lord
did for Lazarus, who therby pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>scribed
vnto vs the rule, ordre,
and verie termes of bewailing,
whiche in no case we must passe.
And so sayeth Paule. <hi>Of those
that slepe I wolde nat haue you
ignorant, least ye shulde bewayle,
as others do that wante hope.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bewayle sayeth he: but nat as
the Grekes do, who denie the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
whoo despayre of the
lyfe to come. I am ashamed I
promes you, and nat meanely I
am troubled in my sprite, when
I see in the <unclear>mercatestede</unclear>  theise
flockes of women without sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me,
pluckinge theyr <unclear>heares; sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing</unclear>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:9"/>
their armes, scraching their
chekis, yea and doyng al this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Grekes eies. What wil
nat they say? what will nat they
blaste of vs? Theise be they that
so constantly affirme there shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be
a resurrection of the deade:
gaye wordes: but theyr deedes
drawe nat after that lyne, with
their wordes they maintayn the
resurrection, but theyr doinges
smelle of the desperate. If they
firmely trusted on the resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
they wolde nat do thus, if
they were perswaded, the deade
went to a better state, they wold
nat make this dole. These taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and worse then these, do the
vnfaithfull cast on vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they
heare vs crye out so. Let vs be
ashamed therfore, and vse more
<pb facs="tcp:3893:9"/>
modestie, nor sclander we not so
muche therby, bothe our selues,
and those that loke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs. For
I pray the tell me? why beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
thou so sore the passer out of
this lyfe? Because he was an yll
man? In that poynt (me thinkꝭ)
thou oughtest to rendre thanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
that all iniquitie is nowe
lopped from him. But put case
he was good and vertuous, so
muche the more then shuldest
thou reioise, at his taking away
before any wyckednes had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted
his good thoughtes, and
that he is remoued to that place
where for euer he shall floryshe,
without so much as neuer so li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
suspition of any tourne in
thinges. But he was a yonge
man, glorifie thou god therfore,
<pb facs="tcp:3893:10"/>
that toke him, and so sone hathe
called hym to a better state.
Then set case he was olde: and
for that also yeld thou thankes,
in glorifieng god his caller.</p>
            <p>Be ashamed therefore of thy
dolemakynge: sithens that the
pompe of burieng, psalmes sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng,
prayers, assemble of hed
citisens, gatheringe togither of
the brethern, al these thinges ar
ordeined, nat that thou shuldest
lament, or be repynyng, but to
thend thou geue thankes to god
the taker. For like as euery man
contendith to set fourth &amp; speke
well by suche, as are called to
some great office or dignitie, so
of the sainctes that deceas, (as
who sayeth) called to a greater
promotion, we all shuld speake
<pb facs="tcp:3893:10"/>
honorably, sithens that deathe
is restfulnes, the dispache of all
thoughtꝭ and cares perteinyng
to this lyfe. When thou seest
therfore any of thy nere frendes
shaking ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des with this world,
do not take it grudgingly, but
rather when the sorowe stingith
the, call thy wittes togither, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thyne owne conscience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidre
how within short space af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same end abideth the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.
Attempre thy selfe, and by
the others death take warning.
Cutte away all differring of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement,
call thy dedis to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt,
and make the best chang
thou canst. The Ethnike and
vnfaythfull beholdeth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyn,
&amp; worshippith the heauyn,
takynge the same for god. He
<pb facs="tcp:3893:11"/>
seeth the earth and worshippeth
it, &amp; gapith after thingꝭ mortal.
But we on thother part behold
the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and prayse the maker
of the heauen, inasmuche as we
take the same nat as god, but for
the worke of god. I see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke
of this whole world, wherby as
by the hande I am led vnto the
creatour therof. The vnfaithful
seeth ryches, &amp; fixeth his mynde
theron, &amp; is rauished therwith:
I like wise see riches, and dispise
it. He feelith pouerty, and why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
therat: I fele the lyke, and
reioyce therat. For otherwise be
hold I thinges the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth. And
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so on death. He seith a corps,
and taketh it for a corps: I see a
corps, and repute this parte of
death none other but for a slepe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:11"/>And as in writyng it comes to
passe, that where as with eies,
aswell the conninge, as vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
do pore on the letters, Yet
nat for that with lyke vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
For thunconning do
take those for bare letters only
whyche they loke on, whereas
the conning with great subtilty
pyke oute the meanynge vnder
hidden: So in the thinges self,
with the selfe same eies beholde
we all, on mortall thynges, but
nat with the lyke vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
Shal we therfore in this
opinion of death agre with the
Ethnikes? we (I saye) who in
all other thynges do disagree
from them? Thinke we ones, to
whom the deade is <unclear>goone</unclear>, and
receiue we consolation, king he
<pb facs="tcp:3893:12"/>
is with Petre, Paule, and the
hole company of sainctes.</p>
            <p>Thinke, how he shal rise again,
and that with farre more glory,
and reputation. Thinke, howe
that to mourne, and lament, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
els thy teares, may naught
auayle the, but in fine make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
to thine owne disaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Thinke, if thou doest
thus, whose example thou folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wist,
and in any waies eschonne
the company of synne. For here
in, whome folowiste thou? or
whom doest thou countrefaite?
but the infidels, and those that
haue no hope? Lyke as Paule
saieth: lest ye mourne as the reste
do, that haue no hope. And mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
ye well, how warely the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speaketh: for he said nat ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe
<pb facs="tcp:3893:12"/>
of the resurrection, but plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
those that haue no hope. For
who so loketh nat after the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
day, hath no maner ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,
nat onely of gods forsight in
thinges, but nat so muche as of
gods ryght wisenes, accordyng
as he ouerue with all the same.
He that hathe no syght in this,
nor iugith nat this is so, is bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then any beaste, and puttith
all lawes, iudgementes, good
constitucions, and for shorte, al
goodnes out of his own mind.
For who so loketh nat to rendre
any counte of his doynges, sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from all vertue, and cleuith
to all naughtynes.</p>
            <p>We then considering all this,
and countinge the Grekes cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
whiche we folowe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
<pb facs="tcp:3893:13"/>
dole, to be a very madnes
&amp; amasing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind. Eschonne
we (I say) this vsage with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
For to none other intent dothe
Paul so often make mention of
them, but that reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring what
disworship we incurre therby,
we shulde refraine customynge
with them, and rather make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne
to our owne noblesse.</p>
            <p>And that nat here onely, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and continually doth Paul
so. For when he wold haue vs
leaue our synnes, then makith
he demonstration, what maner
men through our synnes we are
coupled with, to thend we shuld
mislike, and be offendid with the
maners of the person, &amp; shon his
company. Further writing to
the <unclear>Thessalonie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</unclear>, thus saith he:
<pb facs="tcp:3893:13"/>
Let eche of you possesse his owne
bodie in all holines and honour,
nat in susteining of disworship, as
the Gentiles, who know nat god.
And agayn, nat as thother Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
who walke in the vanitie of
theyr hertes. So also in this
place. Brethern, I wold nat haue
you ignorant what is become of
them that slepe, lest ye mourne as
others do who want hope. For
nat the nature of the thyng, but
the purpose of our mynde, nat
the death of the passer hence, but
the weake sprite of the bewailer
is that, that troublith vs. For
as for the beleuing man, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
displeasures can <unclear>displease</unclear>
him, but rather <unclear>before that</unclear> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

               <pb facs="tcp:3893:14"/>
oddes betwix him and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithefull.
No small vantage
then receiue we through christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
religion, onles we repute nat
continuall quietnes of mynde,
and euer a lyke gladnes, to be
the greatest fruite we may here
gather. Therfore saieth Paule.
Ioy ye euer in the lord, agayn (I
say) reioyce ye. For asmuche as
before the resurrection daye, we
ar priuileged in the mean space,
in that we fall nat into theise
dayly troubles of our lyfe, but
rather through hope of the lyfe
to come, euyn here receyue we
great comfort, and consolation.
Moreouer as we make game
on bothe sydes, so on both sides
is the <unclear>vnfaithfull at</unclear> after deale,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               <unclear>throughthe</unclear> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:3893:14"/>
remaynyng hym for nat
trusting in the resurrection, the
other, because euery small mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happe
here, discouragith hym,
whoo looketh after noo maner
wealth in that other worlde to
come. And therfore nat only
for the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sake, ought
god to be thanked, but also for
that hope of the resurrection,
hable to comforte our soules in
perplexitie, and encourage vs
aswell in other thinges, as it
dothe in this, that we shall rise
agayne, and be with god. For
and if we nedes must lament,
and mourne: those that lyue in
syn, nat those that deceas with
vertue, shulde we <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
weape for. And  so did <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
For writing to the Cori<gap reason="illegible" extent="7 letters">

               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:15"/>
thus saieth he. Least at my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
to you, god humble me soo
much, that I must be faine to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
many of you, nat as deade,
but that haue synned, and repent
nat of the excesse and vnclennes
they haue committed. Bewayle
the dead, for he wantith his sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
bewaile a foole, for he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith
wyt. Meanly bewayle the
deade, for he is but at rest, but a
foles life is worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his death.
That and if algates we must be
mone hym that is depriued of
life, then muche more him, that
is voide of ryghtwisenes, and
hath missed of this gifte of hope
sent to vs from aboue.</p>
            <p>Suche men therfore let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone,
for this mourning we do
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <unclear>inasmuche</unclear> as in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
<pb facs="tcp:3893:15"/>
them, ofte times we do
refourme theim. Where as to
bemone the deade is bothe fond,
and improfitable. And so let vs
nat abrogat this custom of dole
makyng, but then let our dole
be for synnes sake onely. For
afore pouerty, sikenes, vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
death, begylyng, or slaunder,
all these with like disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities
appertaining to vs we ought to
bear out with a right good hart,
because these euilles, incase we
be patient, maye be occasion of a
greter croune &amp; glory. But how
may it be (saiest thou) that a man
mourne not? To this I are the
contrary. Howe may it be, that
a man endewed with reason <unclear>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation</unclear>
&amp; hope  of thinges
to come, shulde m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:16"/>
But who is he (saiest thou) that
in this confusion, and chaunge
of thynges, may nat somewhat
be moued? Many (I say) both in
ours, and in our elders dayes.</p>
            <p>For Iob, when the hole nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre
of his children perished, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ye what he sayeth. God
gaue me them, God hath bereuid
me them, as pleaseth god, so is it
done. These wordes armeruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to be rehersed onely, but if
thou serchest them narolier, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wilt thou more meruayle. For
thus muste thou make thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse:
How the dyuel his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutour
toke awaye nat haulfe
his chyldren, and lefte the other
haulfe, nother that he toke the
more numbre, &amp; spared the lesse,
but that he <unclear>sweped</unclear> away al the
<pb facs="tcp:3893:16"/>
fruite, and yet the tree he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
nat, he raysed all the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the sea, and yet the shyp
he drowned nat, he gaue the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
to the vttremoste, and yet
the strong towre wanne he nat.
So Iob abode all his bruntes,
and remained in one vnstyrred.
Many dartes were launced at
him, whiche he shruncke nat for:
nay rather they were launced, &amp;
he was nat wounded. Imagine
we (I pray you) what a thynge
it was for Iob, to see so many of
his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al at ones perishing.
Yea, and trowe ye nat, it was a
sufficient corrosiue to his herte,
to haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all taken from him?
al (I say) togither, at one tyme,
in one day, of like floure of age,
of muche hope and <unclear>towardness</unclear>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:17"/>
in suche sort to finishe their yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris?
after so many wrekes, and
scourges, this laste to make vp
his mouthe? specially he beyng
so louing a father, and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
suche as deserued no lesse?
For wher as one leseth by death
his vnthrifty children, well may
it cause him to regrete a litle, nat
that the anguishe so hotely scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith
him, chiefly because the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiousenes
of such as deceas,
may well be in cause, why that
sorowe settithe nat her tethe so
sharpely in vs. But if theyr
goodnes he commendable, then
thrilleth the that deape wounde
with continuall remembraunce,
and the incurable euyll breadeth
two maner thornes in thy hert.
That one is the remorse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:3893:17"/>
and kynde, whiche we that
liue haue, the other is the vertue
the deceased persone was of.</p>
            <p>Then, that Iobs chyldren were
of much towardnes, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
by this, in that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
toke much care about their
bringing vp, and made ofte sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
for them, hauing doubte
at leaste vpon their hidden sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
For nothinge was dearer
to him, neither more tendid on,
then his childrens bryngynge
vp, an euidente argument nat
onely of their good demeanour,
but also of his fatherly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>Inasmuche therfore as Iob
was a father, yea and so tendre
a father, as nat onely expressed
his naturall loue, but also the
feare he toke for them, besydes
<pb facs="tcp:3893:18"/>
that they that died, were of such
an aproued honesty, trebly were
those panges of sorowes leuelid
at him. Whiche in case they had
ben put to one by one, so might
the pecemealeshype haue geuin
place to som maner co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>solation,
as when the presence of the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viuours,
couerith the sorowe
conceiued for the deade. But
where as the hole flocke decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
whome canne he susteyne to
loke vpon? that before was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to so many children, and
nowe hath nat so muche as one
left him. And here now I might
bring in his fifte sworde of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,
in that they all at ones so
sodainely were bereuid of their
life. For and if their death had
vetid within space of .iiii. or .v.
<pb facs="tcp:3893:18"/>
daies, so might his wifes, and at
his neighbours haue borne him
feleship in lamenting with him,
that in so short space, and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lokid
for, so goodly a meiny was
quite fordone. But muche more
cause of sorowe had Iob, who
nat in thre, in two, or in one day,
but in a moment was euenly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of them al. For a mishap
long loked for, albeit it touchith
a man to the quicke, Yet for
that the euill co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming is forseen,
it is wont to be more tollerable.
but when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same chancith bothe
at ones, and at vnwares, then is
it intollerable. When so euer
then a thynge is greuous of it
selfe, and therto doth opresse one
beyonde his expectation, that is
surely a greate enforcement of
<pb facs="tcp:3893:19"/>
his sorowe. Nowe therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
with thy selfe howe intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
Iobs sorowe was, and
how it passed the common grief
felte in like passions. But wilt
thou hear now the sixte throwe
of Iob? he lost al his children in
the floure of theyr youthe, and
pardie ye wote howe sore mens
deathes afore their time of ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
are wont not onely to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
theyr frendes, but also in
sundry meanes to trouble them.
then this of Iobs children was
nat onely an vnripe death, but
therto, a violent deathe, whiche
violentnes may be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his
seuenth calamitie for he sawe
them nat yeldyng their gostes
and laste breathes in their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
but they were al oppressed
<pb facs="tcp:3893:19"/>
with the ruine of the house wher
they banketted. Nowe put case
some one as he digged amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
those ruines, shuld plucke
out now a stone, &amp; then a limme
of some one of them, perchaunce
one hande holdynge the cuppe,
on other in the platter, with all
the shape of the bodye quashed
asu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, the nose frushed downe,
the head crased, the eyes quisted
oute, the braine dispercled, and
the hole proportion of the body
with the diuersnes of the bruses
so disfygured, that the poore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
myghte vnnethes discerne
the desyred sight of one of his
children from an other. At the
rehersall onely of this tragedie,
yeare moued to compassion and
teares. What thincke you then
<pb facs="tcp:3893:20"/>
by him that sawe this gere? For
seing we now so long time sins,
can not so muche as heare with
out teares, so miserable a chance
as this was, yea, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ꝑtaining vnto vs: What
maner a man, and of how stony
an hert was Iob, (trow ye) who
seyng all this with his eyes, nat
in an other mans aduersitie, but
in his owne, coulde so refraine,
and mortifie his courage? For
he neither repined therat, no nat
somuche as ones openid he his
mouth in grudge. As what mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nith
this? is this the recompe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
of my mekenes? to this therfore
hath my house stood open to all
straunge gestes, that I shuld se
the graue of my children? haue
I therfore vpon those extendid
<pb facs="tcp:3893:20"/>
all gentilnes, that these shulde
suffre this death?</p>
            <p>None of all these muttringis
vttred he, no nat somuche as
ones thought them, but after a
longe debatynge with him selfe
toke he all in good wourth. For
like as a cunnyng founder, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he castith an image of gold, doth
proportion and make fete the
moulde with all diligence, soo
he with proportioninge and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
brought his courage to a
good poynte. And as a painful
husbandman, watrith, byndith,
and hedgith in, the graffes of
palme and Oliuertrees, likewise
Iob ceased nat with all his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
to bring vp eche of their sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
as a fruiteful Olyue tree, to
a greater encreace of vertue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:21"/>And hauyng all done, when the
storminge of the wicked sprite,
had disturbed, and beaten them
to the ground, with a miserable
ende of theyr liues lotted vnto
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet vsed he no kinde of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie,
but thanking god of al,
gaue so the dyuell a clap at the
auauntage. But now if thou
wilt say, that his sorowe for losse
of many chyldren, is nat to be
compared to his, that had, and
lost his onely childe, thou spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kist
well, and I wyl wel so be it.
For nat euen, but muche greater
was Iobs sorowe. For who can
gesse the benefite risinge to the
father of many chyldren? and
perconsequent, the wound recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in many bodies, must nedes
engender a more manifest cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite,
<pb facs="tcp:3893:21"/>
and sharper heuynes. But
now, if thou desyrest an example
of him, who hauing but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne, shewed neuertheles as
great as Iob, or rather greater
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance. Then loke thou on the
Patriarch Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who in dede
sawe nat his so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Isaac die, but
was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded (whiche thyng
was far more piteous, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable)
was commaunded I saye
with his owne handes to kylle
him, &amp; yet this bidding he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stode
nat, neither toke it heuily,
nor vsed none of al these wordis.
To this the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hast thou made me
a father, that I shulde be myne
owne childes queller? better had
it ben nat to haue geuen him vn
to me, then in this wise to rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
him. But if thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
<pb facs="tcp:3893:22"/>
haue him, to what purpose
I besech the wilt thou haue him
slayne of me, and my hand to be
his bludsheder? was it nat thy
promes, howe in this boye my
sede shulde store all the worlde?
and what frute geuest thou me,
when thou pluckest vp the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?
how assurest me thou of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phieus,
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandest my one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne to be slayne? who euer
sawe the like, who dyd the lyke?
I am begiled, I am betrayed.
Abraham truly againsaide nat
gods commandement, nor stode
nat in termes of why, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
with him, but when he had
ones herde. Take thy dere and
welbeloued so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Isaac, &amp; make
of him sacrifice to me, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suche
an hille as I shall apointe the,
<pb facs="tcp:3893:22"/>
with as good a will he wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute
it, as if more had ben com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded
him, he wold haue done
his vttermost, for he both kepte
this secrete from his wyfe, and
from his seruantes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding
them to tarye at the foote of the
hille, and taking with him only
Isaac for his oblation went vp,
nat with a faynt hert, but glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
aboute the execution of
gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement. Thinke
therfore howe harde a case this
was, when no man beyng by, he
did question (perchaunce) with
his sonne aparte, whiche might
make his hert the rather fown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre
into pitie, and a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
heate of loue, nat in one or
two daies, but in many daies to
be quickenid in him, inasmuche
<pb facs="tcp:3893:23"/>
as to haue dispached gods byd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
out of hande, was sure a
very great and hard enterprise,
but nat of suche maistrye, as by
respite of so many daies to haue
his minde temptid, specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
beseagid with soo greate a
loue, as he bare towardꝭ Isaac.
For therfore dyd god apoynte
him a place of further distance,
where he shuld do his oblation,
to the end the w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estlers styfnes
might be the better assaied. And
in dede a stiffe wrastler was A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
with no man, but with
the very lawe of nature. For
what eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is liuely inough
to set afore our eyes his stoute
hert? He led away his sonne, he
bounde him, laide him on the
heape of wod, drewe his sword,
<pb facs="tcp:3893:23"/>
was ready to strike him. I can
nat tell I, howe, nor by what
meanes to describe all this.</p>
            <p>He only knew it, who toke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
hym to do it. For no paynted
wordes maye sufficientely sette
oute colours in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>For howe was nat his hande
astonied? How did nat the force
of his synewes weaken? Howe
could nat the desirable presence
of his dere childe, edge him to
compassion? And then agayne,
that, that Isaac dyd, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus
was it? For as Abraham
obeyed god: so obeied he his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp; as when god bad Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
slea him, he axed nat after
the cause wherfore: lykewise I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac,
his father constrayninge
him, and offringe him vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:3893:24"/>
aultar, enquired nat of him why
he did it, but was subiect to his
will and pleasure. Here nowe
may we see the father, a sacrifice
of his sonne, &amp; a sacrifice yelden
vp withoute bloudshedynge, a
burnt offring withoute fyre, for
a figure of the death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
He slewe his sonne and
nat slew his sonne, nat with his
hand, but with his intention he
slewe him. And god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded
thus muche, nat for effusion of
blouddes sake, but to manifest
vnto vs the obedience of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
and that hys promptenes
mighte ouer all be notyfyed, to
our teachynge and instruction.
Howe that gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes
ought to be preferred nat onely
before our children, the lawe of
<pb facs="tcp:3893:24"/>
nature, &amp; briefly all other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
but euin our very owne ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
And therfore came he down
to let Abrahams hande, hauing
Isaac as a liuing witnes of this
acte. What forgyuenes then
shalt thou obtayne? or what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
can thou bring? seing such
a man as Abraham was, with
so good an hart to haue bowed
him selfe, and in all poyntes to
haue geuin place to god, and
thou in this small case wilt nat
take it well, but stubbernly?</p>
            <p>For neyther alleage thou thy
mourning, nor yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gretnes of
thy calamitie, but rather thinke
howe Abraham was stronger,
then so excedyng great, and far
passynge a sorowe. For it was
inough, that gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb facs="tcp:3893:25"/>
had some thing troubled,
and cast his mind into perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
togither with this, that god
had assayed his faythe in other
proofes aforetimes. Fo. who,
excepte Abraham selfe wold nat
haue reputed gods promis, as
touchynge the multitude of his
generation, &amp; nephieus, to haue
ben but disceite, and trompery?
And yet this natwithstanding,
we ought to haue Iobs pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and his wonderfull mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in greate price, namely
his ouerturne, and fall, beinge
so piteous as it was, in that a
man of that excellente vertue,
after so many almes dedes, and
so great hospitalitie kept, when
he neither had prouoked gods
wrath vpon him self, nor on his
<pb facs="tcp:3893:25"/>
children, shuld with his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
so miserable a misfortune,
so strange, and so vnloked for,
yea and suche as in longe tyme
falleth nat vpon the wickedest
men that be. Nor for all this
did he nat, as commonly men
wont to do, neither iudged ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
vnauaylable, ne yet reputed
his former life well led, to haue
ben spent in vain. Eche of these
therfore, we muste nat prayse
onely, but folowe also, and do
after their vertue. But some
will saye, naye: they were men
that passed. Ye truely: they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and were meruaylous men.
Natheles at our handes is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a greatter religion, then
at theirs was, whoo folowid
but the olde fourme of lyuinge
<pb facs="tcp:3893:26"/>
onely. For vnles your iustice be
farre more habundant, then that
of the Scribes, and Pharises, ye
shall nat entre into the kyngdome
of heauen.</p>
            <p>Therfore in any wise vse we
moderation, and callyng to our
mynde, these, and those thinges,
whiche of the generall resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
&amp; of these holy men haue
been repetid, let vs euer caulme
our mindes, nat only whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cause
of mournyng is obiectid vnto
vs, but also when wear fre from
any maner sorowe. For to the
same purpose I at this present,
what tyme none (as I thinke) is
in sorowe, haue yet grounded
my theme therupon, that when
we haue iuste cause of doole, yet
being armed with remembrance
<pb facs="tcp:3893:26"/>
herof, we may receyue comefort
accordingly. That like as soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
in tyme of peace, do pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
feates of warre, that when
warre is ones proclaymed, and
the tyme requireth expertnes,
they maye then at neade shewe
furthe their conning, learned in
tyme of reste. So likewise, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
we both our weapons, and
medecines, all beyng yet quiet,
that if at any tyme these greate
troubles, miseries, or sorowes
do assault vs. We on the other
side being wel armed, &amp; strongly
defensed, agaynst all the dyuels
bruntes, may with muche mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strie
repulse them backe, &amp; sheld
our selfes, with godꝭ word, right
reason, and example takyng at
the good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3893:27"/>For in so doyng, we may lede
this lyfe in muche tranquillitie
of mynde, and afterwardes be
partners of heauins kingdome,
with <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> vnto
whom with the father, and the
holy goost, be all honour
and imperie, worlde
without ende.</p>
