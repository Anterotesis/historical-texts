            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>His Majesties Most Gracious SPEECH To His Two HOUSES of PARLIAMENT, On Monday the Nineteenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1662.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords, and you Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Think there have been very few Sessions of Parliament, in which there have been so many Bills, as I have Passed this day: I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, never so many Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bills, which I hope you will not draw into example. It is true, these late ill times have driven men into great
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95958:3"/>
streights, and may have obliged them to make Conveyances colourably, to avoid inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and yet not afterwards to be avoided; and men have gotten estates by new and greater Frauds then have been heretofore practised; and therefore in this Conjuncture, extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Remedies may be necessary, which hath induced Me to comply with your Advice, in Passing these Bills; but I pray let this be very rarely done hereafter: The good old Rules of the Law are the best security; and let not men have too much cause to fear, that the Settlements they make of their Estates, shall be too easily unsettled when they are dead by the Power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have so much obliged Me, not onely in the Matter of those Bills which concern My Revenue, but in the manner of Passing them, with so great affection and kindness to Me, that I know not how to thank you enough. I do assure you, and I pray assure your friends in the Countrey, that I will apply all you have given Me, to the utmost improvement of the peace and happiness of the Kingdom, and will, with the best Advice and good Husbandry I can, bring My expences within a narrower compass. Now I am speaking to you of My Own good Husbandry, I must tell you, that will not be enough; I cannot but observe to you, That the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95958:3"/>
whole Nation seems to Me a little corrupted in their excess of living. Sure all men spend much more in their Clothes, in their Diet, in all their Expences, then they have used to do. I hope it hath onely been the excess of joy, after so long sufferings, that hath transported us to these other Excesses; but let us take heed that the continuance of them doth not indeed corrupt our natures. I do believe I have been faulty that way My Self; I promise you, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and if you will joyn with Me in your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral capacities, we shall by our examples do more good, both in City and Countrey, then any new Laws would do. I tell you again, I will do My part, and I will tell some of you, if you do not do yours. I hope the Laws I have Passed this day will produce some Reformation with reference to the multitude of Beggars and poor people which infest the Kingdom; great severity must be used to those who love idleness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to work, and great care and charity towards those who are willing to work. I do very hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend the execution of those good Laws to your utmost diligence, and I am sure I need not put you in minde so to settle the <hi>Militia,</hi> that all Seditious Insurrections may not onely be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to which the mindes of too many are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, but that the people may be without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable apprehension of such insecurity. You will easily believe, that it is very necessary for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95958:4"/>
the Publick Iustice of the Kingdom, and even for the preservation of the reverence due to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, that I make this a Session; and it will be worthy of your Wisdoms when you come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again, to provide that there be not so great clamour against the multitude of Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>I will say no more, but renew My hearty Thanks to you all, and refer the rest to the Chancellor.</p>

            <head>THE LORD CHANCELLORS SPEECH.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now little more then a year that the King first called you to attend Him here, at the opening of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; then you may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber He told you, That he thought there were not many of you, who were not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly known to Him; That there were very few of whom He had not heard so much good, that he was (He said) as sure as He could be of any thing that was to come, that you would all concur with Him, and that He should concur with you in all things, which might advance the Peace, Plenty, and Prosperity of the Nation. His Majesty said he should be exceedingly deceived else.</p>
            <p>It was a Princely Declaration, and a rare confidence, which could flow from no other fountain, but the sincerity and purity of His own Conscience, which admitting no other designs or thoughts into His
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95958:5"/>
Royal Breast, but such as must tend to the unquestionable Prosperity and Greatness of His People, could not but be assured of your full concurrence and co-operation with Him. It was a happy and a blessed Omen, which at the instant struck a terrour into the hearts of those, who promised themselves some advantages from the differences and divisions in your Councels, and hoped from thence to create new troubles and molestations in the Kingdom; and, God be thanked, the King hath been so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceedingly deceived, that he doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge He hath been exceedingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, exceedingly gratified in all He hath desired, and He hopes He hath not in the least degree disappointed your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen of the House of Commons,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have, like the richest and the noblest Soil, a Soil manured and enriched by the bountiful hearts of the best Subjects in the world, yielded the King two full Harvests in one year; and therefore it is but good husbandry to lie fallow for some time: You have not only supplied the Crown to a good degree for discharging many Debts and Pressures, under which it even groaned, and enabled it to struggle with the present
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95958:5"/>
streights and necessities, debts not contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and necessities not run into by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and excess; you may, when you please, receive such an accompt, as will clear all such reproaches; but you have wisely, very wisely provided such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant growing Revenue, as may with Gods blessing preserve the Crown from those scandalous wants and necessities, as have heretofore exposed it and the Kingdom to those dismal miseries, from which they are but even now buoyed up; for whatsoever other humane causes may be assigned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the several fancies and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men, of our late miserable distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they cannot be so reasonably imputed to any one cause, as to the extream poverty of the Crown: The want of Power could never have appeared, if it had not been for the want of Money.</p>
            <p>You have, my Lords and Gentlemen, worthily provided for the vindication and manifestation of the one by the Bill of the <hi>Militia,</hi> and for the supply of the other by the Act for the Additional Revenue; and I am confident, both the present and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages will bless God, and celebrate your Memories for those two Bills, as the foundation of their peace, quiet and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, how froward and indisposed soever
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95958:6"/>
many are at present, who f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nding such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions laid in their way to Mutiny and Sedition, use all the artifice they can to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the People, that you have not been sollicitous enough for their Liberty, nor te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious enough for their profit, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly labour to lessen that reverence towards you, which sure was never more due to any Parliament.</p>
            <p>It was a very natural and an ingenious animadversion and reflection, which the late incomparable Lord Viscount of St. <hi>Albans</hi> made upon that old Fable of the Giants, who were first overthrown in the War against the Gods, when the Earth, their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in revenge thereof, brought forth <hi>Fame</hi>; which he said, is the same, when Princes and Monarchs have suppressed actual and open Rebellion, then the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the People, the Mother of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, doth bring forth Libels, Slanders, and Taxation of the State, which, he saies, is of the same kinde with Rebellion, but more feminine. And without doubt this Seditious Daughter of the Earth, this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Libelling, was never more pregnant then it is now; nor King, nor Parliament, nor Church, nor State, ever more exposed to those <hi>Flagella linguae,</hi> those strokes of the tongue, from which God Almighty can
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95958:6"/>
only preserve the most innocent and most excellent persons; as if repining and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring were the peculiar exercise of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to keep it in health; as if <hi>England</hi> had so much of the Merchant, <hi>Nunquam habendi fructu foelix, semper autem quaerendi cupidita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te miserrima.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are in no degree disposed to imitate, or remember the general excellent temper of the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the blessed condescention and resignation of the people then to the Crown, the awful reverence they then had to the Government, and to the Governours, both in Church and State. This good and happy spirit was in a time beyond our memory, but they remember; as if it were but yesterday, how few Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Parliaments then gave to that Queen, how small supplies the Crown then had from the people, and wonder that the same measures should not still fill the Coffers, and give the same reputation, and make the same noise in Christendom.</p>
            <p>But (my Lords and Gentlemen) how bold soever some unquiet spirits are with you, upon this Argument, you are much superiour to those reproaches. You know well, and you can make others know, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking the Act of Indempnity, how the Crown hath been since used, how our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95958:7"/>
Soveraign Lord the King found it at His blessed Return to it; you can tell the World, that as soon as He came hither, besides the infinite that He forgave, He gave more, more Money to the people, then He hath since received from them; That at least two parts of three, that they have since gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Him, have issued for the disbanding Armies never raised by Him, and for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fleets never sent out by Him, and of Debts never incurred by Him. You will put them in mind of the vast disparity between the former times, and these in which we live, and consequently of the dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the expence the Crown is now at, for the protection and benefit of the Subject, to what it formerly under-went. How great a difference there is in the present greatness and power of the two Crowns, and what they were then possessed of, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident to all men; and if the greatness and power of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> be not in some proportion improved too, it may be liable to inconveniencies it will not undergo alone. How our Neighbours and our Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, who court one and the same Mistress, Trade and Commerce, with all the World, are advanced in Shipping, Power, and an immoderate Desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gross the whole Traffick of the Universe, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95958:7"/>
notorious enough; and this unruly appetite will not be restrained, or disappointed, nor the Trade of this Nation supported and maintained, with the same Fleets and Forces which were maintained in the happy times of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Not to speak of the Naval power of the <hi>Turks,</hi> who in stead of sculk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad in poor single Ships as they were wont to do, domineer now on the Ocean in strong Fleets, make Naval Fights, and have brought some Christians to a better Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence, and another kind of Commerce and Traffique with them, then was expected, insomuch as they apprehend no Enemy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, but what they find in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Ships, which hath indeed brought no small damage upon them, with no small charge to the King, but a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> You may with a very good Conscience assure your selves, and your friends and neighbours, that the Charge the Crown is now at by Sea and Land, for the Peace and Security, and Wealth and Honour of the Nation, amounts to no less then Eight hundred thousand pounds a year; all which did not cost the Crown before these troubles, Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score thousand pounds the year; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will never blame you for any Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95958:8"/>
you have given, or Addition you have made to the Revenue of the Crown; and whosoever unskilfully murmures at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the other new Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, which ought to be looked upon as Jewels of an immense magnitude in the Royal Diadem, do not enough remember what we have lost by <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and should always do, if it were in an Enemies hands; nor duely consider the vast advantages those other Dominions are like, by Gods blessing, in a short time, to bring to the Trade, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, Wealth and Honour of the King and Kingdom. His Majesty hath enough expressed His desire to live in a perfect Peace and Amity with all His Neighbours; nor is it an ill ingredient towards the firmness and stability of that Peace and Amity, which His Royal Ancestors have held and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with them, that He hath some advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in case of a War, which they were without.</p>
            <p>It was a right ground of confidence, such an one as seldom deceives men, that the great Law-maker, the wise <hi>Solon,</hi> had, when he concluded, that Reverence and Obedience would be yielded to his Laws, because he had taken the pains to make his Citizens know, and understand, that it was more for their profit to obey Law and Justice,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95958:8"/>
then to contemn and break it. The extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant times of Licence, which I hope we have almost out-lived, have so far corrupted the mindes, and even the nature of too many, that they do not return with that alacrity they ought to do, into the Road and Paths of Order and Government, from which they have so long been led astray; nor, it may be, is there pains enough taken, to make them understand the profit, benefit, and ease, which alwaies attends a cheerful obedience and submission to Laws and Government. I am perswaded, a little pains and kindness and condescention in the wise, towards the weak, half the diligence and dexterity in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and example, which hath been used to cnrrupt the people in their Loyalty and Understanding, will quickly reduce them to their Primitive temper, which is, to be the best Neighbours, and the best Friends, and the best Subjects of the World: And I make no question, but the great Piety and Devotion, the Moderation, Wisdom, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Hospitality of my Lords the Bishops, in their several Diocesses, will in a short time recover the poor mis-led people: And though the frowardness and pride of some of their Teachers may not be yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough subdued, though some of the Clergy still repeat their old Errors, for which they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95958:9"/>
have been glad to receive Pardon, and do in truth discredit all their other Doctrine, with the absence of any visible Repentance for what mischief they have formerly done; yet I hope the Laity will soon return into the bosom of their dear Mother the Church, and easily discern the Fraud and Imposture of their Seducers; and that all diligence and dexterity will be used, seriously and heartily to reconcile both Clergy and Laity, by all means which may prove effectual.</p>
            <p>You have (my Lords and Gentlemen) like wise Patriots, upon your observation, That the most signal indulgence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descentions, the temporary suspension of the rigour of former Laws, hath not produced that effect which was expected, that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and spirits of men are too rough and boisterous for those soft remedies, you have prepared sharper Laws and Penalties, to contend with those refractory persons, and to break that stubbornness which will not bend to gentler applications: And it is great reason, that they upon whom clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy cannot prevail, should feel that severity they have provoked. You have done your parts like good Physitians, made wholsom Prescriptions for the constitution of your Patients, well knowing that the Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these Remedies, the execution of these
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95958:9"/>
sharp Laws depends upon the wisdom of the most discerning, generous, and merciful Prince, who having had more experience of the nature, and humour of mankinde, then any Prince living, can best distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Tenderness of Conscience, and the Pride of Conscience, between the real Effects of Conscience, and the wicked Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to Conscience; who having fought with Beasts at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> knows how to guard Himself and the Kingdom from the assaults and violence of a strong, malicious, corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Understanding, and Will; and how to secure Himself and the Kingdom from the feeble Traps and Nets of deluded Fancies, and Imaginations: In a word, a Prince of so excellent a Nature, and so tender a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science Himself, that He hath the highest compassion for all errors of that kinde, and will never suffer the Weak to undergo the punishment ordained for the Wicked, and knows, and understands better then any man, that excellent rule of <hi>Quintilian, Est aliquid quod non oportet, etiamsi licet, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud est jura spectare, aliud justitiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Machiavel,</hi> who, they say, is an Author much studied of late in this Kingdom, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol his own excellent judgment and insight in History; in which indeed he was a Master,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95958:10"/>
would perswade men to believe, that the true reason, why so many unexpected acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and mischiefs fall out, to the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of States and Empires, is, because their Governours have not observed the same mischiefs heretofore in story, and from whence they proceeded, and what progress they made, which he says, if they had done, they might easily have preserved themselves from ruine, and prevented the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which have faln out. I am sure you are all good Historians, and need onely to resort to the Records of your own memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Remember how your peace hath been formerly disturbed, by what contrivance and artifices the people have been Alarm'd, with unreasonable and unnatural Fears and Jealousies, and what dismal effects those Fears and Jealousies have produced. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how near Monarchy hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and the Law subverted under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of reforming and supporting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Law, and Justice. And remember how many honest persons were mis-led by not discerning Consequences, who would as soon have renounced their part in Heaven, as have concurred in the first unwarrantable action, if they had suspected what did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: And if we suffer the same enemy to break in upon us at the same Avenues, if we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95958:10"/>
suffer our Peace to be blown up by the same Trains and Machinations, we shall be held very ill Historians, and worse Polititians.</p>
            <p>There is an Enemy amongst us, of whom I doubt we are not jealous enough, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom we cannot be too vigilant, and in truth, in comparison of whom we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably undervalue all other Enemies; that is, the Republicans, the Commonwealths-men, who are every day calling in aid of the Law, that they may overthrow and abolish the Law, which they know to be their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable enemy. Indeed, my Lords and Gentlemen, there is a vey great party of those men in every Faction of Religion, who tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have no Religion, but as the pretence serves to advance that Faction. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too sollicitous, too inquisitive after these men, who are restless in their Councels, and wonderfully punctual and industrious in their Correspondences, which they maintain abroad as well as at home: And you cannot doubt they have encouragement enough from abroad; few of our neighbours love us so exceedingly well, but that they would be glad to see us entangled in Domestique broyls. These men are worthy of your care and diligence, in your speedy settling the <hi>Militia,</hi> which the King hath even now so particularly recommended to you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:95958:11"/>I shall conclude with only putting you in mind, that there was scarce ever a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Sedition in the Republique of <hi>Rome,</hi> then in a time of full Peace, when the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens were sullen, when there was no noise but in whispers, when men neglected their Trades, and stayed idle in their own houses, as if they cared not which way the world went, from whence alone their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours the <hi>Etrurians</hi> were encouraged to make a War upon them. <hi>Novum seditionis genus</hi> (says <hi>Livy</hi>) <hi>silentium otiumque inter cives.</hi> Never any Nation under Heaven, has less cause of sullenness then we, never more of joy and thanksgiving: We all know that God Almighty loves a chearful giver, and we may as well know that he loves a chearful receiver; besides all other stupendious bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings conferred upon us, he hath given us the most chearful Giver, that ever people hath been blest with; a King that hath with all imaginable chearfulness given us all we have asked of Him, all He hath to give; who would not take or retain any thing we give to Him, but for our own sakes; that by receiving and retaining it, He may give it to us again, in more abundance, in abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Peace, and Plenty, and Honour, and all the Comforts which can make a Nation happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:95958:11"/>This time hath made a glorious addition to our happiness, which ought proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to increase our chearfulness; we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely one blessing, the arrival of our Queen, whom God hath now safely brought to us; a Queen of such a rare perfection in Body and Mind, of such great endowments of Wisdom, Vertue, and Piety, that we may reasonably promise our selves from Her, all the happiness we are capable of, and a Succession of Princes to govern us, till the end of the world; and there cannot be a more transcendent instance of the Kings love, and passion for His people, then that He hath staid these four days to take His leave of you; and, that He might give you this days work, all these good Laws, hath denied Himself so long the enjoying the greatest comfort He is assured of in this world.</p>
            <p>If there be not the most Universal Joy in the Reception of these Blessings; if there be not an Universal contentedness and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in the hearts of all men; and if that Contentedness and Satisfaction do not break out, and is not visible in the looks, and thoughts, and words, and actions of the whole Nation, to the inflaming the hearts of the other Nations under His Majesties obedience by our example, we are guilty of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95958:12"/>
an Ingratitude that is worthy to deprive us of all we enjoy, and to disappoint us of all we pray for. And therefore I do most humbly beseech you, My Lords and Gentlemen, That as there is a most noble cheerfulness and alacrity visible in you; and hath shed it self over all your countenances; so that you will think it worthy of your pains, to infuse the same good spirit into City and Countrey, that they may all express that joy and delight in the blessings they are possessed of, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour to improve those blessings, by their cheerful enjoying them, that God may continue those blessings to us, and the Kings comfort may be encreased, by the comfort He sees we have in Him, and in what He hath done for us; and as all Princes may take a pattern from him to Govern, and make their Subjects happy; so that all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may learn from us, how to obey, and make that happiness lasting to them, by an eminent and innocent alacrity in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment.</p>
            <p>I am by the Kings express Command, to add one particular which His Majesty meant, but forgot to say Himself. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but observe that His Majesty hath not Passed the Bill that concerns the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> which you cannot imagine proceeds
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95958:12"/>
from His Majesties want of care of, and kindness to that Noble Family, which hath served him so faithfully, and suffered so much for so doing; but all parties having referred the Matter to His Majesty, he doubts not but to make a better end for that Noble Earl then he would attain if the Bill had passed.</p>
            <p>I shall only add the Kings commands for the Prorogation of this Parliament till the Eighteenth day of <hi>February,</hi> and this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is Prorogued till the Eighteenth day of <hi>February</hi> next.</p>
