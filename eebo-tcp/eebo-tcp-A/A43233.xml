            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I look'd upon him as a Man of ſome Learning and Judgment more than others of that Party, and as conſciencious as many.</p>
            <p>But behold! a Book is at length come forth under his Name, and bearing the Title of <hi>A Vindication,</hi> &amp;c. Which having conſidered, I muſt confeſs I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61239:3"/>find my ſelf miſtaken in the opinion I had of him, both in reference to his Judgment and Conſcience. My reaſons for ſuch change of my mind, I ſhall in theſe Papers produce. And firſt, His addreſs to his Reader challengeth ſome ſhort remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He will have me to be <hi>the moſt unjuſt of any that ever yet wrote againſt them, becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he draws a general charge from a particular failing.</hi> I anſwer, He ſhould firſt have anſwered the Reaſons I gave why I did ſo. But do they not generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count G. F. moſt eminently filled with that Spirit wherein they boaſt? Did he not write this Book in the Name of the <hi>Quakers?</hi> Have they not defended it? And doth not <hi>W. P.</hi> here in their Names under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the defence of it? And in ſuch a caſe I am juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>W. P.</hi> himſelf, ſee <hi>pag.</hi> 136.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He faults my <hi>generoſity,</hi> becauſe I wrote againſt <hi>G. F. at a juncture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when he might under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him to be at</hi> America.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Methinks it ſavours of arrogancy, as if the Voyages of their great Prophet muſt be as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taken notice of, as if he were ſome Prince or Cardinal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſuggeſts the unſeaſonableneſs of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>juſt when they ſhould make the beſt of an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected toleration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And would they not have cryed out with more colour of reaſon, if it had been done at a time when they were under ſufferings? <hi>And if he tells us</hi> (ſaith <hi>W. P.</hi>) <hi>that he had no mind to add to our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, he deals deceitfully: for his ſelf-ſafety, and not charity to us was hinderance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's no marvel that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> errs in judging mens hearts, when he fails ſo groſly in things before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61239:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>his eyes, as I ſhall ſoon ſhew. But the Bookſeller can tell him, the little Book was ſo well approved of by Men of Learning and Authority, (perſons I know not) that it might have been printed in the moſt dangerous times.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But it's a very grievous thing to them to want my Name, and no ſimall enquiry have they made after it: which ingenuous Perſons would have ſcorn'd to have done: But I perſwade my ſelf, I gave ſatisfying Reaſons to all unprejudiced Readers why I concealed it; and <hi>W. P</hi>'s Book hath juſtified them: for he hath at a venture given me a new Name, and aſcribed to me what may ſeem odious under it. If they ſet their Names to their Books to have praiſe of men, I ſeek it not.</p>
            <p>Next, he is much offended at a quondam Friend of his, who was ſo kind as to give away ſome ſix-penny Books to thoſe he knew would not buy them, and yet were concern'd to read them: A notable Crime in another Man, but a virtue in a <hi>Quaker!</hi> I wiſh they would practiſe it in reference to their <hi>Vindication.</hi> But <hi>he beſtows ſome foul Epithites up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> G. F. <hi>as Knave, Puppy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> O the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Self-love! that Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhould thus expoſe a man's name for words ſpoken in a free manner, and privately to his Acquaintance, and that after he had recall'd thoſe terms, and promis'd to forbear them for the future; and in the mean time himſelf to be ſuch a proficient in abuſive Terms and Phraſes, as if he were Doctor of the Chair among the Satyriſts, ſave that he mixeth ſome <hi>Billingsgate</hi> language withal. I ſhall here preſent the Reader with ſome of his ſweet language; if I ſhould tranſcribe it all,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61239:4"/>I dare ſay, it would take up more Paper then I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to write in the whole.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61239:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>them, or ſuch like. If <hi>G. F.</hi> be a Prophet, he muſt be either a true one or a falſe one. 2. <hi>G. F.</hi> ſupplyed me with them, beſtowing thoſe, or the like, upon his Adverſaries upon unjuſt accounts. But I appeal to any prudent man, whether <hi>W. P.</hi> might not, with greater advantage to his Apology, have omitted his many reproachful and virulent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Beſides, I doubt not but to make it as evident as the Sun at noon, that <hi>W. P.</hi> is himſelf guilty of thoſe very Crimes which he falſly charges upon me, and in thoſe very Inſtances.</p>
            <p>Before I came to the main Argument of my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I addreſſed my ſelf to them by way of Introduction, wherein I gave ſome reaſons of that manner of Argument which I intended. This Mr. <hi>P.</hi> firſt falls foul upon, and by the honeſty and diſcretion he uſeth here, we may judge of his performance in the whole Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>In his firſt and ſecond Sections, the Reader may take notice how greedily he catches at the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations I give of ſome of them: I ſaid there were <hi>honeſt-hearted amongst them;</hi> and he ſaith, <hi>He is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to allow us, at leaſt a great many among us, to be honeſt-hearted;</hi> It may as well be underſtood of ſome few. Is he not a modeſt man?

P.</hi> (like a man that will rob his Neighbour for praiſe rather than go without it) ſaith thus, Sect. 2. <hi>If we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel in all things, as he confeſſeth:</hi> Here <hi>W.

I have look't among the Printers <hi>Errata</hi>'s,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61239:5"/>whether he had not corrected <hi>all</hi> by <hi>many,</hi> but find no ſuch thing: And if I ſhould grant him that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (without good reaſon) yet the other piece of falſity, <hi>viz.</hi> putting <hi>we the Quakers</hi> in general for <hi>some of them,</hi> will abide by him, to the groſs injury of me, and the ſhame of himſelf. Doth he call me <hi>idle Boaſter,</hi> and at the ſame time vainly boaſt of the praiſe I never gave them?</p>
            <p>In his third Sect. He calls thoſe praiſes, (which by falſifying my words he wrings out) <hi>paying them their due.</hi>
            </p>

                  </gap> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-erring Spirit, is, or ſhould be, the proper Judge of Truth, Rule of Faith, and Guide of Life among men.</hi> I commend him for his wit: I have charg'd <hi>G. F.</hi> with about fifty ſuch fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures, as for which he condemns his Adverſaries to be perverters of Scripture, and conſequently, Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Blaſphemers. <hi>W. P.</hi> here in vindication of him, enters into a long diſcourſe of two and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pages, to prove from Scripture, Reaſon, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Authority, <hi>That</hi> G. F. <hi>is, or, if he is not, ſhould be led by an infallible Spirit;</hi> for his Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is no other way to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I do not only willingly grant, but contend for it, That there was in <hi>G. F.</hi> at that time when he wrote his <hi>Mystery,</hi> &amp;c. a Conſcience, which had he hearkened to, he ſhould thereby have been a Law to himſelf, and it would not have ſuffered him to be guilty of ſuch things as he condemns in others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I grant alſo that this Rule is infallible, <hi>viz. That he that judgeth another for any thing, is inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, if he do the ſame thing himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I grant, 3. that God is the Author of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Light, or Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>G. F.</hi> might have known the Rule afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid by a good uſe and improvement of his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding! but I ſuppoſe he came to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it by ſome outward Teaching or Tradition, eſpecially by the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And ſo, 5. the Spirit of God may in a true and good ſenſe be ſaid to have taught <hi>G. F.</hi> that Rule, becauſe it inſpired thoſe that preached and wrote that Rule in the Scriptures.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61239:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p n="6">6. That the Spirit of God was ready to have aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in walking according to that Rule.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That it may be, God did by his Power and Providence work upon him toward obedience.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Perhaps the Spirit of God did at that time when he was about to diſobey, ſuggeſt to him his Duty and Rule: But there is little reaſon to think ſo, becauſe that Rule was ſufficiently know to <hi>G. F.</hi> by the means aforeſaid; and God is not wont to give that ſpecial Gift, but to his humble Servants and Friends, or to thoſe whom he will imploy upon ſome ſpecial buſineſs in the World. And if he had ſuch a ſuggeſtion, the more notoriouſly wicked was he to diſobey ſo great a Light.</p>
            <p>Now if any judicious Reader will take pains to conſider the 25 Texts <hi>W. P.</hi> has quoted, (and he may add 25 more to them) with their Contexts, I am perſwaded he will find them every one to intend ſome of the Caſes I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Now let us ſee if we can underſtand what <hi>W. P.</hi> intends by the terms of his Poſition; for we muſt underſtand him, as he underſtands the Scriptures, not Literally, but Myſtically.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are to know that by <hi>God's Holy and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring-Spirit,</hi> he means (if he means as the leading <hi>Quakers</hi>) neither Hypoſtaſis nor Perſon, nor any thing elſe, but God himſelf; who is the Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By <hi>Judge of Truth, Rule of Faith, Guide of Life,</hi> he means, That God doth immediately teach <hi>G. F.</hi> and every man, to judge infallibly of all Truth, what is to be believed, and what to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed. [For otherwiſe it is not intelligible, <hi>That God ſhould be the Judge of Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>among men.</hi>]</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61239:7"/>
            <p>And therefore 3. that <hi>the Scripture is</hi> (as he ſaith pag. 38.) <hi>much like the ſhadow of the true Rule, which may give us ſome ground to gueſs what the Rule if ſelf is.</hi> In the next page, he ſaith in effect, That the Teachings of God, are like the knowledge of the Princes Will and Secrets, <hi>viva Voce,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; which he that hath (and every man ought to have) <hi>heeds not ſo much the ſame when he meets it in print,</hi> that is in the Scriptures: They are like a <hi>Gazette</hi> to a Privy Counſellor. But he ſaith, <hi>That the eternal Spirit,</hi> [that is, <note place="margin">It had been to be deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he had not fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Engliſh in this place.</note> theſe immediate Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings] <hi>to be ſuperior to thoſe Writings.</hi> So that when <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaith, <hi>How can they but delude People that are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible?</hi> This is to be heeded more than any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Scripture, and is ſuperior to thoſe Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He means by his Poſition, that men are to be guided into Truth, and Faith, and good Life, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, in oppoſition to their endeavours, ſtudying the Scriptures, ſetting themſelves to Prayer, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, Preaching, and the like; that is, ſuch of theſe as are performed by us, which he calls, (<hi>p.</hi> 84.) <hi>Running in our own Wills, poring, beating of our Brains, and daily ſtriving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if this be his meaning, (as manifeſtly it is) then let any man, that has read any of thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Books, tell me whether he thinks that any one of thoſe he mentions was of his mind, that is, <hi>Tollet,</hi> or <hi>Maldonate, Beza,</hi> or Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> or <hi>Hutchinſon, Socinus, Selichtingius</hi> or <hi>Crellius?</hi> Did they not all abhor that Doctrine? It comes to this,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61239:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>That God has made men with faculties capable of believing and underſtanding what the Will of their earthly Superior is, by the means of Miniſters, Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, Proclamations, Writings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying his Will heartily without immediate aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. But if our Heavenly Superior will have us to know or do his Will, he muſt tell us immediately himſelf, he muſt go along with us, and lead us ſtep by ſtep, or elſe he muſt expect no Service, Duty, or Obedience from us at all. The truth is, This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the neceſſity of God's immediate Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth overthrow the Mediatorſhip of the Man Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, and quite ſubvert the Goſpel; for <hi>mediate</hi> and <hi>immediate,</hi> are directly contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſtill we have gain'd nothing by this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for if men do not hearken to the Un-erring Judge, or miſtake him, or reſiſt him againſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, refuſing to be led by him, they fail as much as if they had no ſuch Immediate Guide, but a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Guide and Direction. Let Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> be the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; who even in the beginning of his Book, has (notwithſtanding his immediate and infallible Guide) run into five or ſix ſuch palpable Falſities and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnics, as I am conſident the <hi>Cobler of Gloceſter</hi> would never have been guilty of; nor any man elſe, that had not been tranſported with pride, raſhneſs, and revenge. What has he gain'd then by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Guide, which another man (that knows by Nature or Tradition he ought to ſpeak truth) is not equally capable of?</p>
            <p>But why doth this Apologiſt ſpend ſo many Pages upon this Point, and take no notice of my arguing in the following Lines, which he ſaith, I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61239:8"/>my ſelf againſt? Muſt it be paſt over there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? I am perſwaded (to uſe his words) he was confounded at it. It was to this effect; <q>We by your own confeſſion have the Light within, or the infallible Guide as well as you, why then is not our Doctrine as true as yours? You anſwer, That we are not obedient, we are in the cuſtoms of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore not to be heeded. Thus you prove your ſelves to be in the Truth, and us to be in Error, not by Divine Reaſon, and Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but by the high opinion you have of your ſelves, and your low opinion of others.</q> And it indeed they acknowledge that there are vertuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are of a contrary perſwaſion to them, and none but who are guided by an infallible Spirit, then they are no more certain than other men, and we need ſtill an infallible Judge. I add, If every man hath, the I have a meaſure of infallible Light, the leaſt meaſure whereof convinces of ſin, eſpecially groſs ſins, ſuch as Malice, Envy, Lying, Murdering-Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which <hi>W. P.</hi> imputes to me: But I am ſo far from having any ſuch convictions that on the contrary, my Conſcience hears me witneſs of a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty love to Truth and their Perſons, in what I have done, and am a doing: Therefore, if their Doctrine be true, his Imputation is falſe; if his Imputation be true, their Doctrine is falſe. But enough of this.</p>
            <p>Having now in this Introduction given the Reader a proof of <hi>W. P</hi>'s faculty in accuſing, meek lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, faithfulneſs in repreſenting my words and ſenſe, modeſty in praiſing himſelf and Party, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of that which is weighty confidence in denying what they are charged with, and his ſenſe of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61239:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Spirits guidance; We are pretty well prepar'd to make a conjecture of what we are to expect from him, in the handling of the main Argument; which I think fit firſt to give a ſhort account of. And I muſt tell you, that it is <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> an Argument againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> formed out of his own words, and runs thus:
<q>
                  <l>He that is not Infallible, in a Deluder:</l>
                  <l>But <hi>G. Fox</hi> is not infallible,</l>
                  <l>Therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> is a Deluder.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Major Propoſition (as they call it) is expreſly proved by that Quotation out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Book, where he faith, <hi>How can ye be Miniſters of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, if ye be not infallible?</hi> And, <hi>How can they but delude people, that are not infallible?</hi> And again <hi>G. F.</hi> faith, <hi>Is is not Blaſphemy for you to Speak and Preach that which ye have not received from Heaven?</hi> Whence I further Argue thus:</p>
            <p>He that Speaks and Preaches that which he hath not received from Heaven, is a Blaſphemer: But <hi>G. F.</hi> Speaks and Preaches that which he hath not received from Heaven, therefore, <hi>G. F.</hi> is a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer.</p>
            <p>It remains now that I prove the Minor Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former Argument; namely, <hi>G. Fox is not infallible:</hi> and that alſo I ſhall do out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s words, thus: He that ſo quotes Scripture, <note place="margin">The inſtances of theſe things out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Book, are to be ſeen in my Epiſtle, <hi>p. 5, 6.</hi>
               </note> as that he expreſſes the Pronoun <hi>Ye,</hi> where it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or renders the Greek Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by, <hi>with,</hi> or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61239:9"/>
               <hi>among,</hi> or <hi>to;</hi> or puts <hi>He</hi> for <hi>We;</hi> or leaves one ſomething that ought to be expreſſed, or adds to Scripture words; He that doth any one of theſe things, or that which is manifeſtly equivalent, ſuch an one is a Perverter or Corruptor of Scripture, and not infallible: But <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſome one of theſe things, or that which is manifeſtly equivalent; therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> is not infallible. The ſame medium proves the Minor of the ſecond Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> G. F. <hi>Speaks and Preaches that which he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Heaven:</hi> Thus, he that perverts or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts the Scripture in any of the forementioned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, or one that is manifeſtly equivalent, Speaks and Preaches that which he hath not received from Heaven. But <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſo pervert the Scripture, Therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> Speaks and Preaches that which he hath not received from Heaven. The Minor of this, and of the former Proſyllogiſm, namely, that <hi>G. F.</hi> doth ſo pervert the Scripture, was proved in my Epiſtle, by fifty Inſtances out of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Book; <note place="margin">The Myſtery of the great Whore.</note> and I appeal to every unprejudiced Reader, whether there be not as much weight in every one of them, as in ſome of thoſe, for which <hi>G. F.</hi> chargeth his Adverſaries with perverting of Scripture? And whether there be not in many of them greater weight than in any of thoſe? And if it ſhould prove that but two or three of thoſe fifty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are full to my purpoſe, it would be enough to prove what I have undertaken, namely, That <hi>G. F.</hi> is, according to the true ſenſe of his own words, a Deluder and Blaſphemer.</p>
            <p>I have been forced to this way of ſyllogyzing, that Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s fallacious way of handling my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61239:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>may more readily appear; though I believe the common people did underſtand it as well (if not better) in that vulgar way, wherein I propos'd it in my Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>But to return; The evidence of all the Premiſes, is matter of Fact, obvious to the eyes of every man that can but read Engliſh, and diſcern one word or phraſe from another, or when he finds more or leſs in any Sentence; for what can be lighter than the adding of a Pronoun to a Verb, where it muſt be underſtood.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not go too faſt; though my Argument proves <hi>G. F.</hi> to be a Deluder of People, and a Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and ſo a Lyar; yet it doth not prove him to be a falſe Prophet, or Impoſtor: therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that large (and indeed blaſphemous) Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Wo</hi> [G. Fox] <hi>is a Prophet indeed, and hath been faithful in the Lords buſineſs from the beginning: It was ſaid of Chriſt,</hi> That he was in the World, and the World was made by him, and the World knew him not: <hi>So it may be ſaid of this true Prophet, whom</hi> John <hi>ſaid he was not.</hi> I added alſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> common Principle, which doth not permit any one to be of the Miniſtry, (as they call it) but Him or Her that hath an immediate Revelation, or a Prophet. Now if <hi>G. F.</hi> be a Prophet, and a Prophet indeed, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Miniſtry, but the moſt eminent therein, and the Patriarch of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">I ſuppoſe they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that writing to all the Worlds, in defence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is Speaking, or Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or equivalent.</note> and if he be a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Blaſphemer, even when he Speaks &amp; Preaches, then it follows roundly, that <hi>G. F.</hi> is a falſe Prophet,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61239:10"/>or an Impoſtor. This is the ſubſtance of that Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Mr. P. undertook to overthrow. Let us now ſee, how he hath acquited himſelf in that warfare.</p>
            <p>Firſt, He doth not charge me with one word of falſe quotation, (that I remember) either out of Scripture, of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Writings, ſo that I take it for granted, that the quotations are all true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. 2. He grants that <hi>G. F.</hi> is a Prophet, or <hi>ſent of God, by his eternal Spirit, to turn people from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> p. 67. 3. He doth not deny, at leaſt for the moſt part, but that what I have aſcribed to <hi>G. F.</hi> as Scripture words quoted by him, is ſuch, and conſequently diſtinguiſhed from <hi>G. F</hi>'s Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes, Explications, or Inferences. But he doth deny, 1. <hi>That</hi> G. F. <hi>his affirming things to be true, which are falſe, and falſe which are true,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Here this great Linguiſt has forgot to write good Engliſh, that is his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue.</note> 
               <hi>to be obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their eyes or ſenſes:</hi> That is, He denies that <hi>G. F.</hi> his putting <hi>them</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.10.) thereby changing the Antecedent, <hi>with</hi> for <hi>in,</hi> (<hi>Epheſs.</hi> 2.6) the corruption he blames in others; <hi>Conſcience</hi> for <hi>Thoughts,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15.) <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Lord,</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9) <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (<hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.) and ſo of the reſt; He denies, I ſay, that theſe and the like falſities in <hi>G. F</hi>'s quotations of Scripture are obvious to his ſenſes: and yet 1. they are words written, and therefore proper objects of ſenſe; and 2. the change of the words, (which is the falſity in this caſe) is in his anſwers, not denyed, but excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So that this his firſt Anſwer comes to this, That <hi>W.P.</hi> doth deny that to be obvious to his ſenſe, which he reads and acknowledgeth by excuſing. And if this anſwer may ſerve his turn, I muſt confeſs I am
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61239:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>non-pluſt; for when I have ſhewn an Object of ſight to a mans eyes by noon-day light, and when he perceives it, and acknowledgeth it by manifeſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: If he ſtill perſiſt to deny it expreſly, I cannot help it, nor I think any man in the World. I may well be ſaid to fetch Arguments <hi>out of Bedlam,</hi> (as he ſayes) If I ſhould proſecute ſuch a man any further. — But for the ſake of ſome that will believe their Senſe and Reaſon, I will proceed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He utterly denies that ſuch falſity, as I have ſpoken of, <hi>renders</hi> G. F. <hi>either a falſe Prophet or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor;</hi> Lyer he doth not deny. Now, 1. I muſt confeſs I have not ſo ſubtil a wit as to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a lying Prophet and a falſe Prophet, and if my Argument will ſerve to prove <hi>G. F.</hi> a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophet, I will not contend, whether the name of <hi>Impoſtor</hi> be proper for him, but uſe it without ſcruple till I be better informed concerning it. 2. Let it be conſidered, what it is that <hi>W. P.</hi> denies, and it will amount to as much as if he had confeſt it. For he denies that ſuch falſities or changes of Words and Phraſes, (in citing Scripture) as <hi>G. F.</hi> by his infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Spirit, calls perverting and corrupting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are ſuch; which is all one as to ſay, that <hi>G. F.</hi> is not infallible, and if he be not infallible, he is judg'd by himſelf to be a Deluder and Blaſphemer. Now hath not <hi>W. P.</hi> vindicated <hi>G. F.</hi> to purpoſe? Or, has he not, under colour of vindicating him, condemn'd him, and that with the moſt opprobious terms he could deviſe.</p>
            <p>This that I ſay is very manifeſt, ſo that if I would ſpend my time, or the Readers, ſo unprofitably, I might here tranſcribe almoſt all that he ſaith as any way pertinent to the Argument, and all his vilifying
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61239:11"/>Speeches on that account, and retort them upon <hi>G. F.</hi> to whom they do in truth belong, and not to me. For though I have in ſome inſtances imputed faultineſs to him for ſmall variations from Scripture words, becauſe I ſaw that thoſe variations counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced ſome error; yet I am confident, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have entered into my head ſo to do, unleſs I had firſt found him blaming his Adverſaries for pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture upon far ſlighter, yea, and ridiculous accounts.</p>
            <p>Might I not here tell <hi>G. F.</hi> as <hi>W. P.</hi> tells me? (p. 50.) <hi>Had he not been void of all ſenſe himſelf, and reaſon too, he would never have ſuffered ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and untruth, to paſs the Preſs without correction.</hi> And (p. 21.) <hi>That no man in that compaſs, could have manifeſted more weakneſs, folly, malice, and untruth, (as well in defending of his own, as in oppoſing our Principles)</hi> then <hi>G. F.</hi> hath done in his <hi>Myſtery of the Whore.</hi> Witneſs the quotations before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and <hi>W. P.</hi> Again, (p. 52.) with a little varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>But that a man ſhould make 22 corrections of ſo many Texts of Scripture corrupted by the Tranſlators, and twelve or thirteen of them to depend upon the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of the Greek Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in, and not otherwiſe, befits no man that loves to be profitably imploy'd, but it therefore ſuits</hi> G. F. <hi>which is ſo over-run with,</hi> &amp;c. That on Ship-board (a kind of publick place, or elſe I ſhould not mention it) he ſuffers (as the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers inform) elder men than himſelf, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets too, to miniſter to him in the loweſt Offices, ſuch as untying and pulling off his Shooes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But how ſhould Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> know that I am <hi>ſo over-run with the lazy?</hi> Did his infallible Spirit reveal it to him? for otherwiſe he doth but gueſs who I am. Here he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61239:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſcorns me with <hi>ſaturnal Dreams:</hi> See the tender Conſcience of this <hi>Quaker!</hi> He dare not uſe the word <hi>Saturn,</hi> when it is a meer ſignification of a certain day in the week, as <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> is of a man; but when if ſerves to abuſe his Neighbour, he can uſe it without ſcruple.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 53. <hi>I look upon it</hi> (ſaith W. P.) <hi>as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and preſumptuous, for any man to undertake what he cannot prove, and not leſs baſe to affirm a man miſcites, perverts, and corrupts Scripture, when he renders the genuine ſenſe of it.</hi> Had Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſo ſoon forgotten what he had read in the Page immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foregoing? <hi>(Epiſt. p. 6.)</hi> Or, Doth he think that <hi>Deſtroy ye this Temple,</hi> is not the genuine ſenſe of <hi>Deſtroy this Temple?</hi> is this to vindicate <hi>G. F.</hi> to render him <hi>baſe?</hi> And may not Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> (p. 62.) <hi>confeſs himſelf troubled,</hi> [as well for <hi>G. F.</hi> as for me] <hi>not at his great skill, but folly?</hi> When he finds him asking his Adverſaries, ſo like a Critick, Where <hi>doth the Scripture ſpeak of humane, the word Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane?</hi> And will not <hi>W. P</hi>'s words, <hi>p.</hi> 6†, ſerve pertinently againſt <hi>G. F. viz: Certainly then this word</hi> Humane, <hi>is not of ſuch dangerous conſequence, nor inconſonant to Scripture-language, as this idle and ignorant perſon would render it.</hi> But I muſt haſten. And yet give me leave a little to borrow Mr. <hi>P</hi>'s pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick figure of ſpeaking, <hi>p.</hi> 80. thus: <hi>And that which is more to be wondered at, this miſerable man,</hi> even while he denies <hi>G. F.</hi> to be a falſe Prophet or Impoſtor, doth manifeſtly aſſert him to be a Deluder and Blaſphemer. <hi>I heartily pity the man, and am really affraid he has overcharged the ſtrength of his brain; for with me ſuch manifeſt contradiction is but a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61239:12"/>ſmaller degree of diſtraction. O ſtupendious folly!</hi> Thus doth Mr. <hi>P.</hi> treat his Adverſary.</p>
            <p>Theſe paſſages, out of many more of the ſame complexion, I have taken out of <hi>W. P</hi>'s vindication of <hi>G. F.</hi> from the firſt inſtance of Scripture miſ-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited (in his language corrupted) taken from <hi>John</hi> 1.9. which may be by me applyed to them according to truth; but are by <hi>W. P.</hi> to me, by abuſe of my Words and Perſon, as may caſily be perceived by any intellgent Reader. But that which is matter of wonder (if any thing be ſo in this Author) is, That he ſpends near two and thirty pages upon this Head, and concerning the Light, and not one word (that I can perceive) whereby <hi>G. F.</hi> is any way vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from my chief exception; which lay in this, <hi>That every man whom the Light lighteth, is not of neceſſity or effectually enlightned:</hi> But <hi>G. F.</hi> reads it, <hi>Every man that cometh into the World is enlightned.</hi> I added, for explanation of my ſenſe, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4.) That <hi>the goodneſs of God leadeth—to repentance thoſe that are impenitent, and not led to repentance.</hi> I added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.15. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.33. <hi>&amp;</hi> 36. but of this Mr. <hi>P.</hi> hath deep ſilence. He ſpends near 16 pages about the tranſlation and reference of <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>As for the difference between <hi>lighteth</hi> and <hi>enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> I ſtood not upon it; but now, after all his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61239:13"/>labour, I ſay, There is as much difference between theſe words, as between <hi>deſtroy this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and <hi>deſtroy ye the Temple;</hi> and our Tranſlators ſeem to uſe the word <hi>lighteth,</hi> for the <hi>Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and the word <hi>enlighteth,</hi> for the <hi>Goſpel received and believed. W. P.</hi> deals here like a cunning Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, who having a bad Cauſe, labours hard to turn off the Judges from the Matter in iſſue, to ſomething that is not ſo. In order to that, another Artifice he uſeth is, To make an hideous out-cry againſt me, as a Socinian, Mungrel-Socinian, Bidlean, and other frightful names; as if it were a ſufficient vindicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>G. F.</hi> from the charge I have prov'd againſt him, out of his own Writings, that I am an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious or Heretical Perſon. Let me be all that <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaith I am, a Turk, a Jew, an Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phite, an Arrian or Sabellian, or what he will; will <hi>G.F.</hi> his Doctrine be e're the truer, or his Perſon the wiſer or honeſter? Away with ſuch Mercurial ſleights! Here he would fain draw us into the Controverſie of his ſtating, <hi>viz. Whether the Light be natural and created, or ſupernatural and eternal?</hi> Into which if we ſhould be ſo fooliſh as to follow him, I dare ſay we might have work enough for a full age, and be never the wiſer at laſt; For how is it poſſible to come to any determination with one that is equivocating in his terms? as I ſhall ſhew the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be.</p>
            <p>Next he falls upon my Conceſſions concerning the Light in every man, and pleaſes himſelf hugely in making me contradict my ſelf, and give away my Cauſe: But it's no great matter, for one that is wont to equivocate in his own words, to make his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours contradictory by the ſame art.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61239:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>And, 2. if if ſhould appear that I had failed in expreſſing my mind concerning that matter, yet ſtill the Argument of my Book might be firm and valid againſt <hi>G. F.</hi> Here under this Head, upon my ſober appeal to the Light in the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he falls (as it were) into an exſtacy, and cries out <hi>monſtrum hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendum!</hi> (as if ſome Poetick Deity had inſpir'd him): Why! what's the matter? He ſaith, <hi>That unto which a man makes an appeal, muſt be capable of giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an infallible judgment, and ſo a true Judge, or elſe he appeals fooliſhly. Anſw.</hi> It ſeems, when <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that is, <hi>Nero,</hi> that <hi>Nero</hi> was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving an infallible judgment, or elſe <hi>Paul</hi> appealed fooliſhly. Do not all men know that Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals are made to men upon the account of neceſſity or conveniency, not upon an opinion of his infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to whom the appeal is made? Doth not Mr. <hi>P.</hi> reaſon like a man in a fright? 2. He ſaith, that <hi>G. F.</hi> is by the verdict of that Light in them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced <hi>not guilty;</hi> and I tell him, that <hi>G. F.</hi> is by the verdict of the Light in me, and as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands as the <hi>Quakers</hi> pronounced Guilty: On which ſide now is the infallible judgment? or, are we both infallible? What triſting is here with terms and words! Upon the queſtion if ſelf, of the Light in every man, I have in effect diſcours'd already, when we conſider'd <hi>W. P</hi>'s Poſition touching the Un-er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Judge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I add further, That every man that grows up to years of diſcretion, has a capacity, by Nature or otherwiſe, to know ſo much of Gods Will, concerning his Duty, as whereby his honeſty and ſincerity may be tryed. 2. That he that is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the obedience of that knowledge he has, ſhall have more. 3. That ſuch an one (as was <hi>Cornelius,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61239:14"/>Acts</hi> 10.) who feareth God, and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſhall be accepted of him. But. 4. that ſuch a perſon may be yet without the Knowledge or Faith of Jeſus the Mediator between God and men. And, 5. that God did not to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> neither was wont in thoſe Primitive times, nor doth he in theſe dayes (that can be made to appear) reveal unto ſuch men inwardly by his Spirit, the knowledge of Chriſt the Mediator; which was contained in thoſe words which <hi>Peter</hi> preached to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whereby he and his Houſe were to be ſaved. 6. I ſay, That that knowledge in thoſe words are conveyed to us by the Holy Scriptures, as unto <hi>Cornelius</hi> by word of mouth. 7. I ſay, That the <hi>Quakers</hi> in viliſying <hi>the knowledge from tradition, and the profeſſion of the Perſon of Chriſt by tradition,</hi> and contending for an immediate reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this Knowledge, do vilifie the diſpenſation of the Goſpel by the Mediator Jeſus, and his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts their Preaching and Writing. Theſe things are evident, partly by themſelves, partly by Scripture, as <hi>Acts</hi> 10. &amp; 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Now let us look into Mr. <hi>P.</hi> and his Aſſociates, their ſenſe of that Doctrine they ſo much glory in, and upon the account of which they ſing ſuch loud tryumphs in the World, <hi>viz. The Light in every man is infallible,</hi> and <hi>they that are not infallible, are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luders.</hi> For we ſhall deceive our ſelves, if we think we underſtand them, when we underſtand the words in one ſenſe. 1. Then you muſt know that by the term <hi>Light,</hi> ſometime they mean Chriſt; ſo, when they ſay, <hi>the Light is ſupernatural and eternal,</hi> they mean by <hi>the Light, Chriſt,</hi> that is, God; and the ſenſe is,<note place="margin">See p. <hi>68,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>God is ſupernatural and eternaly,</hi> and <hi>God is infallible:</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:61239:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>Who ever denyed it? But, 2. when they ſay, <hi>the Light juſtiſies or condemns,</hi> then they mean that which we call Conſcience, for ſo <hi>G. F.</hi> expounds it, (<hi>Myſt. p.</hi> 11.) ſaying, <hi>And the Light condemns, which you call Couſciouce.</hi> Sutable to this ſenſe, when a man proceeds rightly in the uſe of his faculties, and thoſe means which God aſſords him, and attains to a true knowledge, then he is infallible, and the Light, that is, his Judgment is infallible: But when he doth not proceed rightly, and gives a wrong judgment, then he is fallible, and his judgment fallible, but not the Light. And ſo the ſenſe of their Poſition, <hi>The Light is infallible,</hi> (when they do not mean by <hi>the Light,</hi> God) is, that true knowledge or true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is true knowledge or true judgment. And Mr, <hi>P.</hi> has unhappily, (by being a little more open than their Doctrine will bear) utterly betray'd both his Cauſe and his Friends: For thus he ſaith, (<hi>p.</hi> 82.) <hi>Infallibility of perſons, any further then as they are joyned and conformed to the Light of God, me never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed; and fallibility of the Light, becauſe of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility of perſons, we never owned.</hi> That is to ſay, when <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> preach nothing for truth, buth what they certainly know to be ſo, then, and in that point they give a true judgment, and are infallible; [and ſo is every man in the World] ſo are <hi>G. F</hi>'s Adverſaries;] but when they give a falſe judgment, thinking it to be true, then they are fallible: He might as well have ſaid, They that are intallible, are infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible; and on the contrary. They that are infallible, are fallible; and they that are fallible, are infallible, for there is nothing hinders, but that the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may be infallible in ſome things, and fallable in many things, for nothing is more common, than for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61239:15"/>the ſame perſon to follow the Light of God in one thing, and neglect it in another. When <hi>G. F.</hi> quoted Scripture right, then he did conform to the Light of God, which told him he ought to do ſo, and was infallible: But when he quoted it wrong, then he was not conformed to the Light of God, but fallible. Behold here the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility! May we not retort then <hi>G. F</hi>'s words? <hi>How can he but delude people, ſince he is not infallible?</hi> But they have yet a third ſenſe of the term <hi>Light,</hi> when they ſay, it is infallible, and that is this; <hi>The light in every man, is the immediate Teaching or Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God in every man; and that is alwayes infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Anſw.</hi> I have ſpoken of this before in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction; And again, 1. I ask, Is the mediate Teaching or Speaking of God, either by Nature or Scripture, fallible? I hope not. 2. Mr. P. grants, <hi>p.</hi> 72. That <hi>men may, through their ſins and inſirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, miſtake, and not perceive the teaching of the Light, and ſo not conform it; and then they are fallible like us or other men.</hi> 3. This is that which I ſaid in my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, If God be pleaſed in a mediatory way, by ſuch very vile means (in the <hi>Quakers</hi> account) as the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs of Preaching, and traditional Scripture to reach men ſufficiently; and if they deſpiſe that way, muſt God be bound to ſupply their pride and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by his immediate Teaching? which when he has done, they are ſtill as liable as other men to be inconformable to it. And ſo this their great Doctrine of infallibility comes to nothing but equivocation, noiſe and wind. Their perſons <hi>W. P.</hi> in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to <hi>G. F.</hi> grants to be fallible; their <hi>Light within,</hi> when it is taken for the laſt Dictate of their underſtanding, (which men are obliged alwayes to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61239:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>follow) for whatſoever is not of Faith, is ſin) Mr. <hi>P.</hi> grants to be alſo fallible. And why may not I now retort his exprobration? <hi>Well! before I would undertake Controverſies, and thus give away my Cauſe, nay, ſo wofully, yet frequently contradict my ſelf, [and my Friends] I would never write while I live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things thus diſcourſed, to follow Mr. <hi>P.</hi> though they are a digreſſion from my Argument, yet I hope not unprofitable to the Reader. We may now proceed to his Anſwers upon the particular Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſhow that even in thoſe that are of leaſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his Vindications of <hi>G. F.</hi> and his contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Speeches againſt me for the ſlightneſs of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, do all fall heavily upon his Prophet <hi>George.</hi> For I have him upon this <hi>Dilemma:</hi> If the Inſtances I have produced of <hi>G. F</hi>'s miſ-citings of Scripture, be indeed pervertings and corruptings of Scripture, then <hi>G. F.</hi> is fallible and a Deluder; if they be not, then alſo he is fallible and a Deluder, becauſe he has judg'd them and the like to be ſo in his Adverſaries. So that if I had hir'd <hi>W. P.</hi> to have wrote in defence of my Argument, and in aggravation of G. F's <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> I'm confident he could not have it done more effectually, than he hath in this his Book, where he denies the Antecedent, namely, That ſuch miſ-citings are pervertings, which he doth almoſt in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It would tire the Reader to paſs through them all, we will try it in ſome few of them, that are, in his eſteem of the moſt trivial account.</p>
            <p>And the firſt ſhall be that from <hi>Epheſs.</hi> 2.6. where for <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>We may gueſs at his meaning without an interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; But muſt Chriſt be Lord and not Lord,</hi> [diſtinct and not diſtinct] <hi>at every turn, when this preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perſon</hi> G. F. <hi>will? — In ſhort, If a mans</hi> expreſſing, <hi>ye,</hi> where it muſt be underſtood, <hi>muſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61239:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>conclude him</hi> a perverter of Scripture, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Deluder and Blaſphemer, <hi>Who is true? Let all the World read, and obſerve of what ungodly ſtuff, and very traſh his</hi> [Myſtery Book] <hi>doth conſiſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. G. F. ranks it among Scriptures corrupted by the Tranſlators, that they render <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. <hi>The Goſpel which was preached to every Creature;</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (in contradiction to him that aſſerted that the Goſpel is not firſt made known by the ſeeing within, but by hearing tydings without) renders it, <hi>The Goſpel is preached in every Creature,</hi> where he puts <hi>is</hi> for <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>in</hi> for <hi>to.</hi> Now <hi>W. P.</hi> (p. 121.) doth not deny the change; but ſayes, that <hi>is</hi> and <hi>was</hi> are both true. He ſayes alſo that <hi>in</hi> every Creature, and <hi>to</hi> every Creature, may be the ſame. What now? How can it be a corruption of Scripture in the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators, to render it <hi>to,</hi> if it be the ſame with <hi>in. W. P.</hi> ſeems in this, and indeed in the ſum of his Vindication, to have writ by immediate inſpiration, that is, what came next to his fancy, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of its being for him or againſt him. Well! what's his cenſure againſt me, which lights upon G. F? <hi>His carping there is like all the reſt, malicious and troubleſom.</hi> It ſeems G. F. is a malicious and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſom Prophet.</p>
            <p>Thus I might go through all the inſtances, and preſent <hi>W. P.</hi> wounding and goring himſelf and Friend upon the Horns of my Argument, but the Reader will eaſily excuſe me from that travel, and do it himſelf in his own mind. And yet methinks I cannot but note one more of his <hi>mercurial watchings:</hi> (He'l go near to charge me with palpable lying, (as he has done divers times in the like caſe) for this common phraſe, becauſe I ſay, <hi>I cannot,</hi> when I can).
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61239:17"/>It is in my <hi>p.</hi> 33. in his <hi>p.</hi> 126. where I fault G.F. for ſaying abſolutely, God ſaid, <hi>For did not ſin with his mouth,</hi> where the Scripture ſaith, <hi>In all this did not Job ſin with his lips:</hi> Now my exception lies in thoſe words, <hi>In all this,</hi> which <hi>W. P.</hi> according to his wonted honeſty, leaves out, and gives out, that my exception lies in the putting of <hi>mouth</hi> for <hi>lips,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 127.</note> and that I charge G. F. with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture on that account, when as he has found as great a change as that in Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles their quoting of Scripture. Well! ſuppoſe (what is not) that my exception had been that; Is it not as great a corrupting of Scripture, to put <hi>mouth</hi> for <hi>lips,</hi> as to put <hi>to</hi> for <hi>in,</hi> where Mr. <hi>P.</hi> faith, <hi>To</hi> and <hi>In, may he the ſame;</hi> or as, <hi>deſtroy ye,</hi> for <hi>deſtroy</hi> (<hi>ye</hi> underſtood). Thus all the foul play that <hi>W. P.</hi> can uſe, will not excuſe his good Friend; but every blow that he ſtrikes at me, wounds G. F. mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally. But the moſt deadly of all comes at laſt; 'tis this, (without change of his Argument) <hi>If Chriſt and his Apoſtles have not obſerved ſuch exactneſs as</hi> [G. Fox] <hi>ſo ſeverely reproves</hi> [his Adverſaries] <hi>for the want of. It is to be hoped, that be will either retract his unworthy abuſe — or elſe not think it hard in us to charge this blaſphemous inference upon him, namely, that he makes Chriſt Juſus and his Apoſtles perverters of Scripture, and what elſe be wickedly concludes againſt Profeſſors.</hi> This inference falls with all its weight upon G. F. as the Reader may readily perceive: But for me, it touches me not at all: For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, We will ſuppoſe G. F. but equal to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in changing words to the ſame ſenſe, yet there will be this difference between them. 1. They teſtified the infallibility of their ſpirit by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61239:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>many Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I never heard of any that <hi>G. F.</hi> did, except the eating and making one or more meals of Spidars, of which I hear not of any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence but his own word. 2. Chriſt never call'd the Scribes and Phariſees Perverters of Scripture, for ſuch change of words as G. F. hath done Profeſſors. 3. Chriſt did not at the ſame time challenge the World, and call them forth to come and have their Doctrines tryed by that very Scripture, that is, that Verſion, or that Copy then in uſe among them, and which he corrects them for not following exactly in every point, without their meanings, as G. F. has done in his <hi>Myſtery,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Preface</hi> to the ſame. Which things conſidered, are enough to render him (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Judgment) as Deluder and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer, and <hi>W. P.</hi> no leſs in making the Parallel; but our Lord and his Apoſtles innocent.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, of fifty inſtances, there are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three or four that have not either addition or ſubſtration both of words and ſenſe, or an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of words either importing or countenancing a bad ſenſe, or at leaſt varying from the ſenſe of the place, as I doubt not but will appear to any judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader. And <hi>W. P.</hi> himſelf, in moſt of the Inſtances, doth not deny the various ſenſe, onely he endeavours to make that ſenſe conſiſt with truth in general, or ſome opinion of their own, which others count error.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, It's more than Mr. <hi>P.</hi> knows, for all his skill in the Hebrew, (which is very notorious among learned men) whether out Lord and his Apoſtles in their Citations of Scripture, did not keep to the very words of that Verſion which was then in uſe, or allowed by thoſe to whom he ſpake, and they wrote.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:61239:18"/>So vaſt a difference is there between the Citations of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and thoſe of <hi>G. F.</hi> that it's a moſt ſhameful thing they ſhould be brought into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon. Here I might tranſcrible much to the bitter condemnation of them out of their own mouths, but I muſt haſten.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding after Mr. P. has writ a Book ſtuft with Invectives, and opprobrious condemnations of <hi>G. F.</hi> his Doctrine and Perſon, under my Perſon and Cauſe, he comes at length, in the end of it, to ſay ſomething to his purpoſe of Vindication, if it were true and reaſonable, but it proves no Armour of proof, but a meer Cobweb. He argues thus, <hi>Profeſſors hold the Scripture to the ſuch a ſufficient, infallible—Rule, as that God hath not given unto men any thing more clear and certain:</hi> But G. F. and the <hi>Quakers</hi> hold, That <hi>the eternal Spirit is, by way of excellency, the Rule and Guide of Chriſtians:</hi> Therefore <hi>he was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined to the very expreſs words and points thereof as his Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Could he ſatisfie his Conſcience in this Apology? But I anſwer, 1. This arguing clearly ſuppoſes that the Dictates of <hi>G. F.</hi>'s Spirit, are more excellent than the Scriptures. 2. It ſuppoſes that the Spirit of God, or God himſelf, can affirm that to be written which is not written, that is, can lie: for in citing Scripture, men have reſpect to the very expreſs words, and upon thoſe they build the ſenſe. 3. It ſuppoſes that becauſe G. F. has a leſs eſteem of the Scriptures than other men have, therefore he may ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly do that to the Scriptures, which will render other men Pervertors and Corruptors of them. 4. It ſuppoſes that which is falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That Profeſſors hold the proſent English Transſlation to be unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61239:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>for G.F. chargeth them with perverting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for altering it to the very ſame ſenſe, as both he and they muſt acknowledge. 5. G. F. chargeth the Tranſlators with corrupting Scripture, for rendering it ſo as <hi>W. P.</hi> confeſſeth to be the ſame with the rendring that G. F. would have, as I ſhew'd upon <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. 6. It ſeems by this arguing, that when G. F. calls upon other Chriſtians to come forth and be tryed by the Scriptures, we muſt underſtand, not the form of found words contained in the Scriptures, but his interpretation of Scripture: But they, poor Men! <note place="margin">Divinity of Chriſt Pref.</note> muſt be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nay, commanded to give him plain Scripture, printed Scripture, Chapter and Verſe. What? though G. F. his words are to W. P. of equal, yea, greater authority than the Scriptures, (as proceeding freſh and new from the holy Spirit, but theſe have paſs'd through many foul hands); muſt they therefore be ſo to other men, that do not acknowledge him led by that Spirit? When the truth of any matter in queſtion is to be tryed by a written Teſtimony, and that writing may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; he that ſhall then, inſtead of the determinate words of that Teſtimony, produce other words to the prejudice of his Neighbours cauſe, ſhall be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted forger and lyar. And I nothing doubt, but that G. F. if he had dealt ſo with other writings of civil concern, as he has done with the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, would by this time have loſt his ears. And it would not have excus'd him in ſuch a change, to have urged that his own knowledge and teſtimony were of greater cortainty and vilidity, than the words of that written Teſtimony, foraſmuch as Party concern'd acknowledg'd no ſuch matter. 7. G. F.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61239:19"/>in accuſing Profeſſons of perverting Scripture in the Inſtances cited, follows his own Judgment and Principle, and not theirs; for the makes it an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Quakers</hi> their being <hi>ſent of God, becauſe they ſpeak of Scripture right as it is,</hi> but Profeſſors the contrary; and tells them, <hi>they run into all abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities that give their meanings to Scripture.</hi> Laſtly, ſuch is the unhappineſs of <hi>W. P</hi>'s undertaking in this matter, that almoſt all his reaſonings and ſcornings too againſt me, in vindication of G. F. turn directly to his condemnation: For becauſe Prefeſſons do not acknowledge any other common Rule of Faith but the Scriptures, it was neceſſary therefore for G. F. to confute them by expreſs Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially in that he had undertaken ſo to do, and dar'd them to go to a tryal at than Tribunal. See the Epiſtle to his <hi>Myſtery.</hi> I have been long in the anſwer of this Allegation, becauſe it ſeems to be the only thing of weight in his whole Book; but you ſee how it diſſerves him.</p>
            <p>Having now ſeen my Argument againſt G. F. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd and improv'd with much bitterneſs by W. P. under pretence of vindicating him, I might here fairly conclude; but having added to my Argument (in my Epiſtle) that he had not only done to ſame, or the like to that which he condemn'd in other, but much more, and that which was really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemnable, and urg'd my Inſtances to prove that alſo, it may perhaps be ſit for me to ſay ſomething in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of them, or some of them, from <hi>W. P.</hi>'s exceptions: Though indeed, if the Reader would but take the pains to compare my Epiſtle with his Anſwer, and what I have here already written, I might well ſpare mine and his further labour in this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61239:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>Matter. But becauſe every Reader may not have opportunity ſo to do, I will proceed.</p>
            <p>The firſt inſtance I have ſpoken to already.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Inſtance is form <hi>John</hi> 1.7 where G. F. applies that to the <hi>Light,</hi> which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of the Baptiſt, <hi>vis. That all men through him might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> Which taken, as it is ſpoken, proves, that the preaching of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> was a means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all men to believe, and conſequently that the true <hi>Light</hi> may light every man by the fooliſhneſs of preaching or outward means; which is contrary to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine of the Light, and is avoided by his perverting the Text.</p>
            <p>The third Inſt. in from 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to [give] the Light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> G. F. hath it thus; <hi>When as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid that the Light which ſhined in their hearts, to give the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 1. He puts <hi>the light</hi> inſted of <hi>God.</hi> 2. He leaves out <hi>Light</hi> immediately before <hi>of the knowledge.</hi> 3. The whole Sentence is non-ſenſe; and notwithſtanding all this, <hi>W. P.</hi> has the face to tell his Reader, <hi>He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes an arrant lie upon our very ſenſes,</hi> and call me, <hi>wretched Scribler! How idle? How frivolous, &amp;c.</hi> The error that's couch'd here, is. 1. That God and Chriſt the Light are not diſtinct, but all one. 2. That by Light here is not meant Knowledge. 3. That this Light is not an effect of Creation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Inſt. from <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. where <hi>G. F.</hi> reads <hi>them</hi> for <hi>him,</hi> and ſo takes away from us a proof, that the New Man there ſpoken of, is created. <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaith, in his defence, <hi>If he did put Them for Himit is not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61239:20"/>falſe;</hi> but if we, in common diſcourſe, ſay <hi>you</hi> for <hi>thou,</hi> he'l ſay it's falſe.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>G. F.</hi> puts <hi>Conſcience</hi> for <hi>Thoughts,</hi> becauſe Conſcience was more eaſily drawn to ſignifie the <hi>uncreated Light in every man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) <hi>John</hi> 7.38. There he puts <hi>Chriſt's helly</hi> for the <hi>Believers belly,</hi> to countenance the foreſaid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="7">(7.) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. G. F. applies that to the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Word,</hi> which is plainly ſpoken of <hi>the Apoſtles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 119.</note> And W. P. <hi>that he may be true to his way,</hi> of abuſing me falſly, ſaith, I undertake to prove him to be an Impoſtor, for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the before <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which the Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not. Did ever man make leſs conſcience of what he wrote?</p>
            <p n="8">(8.) <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23. Putting <hi>was</hi> for <hi>is,</hi> to prove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preaching without outward. I have ſpoken of it before.</p>
            <p n="9">(9.) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Within you</hi> for <hi>in you,</hi> to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance (as he ſuppoſes) their Doctrine of God's <hi>immediate Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">(10.) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. G.F. ſaith, The Scripture ſaid, <hi>The Letter was dead and did not give Life. W. P.</hi> blames me for referring theſe words to this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (which is the neareſt I can find) but he finds no Scripture nearer, to which to reſen it. How cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious he is! <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Letter <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>illeth,</hi> (ſpeaking of the firſt Covenant, as <hi>W. P.</hi> confeſſeth) but <hi>G. F.</hi> intends, that the outward diſpenſation of the New Covenant in the Scriptures is dead. An Opinion that has done no ſmall miſchief in the World.</p>
            <p n="11">(11.) I have charged <hi>G. F.</hi> that twenty times or more (as I ſuppoſe) he denies that the Scripture is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61239:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>called <hi>Word,</hi> but ſaith, it is called <hi>a Treatiſe,</hi> Acts 1.1. And yet that word there rendred <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> is the ſame which is rendred <hi>Word,</hi> when applyed to Chriſt: But <hi>W. P.</hi> to help at a dead lift, ſaith, <hi>G. F.</hi> intended, <hi>The Word of God by way of excellency:</hi> Which of <hi>G. F.</hi> his Adverſaries did ever affirm it was?</p>
            <p n="12">(12.) But <hi>W. P.</hi> can deſend him in any thing, even when he obtrudes upon his Reader the groſſeſt abſurdity inſtead of Scripture, and will not have it to be any more than a trivial Objection againſt his infallible Prophet, when he ſaith, <hi>And ſo to the Word Chriſt Jeſus, Him by whom the World was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is was made.</hi> This <hi>G. F.</hi> puts in a Scripture Letter, and this he repeats in his Book at leaſt ſeven times without any variation; the eighth time he has it thus, <hi>By which the World was made before it was made.</hi> It's evident enough he has reſpect to <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Without him was not any thing made that was made.</hi> What ſaith his Chamption now? <hi>But is there no allowance to be had for curt Expreſſions, eſeapos of the Pen, overſight in Compoſitors, and Errors in the Preſs?</hi> What! eight times after the ſame manner? Where was <hi>W. P.</hi>'s Conſcience? But <hi>can be not make ſenſe of it?</hi> Yes, yes: <hi>Suppoſe a Comma at the firſt</hi> made, <hi>where</hi> and <hi>being underſtood, explaineth the ſenſe, was maketh it more clear:</hi> That's one way. Again, Take the middle Clauſe and put in laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchanging <hi>the World</hi> and <hi>it,</hi> thus: <hi>And ſo to the Word Chriſt Jeſus, before the World was made, him by whom it was made.</hi> All this ſtir is to make it ſenſe, (as for Scripturee, 'tis ſuch as God's infallible Spirit in <hi>G. F.</hi> wirtes) And may not a man at this rate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the groffeſt non-ſenſe that ever was writ? Go
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61239:21"/>thy wayes for an admirable Advocate! Once more let me ask the Reader what he thinks of the honeſty of <hi>W. P.</hi> and whether he will excuſe me hence-forward, if I mingle any more Diſcourſe with him? It may benefit ſome or other, therefore I will yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a little further.</p>
            <p n="13">(13.) Who can read <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. and not perceive that by <hi>the word very night unto them in their mouth and in their heart,</hi> is meant, the Word written? And yet <hi>G. F.</hi> would have it to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward immediate Word, and therefore <hi>in thy mouth,</hi> muſt be left out as not well agreeing with that <hi>notion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">(14.) It's for the ſake of that Notion, that <hi>the Power of God</hi> is ſaid by him to be <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> and <hi>the Goſpel the Power of God,</hi> as if they were convertible terms; whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes only, That the Goſpel <hi>is the Power of God</hi> (not ſimply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely but in a certain reſpect) <hi>to Salvation to every one that believeth:</hi> This I expreſs't fully in my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but <hi>W. P.</hi> would not ſee it, but cries out, <hi>Groſs folly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="15">(15.) Next you muſt know that the <hi>Quakers</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the thought of Chriſt's having the Eſſence of a man in any place remote from their own dear hearts, and therefore when G. F. cites that Scripture, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.5, 6. He muſt leave out of the very heart of the Text, <hi>He is not here:</hi> And W. P. will have it very aptly uſed to expreſs the Myſtical Reſurrection: but ſtill <hi>he is not here</hi> muſt be out, for that doth not quadrate with their fancy.</p>
            <p n="16">(16.) And G. F. cites that Text (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.30.) defectively, to prove Chriſt not abſent from his Church, and W. P. avows it. Indeed G. F. ſayes,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61239:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>He is deceiced, who ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is diſtinct from the Saints,</hi> Myſt. p. 16.</p>
            <p n="17">(17.) But upon that Text, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.21. W. P. gives my chief exception a go-by, takes no notice of <hi>G. F</hi>'s changing, <hi>The Kingdom of God into plain Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> But if he had, he abhors to think <hi>that Heaven is a viſible place to be liv'd in, bearing ſome reſemblance to this viſible World,</hi> p. 12.</p>
            <p n="18">(18.) <hi>Amos</hi> 3.13. There G. F's applying that to Chriſt, which is ſpoken of the Lord God, favours their Doctrine of no diſtinction between God and Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, and W. P. defends it on that account.</p>
            <p n="19">(19.) The like may be ſaid of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. where W. P. according to his uſual candour, tells me of <hi>Col.</hi> 3.11. but takes no notice of G. F. his citing Chapter and Verſe, which he is not wont to do.</p>
            <p n="20">(20.) Joh. 1.1. <hi>God is the Word,</hi> is defended by the ſame perverſe Doctrine.</p>
            <p n="21">(21.) So is his adding <hi>He</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>the Father,</hi> Joh. 10.29.</p>
            <p n="22">(22.) His palpable diminiſhing from <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. hath the ſame tendency, and W. P. owns it. G. F. in his own Cauſe, would have exclaimed here, as he doth upon the Miniſters of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">(23.) W. P. talks of <hi>Brazen</hi>—but I wonder with what face he could give ſuch anſwer to <hi>John</hi> 15.25. which if it be not (as G. F. cites it) an addition to Scripture, I never ſaw one, nor ever ſhall. What? call for plain Scripture from another, and at the ſame inſtant urge Scripture with addition himſelf! He thinks if he can but make G. F. ſpeak ſenſe, and truth in his Opinion, he has done enough. He may
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61239:22"/>as well ſay, all G. F.'s Book is Scripture, for he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves it all as infallible as Scripture, as if there were no difference between a Quotation, and a Comment or Expoſition. But G. F. has ſaid it, <hi>Chriſt is not diſtinct from the Father:</hi> That's enough for W. P. though it ſubvert the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="24">(24.) The like ground there is for inſerting <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1. which I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p n="25">(25.) And for putting <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Lord,</hi> Rom. 14.9.</p>
            <p n="26">(26.) And ſo he would confound <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> by putting the one for the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 14. And why did not W. P. anſwer what I urg'd, rather then paſs it by, and call me <hi>Buſy-body,</hi> which is very eaſie.</p>
            <p n="27">(27.) Add to theſe <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>John</hi> 17.5. (which I am about to ſpeak) and we have 11 Texts abuſed to ſerve that goodly Doctrine of the Father, Son, and Spirit, their not being diſtinct but all one: A very trivial Matter that doth but ſubvert the Faith of Chriſt, and introduce another Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="28">(28.) When G. F. ſayes, This is Scripture, If we find it not there, we muſt ſay, He is miſtaken, and then he is fallible. If he give us the ſenſe of Scripture in other words, and obtrude them for Scripture, he corrects the Scripture inſtead of citing it. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> But G. F. <hi>Chriſt who was glorified with the Father before the World began.</hi> W. P. cries out, <hi>Sottiſh Ignorance and Enmity with a witneſs: Did ever Chriſt of his Apoſtles, or any ſober man living, chide or reprove a perſon, if
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61239:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>he did leave out or put in, or change a word, not in the leaſt perverting the ſenſe?</hi> Yes, G. F. doth it, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing <hi>ye,</hi> where it muſt be underſtood. It ſeems then G. F. is no ſober man in W. P's account; and if ſo, I know not how he ſhould be a true Prophet. But I have ſhew'd in my Epiſtle, that he perverts the ſenſe, and that the Phraſe is to be underſtood of the glory which Jeſus had, not in poſſeſſion, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree with the Father, before the World was. Here Mr. <hi>P.</hi> cries out lamentably, <hi>That ever any man ſhould undertake to correct others in that which doth not deſerve it, whilſt the beam is in his own eye, and is himſelf moſt guilty!</hi> This is like the reſt, ſutable to the honeſty of Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that he ſhould compare an Expoſition of Scripture with a quotation of it. <note place="margin">He chargeth me (<hi>p.</hi> 61.) with driving at <hi>the Dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigating Chriſt of all right to eternal Divinity!</hi> This is learned non ſenſe; <hi>G. F</hi>'s ſpirit could never ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate him to ſuch a degree of Jargon: Beſides, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he can produce ſome Author for it, (which I am perſwaded he cannot) I ſhall conclude him the firſt that ever us'd the word <hi>diveſtigate,</hi> or <hi>diveſtigare,</hi> in any ſenſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</note> And becauſe the chief artifice of his Book, is to render me odious and deteſtable under the name of <hi>Socinian, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grel-Socinian, Bidlean,</hi> and the like, and for that takes no ſmall occaſion from my expoſition of this Text; I ſhall ſhew, 1. that two great Authors, no <hi>Socinians,</hi> are of the ſame mind. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> upon thoſe words, <hi>The glory which, I had,</hi> adds, <hi>Deſtinatione tua, in thy Decree.</hi> Augſtinus, <hi>Et nuno clarifica me,</hi> And now glorifie me: <hi>Hoe eſt ſient unno, it a &amp; nuno; ſient tune praedeſtinatione, ſie &amp; nuno perfectione, That it, us then, ſo alſo now, as then in Predeſtination, ſo alſo now in Perfection.</hi> Secondly, I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61239:23"/>ſhall declare the Opinion of the Leading <hi>Quakers</hi> concerning the Eſſence or Beeing of our Lord and Mediator Jeſus Chriſt, ſo far as the equivocation of their Writings will permit. And it was as much as all the reputation of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is worth to be plain in this point, therefore we muſt not expect it from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Then for the God-head or Divinity of Chriſt, in the confeſſion whereof Mr. P. and <hi>G. W.</hi> do ſo much glory and boaſt; Mr. <hi>P.</hi> in his <hi>Sandy Foundation,</hi> hath brought many Texts of Scripture, and five Arguments from right Reaſon, <note place="margin">Though the word <hi>One</hi> is not in the Hebrew in ſome Texes, where he ſo confidently puts an Emphaſis.</note> to prove that <hi>God is the Holy ONE, not it Holy THERE: that ONE is God, and God only is that Holy ONE:</hi> He rejects there that <hi>impertinent diſtinction, that he [God] is ONE in Subſtance, but THREE in Perſons or Subſiſtencies. G. Whitehead</hi> defends this Poſition of W. P. in his Book called, <hi>The Divinity of Chriſt,</hi> where in the Name of the <hi>Quakers</hi> he confeſſeth, <q>That there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, and that theſe Three are One, both in Divinity, Divine Subſtance, and Eſſence, not three Gods, nor ſeperate Beeings. <hi>That they are called by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Names in Scripture, as manifeſt to and in the Saints,</hi> —and are— <hi>One infinite Wiſdom, One Power, One Love, one Light and Life, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I ſhould have given G. F. the preheminence, for I believe he is the Author of this Opinion among the <hi>Quakers;</hi> he ſaith (<hi>Myst.</hi> p. 142.) <hi>Chriſt is not diſtinct from the Father;</hi> and p. 199. they are not <hi>only One,</hi> but <hi>all One.</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61239:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>Hence it is manifeſt, 1. that when they ſay, <hi>Chriſt is God,</hi> they mean nothing by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> neither Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance nor Eſſence, Perſon nor Subſiſtent, (eſpecially in the ſenſe of their Adverſaries) Wiſdom or Power, Light or Life, or any thing elſe that is really diſtinct from that which the Jews mean by <hi>the God of Iſrael,</hi> or the Mahometans by <hi>one God.</hi> He that believes leſs, muſt be an Atheiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Propoſitions, <hi>Chriſt is God,</hi> and <hi>the Father is God,</hi> are of the very ſame import and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, even as to ſay, W. P. is a Man, or, The Author of <hi>the Sandy Foundation</hi> is a Man. So that (reſpecting the time before Jeſus was born) the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, or Chriſt, did as much ſignifie one and the ſame intelligent and happy Perſon or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis, as <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtle of the Gentiles, the ſame individual Man or Perſon. And this is that Opinion which Eccleſiaſtical Writers attribute to <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and they that maintain it, are called by them <hi>Sabellians.</hi> The conſequence whereof is that, the Son of God, or Chriſt as God, was at that time nothing but another Name of God or the Father, and had no more Life, Knowledge, Power or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty diſtinct from the Life, Knowledge. Power or Properties of God, or the Father, than he that is not, has from him that is. And ſo all that the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> contend for, (when they ſeem ſo zealous for the Divinity of Chriſt) is nothing in the World, (beſide their own glory, and the diſparagement of their Adverſaries) ſave that God, or the Father, was or might be in thoſe dayes called, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or <hi>the Light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus much touching the Divinity of Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Leading <hi>Quakers.</hi> Now for his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61239:24"/>or his being a Man. And we ſhall find, that what-ever W. P. talks of Chriſt, <hi>as Man,</hi> and <hi>as God,</hi> yet that he equivocates and deludes his Reader, believing no ſuch thing as Chriſt his being a Man, or elſe he diſſents from his Brethren, which I ſuppoſe he will not own.</p>
            <p n="1">1. G. F. (for it's fit he ſhould lead) doth in an inſulting manner crow over his Antagoniſts, for uſing the word <hi>Humane,</hi> when they ſpeak of the Nature of Chriſt, (ſee my Epiſtle, <hi>p.</hi> 37.) <hi>Where doth the Scripture</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſpeak of Humane? the word Humane?</hi> In his Epiſtle before <hi>the Divinity of Chriſt. Is God a Man? No, he is a Spirit. — Is the Holy Ghoſt a Man? It is called the Holy Spirit; and Chriſt was a Man, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If G. F. believed Chriſt to be now a man, why did he not retain the Preſent Tenſe <hi>is,</hi> but change it into <hi>was,</hi> very roughly? But that which we find in the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of that Epiſtle, will put the matter out of queſtion, where that Author, out of Scripture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines a perſon to be — <hi>a Man or Woman; ſometime the Body, the Face, or viſible appearance of either:</hi> He cites many Texts out of the Old Teſtament, for that uſe of the word Perſon, and ſaith, that in the New it <hi>is mentioned with the ſame acceptation as before in the Old. As for inſtance,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Thou regardeſt not the</hi> Perſon <hi>of Men,</hi> Mat. 22.16. Mark 12.14. Luk. 20.21. <hi>In the Greek it is</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>faciem hominum, the face of men;</hi> (he cites <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Jud.</hi> 16. where the ſame word is rendred <hi>Perſon</hi>) and concludes, <hi>That the word</hi> Perſons <hi>is attributed to men.</hi> How now? If Chriſt is a Man, and a Man is a Perſon, will not Chriſt be then a Perſon? No ſuch matter, according
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61239:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>to theſe mens Logick; for immediately he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to vindicate the Greek Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. from being tranſlated <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> and ſayes, it is tranſlated <hi>face of Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>ſight of Chriſt;</hi> and our Poly-glottiſt W. P. ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 11. <hi>Chriſts Perſon is (ſtrictly conſidered) an unſcriptural expreſſion,</hi> and will needs make me <hi>manifeſtly guilty</hi> of perverting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for uſing it. <note place="margin">Yet eight lines after, himſelf confounds and abuſes Scripture, <hi>Heb. 2.16.</hi> with <hi>Rom. 4.5.</hi>
               </note> But what weight there is in his friends anſwer to that Text I ſee not; for if a Perſon be <hi>a Man,</hi> or <hi>the face of a Man</hi> (as he defines it); then if Chriſt be a Man, he will be a Perſon, and his face will be the face of a Perſon: And if Chriſt be not a Perſon, then he is not a Man; for the definition of a thing, and the thing defined, are convertible. But that they do abſolutely deny Chriſt to be a Perſon or Man, I prove further, out of G. W's Book, <hi>Chriſt Aſcended,</hi> p. 24. <q>This manner (ſaith he) of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding God's right hand, and Chriſt to a limitation out of his People in a <hi>perſonal Beeing,</hi> (which are no Scripture terms) ſtill implies him to be a <hi>perſonal God or Chriſt;</hi> like the Anthropomorphites and Muggletonians conceits of his.</q> Where note, that he doth with equal contempt, reject a perſonal Chriſt as a perſonal God, and ſo Chriſt is no more a Perſon that God, and conſequently no more a Man, for they deny God to be a Perſon.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>Is the Eſſence or Beeing of the Son of God perſonal?</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 37. He challengeth his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, ſaying. <hi>What rule in Scripture haſt thou for theſe words, [viſible God, viſible Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.] And a little below, <hi>Thou like the old heretical Egyptian Monks,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61239:25"/>(the Anthropomorphites, and late Muggletonians)</hi> art relling of a <hi>viſible God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt remote, not in any.</hi> Behold here what an abominable thought it is to this man, and <hi>the Family of Light, called Quakers,</hi> (that's his phraſe) that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be like a Man, viſible, or in any place remote from Men and Women that live here upon Earth; and if he be not, then it's certain he is not a Man; for a Man being in his Subſtance, Body, as well as Spirit, and finite, cannot be in moe than one place at the ſame time. And Mr. <hi>P.</hi> talks at the ſame rate (with G. W.) P. 12. Sect. 6. where he argues thus, <hi>If Gods, preſence make the Heaven, as we have been alwayes taught, and all have believed and confeſt;</hi> [let every Reader judge whether he ſay true or falſe.] Do not all Chriſtians in the World (except a few) believe and confeſs that Heaven is a certain place, (diſtinct from Earth) into which Chriſt aſcended, when a Cloud received him out of their (the Apoſtles) ſight, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9.] <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſince God vouchſafes to Temple and Tabernacle in men, it follows, that his Heaven is there alſo.</hi> And ſo the Man Chriſt Jeſus ſits at Gods right hand in Heaven, when W. P. ſits at G. F's right hand, for God Tabernacles in G. F. and hath his Heaven there, and Chriſt is in W. P. or elſe there's no ſuch thing as Chriſt's being a Man. Here W. P. derides and abominates their Faith, who believe, <hi>That Heaven is a viſible place to be liv'd in,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But we will return again to G. W's <hi>Chriſt Aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> p. 18.— <hi>Except you eat my Fleſh, and drink my Blood, you have no Life in you, ſaith Chriſt,— So neither is Chriſt, our Gods right hand, ſo limited 20 a remoteneſs from them</hi> [the Saints.] Is ſeems
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61239:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>that Jeſus Chriſt is no otherwiſe in Heaven, then he is in the Saints, when they eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood. And indeed <hi>J. Newman</hi>'s deſign was from what appears in <hi>G. W</hi>'s Book to aſſert, That the Man Jeſus our Lord, although he is the Eternal God, has in Heaven, a place remote from Earth, an Humane Body, which is not ſubſtantially in any Man, nor in any place, but in that which all men call Heaven. To this <hi>G. W.</hi> oppoſeth himſelf, and ſaith, p. 21. <hi>Doth not this oppoſe the Infiniteneſs and Omnipreſence of God and Jeſus Chriſt, and bring them under the limitation of finite Creatures.</hi> So that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt (according to him, has no other Body of a Man, than what is as Infinite and Omnipreſent as God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Next we will ſee what <hi>Iſaac Pennigton</hi> (another famous man) ſaith to this Point; in his Book inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>A Queſtion,</hi> &amp;c. p. 33.— <hi>The Scriptures do expreſly diſtinguiſh between Chriſt and the Garment which he wore; between him that came, and the Body in which he came.</hi> So then Chriſt's Body, by which he means the whole Manhood, was but Chriſt's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>A little farther he ſaith, <hi>This we certainly know, and can never call the bodily Garment</hi> Chriſt, <hi>but that which appeared and dwelt in the body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this agrees our Author <hi>W. P.</hi> (p. 11.) <hi>We dare not ſay, That the intire Chriſt was that viſible Body that was crucified at Jeruſalem.</hi> What was then? <hi>J. Pennington</hi> will tell us in his next words; <hi>Now if ye</hi> (Profeſſors) <hi>indeed know the Chriſt of God, tell us plainly what that is which appeared in the Body? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was not the Chriſt before it took up the Body, after it took up the Body, and for ever?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:61239:26"/>
            <p>Here it's manifeſt, that by <hi>Chriſt</hi> he underſtands nothing of Manhood, Body nor Soul, but only that which was before Jeſus was born, and the ſame is ſtill the Chriſt, his Body or Manhood was only his Garment, which he took up and laid down. And <hi>G. W.</hi> uſeth the word <hi>Manhood;</hi> p. 14. <hi>He took upon him the Manhood in time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I may appeal to my Reader, whether I have not clearly prov'd (as far as the nature of the thing will bear) that the Leading <hi>Quakers</hi> do not believe that Jeſus Chriſt is a man: I ſay, as the nature of the thing will bear, becauſe if they ſhould in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Syllables deny it, (though I have had it ſo from ſome of their mouths) they muſt contradict expreſs Scripture, whcih often calls Chriſt a Man, even ſince his Reſurrection; and that would deſtroy their reputation among thoſe that reverence the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. But how they can, by an unparallel'd equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vecation, both confeſs him in Scripture to be a Man, and at the ſame time, in Heart, and in their Books, deny him, I ſhall now ſhew you, out of the Books of <hi>Iſaac Pennington,</hi> and <hi>G. Fox</hi> a forenamed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I. P.</hi> p. 20. <hi>For that which he</hi> (Chriſt) <hi>took upon him was our Garment, even the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature, which is of an carthly periſhing Nature; but he is of an eternal Nature, and his Fleſh, and Blood; and Bones, are of his Nature.</hi> Here obſerve, that the Fleſh and Blood of our Nature, that is, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood which he took upon him, was a Garment, and ſo no part of his Nature; but he had Fleſh, and Blood, and Bones too before that time; which Fleſh, Blood, and Bones, were of an Eternal Nature, that is to ſay, God; for I know nothing elſe that was of an Eternal Nature.</p>
            <pb n="51" facs="tcp:61239:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Here Chriſt is denyed to be by Nature a Man, and yet by his Eternal Nature to have Fleſh, Blood, and Bones. Now if any man in the World can ſhew me a groſſer piece of equivocation than this, I will acknowledge my ſelf a very ignorant Perſon: To ſpeak of the Fleſh, Blood, and Bones of a Man, and to intend nothing of the Nature of Man, but only of God. Has <hi>Muggleton,</hi> or the Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phites of <hi>Egypt</hi> (whom they ſo often call upon) ſaid any thing of ſo groſs a nature as this, if it be taken properly? and if it muſt be taken improperly, what horrid deceit and equivocation?</p>
            <p>But it were a diſparagement to <hi>G. F.</hi> that <hi>I. P.</hi> ſhould have a Notion that was not firſt revealed to <hi>G. F.</hi> Therefore we find that long before, <hi>G. F.</hi> had ſaid in his <hi>Mystery,</hi> p. 68.— <hi>And is not Chriſt in Man? And doth not Chriſt ſay, they muſt eat his Fleſh? And ſo if they muſt eat his Fleſh, Is not his Fleſh in them? — And how can ye call him Chriſt in Man, without the Man he there? I. P</hi>'s words may be the expoſition of theſe, and tell us, that by <hi>Man,</hi> G. F. means the Eternal God, and by the Fleſh which men eat, and whcih is in them, he means the Fleſh, Blood, and Bones of the Eternal God. Who can read theſe things without horror? Now let me put two or three Queries to my Reader, which he may reſolve from theſe Premiſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> Firſt, Of what uſe is or can the Scripture be to theſe men, who do thus confound Heaven and Earth, God and Man, Fleſh and Spirit, Man's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and God's Nature, Eternity and Time, that they will underſtand the one, when the other is named and plainly ſpoken of? And for ſo doing, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the guidance of God's infallible Spirit? And
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61239:27"/>
               <hi>W. P.</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 38. 'Tis their Principle, <hi>That the Eternal Spirit,</hi> (their Guide and Rule) <hi>who in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations hath revealed a great part</hi> [it ſeems, not al <hi>of the things contained in the Scriptures to be ſuperior to thoſe Writings;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Non-ſenſe as was obſerved before.</note> and below that, <hi>The Scripture is much like the ſhadow of the true Rule.</hi> I ſay, of what uſe can this ſhadow of a Rule be to theſe Perſons?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether I did not take the moſt proper way of dealing with theſe men in my Epiſtle, ſhewing to their ſenſes, that <hi>G. F.</hi> in his Miniſtry had aſſerted for Written and Spoken, that which is not Written nor Spoken?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether any ingenuous man could expreſs a charge more modeſtly than I did, when I ſaid,— <hi>You ſeem at leaſt to deny his Perſon,</hi> ſeeing I have now, and could then have prov'd, that they not only ſeem to deny Chriſt's Perſon, but do effectually deny it, both in the ſenſe of their Adverſaries, and in their own ſenſe of that word?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> be not either a very weak man, or was not in a great rage, or both, that he ſhould write ſuch a Book as this I have in hand, when he might know before what I could produce againſt them? For he might caſtly imagine that I could have recourſe to that Chriſtian Letter, wherein theſe things had been repreſented to him; which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived above twelve months agoe, and takes no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether he will impute it to Mr. P's want of all honeſtly and good Conſcience, or to a tranſport of Paſſion and Revenge, that he makes ſuch hideous out-cries of Sacriledges and Ingratitude toward
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61239:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>Chriſt Jeſus, againſt thoſe he calls <hi>Mongrel-Socinians,</hi> becauſe they will not own that God was called <hi>Chriſt</hi> before Jeſus was born; and in the mean time him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to deny whatſoever of Eſſence, Subſtance, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Power, Life or Happineſs is attributable to Jeſus, as he is the Mediator between God and Men?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Whether the Reader will not freely give me, himſelf and all other Chriſtians, a <hi>Superſedeas</hi> or Diſpenſation from ever writing or ſpeaking any more about matters of Religion to ſuch men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Concluſion, when their ſenſes evidence all the Premiſes; that condemn that falſity in other men, which they excuſe in themſelves; that palpably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie other men, to get glory to themſelves; that deny Chriſt totally under his name and pretence of Zeal for his Divinity; finally, that are ſuch notorious Equivocators as I have manifeſtly prov'd theſe men to be?</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe Mr. P. has made it his great ſtudy to render me &amp; conſequently what I have ſaid (thought 'tis inconſequent enough) odious &amp; deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, under the name of <hi>Socinian, Bidlean,</hi> and the like, although I wrote nothing but what was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by men of learning and piety, and ſtrangers to me, and (for ought I know) to all my Friends: I will therefore preſent to the Reader a ſhort account of theſe mens opinion concerning, Chriſt, who for diſtinction ſake call themſelves <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> being ſo called in thoſe places, where by the Laws of the Countrey they have equal liberty of Religion with other men, or becauſe they own but one Perſon, and one Subſtance or Eſſence of the moſt High and Independent God, and to diſtinguiſh them from
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61239:28"/>other Chriſtians that hold Three Perſons, and one Eſſence of God, and are therefore denominated <hi>Trinitarians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay therefore, that they are very zealous Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Unity of God, and that is the reaſon (as they ſolemnly profeſs) why they cannot allow of three Perſons in the God-head, becauſe they think it deſtroys his Unity or Oneneſs; and I have ſhew'd that the <hi>Quakers (W. P.</hi> eſpecially) do alſo diſallow them. Notwithſtanding the <hi>Quakers,</hi> according to their equivocating manner, can call God the Father by the Name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the other cannot. I know not that they differ in one tittle more concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one God.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> willingly and heartily acknowledge, that he was fore-ordain'd before the foundation of the World, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. that he was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt upon her, and the power of the moſt High overſhadowing her, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. and therefore he is called <hi>[IS]</hi> the Son of God; likewiſe that he, and no Man but he, aſcended into Heaven, and deſcended thence, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. being ſanctified and ſent into the World, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which he came, not to do his own Will, but the Will of him that ſent him, <hi>John</hi> 6.30. that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this miſſion and ſanctification, he did, whilſt he was here upon Earth, deſervedly challenge the Name of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Son of God,</hi> John 10.34, 35, 36. in a far more excellent ſenſe than either the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates among the Jews, that were called gods, and Sons of the moſt High, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.1, 6. Or <hi>Moſes,</hi> who was God to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod 7, 8, and alſo to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61239:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> Exod. 4.16. Heb. or than any Angel, who in the Diſpenſation of the Law, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent God, and was therefore called by his Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.35. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. ſee <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.22. And that as there was but one God then, ſo there is but one God now, notwithſtanding that Jeſus is <hi>God over all.</hi> Unto which glorious and ſupream Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, next to the moſt high God himſelf, Jeſus did attain, by doing the Will of God fully and perfectly on Earth, the perfection of which obedience: was, that <hi>being,</hi> as is ſaid, <hi>in the form of God, he thought it not robbery</hi> [or a prey] <hi>to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Death, even the death of the Croſs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name, which is above every Name; that at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould how, — and that every tongue ſhould confeſs that Jeſus is</hi> Lord, <hi>to the glory of God the Father,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>That God hath made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye</hi> [the Jews] <hi>have cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, both Lord and Chriſt,</hi> Acts 2.36. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour,</hi> Acts 5.31. <hi>God raiſed him ſeem the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand, in the heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, far above all principality and power,</hi> &amp;c. For by God's exalting Jeſus, and ſetting him at his right hand, they underſtand that the ſame Man Jeſus, that was crucified and raiſed from the dead, was alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the ſight of the Apoſtles into Heaven, a Cloud receiving him out of their ſight, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9. And that he is there, having not now a Body of Fleſh and Blood, (for <hi>fleſh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.50.) but an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſpiritual, incorruptible and glorious body of a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61239:29"/>Man, the like whereof all Saints ſhall have in the Reſurrection, when this Man Jeſus ſhall deſcend from Heaven to judge the World; that in the mean time he ſits at God's right hand, that is, he has all power in Heaven and Earth committed to him, and reigns over Men and Angels, as will appear by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Father hath <hi>committed all judgment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Son; that all men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.23. Therefore they worſhip Chriſt, and call upon him as their Lord, their King, their great High-Prieſt, their God, that ſearcheth their hearts, and is perfectly able to ſave them that come unto God by him. And they ſay, it's no wonder, that they honour Chriſt as God, whilſt they acknowledge God his Father to be above him, foraſmuch as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth the ſame, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8, 9.) ſaying, <hi>But unto the Son, he ſaith, Thy Throne, O God, is forever and ever,— Thou haſt loved Righteouſneſs, and hated Iniquity: Therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellaws.</hi> Finally, <hi>When all things ſhall be ſubdued under him</hi> [this Man Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus], <hi>then ſhall the Son alſo himſelf be ſubject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28.</p>
            <p>Now I know not any thing of all that I have ſaid concerning the Manhood, Reſurrection, and Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Jeſus, wherein the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> do not agree. The only Point in difference between them is this; Whether this Dominion, Power and Glory, which are conferred upon the Man Jeſus, be conferred upon him, by aſſuming him into a perſonal Union with God, ſo that the Man
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61239:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>and a Perſon of God make one individual Perſon; or whether they be conferred upon him, by God's communicating to him ſuch a Supernatural and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power, as he never communicated, nor ever will, to any Man or Angel, and greater than which God himſelf cannot beſtow. The firſt the <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> hold, the latter the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> Herein they both agree, That the Man Jeſus is really inveſted with this Power. But for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I have ſhew'd, that they really deny this Perſon, this Man Jeſus, and conſequently all that power and glory which he is inveſted with. So that all that they talk of him, and all their contention for him is meer equivocation. The Man Jeſus, the Mediator between God and Men, is, according to them, ſo far from being our King, our Lord and God, our High-Prieſt and Interceſſor, and from being in himſelf immortal, moſt happy, and glorious, that he has not ſo much Being as a Bat, I mean, a proper Bat, not one of Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s Bats. So that he that ſhall call Jeſus accurſed, (O horribled) (meaning by <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that perſonal Beeing or Man that was dead, and is now alive in Heaven, a place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from men on Earth) he commits really no greater offence, than he that ſhall call the <hi>man i'th Moon</hi> accurſed; for the one (as they hold) hath as much Beeing as the other. And now let the World judge, whether I did not uſe a ſoft expreſſon, when I ſaid that ſome Doctrines of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> did ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them very diſhonourable and dangerous to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion. If the <hi>Deiſts</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ſhould once get the <hi>Quakers</hi> knack of equivocating, and meaning by Jeſus Chriſt, when they ſpeak of him, nothing but God, then what havock might they make of Chriſtian Religion?</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:61239:30"/>
            <p>I would not be miſtaken, when I charge theſe things upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I mean the Leading Men; for I am ſtill perſwaded there are ſome honeſt-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among them, that neither know this that I have ſaid, to be their Doctrine, nor believe it. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there may be ſome that own it and profeſs, it, that are ſo ſilly, they neither know what they ſay, nor whereof they aſtirm.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I proſeſs ſolemnly, that it is not from any malice, envy or revenge, that I impute theſe things to them; for I do heartily believe their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſuch as I have ſaid; and I hope the Proofs I have quoted out of their Writings, will ſufficiently vindicate me in the eyes of all impartial Readers; and I can eaſily produce more of the ſame kind. See the <hi>Dialogue between a Chriſtian and a Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as I have ſhew'd, that they <hi>do not</hi> believe the Beeing of Jeſus the Mediator, and conſequently none of thoſe Articles of Chriſtian Faith which depend upon his Beeing; ſo it were not very difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that they <hi>cannot</hi> upon their Principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve any of them.</p>
            <p>I will try a little, and for Example, let the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be believed be, <hi>God raiſed up the Lord Jeſus from the dead;</hi> It you bring them Scripture, and univerſal Tradition, to get credit with them, it's all nothing: <hi>G. Keith</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>Immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> p. 35. — <hi>The beſt words uttered from Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, or from any of the Apoſtles or Prophets, and yet recorded in the Scriptures, cannot reveal the Father, nor the Son either.</hi> Again, p. 37. <hi>Outward Revelation or Diſcovery by words ſpoken from without of Chirſt, or any of his Diſciples, or Apoſtles, cannot reveal the Father nor the Son.</hi> It ſeems then
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61239:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>that if Chriſt himſelf (as after his Reſurrection with his Apoſtles) ſhould converſe with us, and preach to us, that God had raiſed him from the dead, and if the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles ſhould bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to what he ſaid, all this could not work in us any true ſaving-Faith of the Propoſition aforeſaid, without an immediate Revelation within; for that's the purport of his Book, the Title whereof is, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelations — not <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> but remaining — of indiſpauſable neceſſity as to the whole Body in general, ſo to every Member thereof, every true Believer in particular.</hi> And <hi>by immediate Revelation,</hi> he tells us, p. 16. <hi>They underſtand not onely immediate ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural influences of the Spirit of God — to aſſiſt and enable or elevate the mind to know and underſtand ſavingly, but alſo ſuch inward influences as are the very immediate Objects of our mind.</hi> Hence he ſaith, p. 40. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of Man to be but vanity,</hi> and his wiſdom fooliſhneſs <hi>and enmity againſt God, even all that wiſdom, which the carnal mind can gather into it ſelf, whether from the Words of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or from the Works of Creation and Providence.</hi> Here by <hi>mans wiſdom</hi> and <hi>carnal mind,</hi> mind, you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him of all wiſdom whatſoever, which comes not by immediate inward Revelation. So p. 59. <hi>All your Scripture, literal, traditional Knowledge and Wiſdom is a burthen unto this</hi> [ſomething] <hi>in you.</hi> And <hi>G. White head</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Chriſt Aſcend.</hi> p. 28.) <hi>That</hi> [Faith] <hi>that is without the divine and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate illumination of the Spirit within, which is no Divine Faith, but mens Knowledge, Faith, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are but Traditional, Literal, and Lifeleſs.</hi> So that if <hi>W. P.</hi> would have told candidly and plainly with us, he ſhould have told us that the infallible
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61239:31"/>Spirit is the immediate Judge, Rule and Guide to men, and ſo that no man can have any true Faith or Religion without its immediate propoſing, by way of Object, unto him, as was done to the Prophets and Apoſtles. Therefore <hi>G. F.</hi> in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his <hi>Myſtery,</hi> (as I hinted before) ſhowing, <hi>the ground of difference between the Prieſts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, and all Sects in theſe Nations, and the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the controverſie on their part is juſt and equal againſt them all, and that they have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe to cry againſt them, and to deny their Miniſtry, their Church, their Worſhip, and their whole Religion, as being not in the Power, and by the Spirit of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi> Compare this with what I have cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and then it plainly appears, that all right <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> in <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s ſenſe have renounced or denyed their Faith, Worſhip and whole Chriſtian Religion, which they had before they were <hi>Quakers,</hi> as being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as ours is) upon Reaſon, Scriptures, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus, and his Apoſtles and Prophets, and Tradition, with an aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating the mind; but not upon immediate objective Revelation, ſuch as the Apoſtles and Prophets had, and ſuch as the <hi>Quakers</hi> now pretend to have. For we, and thoſe that differ from them profeſs thoſe things before mentioned to be the ground of our Faith; they profeſs the laſt of Immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the ground of their Faith and Religion; and deny ours to be Divine Faith or true Religion; Nay, they cry out againſt it as fooliſhneſs and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, literal and lifeleſs.</p>
            <p>So then <hi>W. P.</hi> doth but make a fair flouriſh, when he faith, p. 39. <hi>The Scriptures we own, and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Truth therein contained, we reverence and eſteem
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61239:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>as the Mind and Will of God to men:</hi> For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, according to their Principles, eſteem any ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scripture, be it that <hi>God raiſed up the Lord Jeſus from the dead,</hi> or any other word of any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, or of Chriſt himſelf, I ſay they cannot eſteem it as the Mind and Will of God, except they have an immediate Revelation dictating the ſame unto them: Which if they have, then the Scripture is ſuperfluous to them, and they do no more eſteem it the Mind and Will of God, becauſe it is written in the Bible, than if it had been written in any other Book among Fables and Lies.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, I argue thus: If among the Profeſſors of Religion in theſe Nations, there be thoſe that ſincerely confeſs the Lord Jeſus, and heartily believe that God raiſed him from the dead, upon the grounds forementioned, and not upon the ground of immediate objective Revelation of God's Holy Spirit, then <hi>G. Fox</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> deny, and cry out againſt true Chriſtian Faith and Religion, and conſequently cannot have them.</p>
            <p>Again, If men in general cannot ſavingly believe without hearing a ſent Preacher; then men cannot believe by immediate inward Revelation: and then they that aſſert they can, and do, and deny the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, cannot have ſaving Faith. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is true from <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent from the oppoſition between mediate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18.</p>
            <p>They to whom the preaching of the Croſs is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs, and not the Power of God, cannot have Goſpel-Faith: But to <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſome <hi>Quakers,</hi> the preaching of the Croſs, without immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is fooliſhneſs, and not the Power of God:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61239:32"/>Therefore <hi>G. F. &amp;c.</hi> cannot have Goſpel-Faith.</p>
            <p>Let us proceed now to the other Inſtances of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture abus'd, and ſhow the tendency of it to falſe Doctrine.</p>
            <p>(Inſt. 29.) Next he would vindicate <hi>G. F.</hi> in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the Tranſlators for rendring <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I proteſt by,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.31. ſaying, there is nothing in the Greek for <hi>I proteſt,</hi> and yet Mr. <hi>P.</hi> cannot but grant that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is commonly at leaſt a particle of Swearing; and if but ſo, it follows, that there is ſomething in the Greek that anſwers <hi>I proteſt by;</hi> for ſuppoſing that not to be the ſenſe of the place, which the current of Interpretors ſay is, yet there is that word <hi>there</hi> which will bear ſuch a Tranſlation, there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Greek for <hi>I proteſt,</hi> which <hi>G. F.</hi> denies, and therein impoſes upon his Reader, which is enough for my purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>W. P.</hi> (p. 91) that he may be true to his preſumptuous way of arguing, though he venture the abuſing God and Men, tells us, That <hi>an Oath having been made from the diſtruſt of honeſty in him that was to take it, where the cauſe (Lyes, Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>is removed, the effect</hi> (Swearing) <hi>ſhould ceaſe:</hi> As if Chriſt, or rather God himſelf, had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted his own honeſty, when he ſware unto Chriſt, <hi>Thou art a Prieſt for ever after the Order of</hi> Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec; or the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the Faithful, had diſtruſted God's honeſty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ſware to him to free him from his diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and not becauſe (as the Scripture ſpeaks) <hi>God</hi> [was] <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe, the immutability of his Counſel,</hi> Heb. 6.17.</p>
            <p n="30">(30.) Next we come to that Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61239:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Neither be ye called Maſters,</hi> &amp;c. Here, as his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is, he abuſes my words, as if he came <hi>out of Bedlam,</hi> and then my Argument muſt be a Bedlam one. Read both, and compare, for I may not now repeat. If the <hi>Quakers</hi> reſtrain the Text, where they have reaſon, why may not others reſtrain it, where they have as good reaſon? and that without <hi>blaming the Text?</hi> or <hi>ſtrange irreverence to Holy Writ?</hi> If my Neighbour be a Maſter of Servants, why may I not treat him in compellation as ſuch? and not as if he had no Servant, and were himſelf a Servant? And by Mr. <hi>P's</hi> favour, I count it no ſin to call ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man's Wife, <hi>Good Wife!</hi> or another Man's She-Servant, <hi>Maid!</hi> Mr. <hi>P.</hi> doth; but no ſin to tell me, I have told a plain lye, when himſelf has made my words ſo, by detracting from them. And therefore the Reader has no reaſon to believe him, when he ſaith, <hi>Civil honour, namely of calling Maſter, is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to common Truth, and Chriſtian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I wonder <hi>W. P.</hi> ſhould take ſo much pains to vindicate <hi>Stephen</hi> in calling the Counſel of the Jews, <hi>Men, Brethren, and Fathers,</hi> who yet were not his proper Fathers; for he might with more eaſe have done it, by ſaying, He had a ſpecial impulſe for it, as the <hi>Quaker</hi> that came many ſcore of miles (as they ſaid) to perform his obeyſance to <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> at her own Houſe; where at a ſolemn Meeting, the Man roſe up from his Seat, and went and fell down upon his knees (with his Hat in his hand) directly before <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> and made his humble addreſs to her by the compellation of <hi>my dear Mother!</hi> and beſeech'd her to pray for him.</p>
            <p>In like manner, on the third or fourth day after, <hi>John Stubs,</hi> at another Meeting, requeſted the like
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61239:33"/>favour of her, with his Hat under his Arm ſtanding, and calling her, <hi>My dear everlaſting Mother:</hi> The truth of theſe things can be prov'd by eye and ear-witneſſes, and I ſuppoſe there are ſome <hi>Quakers</hi> that will atteſt them.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Margaret Fell,</hi> who was formerly Judge <hi>Fell</hi>'s Wife, and is now <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom <hi>he gave forth a Paper, that his marriage with her, was a ſigure of the Marriage between Chirſt and the Church: Likewiſe that his Marriage was above the ſtate of</hi> Adam <hi>in his Innocency, in the ſtate of the ſecond</hi> Adam <hi>who never fell.</hi> Thus I find it reported by a certain <hi>Quaker</hi> in a Letter (a notable piece) to his Friend. The ſame perſon faith, That <hi>upon two occaſions perſons kneel before</hi> G. Fox, <hi>though 'tis done in a very private manner, and but by a few; the one is, when he ſends them forth to Adminiſter; the other is, upon ſome miſdemeanour committed by a Miniſter, who acknowledging his fault, upon his bended knees,</hi> George <hi>abſolves him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My next Argument was thus: Chriſt ſaith, Be ye not called <hi>Kathegetai,</hi> but he doth not forbid them to be called <hi>Kyrioi;</hi> and we find in Scripture <hi>Philip</hi> called by Strangers <hi>Kyrie,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Kyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oi;</hi> and Chirſt himſelf miſtaken for a Gardener, by a notable Diſciple called <hi>Kyrie,</hi> and all without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke; therefore the compellation of <hi>Kyrie,</hi> is not forbid in <hi>Kathegetes:</hi> If it be, our Lord Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as well as the Apoſtles, will be brought under ſuſpicion of conniving at ſin, in a place where he had opportunity to correct it. And beſides, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Writers giving us no notice of any failure in any of theſe caſes, the Scripture, and practice of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, and Primitive Believers,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61239:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>will be ſo far from being of Example and Teaching to us, that they will be a temptation to us unto evil; and, as Mr. <hi>P. ſayes, like the ſhadow of the true Rule,</hi> that is, an evening ſhadow, which is five times as long as the ſubſtance it ſelf. Let the Reader ſee now if he can pick any thing out of <hi>W. P</hi>'s anſwer, but evaſion and ſhuffle. He ſaith indeed, in excuſe of our Lord's ſilence in the caſe, that <hi>he never particularly check't</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>for denying him;</hi> which how parallel to this caſe, let the ſober Reader judge; and how boldly our Lords innocence is called into queſtion, and how lamely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. And whether <hi>G. F.</hi> would have incurred that ſuſpicion of guilt in the like Circumſtances? or the only Scripture of his Life and Doctrine, wrote by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> left him under it?</p>
            <p n="31">(31.) As for his defence of Women ſpeaking in the Church, it's like the reſt, meer ſhuffle. Judge what a pliant Conſcience this man has! who can accuſe ſome that he had nothing to do with, <note place="margin">pag. 68.</note> of making <hi>John</hi> ſpeak equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catingly, <hi>becauſe they do not expound Scripture to his ſenſe,</hi> and me a little before of <hi>ſtrange irreverence to Holy Writ</hi> for reſtranining the Text, which himſelf alſo reſtrains; <note place="margin">pag. 92.</note> and here behold what a ſenſe he puts upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34, 35. as if he were expounding one of the old Poetical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles! But at length he comes to this, <hi>I permit not an unlearned or ignorant Woman to ſpeak in the Church;</hi> And Did the Apoſtle permit, or Do the <hi>Quakers</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unlearned or ignorant men to ſpeak in the Church? I ſaid, <hi>The Apoſtle forbids Women by Sex, in thoſe caſes wherein he allows men by Sex to ſpeak in the Church:</hi> Where's his Anſwer? Find it that can. He tells us of Women's labouring in the Lord,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61239:34"/>Helpers in Chriſt Jeſus? Servants of the Church: as if they might not do all that without ſpeaking in the Church, where there were men enough qualified for that work. He tells us of Women propheſying, for among them (the <hi>Quakers</hi>) any profound &amp; vehement prattle may ſerve for that: but I never yet heard of a <hi>Quaker</hi> that ſpake an unknown Tongue. And yet one would think they needed it enough, when they are ſent to the <hi>Indians,</hi> or to the Great <hi>Turk.</hi>

Theſe five Inſtances, (<hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27. <hi>Joh</hi> 2.10, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.) the change of the Phraſe in the two firſt and laſt, and the defect in the third and fourth, do all favour their doctrine of Perfection, which is indeed a Doctrine of Sin and Imperfection: for he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect Man according to them, who ſins not againſt his immediate Light or Conſcience, and ſo their Perſection is conſiſtent with all manner of ſins of Ignorance of Error proceeding from any paſſion, as is moſt manifeſt in theſe two, <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> who muſt be accounted perfect men, notwithſtanding all their blaſphemics againſt God and Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumelies againſt men, which I have evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated. And then it's conſiſtent with ſins of Omiſſion in great plenty, for whil'ſt they deny the Worſhip and whole Religſon of all but themſelves, they muſt of neceſſity want that love toward them, which is due to Chriſtian Brethren. Behold here a ſort of Chriſtians, without either Faith in the true Chriſt, or love to his faithful Servants!</p>
            <p n="37">(37.) And it's not a little miſchief that has been wrought by that Notion of <hi>God's working all in us, and for us,</hi> which <hi>G. F.</hi> will have the Apoſtle to ſay; and <hi>W. P.</hi> beings three Texts, from whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61239:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>it, as if I had charged <hi>G. F.</hi> with a falſe Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xence, and not falſe Scripture.</p>
            <p n="38">(38.) Our Tranſlation hath, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20.) — <hi>If they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them:</hi> But G. F. <hi>You that ſpeak not according to that Rule, it is becauſe you hate the Light in you.</hi> And <hi>W. P.</hi> inſtead of vindicating him, rails at me. Who knows not what that change meant?</p>
            <p n="39">(39.) That <hi>G. F.</hi> may diſparage the places where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in other Chriſtians worſhip God, ſaith, <hi>Is God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Temples made with hands?</hi> And would have his Reader take that for Scripture. <hi>W. P.</hi> ſaith nothing to it.</p>
            <p n="40">(40.) I ſhew'd in my Epiſtle, <hi>p.</hi> 27. what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is countenanced by <hi>G. F.</hi>'s putting <hi>is</hi> for <hi>was,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. as if there were no work done by Chriſt for reconciling men, which he was not, and is not alwayes a doing. I ſhew'd alſo that <hi>G. F.</hi> ſaid, God <hi>was in Chriſt, reconciling himſelf to the World.</hi> But <hi>W. P.</hi> takes no notice of it. He ſeems to have wrote his Book only for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or thoſe that either never read my Epiſtle, or elſe have forgot it.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole Matter, (for I have exceeded my intended brevity) let the impartial Reader judge of <hi>W. P</hi>'s, and my performance in tals Argument; And whether I have not prov'd by evidence of ſenſe what I undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>G. F.</hi> is a falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, a Lyar, or Impoſtor? Yea, whether <hi>W. P.</hi> himſelf hath not confirm'd unawares this Sentence concerning him? Whether it is not horrid impiety for theſe men to pretend the guidance of God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit in what they write; and to run in to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61239:35"/>ſuch Abſurdities, Falſities, and pernicious Errors, as I have prov'd them guilty of? Whether it will not be great folly in me, or any man henceforward to write, or indeed to ſpeak to theſe men concerning Matters of Religion, (except perhaps further to diſcover their deceit) whilſt they practiſe ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of Equivocation in their words, as renders all Diſcourſe vain and ineſſectual? Or, is it poſſible to convince thoſe men by Reaſon, that will deny the evidence of Senſe? Beſides, how can there be either end or fruit of writing, where a man ſhall not only muſunderſtand things that are plain; but impute to his Adverſary Words and Sayings of his own coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and proceed to the bittereſt reproaches thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and in the mean time omit to take notice of Matters of moment? Therefore I have entituled this Diſcourſe, CONTROVERSIE ENDED, for I am bold to affirm, that it muſt either be ended here, or if not, It may be continued infinitely upon the ſame grounds. What remains then to be done, but earneſtly to beg of God through Jeſus Chriſt, that he would give them repentance to the acknowleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Truth.</p>
            <p>O Holy Jeſus, who waſt dead, but art alive, and liveſt for evermore; who waſt crucified through weakneſs but liveſt through the Power of God; to whom God, even thy Father, hath given al Power in Heaven and Earth; who canſt be touched with the feeling of our Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, for thou waſt in all things tempted as we are; Have pity upon theſe men, who (ſome of them) have a zeal of God but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to knowledge, work in them Humility,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61239:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>and enlighten the eyes of their minds, that they may acknowledge thee to be their Lord, and the Mediator between God and Men; that they may no longer deſpiſe that Knowledge and Faith of thee, which is by Preaching or Tradition through the Holy Scriptures; but may contend earneſtly for the Faith, which was once delivered to the Saints. <note place="margin">Tradita.</note> Have morey upon me, O Lord, pardon mine Infirmities, and judge whether I have not been as careful not to wrong them in this Work, as I would have them, or any man to be of not injuring me? and grant that it may be fo benefit and advantage to many, and that thou mayeſt be glorified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT</head>
            <p>NOw it will appear whether there be any pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and houeſt men among the Governing <hi>Quakers,</hi> by their dealing with <hi>W. P.</hi> for this Book of his: for I appeal to the Reader, whether he thinks there be any ſuch inconſiderable Society of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>England,</hi> that would not either have requir'd a publick acknowledgment of his Offence, or have diſown'd that Member, which ſhould have wrote in their Deſence a Book of 138 papges, and but two of them (that is <hi>p.</hi> 130, and 131.) that have any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of Auſwer to their Antagoniſt's chief Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; and that alſo, which is there alledg'd, to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61239:36"/>be partly falſe, and altogether inconſequent, ſave againſt himſelf: But to contain many pages that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly confirm and aggravate the Charge brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and moreover, to be ſo ſtuff with pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, calumnious, and ſelf-prayſing untruths, and virulent Language, that it makes their Cauſe and Dealing odious in the ſight of ſober men: all which I have prov'd <hi>W. P.</hi> to have done in relation to the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will eaſily appear to the conſidering Reader, that I have, for brevity ſake, omitted to impprove many Advantages which my raſh Adverſary has given me, contenting my ſelf to in timate them, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. And he that has diligently and judiciouſly read my Epiſtle and his Anſwer, may perceive that I have not ſo much as intimated divers things of much advantage to my Cauſe and Perſon. Among thoſe is that Paſſage in <hi>p.</hi> 136. where he eſſayes to anſwer ſome of my Reaſons for keeping my Name from them, and ſayes, very civilly, That I <hi>horribly bilie them:</hi> why? wherein? Not in this, <hi>That there are ſome of their Writers, that make it a great part of their Anſwers to Books, the reproaching the Author.</hi> Let this very Book of <hi>W. P.</hi> be an Inſtance, How many Sheets muſt it have wanted, if all of that kind had been ſubſtracted? Not in this, <hi>That they are very Rhetorical in that point.</hi> I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>W. P.</hi> could not Rhetoricate ſo well in the praiſe of any Perſon in the World, (<hi>G. Fox</hi> not excepted) as he hath in reproach of me. He has taken up one of <hi>Muggleton</hi>'s peculiar Phraſes, wherewith to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe me and my Friends, calling us <hi>Serpentine Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates.</hi> It's like <hi>Muggleton</hi> had us'd it in <hi>W. P</hi>'s hearing, and <hi>W. P.</hi> according to his nature, was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61239:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>taken with it, and ſo beſtowed it upon his next Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. Neither in this do I belie them, that <hi>if they had my Name, then it muſt be conſidered what Party I am of, and accordingly all that is odious, or ſo reputed, either in the Doctrine or Practice of the whole Party muſt be raked up againſt me.</hi> Let his Book be witneſs whether he has not dealt ſo with me, even upon a ſuſpition of my name. <hi>But,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we never charg'd the infirmities of a ſingle Perſon, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then upon that guilty Perſon, unleſs he were connived at, or juſtifyed in his wickedneſs by any whole Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here lies the Wit, If any part of the Charge be not found apparent, all the reſt, how manifeſt ſoever, muſt go for a horible lie. But <hi>W. P.</hi> (kind Man!) will not put me to much trouble in ſearching for an Inſtance: It is but turning back to <hi>p.</hi> 7. and there I find a ſingle Perſon deſcribed, (as it were in a <hi>Hue and Cry</hi>) and his being <hi>wanting in the very Alphabet of common civility,</hi> attributed plurally to him and me at leaſt, and I think to all the Party that <hi>W. P.</hi> aſſigns for us. Has he not then rak'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me what is odious, or ſo reputed both in the Doctrine and Practice of a Party, and of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſon? Which he can never prove me guilty of juſtifying in that caſe.</p>
            <p>Another Inſtance ſhall be of an elder date; ſee the Epiſtle to <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Divinity,</hi> &amp;c. where <hi>G. F.</hi> tells the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> that <hi>when the people of God, called</hi> Quakers, <hi>were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in divers places to Worſhip God, then you ſaid, They were plotting together againſt</hi> Oliver, <hi>(whom ſome of you called the Light of your Eyes, and Breath of your Noſtrils) to bring in King</hi> Charles. If they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61239:37"/>can make it appear (which I much doubt) that one or another <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independent</hi> did ſuggeſt any ſuch thing againſt them, it can never be believed by any ſober Man that that Perſon was connived at, or juſtifyed therein by one or both Parties, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians</hi> or <hi>Independents,</hi> and yet here <hi>G. F.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> impute it to them both indefinitely; and that ſo, as thereby to inſinuace that the <hi>Quakers</hi> were generally at leaſt eſteemed Friends to the King, and ſufferes upon that account: But the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> Friends to <hi>Oliver,</hi> and Enetnies to the King and the <hi>Quakers.</hi> O the Candour and Simplicity of <hi>G. Fox!</hi> O the Modeſty and Meekneſs of <hi>W. Pen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, Inreference to their calling men <hi>Tinker</hi> or <hi>Tayler,</hi> W. P. replyes, <hi>We never told the World mens Trades in a way of detraction or reproach; our Souls abbor it.</hi> When he has <hi>taken ſhame to himſelf in the ingenuous acknowledgment to the World,</hi> of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths I have prov'd him guilty of; then he may better be believed. In the mean time who can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>G. W.</hi> did not call <hi>Bunyan the Tinker,</hi> by way of detraction, when he adds immediately, <hi>a rayling envious man;</hi> and in a late Pamphlet, calls rayling Language, <hi>Tinkers-Rhetorick</hi> Beſides, <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> is a term of reproach, and he that is ſuch, may by Stature be puniſhed as a Rogue.</p>
