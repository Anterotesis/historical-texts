         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

to Effect and Perfect the ſaid
Works, have been by many heretofore
well known, to have worthily attempted
the ſaid Invention, though with fruitleſs
ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Having ſeen many of their failings, I
held it my Duty to endeavour, if it were
poſſible to Effect and Perfect ſo laudable,
and beneficial, and alſo ſo much deſired
Inventions, as the making of Iron into

            <p>Having former knowledge and delight
in Iron Works of my Fathers, when I
was but a Youth; afterward at 20 years
Old, was I fetched from <hi>Oxford,</hi> then of
<hi>Bayliol</hi> Colledge, <hi>Anno 1619,</hi> to look and
manage 3 Iron Works of my Fathers,
1 Furnace, and 2 Forges, in the Chaſe
of <hi>Penſnet</hi> in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> but Wood
and Charcole, growing then ſcant, and
Pit-coles, in great quantities abounding
near the Furnace, did induce me to alter
my Furnace, and to attempt by my new
Invention, the making of Iron with Pit-cole,
aſſuring my ſelf in my Invention,
the loſs to me could not be greater then
others, nor ſo great, although my ſucceſs
ſhould prove fruitleſs; But I found ſuch
ſucceſs at firſt tryal animated me, for at
my tryal or blaſt, I made Iron to profit
with Pit-cole, and found <hi>Facere eſt addere
Inventioni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I had made a ſecond blaſt and
tryal, the feſibility of making Iron with
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109367:13"/>
Pit-cole and Sea-cole, I found by my new
Invention, the quality to be good and
profitable, but the quantity did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
above 3 Tuns <hi>per</hi> week: After I had
brought my Invention unto ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and profitable, doubted not in
the future to have advanced my Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to make quantity alſo.</p>
            <p>Immediately after my ſecond tryal, I
wrote unto my Father what I had done,

Years in the inventions, my Sufferings
in the War, and my Eſtate ſold for my

dayes, for the general good, by his inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the preſervation of Great <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>'s
Wood and Timber.</p>
            <p>Now let me ſhew ſome Reaſons that
induced me to undertake theſe Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109367:14"/>
after the many failings of others,
well knowing that within Ten miles of
<hi>Dudley</hi> Caſtle there to be neer 20000.
Smiths of all ſorts, and many Iron works
at that time, within that Circle decayed
for want of Wood (yet formerly a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Woodland Country.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord <hi>Dudley</hi>'s Woods
and Works decayed, but Pitcoal and
Iron, Stone or Mines abounding, upon
his Lands, but of little Uſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe moſt of the Coale-Mines
in theſe parts, as well as upon the
Lord <hi>Dudley</hi>'s lands, are Coals, Ten, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and Twelve yards thick; the top
or the uppermoſt Cole, or vein, gotten
upon the ſuperficies of this Globe or
Earth, in open works.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Under this great thickneſs
of Coal, is very many ſorts of Iron, Stone
Mines, in the Earth Clay or Stone earth,
like bats, in all four yards thick; alſo
under theſe Iron mines is ſeverall yards
thick of Coals, but of theſe in an other
place more convenient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:109367:15"/>
Fifthly, Knowing that when the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
are forced to ſinck Pits for getting
of ten yards thick or more, that be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
under the ground, being ſmall are of
little or of no uſe in that inland Country
nor is it worth the drawing out of the
Pits, unleſſe it might be made uſe of by
making of Iron therewith into caſt
works or Bars.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Then knowing that if there
could be any uſe made of the ſmal-coale
that are of little Uſe, then would they be
drawn out of the Pits, which coles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
often times great prejudice unto
the Owners of the works and the work
it ſelf, and alſo unto the Colliers, who
caſting of the ſmalcoles together, which
compelling neceſſity enforcing the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
ſo to do, for two cauſes; one is to
raiſe them to cut down the ten yards
thickneſſe of coles drawing onely the
bigger ſort of cole, not regarding the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
or ſmall cole, which will bring no
money; ſaying, <hi>He that liveth longest let
him fetch fire further:</hi> Next, Theſe Colliers
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109367:15"/>
muſt caſt theſe coles, and ſleck or droſſe
out of their wayes, which ſulphurious
ſmall cole and crouded moyſt ſleck heat
naturally, and kindles in the middle of
thoſe great heaps; often fals the cole-works
on Fire, and flaming out of the
Pits, and continue burning like <hi>Aetna</hi> in
<hi>Cicily,</hi> or <hi>Hecla</hi> in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet when theſe looſe Sulphurious
compoſts of cole and ſleck, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in proceſſe of time, the Fire de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes,
yet notwithſtanding the Fire hath
continued in ſome Pits many years; yet
colliers have gotten coles again, in
thoſe ſame Pits, the Fire not penitrating
the ſolid and firme wall of coles, becauſe
<hi>Pabulum ignis eſt Aer,</hi> the Ayre could not
penetrate, but paſſe by it in the looſe cole
and ſleck; for comming into thoſe pits
afterwards, I have beheld the very blows
of Pikes or tools that got the coles there
formerly. Alſo from theſe Sulphurious
heaps, mixed with Iron, Stone (for out of
many of the ſame pits is gotten much I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
Stone, or Mines; the Fires heating
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109367:16"/>
vaſt quantities of Water, paſſing thorow
theſe Soughs or Adits, becometh as
hot as the Bath at <hi>Bathe,</hi> and more heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſovereign even for old Ulcers
and Sores; but becauſe many of theſe
Baths doe proceed not onely from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sulphur and vitriol of <hi>Mars,</hi> but
alſo from <hi>Solars</hi> ſulphur in this Iron
ſtone, I hope, <hi>Filii Artis,</hi> will excuſe my
digeſion from the making of Iron with
Pitcole, Seacole, Peat or Turff, and the
melting of mines and mettals and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the ſame, with the like fuell: the
firſt Pattent being granted by King <hi>James</hi>
for 31. Years in the 19th year of his
Reign upon juſt and true information,
that the Authour had the year before

caſt Iron Works of ſundry ſorts

Iron: But the year following, the grant
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109367:16"/>
or Pattent for making of Iron with Pitcole
or Seacole, There was ſo great a
Flood, by rain, to this day, called the
great <hi>May-day-Flood,</hi> that it not onely ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated
the Authours Iron works, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
but alſo many other mens Iron
works and inventions; but alſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens Iron works: and at a market
Town called <hi>Sturbridge</hi> in <hi>Commitate Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorae,</hi>
although the Authour ſent with
ſpeed to preſerve the people from drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
one reſolute man was carried
from the Bridge there in the day time,
and the nether part of the Town was ſo
deep in Water that the people had much
ado to preſerve their lives in the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rooms in their Houſes.</p>
            <p>My Yron works and inventions thus
demoliſhed, to the joy of many Iron ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
whoſe works ſcaped the Flood and
who had often diſparaged the Authors
Inventions, becauſe the Authour ſold
good Iron cheaper then they could afford
it; and which induced many of the Iron
maſters to complain unto King <hi>Iames,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verring,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109367:17"/>
that the Iron was not Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
As ſoon as the Authour had repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his works and inventions (to his no
ſmall charge) they ſo far prevailed with
King <hi>Iames,</hi> that the Authour was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
with all ſpeed poſſible, to ſend all
ſorts of Bar Iron up to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
fit for making of Muſquets, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines
and Iron for great Bolts, fit for
Shipping, which Iron being ſo tryed by
Artiſts and Smiths, that the Iron maſters
and Iron-mongers were all ſilenced until
21th. of King <hi>Iames:</hi> At the then Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
all Monopolies were made <hi>Null,</hi>
and diverſe of the Iron-maſters endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to bring the invention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Iron with Pitcole, Seacole, Peat and
Turff, within the compaſſe of a <hi>Monopoly;</hi>
but the Lord <hi>Dudley</hi> and the Authour did
prevaile; yet the Pattent was limitted
to continue but Fourteen years; after
which Act the Authour went on with his
invention cheerfully, and made annually
great ſtore of Iron, good and merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and ſold it unto diverſe men yet
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:109367:17"/>
living at Twelve pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun; I alſo
made all ſorts of caſt Iron Wares, as
Brewing-Cyſterns, Pots, Morters, and
better and cheaper than any yet were
made in theſe Nations, with <hi>Charcoles;</hi>
Some of which are extant to be ſeen by
any man (at the Authours Houſe in the
City of <hi>Worceſter)</hi> that deſire to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of the truth in the Invention.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, The Authour was outed of
his works and inventions before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by the Iron-maſters and others
wrongfully, over long to relate: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unwilling his Inventions (having
undergone much charge and pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in)
ſhould fall to the ground, and be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in him, made him to ſet forward
his Invention again, at a Furnace called,
<hi>Himly Furnace</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi>
where he made much Iron with Pit-cole,
but wanting a Forge to make it into bars,
was conſtrained for want of Stock to ſell
the Pig-Iron unto the Charcole Iron-maſters,
who did him much prejudice,
not onely in detaining his ſtock, but alſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109367:18"/>
diſparaging the Iron; <hi>Himley</hi> Furnace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rented out unto Charcole Iron-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>The Authour Erected a new large Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace
on purpoſe, 27 foot ſquare, all of
ſtone for his new invention, at a place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<hi>Haſco Bridge,</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Sedgley,</hi>
and County of <hi>Stafford;</hi> the Bellows of
which Furnace were larger then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bellows are, in which work he made
7 Tuns of Iron <hi>per</hi> week, the greateſt
quantity of Pit-cole-Iron that ever yet
was made in <hi>Great Brittain;</hi> near which
Furnace, the Author diſcovered many
new Cole-mines 10 yards thick, and
Iron-Mine under it, according to other
Cole-works; which Cole-works being
brought unto perfection, the Author was
by force thrown out of them, and the
Fellows of his new Furnace and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by riotous perſons cut in pieces, to
his no ſmall prejudice, and loſs of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
of making of Iron with Pit-cole,
Sea-cole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that being with
Law-Suites, and Riots, wearied and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:109367:18"/>
to proſecute his Art and Invention
at preſent, even untill the firſt Pattent
was extinct: Notwithſtanding the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
his ſad Sufferings, Impriſonments
wrongfully for ſeveral thouſand pound
in the <hi>Counter</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> yet did obtaine
a new Pattent, dated the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>May, Anno
14. Caroli Primi</hi> of ever Bleſſed Memory,
not only for the making of Iron into caſt-works,
and bars, but alſo for the Melting,
Extracting, Refining and Reducing of
all Mines, Minerals and Mettals, with
Pit-cole, Sea-cole, Peat, and Turf, for the
preſervation of Wood and Timber of
this Iſland; into which Pattent, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
for the better ſupport and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Invention, ſo much oppoſed
formerly at the Court, at the Parliament,

did well know my former Sufferings, and

what I had done in the Invention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Iron with Pit-cole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which ſaid Patentees Articled the
<hi>11th</hi> of <hi>Iune</hi> following, they Grant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pay the Authour all the charges of

alſo to lay in for a common and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock
each man of the four, one hundred
pounds, and ſo from time to time, what

ſhould think fit to be laid in for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

Partners had in ſtock near 700l. but they
not only cunningly drew me into Bond,
entered upon my Stock and Work, unto

Kings Party; unto the great prejudice of
my Inventions and Proceedings, my Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
being then almoſt extinct; for which,

            <p>In the interim of my proceedings,
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the then Parliament, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Pattent, and an Act of Parliament
unto Captain <hi>Buck</hi> of <hi>Hampton Road,</hi> for
the making of Iron with Pit-cole and
Sea-cole; <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and many of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
were Partners, as Major <hi>Wildman</hi>
and others; many Doctors of Phyſick, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109367:21"/>
Merchants, who ſet up diverſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Works, and Furnaces at a vaſt
charge, in the Forreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> and after
they had ſpent much in their Invention
and Experiments, which was done in
ſpacious Wind-Furnaces, and alſo in
Potts of Glaſs-houſe Clay; and failing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
got unto them an Ingenious
Glaſs-Maker, Maſter <hi>Edward Dagney</hi> an
<hi>Italian</hi> then living in <hi>Briſtow,</hi> who after
had made many Potts, for that purpoſe
went with them into the Forreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi>
and built for the ſaid Captain <hi>Buck</hi> and
his Partners, a new Furnance, and
made therein many and ſundry Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

that the Authour had knowledge in

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> they from Cap. <hi>Buck,</hi> and the
other Partners importuned the Author,
who was at that time in great danger by
the Parliament, (being a Colonel of the
Kings Party) to go along with them into
the Forreſt of <hi>Dean,</hi> which at that time
durſt not deny; Coming thither, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
their manner of working, and
found it impoſſible, that the ſaid <hi>Edward
Dagney</hi> by his Invention ſhould make any
Iron with Pit-cole or Sea-cole, in Pots to
profit: I continued with them till all
their Potts and Inventions failed; at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Dinner and Supper, Captain <hi>Buck,</hi>
Captain <hi>Robins,</hi> Doctor <hi>Ivie,</hi> Doctor
<hi>Fowler</hi> and others, would aſke the Author
why he was ſo confident that Iron in
quantity could not be made by their new
Inventions? I found it a difficult thing to
diſſwade the Partners from their way, ſo
confident were they to perform the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Iron with Pit-cole or Sea-cole to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109367:22"/>
profit; that they deſired me to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
a ſecond time into the Forreſt to ſee
it Effected: But at that time, I ſaw their
failings alſo.</p>
            <p>Yet nevertheleſs Captain <hi>Buck,</hi> and his
Partners Erected new Works at the

much as in their former Inventions; but
Major <hi>Wildman,</hi> more barbarous to me
then a Wildman, (although a Miniſter

The Author, during the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
their time, could get no Order
upon his Reference; But his Petition
was left, with the now Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
the Lord Treaſurer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to take or
grant further order therein, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath gotten hitherto no order.</p>
            <p>Therefore compelling neceſſity doth
conſtrain (having proſecuted his Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hitherto) him to deſiſt from his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
in which he hath taken more
pains, care and charge, then any man, to
perfect his new Invention in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.</p>
            <p>Although the Author hath not as yet
ſo fully perfected or raiſed his invention
to the quantity of Charcole Iron Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
yet the Authors quantity being
but ſeven Tuns <hi>per</hi> week at the moſt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the quality of his Iron made
with Pit-cole and Sea-cole, hath the moſt
eminent Triplicity of Iron of all that can
be deſired in any new Invention.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. More Sufficient. </item>
               <item>2. More Cheap.</item>
               <item>3. More Excellent.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:109367:25"/>
Upon which triplicity, the Authour
might enlarge himſelf, but ſhall not be
tedious, only give me leave to mention
that there be three ſorts of Caſt Iron;</p>
            <p>1. The firſt ſort is Gray Iron.</p>
            <p>2. The ſecond ſort is called Motley
Iron, of which one part of the Sowes or
Piggs is gray, the other part is white in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt.</p>
            <p>3. The third ſort is called white Iron,
this is almoſt as white as Bell-Mettle,
but in the Furnace is leaſt fined, and the
moſt Terreſtrial; of the three, the Mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
Iron is ſomewhat more fined, but the
Gray Iron,</p>
            <p>1. Is moſt fined, and more
ſufficient to make Bar-Iron with, and
tough Iron to make Ordnance, or any
Caſt-Veſſels, being it is more fined in the
Furnace, and more malliable and tough,
then the other two ſorts before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and of this ſort, is the Iron made
with Pit-cole, Sea-cole for the moſt part,
and therefore more ſufficiently to be
preferred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:109367:26"/>2. More cheaper Iron there cannot be
made, for the Author did fell pigg or caſt
Iron made with Pit-cole at four pounds
<hi>per</hi> Tun, many Tuns in the twentieth year
of King <hi>James,</hi> with good profit; of late,
Charcole Pig-iron hath been ſold at ſix
pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, yea at ſeven pounds <hi>per</hi>
Tun hath much been ſold of late years.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Author did ſell Bar-iron,
Good and Merchantable, at twelve
pounds <hi>per</hi> Tun, and under, but ſince
Bar-iron hath been ſold for the moſt part
ever ſince at 15l. 16l. 17l. and 18l.
<hi>per</hi> Tun, by Charcole Iron-Maſters.</p>
            <p>3. More Excellent for diverſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and principally, being the meanes
whereby the Wood and Timber of this
Iſland almoſt exhauſted, may be timely
preſerved yet, and vegetate and grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
unto his former wonted cheapneſs,
for the maintenance of Navigation,
which is the greateſt Strength of <hi>Great
Brittain,</hi> whoſe Defence and Offence,
for all the Territories that belong unto
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109367:26"/>
it, next under God and his Vice-Gerent,
our Sacred Majeſties Cares, conſiſts moſt
of Shiping, Men of War, Experienced
Mariners, Ordnances, Ammunition, and
Stores, the Ordnance made therewith
will be more gray and tough, therefore
more ſerviceable at Sea and Land, and
the Bar-iron will wall, rivet, and hold
better then moſt commonly Charcole
Iron.</p>
            <p>2. More Excellent, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
the Invention of making of Iron
with Pit-cole and Sea-cole will preſerve
Wood and Timber of <hi>Great Brittain</hi> ſo
greatly conſumed by Iron-Works of
late.</p>
            <p>But alſo in reſpect, this my Invention
will preſerve many Millions of Tuns of
Small-cole in <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> which will
be loſt in time to come, as formerly they
were, for within ten miles of <hi>Dudley Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,</hi>
is annually conſumed four or five
thouſand Tuns at leaſt of ſmall Pit-cole,
and have been ſo conſumed time out of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109367:27"/>
mind under ground, fit to have made
Pit-iron with; which coles are and (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Iron be made therewith) will be for
ever totally and annually loſt; if four or
five thouſand Tun of Cole be conſumed
within ten miles compaſs, what Coles is
thus conſumed in all <hi>England, Scotland,</hi>
and <hi>Wales?</hi> which is no good Huſbandry
for <hi>Great Brittain, hinc ille lacrime,</hi> that
our Timber is exhauſted.</p>
            <p>Muſt I be ſtill oppoſed, and never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
my Inventions, nor <hi>Great Brittain</hi> the
Benefit?</p>
            <p>Muſt my Pattent be obſtructed in
Peace, as it was extinct by the Wars?
And muſt not my Pattent be Revived
for the making of Iron with Pit-cole, Sea-cole,
Peat, and Turf, but find Enemies
ſtill to oppoſe it?
How many thouſand Tuns of Iron
might have been made but ſince my firſt
Invention, <hi>An. Jacob. 18th</hi> by my means
with Pit-cole, and Sea-cole (loſt) if I had
not had Enemies; and had not wood and
timber been preſerved?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109367:27"/>
But moſt men will aver, that it doth
concern the Author to Demonſtrate the
great loſſe mentioned formerly of Pit-cole
annually;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is thus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is at leaſt within ten miles of
the Caſtle of <hi>Dudley,</hi> twelve or fourteen
Cole-Works, ſome in <hi>Worcester,</hi> and
ſome of them in <hi>Stafford-ſhire</hi> (now in
work, and twice as many in that Circute
not in work) each of which Works get
two thouſand Tun of Cole yearly, ſome
get three, four or five thouſand Tun of
Coles yearly: and the uppermoſt or top
meaſures of Coles are ten, eleven, and
ſome twelve yards thick; the Coles Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending,
Baſſeting, or as the Colliers
term it, Cropping up even unto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfices
of the Earth, and there the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
formerly got the Coles; but where
the Coles is deep and but little Earth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the meaſures of Coles, there the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers
rid off the Earth, and dig the Coles
under their feet; theſe Works are called
Foot-rids.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:109367:28"/>
But of theſe Works there are now but
few, ſome of theſe ſmall Coles in theſe
open Works, the poor people did carry
away, but paid nothing for them in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times, termed the Brain Carriages.</p>
            <p>But now the Colliers working more
in the deep of theſe Works, they are
conſtrained to ſink Pits, ſome of which
Pits are from eight unto twenty yards
deep, and ſome are near twenty fathome
deep, which fathome contains two yards.</p>
            <p>In theſe Pits, after you have made or
hit the uppermoſt meaſures of Cole, and
ſink or digged thorow them, the Colliers
getting the nethermoſt part of the Coles
firſt, about two yards in height or more,
and when they have wrought the Crutes
or Staules, (as ſome Colliers call them)
as broad and as far in under the ground,
as they think fit, they throw the ſmall
Coles (fit to make Iron) out of their way
on heaps to raiſe them up ſo high, to
ſtand upon, that they may, with the
working of their Picks or Maundrills o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109367:28"/>
their heads, and at the one end of the
Coles ſo far in as their Tool will permit,
and ſo high as their working cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a parting in the meaſure of Cole, the
which Coles, to the parting by his ſelf
clogging and pondrous weight, fall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
many Tuns of coles, many yards
high down at once; with which fall and
the Colliers breaking of the ſaid Cole,
many ſmall coles do ſo abound of no uſe,
and fit for no ſale; that in getting of
twenty thouſand Tun of Pit-cole, one
half near is ſmall cole, not drawn out of
the Pits, but deſtroyed, left, and loſt;
which ſmall cole, with the ſleck thrown
moyſt together, (heat the ſooner) and by
means of its ſulphurouſneſs fire in the
Pits, to no ſmall prejudice unto the
Owners of the Works, and the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
beſides <hi>Great Brittains</hi> Loſs; which
Cole might have made many thouſand
Tuns of Iron, and alſo have preſerved
this Iſlands Woods and Timber: I might
here give you the names, and partly the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:109367:29"/>
nature of every meaſure, parting of each
cole lying on upon each other; the three
uppermoſt meaſures are called the white
meaſures for his white Arcenical, Salſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginos
and Sulphurious ſubſtance which
is in that Cole; the next meaſure, is the
ſhoulder-cole, the toe-cole, the foot-cole,
the yard-cole, the ſliper-cole, the ſawyer-cole,
and the friſly cole, theſe laſt three
coles are the beſt for the making of Iron,
yet other coles may be made uſe of.</p>
            <p>I might give you other names of coles,
but deſire not prolixity, yet muſt I tell
you of a ſupernumerary number of
Smiths within ten miles of theſe Cole-Works
near twenty thouſand; yet God
of his Infinite goodneſs (if we will but
take notice of his goodneſs unto this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
hath made this Country a very
Granaris for the ſupplying theſe Men
with Iron, Cole, and Lime made with
cole, which hath much ſupplyed theſe
men with Corn alſo of late, and from
theſe men, a great part not only of this
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109367:29"/>
Iſland, but alſo of his Majeſties other
Kingdomes and Territories with Iron
wares have their ſupply, and wood in
theſe parts almoſt exhauſted, although it
were of late a mighty wood-land Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>Now if the Coles and Iron-ſtone ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
were made right uſe of, we
need not want Iron as we do; for very
many meaſures of iron-ſtone are placed
together under the great ten yards thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of cole, and upon another thickneſs
of coles two yards thick, not yet menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
called the bottom-cole, or the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
cole, as if God had decreed the
time when, and how theſe Smiths ſhould
be ſupplyed, and this Iſland alſo with
Iron, and moſt eſpecially, that this cole
and iron-ſtone, ſhould give the firſt, and
juſt occaſion for the invention of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of iron with pit-cole, no place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo fit for the invention to be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, then this Country, for the general
good; whoſe Woods did formerly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109367:30"/>
in Forreſts, Chaſes, Parks and
Woods, but exhauſted in theſe parts.</p>
            <p>Now for the names of the iron-ſtone,
the firſt meaſure is called the Black-row-graines,
lying in very hard and black
Earth.</p>
            <p>The ſecond meaſure is the Dun-row-graines,
lying in dun earth or clay.</p>
            <p>The third meaſure is called the white
row grains, lying in very white Earth or
Clay, under theſe three meaſure are
ſundry other meaſures, and are called,
firſt, the Rider Stone; ſecondly, the
Cloud Stone; thirdly, the bottom Stone;
fourthly, the Cannock or Cannotſtone,
which laſt may wel be ſo caled (although
all the other meaſures be very good) yet
this Stone is ſo Sulphurous and Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial,
not fit to make Iron; becauſe the
Iron thereof made is very Redſhare,
which is that if a workman ſhould Draw
or Forge out a Share mould fit for a
Plough in that red heat, it would crack
and not be fit for the Uſe of the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109367:30"/>
Plough or Share. I may take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
here to ſpeak of the Nature of
Coldſhare Iron, which is ſo brittle if
made of the grain Oare or Iron ſtone
would be almoſt as brittle as ſome <hi>Regulus
Antimony</hi> made with Iron for which one
ſmall blow over an Anvil you may break
the biggeſt Bar that is, if it be perfect
coldſhare Iron; nay the Plough-man of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
breaks his Share point off if it be
made of coldſhare Iron. But perfect
tough malliable Iron will not break fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
in hot-heat or cold, as coldſhare wil,
or red hot as Sulphurious veneriated red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhare
Iron will; but yet tough enough
when it is cold: All which aforeſaid
qualities of Iron the Authour very well
knoweth how to mend their Natures, by
finning or ſetting the finery, leſſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haw
more borrow which are terms of art,
and by altering and pitching the works,
and plates, the fore ſpirit-plat, the tuiron,
bottome, back and breaſt or fore-plate,
by the altering of which much may be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109367:31"/>
done, if the work be ſet tranſhaw and
tranſiring from the blaſt, the Iron is
more coldſhare leſſe Fined, more to the
Maſters profit; leſſe profitable to him
that makes it into manufactorage, and
leſſe profitable to him that uſeth it; but
the Iron made in a Burrow work, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
more tough and ſerviceable; yet the
nature of all Iron ſtone, is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
both in the Furnace, and in the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that the Sulphurious Arceniall and
Veneriating qualities, which are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in Iron ſtone be made to ſeparate,
in both the works from the fixed and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bodies of Iron, whoſe fiery quality
is ſuch, that he will ſooner ſelf calfine
than ſeparate from any Sulphurious ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriated
quality.</p>
            <p>No man, I hope, need to be offended
at any terms of Art, it hath been alwayes
lawfull for Authours of new Arts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
at their own pleaſures, to give
name to their new Inventions and Arts,
every Tradeſman is allowed it in his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:109367:31"/>
But the Authour hath as much as he
could avoided the terms of Art that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sturtenant</hi> and others have uſed,
which are very many: onely the Author
hath given you the common names and
terms (for the moſt part) which are ſo
common among Forge-men and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
as is nothing more common; but
kept ſecret amongſt them and a myſtery
not yet known, but unto very few Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of Iron-works; nay I have not yet
troubled your memory with any of the
Founder terms, of but making his harth
as the Timpe ſtones, the Wind-wall
ſtones, the Fuiron ſtones, the Botton-ſtone,
the Back-ſtones and the Boſhes,
in the making and picking of which
harth, is much of the Myſtery.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſſe, there is given unto
ſome Phyloſophers, <hi>&amp; filii Artis,</hi> ſome
few terms how the Sulphurious Arſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
Bituminos, Antimoniall, Venerial,
and other poyſonous qualities, either in
the Pit-cole, ſea-cole, or the Iron-ſtone,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109367:32"/>
may be in part at the Furnace ſeparated,
and not permitted to incorporate in the
Iron, and if it be incorporated, yet by Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
at the Forge, to fetch it out; alſo to
melt extract, refine, and reduce all mines
mettals and minerals, unto their ſpecies
with Pit-cole, Sea-cole, Peat, and Turff,
by wayes not yet in uſe, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour

            </p>
            <p>Having ſuffered much, ever ſince the
Year 1618. unto this preſent, for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
good, as by the preceding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
appears for the making of Iron
with Pitcole, Seacole, Peat, and Turff;
for the preſervation of Wood &amp; Timber
of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> ſo much exhauſted, for
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109367:32"/>
future prevention of which,</p>
            <p>Is firſt, to permit the Authour to enjoy
His Pattent, and fully to perfect his ſaid
Inventions (obſtructed in the Reign both
of King <hi>James</hi> and in the Reign of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Majeſty King <hi>Charls</hi> the Firſt, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Bleſſed Memory; and lately ſince
his moſt Sacred Majeſties happy Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration)
who deſires nothing but to be
animated with the Patent revived accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
unto the Statute of 21. <hi>Iacob.</hi> for
Inventors.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to impower the Authour or
any other Agents to take care that no Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole,
or Seacole be any wayes wilfully
deſtroyed under ground.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To put all former good Laws
in Execution, and to make others for the
preſervation of Wood and Timber of
theſe Nations, eſpecially neer Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable
River or Seas.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Seeing there goeth out of
<hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Tuns Annually of Pitcole and Sea-coles
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109367:33"/>
to furniſh <hi>France,</hi> and alſo the Smiths
thereof <hi>Spaine, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
eſpecially the Smiths thereof; the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
and the Smiths thereof, beſides
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> carries great quanties of
our Coles unto Foreigne parts, without
which thoſe Countries cannot ſubſiſt:
Now the Authors deſire, is, that where
there is a conveniency of Iron ſtone or
Ewre, the Coles may not be tranſported
(paying His Sacred Majeſties Duty) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
Order from His Majeſty or his Privy
Council.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That no Pitcole be Exported,
ſeeing that Wood fuell and Timber is
decayed for Buildings, and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
Brickmaking (formerly ſpending
Wood, but now coles) is much in uſe;
alſo is Glaſſe now made with cole, but
formerly were there many Thouſand
Loads of Wood fuell ſpent in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
thereof, and the Glaſs Invention
with Pitcole was firſt effected near the
Authours Dwelling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:109367:33"/>
Sixthly, Making of Steel, Brewings,
making of Coppras, Allum, Salt, caſting
of Braſſe and Copper, Dyings, and many
other Works were not many years ſince
done altogether with the Fuell of Wood
and Charcole; inſtead whereof, Pitcole,
and Seacole is now uſed as Effectually,
and to a far better Uſe and Purpoſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the preſervation of Wood and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, That which is ſomewhat
neerer the mark and Invention; the
Blackſmith forged all his Iron with
Charcole, and in ſome places where they
are cheap, they continue this courſe ſtill,
but ſmall Pitcole and Seacole, and alſo
Peat and Turff hath and doth ſerve the
turn as well and ſufficiently as Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cole.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, That which is neareſt, and
my perfect Invention, and neer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
Dwelling, called <hi>Greens-lodge,</hi>
there are four Forges, namely, <hi>Greens-forge,
Swin-forge, Heath-forge,</hi> and <hi>Crad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-forge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:109367:34"/>
Which Four Forges have Barred all
or moſt part of their Iron with Pitcole
ever ſince the Authours firſt Invention,
1618. which hath preſerved much
Wood: In theſe Four, beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Forges do the like; yet the Author
hath had no benefit thereby to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Yet by this Barring of Iron with Pit-cole
30000 loads of Wood and more
have been preſerved for the general
good, which otherwayes muſt have been
had and conſumed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Symon Sturtevant,</hi> in his <hi>Mettallica,</hi> in
the Epiſtle to the Reader, ſaith, <hi>That there
was then</hi> Anno 12. Jacobi <hi>in</hi> England,
Scotland, Ireland <hi>and</hi> Wales 800 <hi>Furnaces
Forges, or Iron Mills making Iron with Char-cole:</hi>
Now we may ſuppoſe at leaſt 300
of theſe to be Furnaces, and 500 to be
Forges; and each Furnace making fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Tun <hi>per</hi> week of Pig or caſt Iron,
and work or blow but Forty weeks <hi>per
Annum,</hi> but ſome Furnaces make Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109367:34"/>
Tuns of Pig Iron <hi>per</hi> Week, and two
Loads of Charcole or there about, go to
the making of a Tun of Pig Iron: And
two Loads (or two cords) of Wood, at
the leaſt, go to the making of a load of
Charcole.</p>
            <p>Now what Loads of Wood or Char-cole
is ſpent in great <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>Ireland
Annually?</hi> but in one Furnace, that
makes Fifteen Tun <hi>per</hi> Week of Pig-Iron
for Forty weeks: I ſhall give you
the Table, and leave you to judge of the
reſt of the Furnaces.</p>

            <p>By theſe Examples, may you ſee, the
vaſt quanties of Charcole, or Wood,
that the 300 Furnacis ſpend weekly, or
yearly, and the 500. Forges workings
all the year, ſpend little leſſe then the
Furnaces: It being impoſſible, after this
rate for great <hi>Brittains</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
ſupply theſe her works with Charcole in
Fining of Iron at the Fineries, may be
permitted to uſe Charcole, and may be
ſupplyed with under Woods.</p>
            <p>Let us but look back unto the making
of Iron, by our Anceſtors, in foot blaſts,
or bloomenies, that was by men treading
of the Bellows, by which way they could
make but one little lump or bloom of
Iron in a day, not 100 weight, and that
not fuſible, nor fined, or malliable, untill
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109367:35"/>
it were long burned and wrought under
Hammers, and whoſe firſt ſlag, ſinder
or ſcorius, doth contain in it as much, or
more Iron, then in that day the workman
or bloomer got out, which Slag, Scorius,
or Sinder is by our Founders at Furnaces
wrought again, and found to contain
much Yron and eaſier of Fuſion than any
Yron ſtone or Mine of Yron whatſoever
of which ſlag and Sinders, there is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Countryes Millions of Tuns and Oaks
growing upon them, very old and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p>The next invention, was to ſet up the
Bloomeries that went by water, for the
eaſe of the men treading the bellows,
which being bigger, and the waterwheel
cauſing a greater blaſt, did not onely
make a greater quantity of iron, but alſo
extracted more iron out of the ſlag or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and left them more poorer of iron
then the foot-blaſts, ſo that the Founders
cannot melt them again, as they do the
foot-blaſt ſinders to profit: Yet theſe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109367:36"/>
Bloomeries by water (not altogether out
of uſe) do make in one day but two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pound weight of iron, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts,
neither is it feiſible, or malliable,
but is unfined untill it be much burned,
and wrought a ſecond time in fire.</p>
            <p>But ſome of the now going Furnaces
with Charcole, do make two or three
Tun of Pigg or caſt iron in 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>I</hi> do not wholly compute
the vaſt quantities of charcoles and wood
ſpent in theſe voragious works, which
quantity of caſt iron, with pit-cole and
Sea-cole, at one Furnace <hi>I</hi> deſire not, but
am contented with half the proportion,
which once <hi>I</hi> attained unto before my
Bellows were riotouſly cut, that is one
Tun in 24 hours; we need not a greater
quantity, if the like quantity were made
in Furnaces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> which
abounds with Pit-cole and Sea-cole, as
well as <hi>England;</hi> and our ſupernumery
Smiths, Founders, and Forgemen, and
other Tradeſmen might be there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:109367:36"/>
thereby to furniſh His Majeſties
Plantations, as well, if not better then
<hi>England,</hi> where Coles are far cheaper
then in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although vaſt quantities of Coles do
abound near the Authors dwelling, yet
twenty thouſand Smiths or Naylors at
the leaſt dwelling near theſe parts, and
taking of Prentices, have made their
Trade ſo bad, that many of them are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to ſtarve and ſteal; ſo that it is wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there were ſome courſes taken to
mend their Trade, imploy them in other
parts, or permit them, not to take ſo
many Prentices, all which have great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
to uſe Pit-cole, and had not theſe
parts abounded with cole, it would have
been a great deal worſe with them then
it is; but of the cole there is, nor will be
any want, nor of iron-ſtone.</p>
