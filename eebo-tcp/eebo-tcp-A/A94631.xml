            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right Honorable the Lord Maior, Aldermen,
and Citizens, in Common-Councel aſſembled. The humble Petition of the Youngmen and Apprentices of the City of London,
and the Liberties thereof;</head>
            <opener>SHEWING,</opener>
            <p>THat your Petitioners finding the great decay of Trade, (and that by trade this City ſubſiſts,) and that
thereby their Maſters, whom they ſerve, are maintained, and already are much impoveriſhed by the
decay thereof; and thereby, and by the burthens impoſed upon them, are in a ſhort time like to be
ruined; and your Petitioners expectation, by their ſervice, to enjoy any benefit of Trade hereafter, or to live
with any comfort, to their great diſcouragement, as yet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is vain and hopeleſs: And that the Peace in this
Kingdom, by the Judgment of the Councel of this City, and of all the Adjacent Counties (as by their ſeveral
Printed Petitions may appear) will not be had but by a Perſonal Treaty with his Majeſty; And that that
Treaty by the Judgment of your Lordſhip, the Aldermen and Common Councel of the City, and the Officers
of the Trained Bands, for the place, is conceived to be in this City, as the fitteſt and moſt convenient.</p>
            <p>And whereas the two honorable Houſes of Parliament ſeem jealous that there may be tumults raiſed in the
time of Treaty; We your Petitioners do not only engage that no ſuch tumults ſhall be raiſed by us, but that
if any be raiſed by any ill affected Perſons whatſoever, we ſhall be ready to ſpend our lives in their ſuppreſſing.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding, ſome factious perſons, who having enriched themſelves by this unnatural War, (being
adverſe to all Peace and ſetledneſs, and eſpecially to the Fundamental Government of this Kingdom by MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARCHY,
and the eſtabliſhed Laws which we have covenanted to maintain) do endeavor to obtain from
this Honorable Court, by ſome Petition of theirs, that the ſaid Treaty may be defenſive, which tends in effect
(and is their deſign) it may not be at all.</p>
            <p>And that <hi>London</hi> is the fitteſt place for the ſaid Treaty, theſe Reaſons do evince in our underſtanding; (viz.)
Firſt, For that is the only ſafe place for the preſervation of his Majeſties perſon. Secondly, For that it is his
Majeſties Chamber. Thirdly, For that he is there neer his great Councel. Fourthly, For that all other
places have been as yet unſucceſsful. Fifthly, From hence no Force can ſurprize him. And ſixthly, It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that the ſtain of fomenting this War be taken off from this City, by ſome ſignal demonſtration of the
loyalty of the City to his Majeſties Perſon.</p>
            <p>We therefore humbly pray that your Lordſhip and the reſt of this Councel will adhere to your former late
Reſolutions, and not render us deſperate as perſons that muſt be voyd of any expectation of the fruit of
our ſervices by any continuing Trade: for it is our apprehenſion and the judgment of many wiſe men,
that Peace muſt be concluded by a Perſonal Treaty in this City, or not at all: And if no Peace be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
the Trade, we ſhall be ſure of, is of Blood, Spoyl, Famine, and Bondage, which make us
deſire,
<list>
                  <item>1. That you will give no countenance to any ſuch Petition ſo deſtructive to his Majeſty and his Poſterity,
the Peace of the Kingdom and Welfare of this City.</item>
                  <item>2. That no private Liſtings be further made in this City until ſuch Treaty.</item>
                  <item>3. That there may be a Ceſſation of Arms procured by your mediation in all parts of the Kingdom, until the
Treaty be ended; and that a ſpeedy courſe be taken to disband all Armies.</item>
                  <item>4. That your Lordſhip and this Honorable Court would be pleaſed to preſent theſe our Deſire to the two
Houſes of Parliament.</item>
               </list>

            <closer>And we ſhall ever pray.</closer>
