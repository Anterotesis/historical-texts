         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>My Reverend Brethren,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Have little more to add to what I have given you in Charge this Morning. I ſhall therefore only recommend it to you to aſſiſt me in rendring this Viſitation, which has called you many Score, and my ſelf many Thouſand Miles, as uſeful as poſſible. For I would not have a <hi>Viſitation</hi> here reproachfully ſtil'd a <hi>Vexation,</hi> as ſome have been pleaſed to term the Meetings of the Clergy of this ſort, from their ſuppoſed uſeleſs Charge, and Trouble. And as the only way to render what has been ſaid uſeful, in the ſucceeding Courſe of your Miniſtry, is, to put all the Particulars thereof into Practice; ſo the likelieſt Means to reduce it to that, will be, to take into Conſideration the ſeveral Branches of this Morning's Charge, and to form ſome Reſolutions purſuant to the ſame. Only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we have all ſo much Reaſon to be ſenſible of the late Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment which our Church receiv'd after ſo terrible a Shock, I think it will become Perſons of our Character and Function to be in the firſt place, as thankful to God, ſo to ſignifie our Gratitude to Man, thoſe particularly who had the chief hand in Accompliſhing ſo Glorious a Work. And therefore, if you pleaſe, before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to other Buſineſs, let us conſider who <hi>are fit to be addreſſed to in this Province</hi> by us, on the Account of the late <hi>Act of Religion.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordered</hi> by his Reverence, and the Clergy here met, That our moſt humble and hearty Thanks be ſent to his Excellency, for his late Noble Zeal and Conduct towards the Re-eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this Province; and that Mr. <hi>Lilliſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nobbes,</hi> do wait upon his Excellency with the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordered,</hi> That his Excellency be acquainted, that we have received and read his kind Letter in reference to Mrs. <hi>Moor;</hi> and do aſſure his Excellency, that we ſhall always Religiouſly obſerve the Canons of the Church, and the Laws of this Province, in this, and all other like Caſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordered,</hi> That the Thanks of his Reverence and the Clergy be returned to Colonel <hi>Thomas Smithſon,</hi> Speaker of the Honourable Houſe of Aſſembly, with their Requeſt, that the ſame Thanks may be communicated by him to the reſt of the Members of Aſſembly, for their ſo <hi>Honourably Re-eſtabliſhing Religion</hi> by an unanimous Conſent.</p>
            <p>And as we are given to underſtand, by the Aſſembly's Anſwer to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency's Speech, that this was done by them chiefly with a reſpect to the well Principling of their Children and Poſterity: So let it be aſſured, that, by the Divine Aſſiſtance, this ſhall be our particular Care. And that Mr. <hi>Lilliſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Howell,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Trotter,</hi> be deſired to ſignifie the ſame to him.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That the ſame Care ſhall be taken as to the 2<hi>d.</hi> Claſs; that is, thoſe who are above the Age of 9, and under 13. And that we will put them upon getting alſo by heart ſome ſhort Expoſition upon it, with Scripture Proofs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> As to the 3<hi>d.</hi> Claſs, That we will endeavour all we can to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade ſo many of the young People of our reſpective Pariſhes, as poſſible, to read ſuch Books as we ſhall adviſe them, more particularly ſuch as ſhall be judged moſt proper to inſtruct them in the Nature, Terms, and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace, in order to introduce them to the <hi>Lord's-Supper;</hi> and that in order to engage them betimes more effectually to a good Life. And that we will endeavour to have them meet us every <hi>Lord's-Day,</hi> at the Church, or at ſuch other Times and Places as ſhall be thought moſt convenient, to confer with us upon the Subject of their laſt Reading. That the better to engage them to meet us to ſuch purpoſes, we will endeavour to have them taught to ſing, at thoſe Conferences, the New Verſion of Pſalms, according to the beſt Tunes.</p>
            <p>And that we may be the better able to ſeaſon the Country with Vertue and Sobriety, by thoſe of our own Houſhold, his Reverence be deſired to write to the <hi>Stweards</hi> of the <hi>Religious Societies</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> to provide them with ſuch Servants capable to ſing Pſalms after the New Verſion, and beſt Tunes, to officiate as Clerks of Pariſhes, and ſuch as can write.</p>
            <p>

               <p>And that proper Books may not be wanting for the ſeveral Claſſes of Catechumens, there is Care taken for the ſeveral ſorts, which may be all had in this Town.

               <p>I think we have now gone through all the Parts of <hi>Miniſterial Inſtruction.</hi> In Reference to each of which you ſeem to have form'd ſuch good Reſolutions, as (by the Bleſſing of God upon your Endeavours) will render you the happy Inſtruments of much Glory to God, and of ſaving many Souls. And if the Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements of the moſt ſenſible in this Country have been very large to me, as to your Satisfaction, I can aſſure you, they have freely owned, that there is a ſenſible Alteration over the Province for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince they have had a Clergy amongſt them; you may Reaſonably expect, that upon Conducting your ſelves through the Courſe of your Miniſtry in the manner you have now propoſed, you will become very dear and valuable to all your People.</p>
               <p>But ſtill it remains, my <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> to perfect ſuch Rules as will encreaſe our Favour with God and Man, that to our
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45972:6"/>
good <hi>Doctrine,</hi> we add this; that we form and maintain amongſt our ſelves a good <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> both ſuch as may <hi>prevent</hi> from coming over a ſort of Men, that will infallibly give Scandal to the People, and bring Diſgrace upon our ſelves; and ſuch as will <hi>Cut</hi> off from amongſt us Perſons of thoſe gangreen'd and putrify'd Morals, as will be in danger to corrupt, and vitiate both your ſelves, and the People committed to your Charge.</p>
               <p>Now, in the way of <hi>Prevention,</hi> I think it would be of very great conſequence, could we throughly inform our ſelves concerning the Conduct and Deportment, on Shipboard, of thoſe who come over as <hi>Miſſionaries</hi> here amongſt us; for by a ſorrowful Experience I can aſſure you, that as in ſome Ships there are Temptations of all kinds, ſo the ſcandalous Compliances of a Miniſter on Shipboard will ſpread more from ſuch a Place, than ſhould he commit them pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly upon the Change. For Paſſengers, both free and Servants, being uſually very numerous; theſe no ſooner come to Land, but they immediately diſperſe themſelves into all the Parts of this, and perhaps of the Neighbouring Provinces. And as any Miſcarriages of the Clergy are generally uppermoſt in the Mouths of the <hi>Proteſtant Laity;</hi> ſo the ill Example of any one Miniſter coming over, will be the common Subject of Diſcourſe for Months atfer, wherever theſe Perſons go, to the alienating the Affections of thoſe of our own Communion towards us, and the Encreaſe of thoſe Prejudices which our Adverſaries, both <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Quakers,</hi> have againſt us. I could therefore heartily wiſh, that you would make it your Care to be throughly informed, (as it will be no difficult matter to be) when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any Ship comes into any of your Rivers, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether there be any Miniſter on Board. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether in his whole Paſſage he gave no manner of Scandal. And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whether he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly read Prayers twice a day, and catechize and preach on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days;</hi> which, notwithſtanding the common Excuſes, I know can be done, and to good Purpoſes too, by a Miniſter of any Zeal for Religion. And if he ſhould be found wanting in any of theſe, it will be much eaſier to prevent his Entertainment here, than to work a Reformation in him, when he is once of us; or to exclude him afterwards, for any the greateſt Miſcarriages, from amongſt us.</p>
               <p>But tho much may be done by theſe means to <hi>prevent</hi> vicious and ſcandalous Men from coming in to us, in which your Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence concerning their Conduct on Shipboard will be a great Aſſiſtance to me; yet it will too often happen, that that alone will not do the Work, but ſuch <hi>Offences will come,</hi> as ſhall extreamly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45972:6"/>
both us and our Miniſtry, if not cured by a ſevere Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or a total Exciſion, as the Caſe ſhall require.</p>
               <p>And indeed, it is my Opinion, that the leaſt Mercy is due to a ſcandalous Clergy-Man of all other Criminals; or at leaſtwiſe, that from us, ſuch, of all others, have the leaſt Reaſon to expect it. Every Miniſter in Holy Orders, true it is, he is our Brother, and ought to be dear to us above all other Men as ſuch; more eſpecially as a Fellow-Labourer with us in the Work of the Miniſtry: But then really, as in reſpect of God, every Chriſtian is commanded to <hi>Hate, even his Father and Mother, and Wife and Children, Brethren and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, or he cannot be Chriſt's Diſciple:</hi> So out of a true Chriſtian Zeal to the Glory of God, the Good of Souls, and the Honour of our Sacred Function; ſuch Men amongſt us as ſhall ſo fatally wound all theſe, as the Vices of one in Holy Orders will ever do, ought to be odious and hateful to all of us. And indeed I do think, that our Treatment of them ought to be ſomething like that which was commanded the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> towards their Brethren fal'n into Idolatry, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. the Parallel of which, being it may ſo eaſily be drawn to our purpoſe, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the Words at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thy Brother, the Son of thy Mother, or thy Son, or thy Daughter, or the Wife of thy Boſom, or thy Friend, which is as dear as thine own Soul, entice thee ſecretly, ſaying, Let us go and ſerve other Gods; thou ſhalt not conſent unto him, nor hearken unto him, neither ſhall thine Eye pity him, neither ſhalt thou ſpare, neither ſhalt thou conceal him; but thou ſhalt ſurely kill him, thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him to put him to Death, and afterwards the hands of all the People; and thou ſhalt ſtone him with Stones that he die, becauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thine Eye ſhall not pity him, tho' thy Brother; neither ſhalt thou ſpare him, neither ſhalt thou conceal him; thine hand ſhall be firſt upon him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath ſought to thruſt thee away from the Lord thy God.</hi> And ſurely an impious and vicious Clergy-Man hath, of all others, the leaſt Reaſon to expect a partial and favourable Treatment from us, when we conſider, not only that the Honour of God, and the Good of Souls, which ought of all things to be deareſt to us, do ſo wofully ſuffer from ſuch; but we our ſelves are ſo much injur'd by them, that Men abhor the Offerings of the Lord, and deſpiſe our Perſons and our Function upon their account; inſomuch, that you may ever obſerve, that the Miſcarriages of one unhappy Clergy-Man ſhall be more taken Notice of, to our Diſparagement, than the moſt Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45972:7"/>
and moſt laborious Lives of Ten the beſt Men in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood ſhall be ſpoken of, to the Commendation, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Order.</p>
               <p>I muſt needs own to you, that, for my own part, I am very apt to ſuſpect thoſe, as not great Enemies to a vicious Life them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that, of all Men, can be favourable to an immoral Prieſt. But, I thank God, I have no Reaſon on this account to ſuſpect you, who did lately ſo unanimouſly concur with me in that Letter I ſent to my much Eſteemed Brother, his <hi>Reverence,</hi> the Commiſſary of <hi>Virginia,</hi> on the account of one who had lately ſo wofully behaved himſelf. And the Requeſt wherein you joined with me, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhould be admitted to hold any Cure of Souls there, he ſhould be obliged to make ſome <hi>Penitential,</hi> and that a <hi>publick</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, for the Scandal he hath given, to the Danger of many within this Province, gives me the Satisfaction, that I have a Clergy under me, that will not baſely and cowardly ſuffer their Holy Religion and Function to be inſulted and contemn'd, for want of a due Animadverſion upon thoſe, eſpecially of their own Order, who ſhall give Occaſion for it. I beſeech you do not fail me in thoſe good Expectations I have of you in this Matter alſo, as well as the former; but let me ſee, by your good Reſolutions, that you have an equal Zeal, as for the <hi>Inſtruction</hi> of the Laity, ſo for the <hi>Regulation</hi> of the Clergy. And firſt let me deſire you to concur in what may be neceſſary, for the <hi>Prevention</hi> of ſcandalous Miniſters from Coming over, or at leaſtwiſe from Settling amongſt you.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>The Clergy then deſired his Reverence to lay before them the Letter which was ſent to the Commiſſary of <hi>Virginia,</hi> concerning the Miniſter that lately gave ſuch Scandal; which was accordingly read.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That as well we of the Clergy, who, by reaſon of diſtance, were not conven'd by his Reverence on the Subject Matter of the Letter now read, as the reſt of our Brethren, who then met, do unanimouſly conſent to what had been therein deſired, as to Mr. <hi>W</hi>—'s <hi>Penitential</hi> Acknowledgment, in order to take off the Scandal which he may have given to ſeveral Paſſengers, now ſettled in our reſpective Pariſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That to prevent, as far as in us lies, any ſcandalous Miniſters from Coming hereafter into this Province, and being ſettled in this Church, we will, upon the firſt Notice of the Arrival of any in the Rivers within our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Pariſhes, inform our ſelves the beſt we can concerning their Behaviour, and the due Performance of the Offices belonging to their Function, whilſt on Shipboard; and that we will, as ſoon after as poſſibly, tranſmit an Account of the ſame to his Reverence.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Methods</hi> which you here propoſe, I dare promiſe, will in a great meaſure prevent ſuch from Coming into this Church, who would be miſchievous to it. For you may ever obſerve, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate and looſe Perſons of any kind will ſoon find out the Reaſons they ſhould ſteer their Courſe another way than where Diſcipline meets them. And, let me tell you, it is much eaſier to prevent an ill Habit of Body, by a gentle Purge at firſt, than to cure a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>green by Amputation, or Exciſion afterwards: which, I do aſſure you, Mr. <hi>T</hi>—even in your Caſe, which challenges the leaſt Pity, would be an harſh and uneaſie Operation. You know, <hi>Sir,</hi> the general and publick Fame through the Province, is, That you are a <hi>Polygamiſt,</hi> having Married a Wife here, tho you had at the ſame time, and it is thought ſtill have, one alive in <hi>England.</hi> But it is not from general and publick Report that you ſhall be accuſed of this enormous Crime. There appears enough from your Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and your own Confeſſion, as I find it. recorded in the Council-Book, to render you unworthy of that Sacred Character you bear, or to live in any Church.

                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You are to conſider, That in this General Viſitation, it is not deſigned to proceed forthwith judicially upon you; but to take in ſuch Preſentments and Informations as ſhall be made againſt you. And, I conceive, ſo conſiderable a Record as you have now heard, will ſuffice to found a Libel upon. But tho your Crime
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45972:8"/>
ſhould be as great as it appears to be, God forbid that you ſhould not have a due time allowed you to make your Defence. No, <hi>Sir,</hi> your Defence is what I deſire, and would heartily rejoice to ſee. But then you muſt take care that it be a good one, ſuch as may be Satisfactory to all Perſons that will be ſatisfied with Reaſon; or otherwiſe, your Impunity will continue to expoſe this poor Infant Church to the ſame Dangers, Inſults, and Indignities, which the Scandal you are ſuppoſed to have given has hitherto cauſed, from its Enemies; and which, by your own Confeſſion, granting your Crime to be that of Fornication, is not groundleſs. And indeed, <hi>Sir,</hi> if you will weigh your own, and the Church's Intereſt, in an equal Ballance, you will have as little Reaſon to expect Partiality on your own ſide, as ever any Man, who pretended to Favour. For ſhould it prove true, that you are guilty of the Fact, beſides, that in its nature it is the moſt atrocious one that can eaſily be named, it has theſe four Aggravations belonging to it, than which I can ſcarcely imagine any Enormity capable of greater. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it is done by a Perſon in Holy Orders. <hi>Secondly,</hi> By a <hi>Miſſionary,</hi> (which, by the way, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> ſhould be a Conſideration of no ſmall weight with all of us.) <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to Time; that this Scandal is given at a Juncture when our Church here is weakeſt, and our Friends ſeem to be feweſt, and our Enemies ſtrongeſt. And what more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Argument could they uſe, then, <hi>You ſee what ſort of Perſons the</hi> 40 <hi>l. per Pole goes to maintain.</hi> And, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> as to Place, it ſo happens, that you are ſeated in the midſt of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> nay, within two Miles of Mr. <hi>Hunter,</hi> the Chief amongſt the numerous Prieſts at this time in this Province; and who, I am credibly informed, by the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Gentlemen in theſe Parts, has made that Advantage of your ſcandalous Living, that there have been more Perverſions made to <hi>Popery</hi> in that Part of <hi>Mary-Land,</hi> ſince your Polygamy has been the Talk of the Country, than in all the time it has been an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony. Theſe Conſiderations, <hi>Sir,</hi> do make it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that all poſſible Expedition, which is conſiſtent with common Juſtice, ſhould be made in this Affair, ſo as to acquit you, or condemn you. And therefore, to divide equally between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Juſtice from the Church, and your ſelf, what think you of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> next to make your Appearance in this Place, with a Reſerve to my ſelf, to adjourn to a further time, as there ſhall be Occaſion.</p>

               <p>I heartily thank you, my <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> for the good Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you have given me in this Viſitation; but eſpecially for your ready Concurrence in all that I have propos'd, as requiſite, to put this Church in ſome Order, and your ſelves in a Method of doing the greateſt Good in it. All that I have more to add, is, That we ſhould look back upon the Deliverance this Infant Church has ſo lately receiv'd, as having been, in humane Appearance, totally ſtifl'd, and extinguiſh'd, till the Re-eſtabliſhment it has receiv'd, within a few Days, by a new Law. I was always indeed of the Opinion, that it would be more the Calamity of the Province, than of you, to have your Support taken away from you, and your ſelves return home; and therefore often did beſpeak the People, in theſe words; <hi>Weep not for us; Weep for your ſelves, O ye Daughters of Jeruſalem;</hi> aſſuring them, that thoſe amongſt you who had deſerved well, ſhould be better provided for elſewhere, if the Law of Religion were not renewed. However, upon the Church's Account, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us of the Clergy to be the firſt in Gratitude to God of all kinds; and in this eſpecially. And, I humbly conceive, that cannot be better expreſt, than by conſidering the deſtitute Condition of a poor Siſter Church, very near us, ſtruggling hard for Life, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Comfort of Miniſters, and that Settlement which this, by the Divine Goodneſs, does again enjoy. And methinks it would be a ſuitable Return from us, ſhould we ſubſcribe, out of our Penury, each of us a little, towards the Maintaining of one more Miniſter in it, to aſſiſt in the Converſion of many People, who do there ſeem to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>After which, the Viſitation being about to cloſe up, the Clergy did very much preſs his <hi>Reverence,</hi> both in Debate, and by Reaſons offered in Writing, that he would pleaſe to take a Voyage into <hi>England,</hi> upon the Service of this Church, as conceiving he would be capable of doing it much more Service at home the remaining part of this Year, than by his Preſence here, till his next Viſitation, which they earneſtly requeſt he would Perſonally make amongſt them.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Nobbes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Colbatch</hi> wait upon his Excellency, to inform his Excellency, that the Clergy crave leave to lay ſome things before his Excellency, before the Concluſion of the Viſitation; which accordingly they did; and return'd Anſwer, That his Excellency was always ready to receive what they ſhould offer.</p>
