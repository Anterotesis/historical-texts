         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of this Church, which had beene before in great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to our unspeakable comfort established amongst us, were moved to present many earnest desires and humble supplications to his sacred Majestie, for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a free generall Assembly, as the only legall and readie meane to try these innovations, to purge out the corruptions, and settle the order of the church, for the good of Religion, the honour of the King, and the comfort and peace of the Kirk and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: It pleased his gracious Majestie, out of his Royall bountie, to direct unto this Kingdome, the Noble and Potent Lord, <hi>James</hi> Marques of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miltoun,</hi> with Commission to heare and redresse the just grievances of the good Subjects, who by many petitions, and frequent conferences, being fully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the absolute necessitie of a free generall Assemblie, as the only Judicatorie which had power to remedie those evils, was pleased to undergoe the paines of a voyage to <hi>England</hi> for presenting the pitifull condition of our Church to his sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie; And the said Commissioner his Grace retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe in August last, with power to indict an Assembly, but with the condition of such prelimitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as did both destroy the freedome of an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, and could no wayes cure the present di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases of this Church: which was made so clearly apparent to his Grace, that for satisfying the reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable desire of the Subjects, groaning under the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse and prejudices of longsome attendance, Hee was againe pleased to under-take another journey to His Majestie, and promised to endeavour to obtaine a free Generall Assemblie, without any prelimitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either of the constitution and members, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb facs="tcp:17451:3"/>
to be treated, or manner, and order of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, so that if any question should arise concerning these particulars, the same should bee cognosced, judged, and determined by the Assemblie, as the onely judge competent: And accordingly by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from our Sacred Soveraigne, returned to this Kingdome, and in September last, caused indict a free Generall Assemblie, to be holden at <hi>Glasgow,</hi> the 21. of November instant, to the unspeakable joy of all good Subjects and Christian hearts, who thereby did expect the perfect satisfaction of their long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; and the finall remedie of their pressing grievances: But these hopes were soone blasted: for albeit the Assemblie did meet and begin at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed day, and hath hitherto continued, still assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with his Graces personall presence, yet His Grace hath never allowed any freedome to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, competent to it by the Word of God, acts and practise of this church, and his Majesties Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but hath laboured to restraine the same, by protesting against all the acts made therein, and against the constitution therof by such members, as by all law reason and custome of this church were ever admitted in our free Assemblies, and by denying his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to the things proponed and coucluded, though most cleare, customable, and uncontraverted.</p>
            <p>And now since his Grace after the presenting and reading of his own commission from our sacred So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne, and after his seeing all our commissions from Presbyteries and Burghes produced and examined, and the assembly constitute of all the members by unanimous consent, doth now to our greater griefe without any just cause or occasion offered by us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
<pb facs="tcp:17451:4"/>
depart and discharge any further meeting, or proceeding in this Assembly, under the paine of treason; and after seven dayes sitting, declare all Acts made, or heereafter to be made in this Assembly, to be of no force nor strength; and that for such causes as are either expressed in his Maiesties former proclamations, (and so are answered in our former protestations) or set downe in the declinatour, and protestation presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in name of the Prelats, (which are fully cleared in our answere made thereto) or else were long since proponed by the Commissioner his G. in his eleven articles or demands sent unto us, before the indiction of the Assembly (and so were satisfied by our answers, which his Grace acknowledged, by promising after the recept thereof to procure a free generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, with power to determine upon all questions, anent the members, manner, and matters thereof) all which for avoyding tediousnesse wee heere repeat: Or otherwise the said causes alleadged by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, were proponed by His Grace, in the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie; such as first, that the Assemblie refused to reade the Declinatour and Protestation exhibited by the Prelats, which neverthelesse was publicklie read and considered by the assemblie, immediatly after the election of a Moderatour and constitution of the Members, before the which, there was no assemblie established, to whom the same could have been read: Next, that ruling Elders were permitted to have voyce in the election of commissioners from Presbyteries, which was knowne to His Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the indiction and meeting of the assembly, and is so agreeable to the acts and practise of this church, inviolably observed before the late times of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:17451:4"/>
that not one of the assembly doubted thereof, to whom by the indiction and promise of a free as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, the determination of that question, anent the members constituent propertie belonged.</p>
            <p>And last, that the voyces of the six Assessors, who did sit with His Grace, were not asked and numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which we could not conceive to bee any just cause of offence, since after 39. Nationall assemblies of this reformed church, where neither the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, nor any in his name was present, at the humble and earnest desire of the assembly, His Maiesty graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously vouchsafed His presence either in His owne Royall Person, or by a commissioner, not for voting or multiplying of voyces, but as Princes and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of old, in a Princely manner to countenance that meeting, and to preside in it for externall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and if Wee had been honoured with His Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties Personall presence, His Maiestie (according to the practice of King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memorie) would have only given his own Iudgment in voting of matters, and would not have called others who had not been cloathed with commission from the church to carry things by pluralitie of voyces.</p>
            <p>Therefore in conscience of our duetie to God and his trueth, the King and his honour, the Church and her liberties, this Kingdome and her peace, this Assemblie and her freedome, to our selves and our safetie, to our Posteritie, Persons and Estates, Wee professe with sorrowfull and heavie, but loyall hearts. That Wee cannot dissolve this Assemblie, for the reasons following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the reasons alreadie printed anent the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conveening a Generall Assemblie, which are
<pb facs="tcp:17451:5"/>
now more strong in this case, seeing the assemblie was alreadie indicted by his Maiesties authoritie, did conveene, and is fully constitute in all the members thereof, according to the Word of <hi>GOD,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline of this church, in the presence and audience of his Maiesties Commissioner; who hath reallie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the same, by assisting therein seven dayes, and exhibition of His Maiesties Royall Declaration, to bee registrate in the bookes of this assemblie, which accordingly is done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the reasons contained in the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations made in name of the Noblemen, Barons, Burgesses, Ministers, and Commons, whereunto We doe now iudicially adhere, as also unto the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Faith and covenant, subscribed and sworne by the body of this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because as Wee are obliged by the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and explication subioyned necessarily to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Faith subscribed by Us; So the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, and his Commissioner, and Privie Councell; have urged many of this kingdome to subscribe the Confession of Faith made in <hi>anno</hi> 1580. and 1590: and so to returne to the doctrine and discipline of this Church, as it was then professed: But it is cleare by the doctrine and discipline of this church, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the booke of Policie then registrate in the bookes of assemblie, and subscribed by the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of this church; That it was most unlawfull in it self, and preiudiciall to these priviledges which Christ in his Word hath left to his church, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve or breake up the assemblie of this church, or to stoppe and stay their proceedings in constitution of acts for the welfare of the church, or execution of
<pb facs="tcp:17451:5"/>
discipline against offenders; and so to make i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> appeare, that Religion and Church-government should depend absolutely upon the pleasure of the Prince.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because there is no ground of pretence either by Act of Assemblie, or Parliament, or any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding practice, whereby the Kings Majestie may lawfully dissolve the Generall Assemblie of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> far lesse His Majesties Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioner, who by his commission hath power to indict and keep it, <hi>secundùm legem &amp; praxim:</hi> But upon the contrary, His Majesties prerogative Royall, is declared by Act of Parliament, to be nowayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the priviledges and liberties, which God hath granted to the spirituall office-bearers, and meetings of this Church; which are most frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ratified in Parliaments, and especially in the last Parliament holden by His Maiestie himself, which priviledges and liberties of the church, his Maiesty will never diminish or infringe, being bound to maintaine the same in integritie by solemne oath given at His Royall Coronation in this Kingdome.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Assemblies of this Church have still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed this freedome of uninterrupted sitting, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or notwithstanding any contramand, as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident by all the Records thereof; and in speciall by the generall Assembly holden in <hi>anno</hi> 1582. which being charged with letters of Horning by the Kings Maiestie his Commissioner and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, to stay their processe against Master <hi>Robert Montgomerie,</hi> pretended Bishop of <hi>Glasgow,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to dissolve and rise, did notwithstanding shew their libertie and freedome, by continuing
<pb facs="tcp:17451:6"/>
and sitting still, and without any stay, going on in that processe against the said Master <hi>Robert,</hi> to the finall end thereof: And thereafter by letter to his Maiestie, did shew clearly, how far his Majestie had been uninformed, and upon misinformation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged the prerogative of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of this Church, and did inact and ordaine, that none should procure any such warrant or charge under the pain of excommunication.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Because now to dissolve, after so many sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and complaints, after so many reiterated promises, after our long attendance and expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after so many references of processes from Presbyteries, after the publick indiction of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie, and the solemne Fast appointed for the same, after frequent convention, formall constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Assemblie in all the members thereof a and seven dayes sitting, were by this act to offend God, contemne the Subjects petitions, deceive many of their conceived hopes of redresse of the calamities of the Church and Kingdome, multiply the combustions of this Church, and make every man despaire heereafter ever to see Religion esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, Innovations removed, the Subjects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint respected, or the offenders punished with consent of authoritie, and so by casting the church loose and desolate, would abandon both to ruine.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is most necessary to continue this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie for preveening the prejudices which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue upon the pretence of two Covenants, whereas indeed there is but one.

            <p n="3">3.
