            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

She was descended of honest and wealthie parents. Her father had borne diuerse offices of worship in his companie,<note place="margin">

               </note> amongest whom he liued in good account, credit &amp; estimation all his daies: he was zealous in the truth, and of a sound religion. Her mother was a Dutch woman, both discreete and wise, of singular good grace &amp; modestie: and which did most of all adorne her, shee was both religious, and also zealous. This couple liuing together in the Citie of London certaine yeares, it pleased God to blesse them with Children, of whom this <hi>Katherine</hi> was yongest saue one. But as she was yongest saue one by course of nature: so was she not inferiour to any of the rest, or rather farre excelled them all without comparison by many degrees, in the induments &amp; quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mind. At xv. yeares of age (her father being dead) her mother bestowed her in mariage to one Maister <hi>Philip Stubbes,</hi>

                  <hi>Her mariage.</hi>

And aboue al, for her feruent zeale which she bare to the truth, wherein she seemed to surpasse ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: in so much, as if she chanced at any time to be in place where either Papists, or Atheists were, and heard them talke of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of what countenaunce or credit soeuer they seemed to be, she

would not yeeld a iote, nor giue place vnto them at al, but would most mightily iustifie the truth of God, agaynst their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous vntruths, and conuince them, yea, &amp; confound them by the testimonies of the word of God.<note place="margin">

               </note> Which thing how could it bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise? for her whole heart was bent to seeke the Lord, her whole delight was to be conuersant in the scriptures, &amp; to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon them day and night: in so much that you could seldome or neuer haue come into her house, and haue found her without a bible, or some other good booke in her hands. And when she was not reading, she would spend the time in conferring, talking and reasoning with her busband of the worde of God, and of religion: asking him, what is the sense of this place, and what is the sense of that? How expound you this place, and how expound you that? what obserue you of this place, and what obserue you of that? so that she seemed to be as it were,<note place="margin">

               </note> rauished with the same spirit that <hi>Dauid</hi> was, when he said: The zeale of thy house hath eaten me vp. She followed the commaundement of our sauiour Christ, who biddeth vs to search the scriptures, for in them ye hope to haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life. She obeyed the commandement of the Apostle, who biddeth women to bee silent, and to learne of their husbandes at home. She would suffer no disorder or abuse in her house, to be either vnreproued,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Her gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
               </note> or vnreformed. And so gentle was she &amp; curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of nature, that she was neuer heard to giue any the lie in all her life, nor so much as to (thou) any in anger. She was neuer knowne to fall out with any of her neighbours, nor with the least child that liued, much lesse to scold or brawle, as many will now a daies for euery trifle, or rather for no cause at al: &amp; so solitary was she giuen, that she would verie seldome or neuer, &amp; that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great constraint (&amp; than not neither, except her husband were in companie) goe abroad with any, either to banquet or feast, to gossip or make merry (as they tearme it) in so much that she hath beene noted to do it in contempt and disdaine of others.</p>
            <p>When her husband was abroad in London, or elsewhere, there was not the dearest friend she had in the world that could get her abroad to dinner or supper, or to any disports, plaies, enterludes, or pastimes whatsoeuer: neither was shee giuen to pamper her bodie with delicate meates, wines, or strong drinkes, but rather refrained them altogether, saying, that we should eate to liue,
<pb facs="tcp:4835:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not liue to eat. And as shee excelled in the gift of sobrietie, so shee surpassed in the vertue of humilitie. For it is well knowne to diuers yet liuing, that she vtterly abhorred all kinde of pride both in apparell, and otherwise. She could neuer abide to heare any filthy or vnseemly talke of scurrilitie, bawdrie or vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, neither swearing or blaspheming, cursing or banning, but woulde reprooue them sharpely, shewing them the vengeaunce of GOD due for such deserts. And which is more, there was neuer one filthie, vncleane, vndecent, or vnseemely word heard to come forth of her mouth, nor euer once to curse or ban, to swear, or blaspheme God any maner of way: but alwayes her speaches were such, as both might glorifie God,<note place="margin">

And for her conuersation, there was neuer any man or woman that euer opened their mouthes against her, or that euer either did or could once accuse her of the least shadow of dishonestie, so continently she liued, and so circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly she walked, eschuing euen the very outward appearance or shewe of euill.</p>
            <p>Againe, for true loue and loyaltie to her husband, &amp; his friends, she was (let me speake it without offence) I thinke, the rarest Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon in the world: for she was so far of from disswading her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to be beneficiall to his friends, that she wold rather perswade him to be more beneficial to them.

And so little giuen was she to this world, that some of her neighbours maruailing why shee was no more carefull of it, would aske her sometimes saying: Mistres <hi>Stubbes,</hi> why are you no more carefull for the things of this lyfe, but sit alwayes poaring vppon a Booke, and reading? to whom she would answere: if I should be a friend vnto this world, I should be an enemie to GOD:<note place="margin">

               <p>These Sacraments (I say) are Seales and signes of holie things,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and therefore cannot be the things themselues. For it is against the nature of a Sacrament, to be the thing signified ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Baptisme consisteth of two natures, the visible Element, and the inuisible grace. The visible Element is water, the inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible grace is the gifts and graces of the holy Ghost, conferred in baptisme. The water signifieth vnto vs, that our whole nature is corrupted, and had need to be purged and cleansed. It signifieth also vnto vs, our regeneration, sanctification and new birth. And it representeth also vnto vs the bloud of Iesus Christ, which cleanseth vs from all sinnes. And I faithfully beleeue, that it is no more lawfull for a woman to minister this Sacrament, then it is lawfull for her to preach, or to minister the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>And as concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, I beleeue and confesse, that it consisteth of two natures also, an

earthly, and an heauenly nature or quality. The visible element or earthly nature is bread &amp; wine: the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly nature or quality, the body and bloud of Christ signified thereby. The wine doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present vnto vs the bloud of Christ which was shed for vs: and the bread doth signify vnto vs also, the body of Christ, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for vs. And as many as doe receiue this Sacrament worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in remembrance of the death &amp; passion of Iesus Christ, doe eat and drink Iesus Christ (spiritually) to their euerlasting saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>

And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> feared not to call it bread still many times in his epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> And our Sauiour Christ in the 6. of <hi>Iohn</hi> saith: that they should see him ascend into heauen with the same body that he sate in with them at Supper, whole and vneaten: adding further, that the wordes that he spake, were spirite and truth, and that it is the spirit that giueth life, the flesh profiteth little. And he biddeth vs to celebrate this Supper in remembrance of him: and to preach his death therin till he come againe. If Christ were in the Sacrament, flesh, blood, and bone, then the wicked might eate him, &amp; so should there neuer any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked be condemned: for Christ sayth, hee that eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud shall neuer die: yea Rattes, Cattes and Mice, might eate his body, which were blasphemous, and sacrilegious once to imagine, though the Papists are not ashamed to teach it openly.

But yet notwithstanding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the grace of God be not tyed to the Sacraments, yet hee that may receyue them, and wil not, or else setteth light by them, or contemneth them, shall neuer receiue the gifts and graces sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by them.</p>

The Lord giue vs grace to folow her good example, that we may come to those vnspeakable ioyes wherin she now resteth, through Iesus Christ our Lord, to whom with the Father, and the holy Ghost, be all honour, glorie, prayse, dominion, and thankesgiuing, both nowe and for euermore.
