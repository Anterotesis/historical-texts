         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ſuch a Bear, as we miſapprehended
them, nor their skin fit to be ſold by
us that did it, before warrant is given
from God to deliver it: they ſhall not

            <p>God now ſhews us, That wicked Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
was the deſign, &amp; contrive of a
few in that bloudy, and ever Rebellious
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not the allowance

at <hi>Naſeby,</hi> written to her Majeſty.
My <hi>Heart,</hi> you will finde the <hi>Iriſh</hi> with
you Knaves, (they might deceive the
one, they could not deceive the other,)
And ſince that, how hath God fully
cleared their Majeſties, as now the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
from any allowance of that hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Rebellion. <hi>Own</hi> it Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
it will match well with the Gun-powder
Treaſon, thou didst both, as many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Thy Nuntio was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet
thou ſhalt fall. Hath not God made
his late Majeſties abominating that
wicked act, clear as the day, to be none
of his ollowance? you know, or may,
That Sr. <hi>Phillemon O'neal,</hi> upon his
Trial at <hi>Dublin,</hi> though puſillanimous
<pb facs="tcp:170032:6"/>
and timed in all other things, yet
when he was to give an account
from whence he had his Commiſsion,
God ſent him a courage, gave him abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to ſpeak boldly and truely to Gods
glorie, the honour of the Proteſtant
Religion, and the Kings juſt Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he took Heaven and Earth to
witneſs, he had neither Commiſsion
from King or Queen for that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
he affirmed that himſelf, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Roman ſtamp made them,
that he might play the beſt of his own
Game; it further appears, in that Oath
impoſed on thoſe he ſubdued to his own
obedience. Theſe are things I have had
from very good hands, when my ſelf at
<hi>Dublin,</hi> but that Traitor was executed
<pb facs="tcp:170032:6"/>
a little before I came thither. Now
ſee what God doth, who is the ſearcher
of all hearts, the King is in Heaven,
the Queen declared for Heaven, the
Nation not to be tranſplanted, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivers
and aſperſers of both gone to
their own home, or truely diſcovered
to us by the Lord, who now throws
down that wicked Church.</p>
            <p>Well, you ſhall now ſee we muſt all
live together in brotherly love under
Kingly Government alſo: but you
will ſay how can theſe things be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
what manner of Perſons we
have been? this book will ſhew you.
It proceeds onely from the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and mercifull loving kindneſs of
the Almighty.  The Lord hath made
<pb facs="tcp:170032:7"/>
our Salvation, not our deſtruction, his
glory, when all we, thy people, O God,
had ſinned beyond any help, then, O
Lord, thou ſayest, lo, I come. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how wonderfull a manner, and how
certain our deliverance is, read and
know. Actions, ſalved up with a free
forgiveneſs, are as not done, and as a
bone once broken is much ſtronger af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
well ſetting, ſo is love after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement:
God forgives us our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,
and in mercy reſtores us our
<hi>King</hi> again, who deals with us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guided of God, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did with
his brethren, when onely of God made
ruler in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had power to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
according to their demerit, then
he treats them kindly, following the
<pb facs="tcp:170032:7"/>
example of our Lord. He forgives all
paſt injuries, he loades them with good
things, he weeps over them, when he
tells them he is <hi>Joſeph,</hi> leaſt they, not
ſeeing his heart, might doubt of their
forgiveneſs, he drops Tears as Bloud
from pitying eyes and heart; they
well knew what themſelves had been
to him, unfaithfull brethren, and
its not improbable when they ſaw
themſelves by God caſt under his
power, and diſpoſe, they might fear,
tremble, and expect the reward of ſo
high demerit, for the affronts they
had put upon <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But leaſt ſuch
fears ſhould too much ſadden their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
Souls, he weeps over them more
abundantly, imbraceth them afreſh,
<pb facs="tcp:170032:8"/>
gives them all they ſtood in need of,
and doth not ſo much as once remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
them of the evil meaſure they had
dealt him, ſo allows them no ground
at all to ſuſpect their ſafety, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries

not of their Religion; both unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable.
We ſhould not kill him,
we conceive, out of the way; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhew him the way to walk in.
'Twas murder juſtly condemned
them to ſuffer, not raſh zeal; with
which God is not well pleaſed: who
would that all men ſhould live, and
come to the knowledge of his truth.</p>
               <p>But for the Murderer, the Law of
God was he ſhould die for it: So they
ſuffered not as they were <hi>Iriſh,</hi> or
<hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I could not but obſerve paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the rather becauſe it tended, in
that ſo mixt Aſſembly, highly to the
ſetting right the judgement (as I
conceive) to the glorie of God.

And indeed the firſt I ever ſaw, or
heard pronounced, from thoſe new
erected High-Courts of Juſtice:
Againſt which I have heard ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
bitter Invectives, that they were
like Hell, from whence is no return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There it was not ſo: where I
alſo ſaw many acquitted.</p>
               <p>From thence my buſineſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to <hi>Youghill,</hi> in <hi>March</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:
A ſeaſon more fit for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
and obſervance. I removed
from thence to <hi>Liſmore,</hi> 11 miles off,
cituate upon the <hi>Black-water:</hi> A
Seat very ancient, and not a little
eminent and honourable. Where
having well viewed the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and good contrivances of the
late deceaſed Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> who had
there purchaſed, cauſed to bebuilt &amp;
made many fair and commodious
Seats; governing in the well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
of Affairs, as born for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
good; for ſo he was commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable
to the imploy of the poor, to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170032:11"/>
the improve of thoſe Lands, to the
good example of others, and to the
honour of this Nation. That had
not War prevented, and death put
an end to his dayes (both broken in
upon us as a ſtream too violent to
withſtand, thoſe inundations of evil,
heightened by our ſins and follies of
all ſorts, the onely inlets of all Gods
judgements upon us) it might be
preſumed before this time it had in
ſome meaſure riſen again from the
aſhes; which former Wars, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
had buried it in.</p>
               <p>A very fair &amp; ſtrong built Schole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
with Almeſ-houſes on both
ſides of it, that Earl lived to finiſh
there: And now I believe he really
intended to re-build the Church.
So that like <hi>Him</hi> that was a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Gods own heart, in this he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
him, that he loved the <hi>place
where his Honour dwelleth.</hi> And
therefore he would ſo provide for it,
that in publick he might be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170032:11"/>
and that youth might early be
taught the wayes of godlineſs. Thus
being inſtrumental to well-accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
them, he might beſt ſerve God
and his Nation, in being communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably
good to all; the end for which
we were born.</p>
               <p>This obſerving, I ſometimes was
prone to think, That what he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
begun, might in future time, by
his poſterity and others be carried
on, to the making it, what is to be
deſired, and what it once was (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
an <hi>Univerſity:</hi> So conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently
is it ſituate, naturally afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the delights and good accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
that may beſt commode,
ſerve and adorne an Univerſity.</p>
               <p>As alſo that part of the Land, in
regard of its being well inhabited,
and remoteneſs from <hi>Dublin,</hi> called
for and ſtood much in need of, the
Church indowments being there,
and thereabouts full for incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and invitation, fit to help on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170032:12"/>
with ſo good and pious a work:
were not the poſſeſſors of thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
more lovers of themſelves, than
lovers of God and his ſervice.</p>
               <p>Is it reaſonable that our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
certainly out of love and zeal
('tis poſſible not miſguided too)
ſhould ſo largely give and endow,
for the Glorie, Worſhip and Service
of God Almighty, and we who have
more inlarged Fortunes, ſhould have
more ſtreitened hearts, and more
cruel hands? Indeed onely ſtrongly
bent, &amp; alwayes ready to pull down:
and by Thieving, Sacriledge &amp; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
which is the root of all
evil, make that ours, which neither
God, Man, or law ever meant ſhould:
Nay, they have all forbid it, with a
curſe to the Robber: which in the
end will prove that <hi>Curſed Thing,</hi>
that will make us and our poſterity
moſt miſerable. A Cole from that
Altar fires all our ill gotten nay
other) goods; or elſe fits us and our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170032:12"/>
Poſterity for the ſlaughter, which is
the end of the ill-adviſed.</p>
               <p>Into the remain of this Church of
<hi>Liſmore,</hi> Thurſday the 3 of <hi>March</hi>
1652. I came, (as well might; for
it had neither door to keep out the
unclean beaſts, nor in it any thing,
becoming a Houſe ſet apart for the
worſhip and ſervice of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,)
as inform'd this Church had
belonging to it 8 thouſand pounds
<hi>per Annum,</hi> before the War. Out of
it I often hunted Beaſts of ſeveral
ſorts; which (indeed) by their dung,
recreating themſelves in the ruins of
it, had help to make it with their
fellows, more like a Den of Thieves,
than a Houſe of God.</p>
               <p>This ſeeing, I could not but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and did there kneel down, and
ſupplicate God Almighty, not to
ſuffer us longer, who pretend to the
moſt and beſt of Piety, to carry on
a War, and continue ſuch actions, as
ſhould prove ſo ſcandalous to the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170032:13"/>
                  <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion; deterring from
the profeſſion of it, Such as there
lived among us: who could not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be drawn to the profeſſion of
it by our ſo bad example; living as it
were like men of diſpoſitions, onely
born to cruelty and irreligion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
that he would be pleaſed
to return to us in mercy, ſet every
mans ſins in order before his face, to
the deteſt of them, reſolving never
to return to folly: And that of his
goodnes he would caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all behind
his back, that we might once more
come into the Houſes, built for his
Worſhip and Service, with prepared
hearts, devout Souls; forgiving one
the other; all deſirous to be taught
of God: &amp; that we might live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
more according to his will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
in his word; and ſo knowing
his good pleaſure, we might readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply our ſelves to do it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that the Miniſters appointed
to officiate in thoſe places, might be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170032:13"/>
men ſent from God; who, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his word aright, might to us
ſo divide it. And that we might all
harmoniouſly agree together, not
onely to Preach and talk down Sin;
but that we might all live, for the
time to come, to ſerve him in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of heart, and in the beauty of
holineſs: So that others, obſerving
Gods mercies towards us, and our
amendments towards him, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
with us be drawn, to glorifie our
Father which is in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Sometime of that Thurſday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-noon
I ſpent in that Remain of
Church; ſo praying, meditating and
reading; and could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Indeede, the more I prayed,
the more I wept; the more I wept,
the more I joyed: and from my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
I remember not that I ever
went away with a better return: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very highly comforted, and ſo
aſſur'd that God would hear, and
have mercie; and from thenceforth,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170032:14"/>
and in that place, bleſs me; giving
me for conſolation, that a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided
zeal for his Houſe, Worſhip
and Service, made great our own,
and eſtabliſh'd it alſo.</p>
               <p>That night I went home to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Houſe, I then and there lodged
at, and had this dream:</p>
               <p>Me thought there was a very
groſs and thick <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> over the
face of the whole Earth; dark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
compare: I then heard a very
terrible <hi>Thunder,</hi> which more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
me: and looking up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
I ſaw a glimering <hi>Light;</hi> not
clear; about the bigneſs, and of the
proportion of a round Table, ſome
two yards over: In that <hi>Light</hi> there
appeared to me as the <hi>Body</hi> of an
<hi>Oak,</hi> about a yard long: Root it
had not, nor Top, nor Leaves, nor
Fruit: Full of Sangs it was, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
Knots: not fit for Timber, or
other uſe than the Fire: This ſoon
vaniſhed, yet the darkneſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170032:14"/>
but grew greater than the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and the Thunder anſwerable;
indeed ſo terrible, that it ſeemed to
me, to waken and rouze up all the
people of the Land: which when ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
I prayed in theſe words:</p>
               <p>O Lord! the people are now riſen
up, and ſtand in readineſs to do thy
will: wouldſt thou be pleaſed to let
them know it: I beſeech thee (O Lord)
give them a ſign in Heaven, or from
Heaven, of thy good pleaſure; and
we will readily obey thee.</p>
               <p>There then appeared, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſuch another <hi>Light;</hi> not clearer,
but bigger; and (as the former was)
over our heads, about the height, or
diſtance of the Clouds: having in it
ſuch a <hi>Body</hi> of an <hi>Oake,</hi> as the other;
in this onely differing, 'twas bigger
and more offenſive.</p>
               <p>As we ſtood thus gazing, anon the
Heavens began to grow light in the
Eaſt, as approach of day and Sun:
We ſtanding, as it were, in the midſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170032:15"/>
of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> the
<hi>Light</hi> encreaſed and came on: And
with it, roſe and came toward us the
moſt glorious <hi>Crown</hi> ever eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held:
the richeſt for Jewels; the
moſt tranſparently cut; every way
the beautifulleſt imaginable: Having
in it, and through it, ſtanding as the
three Plumes of Feathers in the
Princes Arms, a bunch of <hi>Bayes,</hi> or
ſmall <hi>Bay-trees:</hi> beautifull for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure;
bearing Berries, as having
Root: Waiting upon this Crown,
came many goodly <hi>Ships;</hi> which
<hi>Crown, Bayes,</hi> and <hi>Ships</hi> came all
along thus together in the <hi>Light,</hi>
from the Eaſt, toward us the people,
who with fixed eyes ſtood looking
into Heaven: All which we perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcerning, and being come almoſt
over our heads, we the people all of
us, with one voice, gladneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
cried out, O Lord, we praiſe
thee; this is of Heaven, we will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:170032:15"/>
I then looked behinde me, for the
former <hi>Glimmering Light,</hi> and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<hi>Oake</hi> in it, and I ſaw them
flying away ſo faſt, that immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they were gone, and no more to
be ſeen: The people, ſeeing it ſo gone
out of the Heavens, reitterated the
former words, and ſaid all with one
conſent, Come, this Crown is of
Heaven, we will follow it; ſo bowed
down and worſhipped, praiſing God.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Light</hi> then went over all the
Heavens, towards the Weſt, and
great was the <hi>Light;</hi> the <hi>Crown, Bayes</hi>
and <hi>Ships</hi> continued in the Heavens;
now light all over.</p>
               <p>After this, immediately from the
Heavens, I heard moſt ſweet and
pleaſing <hi>Sounds,</hi> as the voice, or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
of many waters; and on the
Earth ſhining, appeared nothing but
<hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Plenty:</hi> amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Earth loving kindneſs and
good affections: all with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
praiſing God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:170032:16"/>
Thus, raviſhed with an over-joy,
I wakened, and found my ſelf very
wet with tears. My greateſt joyes
and greateſt weepings ſeldom are
divided. I ſpent moſt of that night
in Meditation and caſting what this
dream might import: for truely this
is but one, though the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
(as I conceive) of the many
I have had from Heaven, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
ſeveral things.</p>
               <p>The next day being Fryday, a day
in the week, which for ſome ſeven
years paſt, I have ſet apart (though
not alwayes ſpent, God be pleaſed
to have mercie upon me and forgive
me) as I ought, or ſhould, for faſting
and examination of my ſelf: That,
as I am one Fryday nearer my end,
ſo I may in one meaſure, or another
grow fitter for it: in regard of the
many mercies God Almighty hath
been pleaſed to afford me, from my
Cradle hitherto: As that he hath
been pleaſed to preſerve me from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170032:16"/>
the noiſom Peſtilence, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the War (where be pleaſed
to obſerve, I have been committed
and taken into cuſtody three times
on the Kings ſide, and five times on
the Parliaments; yet never was in
action, or imploy on either part;)
from ſo many great and eminent
dangers, both by Sea and Land;
from Men lying in wait particularly
for my bloud: And laſtly, that the
Lord hath not cut me off in the
midſt of my ſins, and already given
me my portion with that ſo ſad
company in Hell, from whence is
no returning.</p>
               <p>Theſe were (certainly) grounds
enough for every mans Faſting and
Prayer; eſpecially living in a Time,
when wickedneſs ſeemed to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed
by a Law; at leaſt, it was not
long ſince it was ſo: All theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
were grounds (I ſay) more than
enough, to beſeech God for redreſs,
to a diſtracted people, and a divided
Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170032:17"/>
This Fryday I repaired to that
Church of <hi>Liſmore:</hi> in it, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fit for Contempaltion, I paſſed
that day. Saturday, I could not
but return thither again, and there
pen the ſubject matter of my prayer
on that Thurſday afternoon; alſo
my Dream that night: And decline
I muſt not, nay could not, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
all ſo penned, to the now moſt
Honourable Earl of <hi>Cork,</hi> and his ſo
well accompliſhed <hi>Counteſs:</hi> And
home I muſt preſs them, forthwith
to re-build that Church of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſons cannot but be good
and many, who conſiders the Lord
ſhould be publickly ſerved; and the
people well inſtructed, from the
mouth of him, whoſe lips ſhould
preſerve knowledge, and tongue
ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon. Such
men are the men (certainly) ſent,
and deputed by God himſelf, for the
better turning of ſinners from the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170032:17"/>
evil of their wayes, to ſerve the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living
God: His Temple's the fitteſt
place alſo, where holineſs is injoined
us: Beauty and decency not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.
To this Earl and Counteſs of
<hi>Cork</hi> I apply my ſelf; in their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and private Bed-Chamber they
were pleaſed to hear me to the
full.</p>
               <p>I may not here omit to let you
know, that in the morning of that
very day, when, going to pray for
Gods guidance, in this his buſineſs
of rebuilding his Houſe, to his own
glory, and good of others; and have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
omitted that morning, to read
any part of the Scriptures or Pſalms,
appointed for the day, (the reading
of Gods Word firſt, a good way to
prepare for acceptable devotion,
and praying aright;) from my knees
I roſe, took the Bible, and there
opened to me the Prophet <hi>Haggai;</hi>
which tied my eye upon the place
(a Scripture (God be mercifull to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170032:18"/>
me) I was not at all acquainted
with:) Thus opened, I could not go
on to Devotion, nor to read the
Pſalm, untill I had read that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
out, being but two Chapters;
directed and over-ruled (as I firmly
then, and now believe) by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty:
For, in the whole Book of
God, there is not any place fuller
for the buſineſs I had in hand. It is
well worth your, and all mens ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
and retention, that have too
low eſteem of Gods Houſe.</p>
               <p>But what ſpeak I of too low
eſteem? Indeed, none at all that
good is, of the Churches, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
built and ſet apart to the glory,
for the publick Worſhip and Service
of God.</p>
               <p>Humble men they ſeem to be! A
Stable, or Kitchin will ſerve their
turns: and (truely) good enough too
for many, who have the impudence
to abuſe Gods Houſe, and endeavour
there to ſeduce the more ignorant
ſort of people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170032:18"/>
Theſe <hi>Schrich-Owls</hi> cannot well
endure the light of his Houſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
have they their corners and
ſculking places. A judicious and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick
Auditory, who love the place
where his Honour dwelleth (which
they beſt love to frequent, and thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
go with prepared hearts, to
learn that they may underſtand
what's fit to practice;) Theſe will
not be decoyed by them. With
thoſe it matters not what becomes of
the Houſe of God: Yet obſerve and
remember (I beſeech you) what
that Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> there gives for
reaſon, of all the evils that were
ſent, and continued upon the Land;
<hi>The not-building of Gods Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The lying of that waſte, cauſed the
Lord to have no delight in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
He there adviſeth and enjoyns
to rebuild his Houſe; then he aſſures
them, he will dwell with them, and
bleſs them beyond all compare:
nay, he will take pleaſure in them,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170032:19"/>
verſe the 8. He there goes on, He
<hi>will ſhake the Heavens, the Earth, the
Sea, and the dry Land:</hi> All is his,
&amp; to his, for the glory of his Houſe,
that he will fill with his own glory,
and bleſs the Land with peace and
plenty; ſuch as was never ſeen, untill
the building, or laying of that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
From that very time he
bleſſeth them, when they rebuild his
Houſe, for his publick worſhip and
ſervice. The Lord makes that a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
fit for the imploy of another
Prophet alſo, the Prophet <hi>Zechary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of ſo much concernment you ſee
it is with God: But leſt, theſe things
being Old Teſtament, we ſhould
conclude they concern us not under
the Goſpel: ſo wicked are we grown,
and ſo out of love with any thing,
that coſts us ought in the Service
of God, or is moſt to his glory and
honour; that, as any place is good
enough, ſo indeed any Calf fit to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
Thus ſhift we off the thing, in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170032:19"/>
which our happineſs moſt lies; that
we may make our ſelves moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
Fooliſh men! why conſider
we not, that Chriſts Courts on earth
are his Churches? And, in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
thereof, he hath a Throne
in the midſt of his Temple, and ſits
thereon; before whom all fall down
and worſhip.</p>
               <p>But theſe times call for our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
nay, deep mourning: for
in this buſineſs, we deal with the
Houſe of God and his Worſhip (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we pretend much to both)
as <hi>Amnon</hi> dealt with his ſiſter <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar;</hi>
firſt Raviſh her, then Defile
her, and after turn her out of doors.
But to return:</p>
               <p>Truely, I could not but commend
thoſe two ſhort, but moſt full Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> to that
ſo Honourable <hi>Earl</hi> and <hi>Counteſs:</hi>
for the better diſpoſe of them; whoſe
affairs of concernment, are wiſely
managed by joynt conſent. Their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170032:20"/>
quick diſcern a far off, and ſound
judgement at home, give them great
advantages, for the well-ordering of
all their affairs.</p>
               <p>Who having heard me out, before
I once ſo much as preſſed them to
it, the <hi>Earl</hi> met me with this readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to the work; My Father intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the building of that Church, I
will do it: It is onely by me, for a
ſhort time, deferred; untill theſe
troubles blow over, or time afford
a better opportunity, for the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on of the work: for the rebuild
of which Church, I have many
things already fitted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I moſt heartily wiſh, and do ſo
pray, that there might be found in
all men this readineſs, to make
themſelves happy here, and ſo (cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly)
bleſs'd hereafter. You have

               <p>A Short time after, I fell into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
ſickneſſes and diſeaſes of
that Countrey, ſo that moſt of the
following Summer I paſt in changes,
from one malady to another: At laſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170032:21"/>
I broke out into very many Boyls;
ſo that I may truely ſay from the
Crown of my Head, to my Foot, I
was furniſhed with them; forty, or
fifty at a time of all ſizes: My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in that, and ſome other things
too very like that of <hi>Job's:</hi> which
eſcaped not my obſerve, in a Letter,
to that ſo eminently good Counteſs
of <hi>Cork:</hi> beſeeching ſome of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies;
of which ſhe is free, and do

and that Honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,
I owe moſt humble thanks for
recovery, from my ſo long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>About <hi>Michaelmas</hi> I went to <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi>
in the company and ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of that moſt Honorable Lord,
the Lord of <hi>Broghill:</hi> where I
ſtayed untill near <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Youghall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After ſix dayes there, I could not
be quiet, untill I had ſapplied my
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170032:21"/>
ſelf, by Letter, to his Lordſhip, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him to underſtand, I had a
Dream at <hi>Liſmore,</hi> ſome 9 moneths
paſt: Which Dream, together with
what Obſervance, or Interpretation,
God was pleaſed to put into my
heart and minde, I was to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
to him: Which I could not
decline; and therefore beſought his
Lordſhip, that in his preſence, and
ſome more perſons of Honour, in
that Letter named, he and they
would be pleaſed to lend me half an
hours time, and their attention.</p>
               <p>The Gout at that time was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
upon his Lordſhip, by reaſon of
which incommode, he was diſina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to ſit up: ſo that his Lordſhip
was pleaſed to anſwer my Letter,
that for that reaſon onely he deſired
my forbearance, untill it paſt over;
of which (when ſo) I ſhould have
notice, and in preſence of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
deſired; alſo admittance ſo ſoon
as convenient.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170032:22"/>
His Lordſhips Letter I have, and
reaped what promiſed, a few dayes
after. Being in his Bed-Chamber
(Thoſe I deſired, preſent,) I recited
my Dream as formerly: The Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance,
or Interpretation I gave
thus:</p>
               <p>The cuſtomary ſins we were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of, and had unhappily involved
our ſelves in, had now begot our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity,
as in the dead of night and
ſleep: from which we were not to
be wakened, or rowzed, but by the
Almighty power of God: And
therefore, to let us ſee our conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his diſpleaſure for ſin, whom
our Impieties had irritated; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
came in Thunder; to ſhew us
that our ſeeming righteouſneſs
reached not Heaven, nearer then the
Clouds: our pretentions to good,
went not higher: like an <hi>Ignis-fatuus</hi>
they were, or a Gloe-worm: Light
they had, but not ſubſtantial, enough
to ſhew us we were ſtrong as the <hi>Oak;</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:170032:22"/>
which we might there ſee our wicked
ſelves compared to. Strong we were
to work wickedneſs; <hi>Governours</hi> and
all: to which <hi>Oak</hi> they, and we may
be compared; as in the Prophet <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi>
the 11. and the 2.</p>
               <p>Bad we were of choice; ſo of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;
ſo for works; ſo for offence:
No Root; no Top; no Leaf; no Fruit;
not ſo much as virdure; Offenſive
on all ſides, in regard of the Snags;
not fit for Timber, ſuch our <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours;</hi>
onely for the Fire, ſuch their
unprofitableneſs; juſt like the Stag's
horn, when the velvet of Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is fallen from it (as moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
his Majeſty obſerves in his
Book;) which wicked Governours,
when the people once fail them, and
truely underſtand them, how unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
how offenſive, how danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
how hurtfull; they would then
ſufficiently hate them.</p>
               <p>When once as this <hi>Oak,</hi> ſtript of
his bark, nakedly ſeen, and well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170032:23"/>
then fit onely for the fire. I
command you read the 3 laſt verſes
of the firſt of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> and ſee, if this
Interpretation be not of the Lord;
yea, his own: I will give you the
words, <hi>For they ſhall be aſhamed of
the Oaks which you have deſired: Ye
ſhall be confounded; for ye ſhall be as
an Oak, whoſe leaf fadeth; and the
ſtrong ſhall be as tow, and the makers
of it as a ſpark, and they ſhall both
burn together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here are the <hi>Oaks</hi> ye have choſen,
when ye forſook the Lord. Is not
this a Viſion, and the Interpretation
of the Lord? I made it before I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
this; I now interline it: 'Tis
of God the Interpretation.</p>
               <p>Therefore the <hi>Oak</hi> abides not,
having no allowance, or eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from God in Heaven. Fly
away it doth, when the <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>Crown</hi> appear: To both which they
being enemies and haters of, God
makes them vaniſh, and be no more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170032:23"/>
ſeen. Though they lift themſelves
as high as the Clouds, yet their
place is below, whither he throws
them. Of his allowance they are
not: neither do the people; when
they deſire to do the will of God,
and he hath opened their eyes, to
diſcern aright, what is of God, as
they confeſs that <hi>Light, Crown</hi> and
<hi>Bayes,</hi> they then know the <hi>Crown,</hi>
and <hi>Him</hi> deputed to <hi>govern,</hi> to be
onely of God: And becauſe it hath
its allowance of Heaven, with one
conſent (praiſing God) they invite
All to what themſelves are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of; Obedience to Him and It
onely: and ſo breaking forth, they
altogether cry, <hi>Come, this is of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
we will follow it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that it may have their beſt
affections, and firm allowance, they
give it their Second, the wiſeſt and
beſt Thoughts, reſolvingly too; they
reitterate the words, <hi>Come, this is of
Heaven, we will follow it:</hi> And ſo
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170032:24"/>
down to God and It, and worſhiped
and praiſed the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now, although this were, and yet
is our depraved condition; and that
we have added wickedneſs to wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
and made our ſelves ſtrong
to do ſo; which the Second &amp; greater
<hi>Light,</hi> with the offenſive and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<hi>Oak</hi> in it, fully implied: yet
obſerve the loving-kindneſs of God
Almighty: We no ſooner got into a
frame to beg of him inablements to
know his Will, reſolving then to do
it; and are gotten into a poſture of
readineſs, ſtanding up; but He lets
us ſee, that his diſpleaſure is blown
over: The <hi>Thunder,</hi> that ceaſeth;
thoſe wicked <hi>Governours,</hi> as <hi>offenſive
Oaks,</hi> they are fled; the ſeeming
<hi>Light,</hi> that's annihilated. It is his
mercie that endures for ever, and his
Compaſſion aſſures us, he delights
not in the death of a ſinner; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that he would turn from his
wickedneſs, and live: And thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulating
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170032:24"/>
with us, brings from him
this expreſſion, <hi>Why will ye die, O ye
houſe of</hi> Iſrael? Repent, be ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
and return from whence ye
are fallen, the contempt of Gods
Houſe and Worſhip; Obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom I have ſet over you for
good, would you but ſee it; did not
your continuance in ſin blinde your
eyes, and deprave your underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
yea, could not but be happy.</p>
               <p>Bleſs us he would, and that to the
full too; as he aſſures us in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Haggai,</hi> and divers other places;
even from that time we rebuild his
Houſe, and obey whom he hath ſet
over us for good. And if thus we
would readily apply our ſelves, and
herein obey God and our King, mark
and behold, The Heavens they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
you, and demonſtrate their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance;
rejoycing at it, by their
pleaſant ſounds: the Earth alſo its
gladneſs, ſhining with variety of
Flowers, and abundant Fruitfulneſs:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170032:25"/>
the Seas their over-joy, thinking it
no burden, to their beſt and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigged
Ships to give way, and bow
down: that all ſhe brings from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
and the rich returns of Trade,
that plough her Ocean, may, when
ſo loaden, in their beſt dreſs alſo,
wait upon the Crown, peaceably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
ſuffering themſelves to be
led by it; All which they did, being
Merchant Ships, not Men of War.</p>
               <p>And now tell me, is it not pitie,
&amp; the greateſt too, that whom God
hath made the more reaſonable
Creature, Man, ſhould onely be
averſe, and ſtand in Rebellion; going
on in diſobedience, to his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing?</p>
               <p>But I may not complain, as anon:
I ſhall let you ſee He alſo is, or ſhall
come in; for who can reſiſt, when
God will have it ſo? He hath in
ſtore, nay, he is now diſtributing to
you the greateſt mercy in the world:
which I dare not longer conceal,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170032:25"/>
from all the Sons of Men; but more
eſpecially from the ſo much belov'd
of the Lord, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
the <hi>Jews,</hi> Here's the hope of <hi>Iſrael!</hi>
as alſo to the Heathen, towards
whom his Compaſſions fail not; and
to this our Orthodox, true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, for the honour of it,
to the unparalel'd joy of all good
mens hearts.</p>
               <p>Theſe things obſerved, I then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
my ſelf to Doctor <hi>Mollines;</hi>
who was one of the ten Perſons, I
deſired to be preſent: And becauſe
I knew him to be a perſon of good
life, &amp; believed him of ſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I made it my beſeech to him,
That in a ſhort time, he would be
pleaſed, to give us a Sermon, upon
this Subject, or Text; <hi>He that covers
his ſins, ſhall not proſper; but he that
confeſſeth, and forſaketh them, ſhall
finde mercie.</hi> For to me it ſeemed,
that Gods return is in mercy, was
onely witheld, by our going on in
iniquity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:170032:26"/>
Here alſo I may not omit, but
obſerve to you, that before I came
to the Lord of <hi>Broghills,</hi> I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from my knees, and could not
go on, to beſeech Gods bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what I had to deliver to him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
I turned to the <hi>Reading Pſalms:</hi>
But, as I was caſt formerly upon the
Prophet <hi>Haggai,</hi> with good ſucceſs
for the rebuild of that Church; ſo
here I was caſt upon the 84 and 85
<hi>Pſalms;</hi> both as full as is imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to any that well conſiders, and
compares, what I obſerved out of
my Dream, and deſire to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build
of Gods Houſe. <hi>Oh, how
amiable, and how much to be delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in, is thy Houſe! how ſhould our
Souls long after thy Worſhip!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which when I had read, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
the manner of my being caſt
upon them; having already diſputed
all I intended, or almoſt all what I
would ſpeak to that Company at
the Lord <hi>Brougills;</hi> I could not but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170032:26"/>
conclude, what I believe every well-obſerving
man will; That it was the
onely Providence of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
who, for my further confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
gave me thoſe Pſalms of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
to ſtrengthen me, and diſpoſe
others to their duty; who he was
willing ſhould reap the unparalel'd
bleſſings there aſſured. Pray, well
obſerve it: the one lets you ſee, what
deſires we ſhould have, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>build
of, &amp; worſhip in Gods Houſe
the other his return in mercy; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the Land, when we ſo fear and
ſerve him: <hi>Righteouſneſs, as that
Light, ſhall then go before him; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
alſo and Truth ſhall meet together;
Righteouſneſs and Peace ſhall kiſs
each other; and ſo ſet us in the way of
his ſteps.</hi> Full to all.</p>
               <p>Having done all of Interpretation,
in reference to my Dream, I could
not paſs this lightly over, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it to them; as alſo how that
God had many times ſhewed me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170032:27"/>
things, in and from Heaven;
called me to the ſearch, and often
adviſed the reading of his Holy
Word; giving me to underſtand,
that by ſo doing, I ſhould be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
happy and bleſſed. In par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
one time it ſeemed to me, he
took me into a great <hi>Light,</hi> when all
the World was in <hi>darkneſs;</hi> he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
on each ſide of me an <hi>Angel</hi> of
the Lord; that on the right hand,
opened a great <hi>Book</hi> to me, bid me
read therein, and took an <hi>Angel</hi> of
Gold off that Book, into his hand,
and put it into mine: when received,
I folded my arms and bowed before
him; believing it was no other, but
(as the Buſh of <hi>Moſes</hi>) the preſence
of the Lord: He then told me, he
gave it not to be folded up, or hid;
but to be improved were his Talents
given; and ſo adviſed me to read.</p>
               <p>Another time, one night, about
the hour ten, walking at the end of
<hi>Broad-street</hi> (in which I then, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170032:27"/>
now live,) looking up into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and obſerving ſo great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Stars, I called to minde the
promiſe made to <hi>Abraham, That his
Seed ſhould be as numberleſs, as the
Stars in Heaven:</hi> So praiſing God, I
there ſtood, in, or near that place,
about half an hour; where I did ſee
the Heavens <hi>opened,</hi> my <hi>Saviour</hi> on
the Throne, the <hi>Patriarks, Prophets,
Apostles, Martyrs, Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi>
waiting round about it, and to my
comfort, my own <hi>Father:</hi> This I
ſaw, when I was awake, and really
there ſtanding: Something hath been
ſhewed me, of our ever-bleſſed <hi>King</hi>
dead, but in Heaven glorious: this
alſo I did obſerve to his Lordſhip,
but made no other uſe of it, than
this, That foraſmuch as all I ever
dreamed, or ſaw, of that nature,
was above in the Heavens, or came
from thence; nothing ever from the
bottomleſs pit, the Earth, or Seas:
which gave me to believe it was the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170032:28"/>
further from Deluſion: and much
the more to be believed True, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that which is of Heaven, is
Heavenly.</p>
               <p>And although the Crown was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
no mans head, yet being waited
upon by the Ships, it implied He was
to come from beyond the Seas,
whoſe undoubted right it was: And
who that Man was, to whom it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belonged, his <hi>Star</hi> demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
which at <hi>Pauls Croſs</hi> appeared,
when there was a Sermon preached
there, upon the day he was born on,
being the ſame (as I conceive) our
Lord roſe on; and his (our Kings)
Birth alſo, early in the morning, as
his (our Saviours) Reſurrection,
whoſe Vice-roy certainly he, this
CHARLS STUART, is, as ye
ſhall hear anon; his <hi>Father</hi> (our
late <hi>King</hi>) then preſent: And as the
Gentleman that preached, about the
hour of eleven, was giving thanks
to God Almighty, That to our then
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170032:28"/>
Soveraign Lord the <hi>King,</hi> and to us
his Subjects, was that day born a
Son and Prince, in whom our hopes
were, and aſſurance might be, He
would prove moſt Eminent in his
Church on Earth, to Gods glorie,
and his Majeſties and our comfort:
So thanking God for this (for I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
was) I looked up to Heaven;
and there, at almoſt eleven a Clock,
in the moneth of <hi>May</hi> a moſt clear
day, very near the Sun alſo did I ſee
that his <hi>Star</hi> appear: which wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at, being juſt over (as it were)
his place of Birth, <hi>White-Hall,</hi> or
his <hi>Fathers</hi> head, who was come to
give God praiſe for him at the <hi>Croſs;</hi>
which was alſo ſung by the Quire
on the Leads; his <hi>Star</hi> then appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I my ſelf ſhewed it to very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
hundreds, if not thouſands wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
this. So that the Heavens have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now again demonſtrated Him,
the Seas waiting on him, the Earth
flouriſhing under him; what remains,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170032:29"/>
but that we get our ſelves into a
readineſs, to receive ſo great a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
from ſo good a God; Whom
in mercy he hath appointed over us,
as I firmly believe.</p>
               <p>The Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> I confeſs,
I adviſed never to right, or draw
ſword againſt this <hi>King:</hi> For the war
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I now underſtood it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than formerly; and therefore did
believe, that to his Lordſhip, who
was born there, at <hi>Liſmore</hi> too (as
I conceive) and reſided in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the devices and ſubtleties of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in that Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
or ſince in the carrying on of
that War, were better known, than
to his late Majeſty; whoſe goodneſs
by ſome was too too much abuſed;
ſeeing it not with his own eyes, but
hearing it by others miſrepreſented.
His Lordſhip, who had that great
advantage, as to be amongſt them
himſelf (which was denied his late
Majeſty,) did ſee, that his <hi>Unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> had onely a modeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170032:29"/>
to ſuppreſs the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and cheat the <hi>King</hi> of that
Kingdom, that he might the better
be ſoon uſurper of all the reſt.</p>
               <p>This I now firmly believe was the
ground of the Lord of <hi>Broghills</hi>
fighting in that Kingdom. So never
at all againſt the <hi>King,</hi> but for him:
And I do the rather believe this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I never had any Commiſſion
or deſire, to treat him, other than
with all reſpect, as a perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
that had great and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments:
For I told him that
day, before I went out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
that I believed, he never was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>King:</hi> Further, I never had
deſire to apply my ſelf to any man in
that Kingdom but his good ſelf. And
ſee now (as you ſhall anon) how God
honoureth that Man, above all the
ſword-men in that Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; as <hi>Oliver
Cromwel</hi> only of the ſword-men, the
moſt in the Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>England.</hi> And
more than to theſe two onely did
I never apply my ſelf; ſent of Heaven
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170032:30"/>
to theſe ſo glorious Saints, firſt on
Earth; that they may be moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
ones hereafter in Heaven.</p>
               <p>But, thou Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhalt
fall (as anon I ſhall ſhew you:) God
will down with thee: Theſe two <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi>
of Honour have, and ſhall the
moſt of any two Subjects in the
world, help down with her. I had
all moſt forgot my then laſt obſerve
to his Lordſhip, A material on it is,
that although every man ſtood up,
bowed, and Worſhipped God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Crown, and with one
conſent crying out, O Lord, we
praiſe thee for this Crown is of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
come, we will follow and obey
it, yet I ſay this of all people, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
no one man diſſented, did not
ſeem for number to exceed four, or
five hundred perſons, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
from me then, this obſerve to
his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>That I feared our ſins and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for ſin would almoſt lay
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170032:30"/>
waſte our Land, we having ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoked the Lord, by our too
much delighted in iniquities and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions
of all ſorts, which we had
juſt ground to bewail, leaſt they
conſumed us.</p>
               <p>But truely ſince I have better
hopes, nay, firmly believe I do, that
if we would turn to God with all our
hearts, and do the things here God
adviſeth to, by me his unworthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
in much mercy ſent unto you,
that you might repent, finde deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and ſo live abundantly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
this number of men, which as I
former obſerved, paſt for the whole
people in the Land, of which none
diſſented, I now hope and pray will
moſt happily prove to be that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, which repreſent the
whole people of the Land, and yet
exceed not 4 or 5 hundred perſons
now of this Parliament, to which
purpoſe I beſeech every good
mans prayers, and every bad mans
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170032:31"/>
amendment of life, and for diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
perſons in that body, believe as
I do, there will not be found one, or
not one to hurt us. Who can be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
when all agree to fear God
and honour their King, keeping the
commandments of the one, the
wholeſom and well conſtituted Laws
of the other, in which doing there
cannot but be happineſs here, and
ever hereafter, into which good old
way of thine and ours good Lord be
pleaſed to ſet us, that we may be
certainly bleſt, our feet being then
found in the way of thy ſteps.</p>
               <p>Thus ended all I then obſerved,
and to my Lodging I retired to the
Widdow <hi>Marricks</hi> houſe in <hi>Youghall.</hi>

               <p>VEry few dayes paſt, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
rancounter, I met
and fell into diſcourſe with a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
who had commanded former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170032:31"/>
a Troup of Horſe in the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
ſervice; we argued, and to this
we came, whether <hi>Kings</hi> were made
ſo originally of God, or the people:
the latter he held, I the former;
which I proved to him out of the
Word of God, that firſt the Choice,
next the Anointing of them, was of
God onely, and his Prophets ſent
by his command; as in <hi>Saul, David,</hi>
and others: ſo not at all in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
'Tis true, the people were all
along commanded to pray for them,
and to obey them, when thus ſet up
by God. So we ended the diſcourſe,
and quietly parted.</p>
               <p>Some four dayes after, one Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
morning (as I beſt remember)
having lain moſt of that night in
Meditation &amp; Prayer, about day I did
ſee, ſitting at my beds foot, behinde
the curtain, a <hi>Man ſent of God:</hi> whileſt
He continued there ſitting, there fell
a <hi>Showre</hi> of <hi>Fire,</hi> thick, and in drops,
like Rain, all about my beds foot:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170032:32"/>
Full in my eye was the <hi>Spirit</hi> there
ſitting, and the fire falling down:
Awake I conceive my ſelf to have
been; for at that very time, I called
to minde the Fire that came down
from Heaven, upon the heads of the
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to their inablement: Anon
the <hi>Spirit</hi> called me by my name,
<hi>Walter Goſtellow:</hi> I indeavoured to
reply, did open my mouth, tried
twice, but my tongue doubled in my
mouth, and I could not bring forth
my words, or ſpeak: He called me
the ſecond time by my name, <hi>Walte
Goſtellow;</hi> I indeavoured the ſecond
reply, but my tongue doubled as
formerly, and I could not ſpeak:
He called me the third time by my
name, <hi>Walter Goſtellow,</hi> to which I
then anſwered, <hi>Here I am:</hi> he asked
and ſaid unto me, Did you ſee the
fire come down from Heaven, as a
ſhore of Rain? I replied, Yes, I
did: he then ſtrook by the Curtain,
looked me full in the face, ſo I him:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170032:32"/>
He wept and ſaid unto me, you do
well interpret Scripture; clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring,
as I believe, to this, That
the Choice of Kings, this of ours
eſpecially is onely in God, and not
at all in the people.</p>
               <p>This over, I wrote to the Lord
of <hi>Broghill</hi> that nights Viſion (for
other I cannot call it,) beſought his
Lordſhip, that once more he would
be pleaſed to admit me before him;
there and then to be preſent alſo
ſome ten, or twelve perſons, by me
deſired: He was pleaſed to afford
me the favour, ſo alſo moſt of the
others.</p>
               <p>By this time it pleaſed Almighty
God to let me know, he had depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me to go to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and
after to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> that now is,
CHARLES STUART, <hi>Charles</hi>
the <hi>Second.</hi> The imploy he would
inform me of: and for the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it ſelf, I muſt believe, that from
ſtrength to ſtrength, He would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170032:33"/>
me, untill I came to perfect
Peace in <hi>Zion.</hi> And although the
things to be done were great, migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſtrange, and wonderfull; yet
for his Honour, Mercy, and Names
ſake, he would bring them to paſs;
and they ſhould be marvellous in
our eyes. Thus began, and thus
ended my Commiſſion of the Lord.</p>
               <p>I then bethought me of what I
would ſay to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and
thus reſolved, that from God I
would reprove him, ſet his ſins in
order before his face, and tell him
he was that great Deceiver, the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
of the Proteſtant Religion, the
Diſhonour of our Nation, a Whited
wall he was, a great and cloſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite,
a Man of bloud, and Son of
<hi>Belial,</hi> and more than all this (for
I never loved him,) all this I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to ſay to him: but the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
me, and gave me to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
that my ſelf prayed in my
Dream, That God would be pleaſed,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170032:33"/>
to let the men of the world, who
were deſirous to do his will, know
it from Heaven, or in the Heavens,
by a ſign, which I have given thee,
and they would readily obey, apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves to walk in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereunto.</p>
               <p>Having thus altered me, and (as
before) again reproved me; letting
me know, God judged not as man
did: He commanded me to treat,
and uſe him kindly, the diſpoſe of
the heart being in the hand of God.</p>
               <p>So that now from former hating
of Him (for ſo I did; no man more)
I now cannot do other than pray for
him, (for ſo I ſhould, and for all
others,) that God would be pleaſed
to inable him, for the overcoming
of all his enemies, more eſpecially
his corruptions. And firmly believe
I do, that the Lord will make Him
highly inſtrumental for the promote
and carrying on things of very high
concernment, for his glory, to his
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170032:34"/>
Honour, and the aſtoniſhment of the
world: For I know what apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
the moſt have of him, both at
home and abroad: but God judgeth
not, as man doth.</p>
               <p>Before the Lord of <hi>Broghill</hi> I
came the ſecond time, and ſo began
with him, as you read upon <hi>Oliver
Cromwell:</hi> I then told him what I
firmly believed, the Lord put into
my heart and tongue, by his dictates
and Viſions; and how that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dery,
men of Valour and Honour
ſhould ſubmit to the <hi>King;</hi> who
would not onely forgive them, but
give unto them all ſo doing, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity,
Honours, Preferments,
Lands, places and Hereditaments;
Seal and confirm them unto them, in
the ſureſt Tenure of this Kingdom,
as at, or after that of Eaſt <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further; that, as the <hi>Light</hi> came
on in Heavens, from the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it the richeſt <hi>Crown</hi> ever eyes
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170032:34"/>
beheld, the <hi>Bayes</hi> rooted and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing,
ſtanding in that <hi>Crown,</hi> as
the three Plumes of Feathers in his
own Arms &amp; Coronet; upon which
<hi>Bayes</hi> was ſtore of <hi>Berries,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth
a proviſion for Poſterity; both
waited upon by good ſtore of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping:
ſo the <hi>King</hi> ſhould come from
beyond the Seas; Land in the Eaſt
of <hi>Kent,</hi> or thereabouts; and come
on towards the Weſt. See, <hi>thus
comes the Lightning,</hi> in the 24 of
<hi>Matthew,</hi> the 27 verſe, <hi>out of the
Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt:
ſo alſo ſhall the coming of the Son of
Man be.</hi> O my God, and my King!
well: I go on: This would fill the
Men of the Kingdom, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
with rejoycing, the people
praiſing God, and the Souldiery, for
their good affections to Gods glory,
and the Kings intereſt; the Earth gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her encreaſe. All Animoſities
thus taken away we ſhould agree,
better than ever, dwell together in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170032:35"/>
brotherly love, and the moſt ſure
bond of peace, and great ſhould be
the praiſe of <hi>God,</hi> Honour of the
<hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Souldiery;</hi> alſo the true
<hi>Protestant</hi> Religion receive its Luſtre
upon the Earth, and flouriſh beyond
compare.</p>
               <p>Among the Perſons preſent, I
then told the Lady <hi>Frances Boyl,</hi> el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Daughter to the ſo excellent
Counteſs of <hi>Cork,</hi> lamed in her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
to ſo much debility, that ſhe
halteth the deepeſt imaginable, but
God Almighty hath been pleaſed to
more than recompence that debility,
by the more noble endowments of
her Soul and minde; which ſpeak her
not onely in them the lively image
of her moſt excellent Counteſs <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
but the dearly beloved of God
her <hi>Father</hi> which is in Heaven: To
this Lady (I ſay) I applied my ſelf,
and told her what I believe God
Almighty had put into my heart
and tongue: That if ſhe were preſent,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170032:35"/>
when the <hi>King</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi>
and ſo received with content in State
(which would not be long ere it was
ſo,) ſhe ſhould then ſee, waiting on
him, whom God had deputed for
her Husband; a Man unſpotted of
the fleſh; with whom ſhe ſhould be
abundantly happy.</p>
               <p>I after beſought her ſecond
Daughter, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Boyl,</hi>
to ſtand forth: before her I kneeled,
told her, if ſhe were then preſent, ſhe
ſhould ſee <hi>Him</hi> the Lord had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
for her Husband, CHARLS
STUART, <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> King
of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi> and
<hi>Ireland, Defender of the Faith.</hi> Here
I could not for bear, but ſeeing the
glory of God, and the Honour of
this his <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> on earth, to be ſo
great, I fell on my face, as in the
firſt of <hi>Corinthians</hi> the 14 and 25.
<hi>And ſo falling down on his face, he
will worſhip God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I take the God of Heaven to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170032:36"/>
I know no other reaſon of it,
it never was the leaſt in my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Since I have read the Prophet
did ſo, as in the 43 of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the
2 verſe, and becauſe the words, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and manner of his Government,
there is ſo very full to my buſineſs,
give me leave to obſerve them to
you; the rather becauſe All of mine,
whether of Action, or Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are ſo long ſince paſt, and by me
this never obſerved, untill Thurſday
the fourth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1654. as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt:
I look upon it, as a further
confirm to me, of my ſo interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Viſion, and over-ruled de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
in that action of falling
upon my face, the words are theſe:
<hi>And behold, the glory of the God of</hi>
Iſrael <hi>came from the way of the Eaſt,
and his voice was like a voice of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
waters, and the earth ſhined with
his glory; and it was according to the
appearance of the Viſion I ſaw; and I
fell upon my face.</hi> And ſo he goes
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170032:36"/>
on, that <hi>the glory of the Lord filled
his Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See what his Providence hath
guided me to do: and all to obſerve
to you; were there but this in it, it
migh confirm you, it is no deluſion.
<hi>O Lord, let the World, as I do, ſtand
amazed, love thee, and fear thee for
ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, I told them I ſhould
go into <hi>France,</hi> or beyond the Seas,
be highly inſtrumental, to turn the
<hi>Queen</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion,
who with the <hi>King,</hi> and all of our
Nation, ſhould return into this
Land, and there, ſhould be no more
Heart-burnings, diviſions, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt
amongſt us; but we ſhould all
agree, in the future, to fear God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
the <hi>King,</hi> and live in brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love, one with another; to our
General good content, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the world.</p>
               <p>I dare not here omit, to let the
Reader know, I did then ſay, I did
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170032:37"/>
believe theſe happy Mutations
would be ſhortly; and that the
<hi>Kings</hi> Birth-day, would be a day
of great Rejoycing, in theſe his
Kingdoms.</p>
               <p>Nay I have expected more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
already than yet I have
ſeen, and ſaid I have to ſome,
that I did believe this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
paſt would have made the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
things yet to come to paſs much
more apparent before now.</p>
               <p>But I ſee where the bringing of
any things to paſs, depends on mans
ſeeing to do Evil, there is nothing
but diſappointment.</p>
               <p>O Lord, if thou turn not Man
to thy ſelf, or thy ſelf do the work,
when will it be? Thoſe that have
robbed thy houſe, and undone man
their brother, whether thy Miniſters
or others, are in no diſpoſition as
yet to part with their ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
ſins, becauſe profitable: Thoſe
that on the otherſide, have by ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170032:37"/>
forſwearing, uncleanneſs, and
all manner of deboyſtneſs, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in giving juſt occaſion to ſay,
the former men, and Times, were
as bad as theſe; becauſe they repent
not, but continue to wallow in
all manner of their pleaſing ſins and
corruptions; who by ſo doing cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> religion, as much as
the former Evil doers, to be Evil
ſpoken of. Truely reader, if any
thing hath befooled, in regard of
time, the ſpiritual man, it is your ſins
of all ſorts, yet continued in. Read
the 9 of <hi>Hoſea</hi> and the 7 <hi>verſ.</hi> There
you ſhall ſee that the iniquity of the
people made that Prophet mad; &amp;
yet you, that will not part with your
luſts and Hypocriſies, and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
of all ſorts, muſt be reckoned
the onely ſober and wiſe men, whilſt
he whom God hath ſpoken to, you
account mad. Did I not tell you,
<hi>That he which covers his ſins ſhould
not proſper, but he that confeſſeth
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170032:38"/>
and forſakes them: ſhould finde mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</hi>
Gods diſpleaſure is ready to
blow over, did we but ſeek him by
our unfained repentance, and lay
hold on him in faith, by our true
and new obedience. Doth not the
Scriptures all along give you this for
reaſon of the withhold of Gods
mercies? There are yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
Obſerve I beſeech you, as
anon I ſhall let you ſee, I had no
ſooner proclaimd this, and other
his loving kindneſſes towards us,
A diſtracted and diſtreſſed people,
in that Church of <hi>Youghall,</hi> which
I could not chuſe, neither can I
do other, than apply my ſelf to
all concerned, either by word of
mouth, or by writing: But I truely
ſay unto you, I was there the third
day clapt into priſon: commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
onely for Teaſon; when I know
no man living is or can be further
from the contrivance, or leſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of ſhedding any one mans
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170032:38"/>
bloud in the world: Nay, I would
from the bottom of my heart, &amp; ſo
do I pray, that God would be
pleaſed to ſet every mans ſins in
order before his face; give him
the heart, truely to repent of them;
come forth, confeſs, and truely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
all his iniquities; and practice
the contrary virtues, for the time
to come: So it is clearly certain,
God would be moſt glorified, and
we moſt happy, that have all done
amiſs, one way, or other.</p>
               <p>It is the worſt of men can kill,
but who can make alive? The good
Spirit of God ſtirs not any man, to
any private revenge: Not a Bird of
prey, but a Dove, was the ſhape,
wherein our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Many, O Lord, lived by thee;
never any deſtroyed, onely the poor
Fig-Tree; as a real Embleme of thy
ſeverity, to the unprofitable and
fruitleſs. After mercy ſo long abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
'tis time for judgement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:170032:39"/>
So that (I ſay) there I was ſome
eight weeks impriſoned: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I often wrote and ſollicited,
that I might be ſent over to <hi>Oliver
Cromwell;</hi> to whom I was more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
deputed, and ſo moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable,
for the carrying on of this
work of the Lord. Nay, I offered,
if they pleaſed, I would pay &amp; bear
the whole charge of a convoy to
him; and give it under my hand and
faith, I would not ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to eſcape.</p>
               <p>Further, that if I was found to be
deluded, then I was content, they
ſhould inflict upon my body what
puniſhment they pleaſed: But if an
Impoſtor, or one that would deceive
by lying, or falſe promiſes, ſpeaking
unto them, when not ſent, or what
God had not deputed me for; then
in that caſe that they burned me, or
put me to death; all theſe Original
papers I have by me, to ſhew any
that doubts it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:170032:39"/>
Yet theſe prevailed not for my
inlargement; ſo there I was retarded
in priſon, and coming over, near 3
months: and almoſt 2 months more
after arrived in <hi>England,</hi> before I
could come to communicate, what I
had to ſay to the <hi>General</hi> of all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, <hi>Oliver Cromwell.</hi>
Here was one impede of 5 moneths.
<hi>May is now gone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Averſneſs have I met with,
in all, or moſt of men: that (truely)
had not the Providence of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God put into the mindes and
mouths of ſome men, I have on late
dayes heard preach, and upon ſuch
ſuitable Subjects alſo; (certainly his
Almighty goodneſs hath guided me
to my great conſolation, and them
alſo, even to my great amazement,
juſt as if they had been within me,
and with me in all my ſufferings;)
I ſay, had I not been thus ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I had well nigh ſunk under the
burden: For ſo fit encouragements
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170032:40"/>
have I had from wiſe men preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that I ſhall never reckon it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than the loving kindneſs of
God to me, for my ſupport, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
on, in this his buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Even ſo did the <hi>Jews</hi> thus evilly
perſecute, deſpiſe, traduce, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and not hearken unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſent to them, although men
of their own Religion. Thus was I
ſhewed, what I am to expect from
All, or almoſt all: ſo that now, I
thank God, I am armed for it.</p>
               <p>For further reaſon, I may not do
other, than preſent you with the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and the Prophet
<hi>Jonah,</hi> who told them, that yet 40
dayes, and that great Citie ſhould be
deſtroyed. You may there ſee the
good effect of true repentance, and
ſpeedy turning from bad works, how
it kept off their judgement 40 years:
and can we (then) expect, or believe
other, but that continuance in ſin
(it may be augmenting them alſo)
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170032:40"/>
will have the contrary effects, to
keep off mercie?</p>
               <p>There is yet a reaſon, and that is
come to my cognizance and obſerve,
in a Book lately publiſhed by <hi>Ariſe
Evans</hi> (a man you are unworthy
of,) whom you have perſecuted too,
as you have all Gods Miniſters, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all, either by Impriſonment,
Sequeſtration, or Death, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
of undoing them. And what
to do, I pray, but to commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
that thoſe ye prefer, may ſet
up Imaginations of their own, and
you (as they) worſhip that Calf? But
you will ſay, This is no Idolatry:
if ſo, then let it go for Idiotrey; and
that hath but one Letter difference:
pray, let it go for both, as being
guilty of both.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Calfs you ſet up, after
them you low and run, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to neglect Gods Miniſters,
whom you will neither hear, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
leſt you ſhould be converted;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170032:41"/>
and ſo become poor. What? out of
love would you have us with that
ſeeming righteouſneſs, zeal, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
party, which to be of, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
prefer us. No; bewitcht we
are with it, and for theſe reaſons will
be of no other judgement: It is you
that talk fooliſhly, we profitably.
And this kinde of Idolatry in all
ages, hath cauſed Gods wrath to

How long did theſe diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies
keep them from entering into
the promiſed Land? which indeed
was ſo near them, as we may truely
ſay even at hand <hi>Moſes</hi> goeth but up
to the Mount, to converſe with God,
the people mutiny, and will have
him no more govern as King. And
for Prieſt and Prophet, why not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
as well as thoſe God onely had
ſet over them, ſeeing they took too
much upon them? What is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of this madneſs? up goes a
Calf preſently, worſhip it they will,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170032:41"/>
they will have Governours and
Teachers of their own making, as

ſo much upon them: yet ruled they
will be too, but it ſhall be by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Tell not us (ſay they of Gods
Miſſion of your Prophets, or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
onely; we know better; he that
can do all without book, learning,
or reaſon, then he is ſent, if ſo
gifted, if we like him alſo it is good
warrant. Thus your contempt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect,
and perſecution of thoſe men,
who undoubtedly would teach you
from Heaven and better things, than
you either hear, or practice on earth,
is another good reaſon; in all ages it
hath gone for a good one: And yet
one of your little ones muſt not be
offended: but, if he cries and bawls
for the life and eſtate of the moſt
conſiderable in the Kingdom, to
pleaſe, it muſt be given him, or them,
Babes of Grace! for you ſay the fat
of the earth is for you, the ſeeming
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170032:42"/>
Saints; But you ſhall finde, and know
too, anon, God will do ſomething,
for the thus perſecuted, but penitent,
Sinners.</p>
               <p>Turn you, turn you, you great
Hypocrites, and you ſhall ſee theſe
things come to paſs in a ſhort time:
And therefore gave I that Text to
that worthy Doctor <hi>Mollines,</hi> to let
you all ſee, <hi>that he which covers his
ſins ſhall not proſper, but who confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
and forſakes them, ſhall find mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi>
and there is the reaſon. It is
true, that good man Mr. <hi>Evans</hi> goes
on to tell you one fault more, an
error it may be, I think it is, I am
ſure it makes way for a great one, in
giving the year its beginning from
the <hi>Conception,</hi> which ſhould take
it from the <hi>Birth</hi> of our Lord. And
becauſe you may fill the world with
confuſion, you keep no day for the
Commemoration of that neither:
which helps to make that ever to be
obſerved good day no otherwiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170032:42"/>
than your charity; whoſe
right hand never yet knew what the
left did.</p>
               <p>But you trouble me; and I long
to be rid of you. Are not theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
if you have any for the wiſe
delay of Gods mercies, and reſtore
of our ſo much deſired <hi>King?</hi> who,
if he comes not yet years &amp; months,
of which opinion I am not, yet I will
wait and believe; for God hath ſaid
it, He whom you have perſecuted,
ſhall ſhortly come, and that in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
too: and, becauſe he ſowed in
tears, he ſhall reap in joy, and bring
his ſheaves with him.</p>
               <p>Oh! could I but perſwade every
man that reads me, or hears of what
the Lord is, in mercy, doing for theſe
<hi>Kingdoms,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant</hi>
Religion, but to turn to him, with
all his heart and Soul (for that is the
taking way) in new obedience, and
to leave no ſin unrepented of, and
no commandment unconform'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170032:43"/>
in ſincerity of heart, and true
obedience; you would then All ſee
that ſuddenly come to paſs, and be
fulfilled in your dayes and eyes;
which I do as truely believe will
come to paſs (and I ſhall ſee it, nay
I do already, and enjoy it alſo,) as
I do believe the Heavens to be over
my head, and the Earth under my
feet. Which if it fail, I am content
that you take me, and put me to
death.</p>
               <p>Theſe Reaſons given for its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
I am brought from what I had
of Viſion, or my own Dictates, to
that, which is moſt certainly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
and the word of the Lord.
Which, although ſpoken out of my
mouth, &amp; by my tongue pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
yet the matter no more my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions,
than I now dictate, or write
unto you, the words, or thoughts of
the moſt Remote King, or Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
in the World: for I never ſo
much as had things of that nature
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170032:43"/>
in my minde. Hear the manner and
the matter: they are both of the
Lord: To whom be given for ever
Honour, Praiſe, Glorie, Obedience
and Thankſgiving. Amen, O Lord,
Amen.</p>
               <p>And now before I proceed, give
me leave to tell you, that, this Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
the 5 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> is come to my
obſerve this of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> the 23
Chap. and the 28 verſ. <hi>The Prophet
that hath a Dream, let him tell a
Dream; and he that hath my word,
let him ſpeak my word faithfully: what
is the Chaff to the Wheat? ſaith the
Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O Lord, this being thy command,
I will obey thee: So help me, God;
for now I come to thy own words.</p>

               <p>SOme three dayes after, I returned
the ſecond time from the Lord
of <hi>Broghills</hi> to my Lodging, the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170032:44"/>
Widdow <hi>Merricks</hi> houſe in <hi>Youghal;</hi>
upon the 3 or 4 of <hi>January</hi> 1653.
lying there in bed, and having ſpent
moſt part of that night in Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Prayer, rejoycings &amp; weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
for of that nature were my
weepings (the fulleſt of joy imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable)
that indeed I often conceived
(not feared) I might ſooner die of
an over-joy, than any grief. In that
night (I ſay) from lying in my bed,
I was upon a ſudden taken up, that is
to ſay, made to ſit up, ſomewhat
bowing: and when ſo, I did then
with a loud voice, ſomewhat altered
from my ordinary ſpeaking, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
theſe words, which words,
I ſay, are the words of the Lord of
Hoſts, God Almighty, &amp; are theſe:</p>
               <p>There is an end of all the Wars in
the Christian World. The Jews ſhall
come in, alſo the Heathen, and ſhall
be converted to the true Religion. The
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall. The <hi>Iriſh</hi>
ſhall not be tranſplanted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:170032:44"/>
This ſaid, I was laid down: and
wondring with my ſelf, that I ſhould
be thus taken up, made to ſpeak
what I knew I uttered, yet not have
any of thoſe thoughts, or concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in my minde, nor knew not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was taken up, that I was riſing,
nor one word of what I ſaid, before
pronounced; I could not but very
much admire (and ſo I did) both the
manner and the matter: Well, I
then prayed and praiſed God; for
awake I was, as truely as I am now;
the ſequel will prove that. I then
concluded it was not at all I that did
it, it was the Lord, who would have
it ſo, and his Propheſie it was
and is.</p>
               <p>Much about half a quarter of an
hour after, I was taken up again, as
formerly, and ſpake theſe words:</p>
               <p>Proclaim <hi>CHARLS STUART,
King</hi> of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the Faith:
<hi>Charls 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> King</hi> of the whole World.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170032:45"/>
This <hi>CHARLS STUART</hi> ſhall
never die; the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Boyl</hi>
ſhall never die; the <hi>Queen</hi> his Mother
(wife to the late <hi>King,</hi> already bleſſed)
ſhall never die; the now <hi>Queen</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> ſhall never die; the <hi>King</hi> of
<hi>France</hi> ſhall never die; his <hi>Brother,</hi>
the <hi>Queens</hi> other Son ſhall never die;
but ſhall all be taken up into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that never ſhall
have end.</p>
               <p>This ſpoken, I was laid down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:
then did one M. <hi>Barret,</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in <hi>Briſtol</hi> that deals in Leather
and Skins, who lodged in the ſame
Chamber with me (but in another
bed) call to me, asked me how I did,
and if I was well: I replied to him,
very well: He asked me if I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep,
I ſaid no: he asked me if I knew
what I ſaid: I replied, yes, very well:
he asked me if I believed what I ſaid,
I told him, he muſt give me leave to
believe, what the Lord cauſed me to
ſpeak, and would have done. There
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170032:45"/>
lodged alſo in the next room, one
<hi>John Marrick,</hi> the Widdows ſon of
that houſe, aged about 21. With
him in bed another Merchant, as I
take it, of <hi>Briſtol</hi> alſo, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts;
to them both well known:
Thoſe in that one bed, ſpake to me
alſo; I replyed to them; many words
we had, all I remember not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I was anon after, taken up again,
as formerly, and ſpake theſe words:
OLIVER CROMVVELL</hi> ſhall never
die; the Counteſs of <hi>Cork</hi> ſhall never
die; the <hi>Earl</hi> her husband ſhall never
die; the Ladie <hi>Frances Boyl</hi> (their
eldeſt daughter) ſhall never die; the
Lord of <hi>Broghill</hi> ſhall never die; the
Ladie <hi>Broghill,</hi> his now wife, ſhall
never die; but ſhall all be taken up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the kingdom of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which
never ſhall have end.</p>
               <p>I was laid down again, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
with my ſelf, What, ſhall <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
Cromwell</hi> never die? it pleaſed
me not: But again the Lord repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170032:46"/>
me, and would have me know,
he judgeth not as man judgeth; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did his ways admit of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
or contradiction. Here again I
ſpoke to the former parties, but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
lay ſtill, praying, weeping, and
praiſing God: for now I firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and remembered, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
theſe things were mightie,
ſtrange, and wonderfull; yet, by his
Power, for his mercie, glorie, and
names ſake, he had aſſured me, he
would bring them to paſs, <hi>and they
ſhould be marvellous in our eyes,</hi> as
the Seal of my Commiſſion was:
And remember I did, he was now
giving me the matter.</p>
               <p>Again anon after, I was raiſed, as
formerly, and ſpake theſe words:</p>
               <p>Thou <hi>Walter Goſtellow</hi> ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
die; thy three Sons ſhall never die;
thy wife <hi>Anne,</hi> and daughter <hi>Anne
Goſtellow</hi> ſhall never die: but ſhall
all be taken up into the kingdom of
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that never ſhall have
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170032:46"/>
end. Then ſhall the bodies of the
Saints, alreadie dead, ariſe, and be
taken up into heaven alſo; the <hi>Sheep</hi>
ſhall go to the right hand, and the
<hi>Goats</hi> to the left: pronounce this
<hi>houſe,</hi> a bleſſed houſe, and this <hi>cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
ſhall for ever be called the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the <hi>Great Prophet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I ſet here down every
word, then pronounced by me: but
certainly the Dictates and good
pleaſure of the Lord of hoſts, that
they be publiſhed to the world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by me <hi>Walter Goſtellow,</hi> his
unworthy inſtrument. I have not
added, or taken from, one word that
I know of, nor misreported the
manner.</p>
               <p>But as old <hi>Eli</hi> asked <hi>Samuel,</hi> after
called of God by his name 3 times,
<hi>Samuel;</hi> &amp; God had ſpoken unto him,
and given him his imploy, what it
was the Lord had ſaid unto him, as
you may read in the 3 Chapter of
that his firſt Book, and the 17 ver.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170032:47"/>
and <hi>Eli</hi> there charged him, that he
hid nothing from him, but tell him
all; which <hi>Samuel</hi> tels you and him
in the next verſe. He did ſo, hid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from him. What follows? it
is the Lord, let him do what ſeems
him good: and the Lord was with
<hi>Samuel,</hi> he grew, and the Lord let
none of his words fall to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
So all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi>
knew that <hi>Samuel</hi> was eſtabliſhed a
Prophet of the Lord, things coming
to paſs as he had foretold.</p>
               <p>When I heard the word <hi>Prophet,</hi>
&amp; knew my unworthy ſelf to be the
man, O Lord, thou knoweſt my
thoughts both then and now, they
are at no time hid from thee, I ſtand
amazed, O Lord, and am ſilent, lay
my hand I do upon my mouth, and
my mouth upon the ground. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet!
I am unworthy O Lord, yea, I
am unworthy to live, much more
unworthy of this ſo great honor:
but, O Lord, thou haſt faſhioned
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170032:47"/>
me, make me I beſeech thee, always
to do thy will, not mine own, that
hath been and now is ſinfull; yea, ſo
hath it been all my days: therefore
I moſt humbly beſeech thee, to have
mercy upon me, O Lord, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of ſinners, nay thou wilt have
mercy for thy compaſſions fail not,
and thy mercies, as thy ways, are
paſt finding out.</p>
               <p>The reſt of that night I ſpent in
Meditation and Prayer; when day, I
aroſe: not fully dreſſed, took Pen &amp;
Ink, wrote all ſpoken; but with this
addition, I began with a Summons
and Invitation to whomſoever, that
they would repair the next week,
Thurſday morning, about nine of the
Clock, being the 12 of <hi>January,</hi> to
the Town and Church of <hi>Youghal,</hi>
there to hear a Sermon, upon this
Text; <hi>He that covereth his ſins, ſhall
not proſper: but he that confeſſeth, and
forſaketh them, ſhall finde mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text was given by a Prophet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170032:48"/>
of Almighty God, now here in
<hi>Youghall,</hi> his name <hi>Walter Gostelow;</hi>
which Prophet will then after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that day, tell you all in the
Church, that there is an end of all
the Wars in the Chriſtian World:
And ſo I went on to finiſh, as before
Propheſied and recited.</p>
               <p>Further, they ſhould that day ſee
riding out in great ſtate, ſeveral of
thoſe Saints, and this Prophet, out
of Town; and upon the Strand of
<hi>Youghall:</hi> which to me as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
was given as a ſign, or miracle,
being yet to come, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of my Faith, as alſo for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
and ground of belief, to the
Sons and Daughters of Men.</p>
               <p>I there went on, <hi>The Heathen and
the Jews are now fitting by the Lord,
to come into his Doctrine, worſhip and
ſervice: and under his Scepter.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
which word of God, the <hi>Holy
Bible</hi> not to be altered; the Book of
<hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> in ſome things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170032:48"/>
and amended, as by a Council
lawfully called, whom God ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
ſhall ſtand and flouriſh all over
the whole World: The Doctrine
and Faith of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
being the pureſt in the World:
againſt which word of God, and his
ſword, put into the hands of this
<hi>King,</hi> CHARLS STUART, no
Power on Earth ſhall ever prevail;
that of <hi>Rome</hi> is now tumbling down,
and melting away like a mighty
Snow-ball.</p>
               <p>The King and Queen of <hi>France,</hi>
with that whole Nation, ſhall ere
long be converted to this Faith:
which Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and all
others upon the Earth, under the
Sun and Heavens, ſhall be obedient
to this <hi>Charls</hi> the Second, and his
Rule in the Kingdom of <hi>England:</hi>
The Lady <hi>Elizabeth Boyl,</hi> ſecond
Daughter to the Earl and Counteſs
or <hi>Cork,</hi> is this <hi>Kings</hi> Wife.</p>
               <p>The General of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:170032:49"/>
Forces, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> ſhall never
die, ſo I here wrote him, and could
not otherwiſe, though I tried often,
and varied to give him ſeveral Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
but could not, the Reaſon you
ſhall have anon. Be pleaſed to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
in the pronounce of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
it is onely <hi>Oliver Cromwell;</hi>
all other Perſons of Dignity &amp; Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
by their Titles <hi>as Signiories,</hi>
his onely <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
I promiſe.</p>
               <p>I went on; The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation ſhould
not be removed, but poſſeſs their
own juſt Rights, converted to this
true Faith they ſhould be: And ſo,
praying that God would enlighten
them, and all men, that we might
all live in brotherly love and Unity
one with another, return again into
his Courts with praiſes, and there
ſerve him in ſincerity of heart, and in
the beauty of holineſs; (for ſo his
houſe ought to be fitted for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,)
that others might be invited
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170032:49"/>
by us and with us, to glorifie our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which is in Heaven: whoſe will
be done on earth by men, as it is by
Saints and Angels in Heaven. Thus
I concluded, writing as faſt as
poſſibly, which done: I could not be
quiet, but haſted immediately to
that ſo every way eminently good
Counteſs of <hi>Cork,</hi> read the Paper
to her, and after made it my requeſt,
very often ſollicitous I was by my
Letters, that ſhe would ſend her
Letters abroad, to invite in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Gentry, and Countrey to the
Town of <hi>Youghall</hi> againſt that day,
the 12 of <hi>January:</hi> my ſelf having
read and communicated the whole
to her Honour, was by her and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Mollines</hi> over-perſwaded, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
for a time to my Chamber,
which I did: But when there, I could
not be quiet, but wrote and ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to ſeveral, inviting them to
<hi>Youghall,</hi> that 12 of <hi>January,</hi> to hear,
as before recited, all to be divulged
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170032:50"/>
by me that day in the Church, after
Sermon. I continued ſoliciting that
<hi>Counteſs,</hi> that ſhe would do the like,
untill I knew I became troubleſom,
yea very troubleſom, even unto two
dayes before this 12 of <hi>January,</hi> did
I thus be ſtir my ſelf.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Fine,</hi> my Kinſman, M <hi>Leonard
Goſtelow.</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Earl,</hi> came
to me, brought me back from her
Honour, divers of my own Letters;
told me weeping, that the <hi>Counteſs</hi>
and his <hi>Lord,</hi> with divers others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
me certainly Mad, that I
would ſo impertinently to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
trouble my ſelf and others. He
then asked me, what I would have,
I told him onely the Countrey, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
Gentry, and All, to come in to
hear the Sermon and Propheſie, that
day the 12 of <hi>January:</hi> He replied
to me, if it be company you would
have, trouble not your ſelf, there
will be enough here; for on that day
will be ſeveral Horſe-matches:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170032:50"/>
which hearing, I was very much
joyed, and after that time, never
troubled my ſelf in the leaſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
in that buſineſs to move further:
which I take God Almighty to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
untill his telling me of it, it
came not into my minde; although
I confeſs, I had formerly heard of
it; but all the time untill then, it
was no more remembered by me,
than it was known to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morteſt
man in the World. But I
ſhall obſerve to you anon, the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and good pleaſure of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
in caſting and bringing to
paſs, what fell out upon that day;
the day I was moſt active upon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the divulge of all I had to ſay,
and did ſay it in the Church.</p>
               <p>I cannot but obſerve to you, that
when perſwaded to retire to my
Lodging, and did ſo, the Lord of
<hi>Broghill</hi>'s Phyſician came to me,
cloſely attended me, &amp; ſweat I muſt,
keep my bed, not ſtir, not write at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170032:51"/>
any hand, not do any thing, but as
preſcribed: all which I now ſee were
clear Artifices of the Lord of
<hi>Broghill,</hi> and that otherwiſe-good
Counteſs of <hi>Cork;</hi> leſt I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
in the Church, what I had
penned in the Paper: for to her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
I made always my firſt addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
untill it pleaſed God, to direct
me to the Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> as more
conſiderable, for the carrying on of
this work of the Lords: For it is the
Lords, and ſhall, and will come to
paſs, though I muſt tell thee, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
(whoſoever thou art) I have
met with very little other, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſneſs
and deriſion, if not ſcorn,
from almoſt All; and to be called
Mad, hath been in many of their
mouths: Yet, I praiſe God, though
ſome have endeavoured to make
me the ſooner Mad, by very unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
carriages and affronts, no man
living can ſay, nay, I challenge them
to it, that they divulge it, if they
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170032:51"/>
ever ſaw, in any of my actions, or
Papers (which I have Copies of,
the moſt conſiderable, and ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

if ſo, let them ſhew it to the World,
ſpare me not, I beg not their favour,
I ſcorn it, it is no new thing (O Lord)
to beſtow ill and falſe Appellations,
in all ages, upon men, thy ſervants
ſent upon the like imploy, to turn
others from the errour of their ways
that delight in general wickedneſſes.
To declare ought from the Lord,
that ſuites not with their fancies,
love and over-carnal apprehenſions;
it muſt be madneſs in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
&amp; to adviſe the Great, Rich,
Covetous, Proud, &amp; High-minded,
to deny themſelves, madneſs it muſt
be. Aſſuredly, our portion is like
that of our <hi>Saviours,</hi> from the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were ſo: they
heard all that was ſaid unto them,
yet being proud and covetous, they
derided him.</p>

But thou, O Lord be thy name for
ever praiſed, and ſo magnified thou
aſſiſteſt, thou delivereſt me, thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videſt
for me, of thy alſufficiencie,
rich mercie, and everlasting loving-kindneſs;
which, I now moſt humbly
beſeech thee may increaſe in me, not
onely in a firm dependance on thee, but
a walking before thee all my days, in
the true practice of pietie, and ways of
thy commandments: which onely can,
through thy mercie, deliver in all the
Inundations of evil, and practices of

               </p>
               <p>Thurſday the 12 of <hi>January</hi>
came, in bed I would not ſtay, up I
got, to the Church I went, took a
ſeat in the moſt convenient place,
quietly demeaned my ſelf until Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
was ended: Here I cannot but
obſerve to you, that although Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>Mollines</hi> had his Sermon in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs;
yet by reaſon of a ſore throat,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170032:52"/>
preached not, but the ordinarie Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturer
for that day: And yet, as if
he had been, in ſome meaſure, privy
to my Propheſie, and Intentions
(which be could not be) his Sermon
was very much for amendment of
life. And obſerve alſo he did, that
<hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were tranſlated into
heaven, having walked with God,
and kept his commandments on
earth; ſo that (as I after obſerved
to him) his Sermon ſeemed to me,
to be a Propheſie of a Propheſie.
But I have had many of theſe, to
my conſolation, as formerly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
from a mercifull God.</p>
               <p>Sermon ended, I then deſired the
people to ſtay, and ſuffer me a few
words: I told them, I had to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
unto them, which was
certainly of the Lord, conſiſting of
Dream, its obſerve and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Viſion alſo and Propheſie, all
of the Lord. I then reached to me
the <hi>Church Bible,</hi> kiſſed it, and did
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170032:53"/>
promiſe upon that holy Evangeliſt,
I would not ſpeak other to them,
than I did believe the Lord had
ſpoken to me, no man living ever
dictating a word to me, or diſpoſing
me thereunto, nor now to this;
which as I could not do other then,
but ſpeak, ſo now here, but publiſh
by Printing unto them, and all thoſe
concerned of the World.</p>
               <p>Begin I did, as you have heard,
declared my Dream, its Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
my Viſion, and other dictates
of mine own, which I penned not,
yet ſo to them related, as here reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
the Propheſie I read to them as
I wrote it <hi>verbatim,</hi> the morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Lord cauſed me to ſpeak it.</p>
               <p>When I came to proclaim the
<hi>King,</hi> away goes the Governor,
Colonel <hi>Saunders,</hi> after him the
<hi>Major</hi> of the Corporation. When
of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> I ſpake,
and the flouriſhing of that again, and
how that none ſhould ever prevail,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170032:53"/>
that roſe up againſt the word of
God, and his Diſcipline now to be
eſtabliſhed, and his Sword alſo put
into the hand of his King, CHARLS
STUART, away goes (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
the <hi>disaffected to both:</hi> for
certainly, Congregations are now
adays, made up of Goats and Tares,
lovers of our ſelves we are, more
than God; and yet be we muſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
until the Harveſt come: then
the Propheſie, as the moſt ſure
written word of God tels you, the
Goats muſt to the left, when the
Sheep onely go to the right hand;
Chaff and Tares to their own home.</p>
               <p>In this Church, although a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-day,
but one Servant of the
Earl of <hi>Corks,</hi> not one of the Lord
of <hi>Broghills,</hi> as I ſaw and remember:
and why that one? and who muſt
that Servant be, but my Coſin their
<hi>Secretarie,</hi> one whom they knew I
loved, and would be much ruled by.
Well, how governs he? I ſuſpect, by
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170032:54"/>
their order too, he comes to me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
as ſoon as I was entered upon
what I intended, and had to do, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
me to deſiſt, weeps to me, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
him, he after pulls me by the
Cloak and Arm, uncivil more than
enough hales me by both, prayes
and weeps to have me out; I took
faſter hold, told him if they would
burn me, they might; but I would
not ſtir from that place, nor from
that imploy of the Lords, untill I
had done that work the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me of his: Then crying like
a great (yet Childiſh) Kinſman, he
went away, whileſt I was over-joyed,
being ſo well rid of him; &amp; ſo thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God, I went quietly on, to do all
I intended to a word, without any
other violence offered me: Yet my
Congregation grew very thin in the
end.</p>
               <p>It is the unhappineſs of theſe times,
that where He ſtands up, that is not
ſent, thither the people run, to which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170032:54"/>
ill adviſed, we may fitly uſe that of
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who, when he ſees one
do ſo, <hi>obſerve</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what haſte
that man makes, to leave his wits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
him:</hi> Yet, to the comfort of
thoſe that hold out to the laſt,
though but a few, if in well-doing,
the bleſſing is to them: But its pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
muſt remedy this, not conceits;
the loving kindneſs of the Lord muſt
do it: Which, when he ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to reſtore to us wiſer Teachers,
we may then hope to ſee. In the
mean time, it calls for our prayers
and tears, that we ſee it not.</p>
               <p>It was a witty one of long ſince
deceaſed Mr. <hi>Shuit,</hi> officiating in
<hi>Lombard ſtreet,</hi> I heard it from him,
(indeed he married me; may his
memory and his works ever live in
us) in a Sermon, complaining of
theſe Times, which he foreſaw haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
upon us, (for ſuch are the true
Prophets of the Lord, and therefore
(as I conceive) called Seers;) <hi>The
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170032:55"/>
age is now grown ſo Chimical (ſaid
he) that from a Tailers ſhop-board, or
Weavers loom, we have thoſe now will
extract Learning enough, to ſtand</hi> 3
<hi>hours in a Pulpit, before an apron'd &amp;
giddy Auditory (with applauſe too;)
that ſhould a wiſe Man put his head in
at the Church-dore, he would judge
the Famine to be very ſore among us,
to ſee an Aſſes head valued at ſo many
pieces of ſilver. Mais donne aux auſnes
le Chardons,</hi> let Aſſes feed on Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles.
But I muſt go on.</p>
               <p>Of a like nature was one I heard,
praying in the Pulpit for a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
in thoſe over-active times,
diſpairingly ſay, How can we hope
for it to Gods glory, when there is
not one in our Univerſities, or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals
but what are Factors for
that Whore of <hi>Babylon?</hi> Sure, he
was never there, he was ſo ignorant,
miſtake me not, I mean the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity;
if otherwiſe, give him the
Whet-ſtone, having thus preach'd
for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:170032:55"/>
Truely, I would not make theſe
Aberrations, but for this Reaſon;
There was with me, all the time of
my impriſonment at <hi>Youghall,</hi> and a
priſoner alſo, a perſon of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as I firmly believe, M. <hi>David
Rooche,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Lord <hi>Rooche;</hi> a Gentleman of
very great integrity, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
where truſt and <hi>devoir</hi> lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him.</p>
               <p>He is a great Devotery and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
hath often told me, how like I was
to be deluded, becauſe part of my
Propheſie was, that the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> ſhould fall; which he laboured
to have me believe, the Gates of
Hell ſhould never prevail againſt;
as being what <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſed to his
Church, That being it, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>He told me, We could ſhew no
Church, neither were we any, ſince
fallen from them, the onely Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170032:56"/>
in all ages, viſibly ſhining, as
upon an hill. That with him was the
ſtrength of his argument, any thing
that ever was in Ours, that looked
like a Church, ſee, becauſe it was
but like one, how God had now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated
that alſo. And for the
Preachers of our Church (as we
would have the World yet misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
we were a Church) now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, what were they, but men
unſent, who filled the world with
Schiſmes Falſhood, Hereſie, ſtrange
and lying Opinions, few or none of
them agreeing; whereas Unite was
the beſt devote of a true Church,
and that theirs onely hath, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
had.</p>
               <p>'Twas too much ſaid, for him to
prove; yet this I will ſay of him,
(nay, I have Propheſied it, and it
will come to paſs) he is too good a
man, to ſin againſt the light of his
Conſcience, he would fear and ſerve
none but <hi>God</hi> onely, nor obey any
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170032:56"/>
but his <hi>King;</hi> and both them with
all his heart: Therefore I told him,
God had, of his Providence, then
ſent him my Fellow-Priſoner, to
ſhew him, firſt or laſt, the Error of
of his Judgement, and that Church:
And then, becauſe he was ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
good otherways in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
ſo exemplarie, he would, being
converted, bring his Countrey to
the Service of <hi>God,</hi> as well as he had
formerly done them to his <hi>Kings</hi>
ſervice; from which intereſt he
would never ſuffer himſelf, nor them
to be ſtirred in the leaſt: for in that
he was a true <hi>Rooche,</hi> which in
French is a <hi>Rock;</hi> whereas now I
underſtand the Honor was in a
French Field, but in the good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of his then King, given to his
Anceſtors Viſcount Lord <hi>Rooche.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I could not for the honor of our
Church, the glorie of God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of my own dutie, but reply
to him, and let him know, that ſuch
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170032:57"/>
fooliſh Babblers as thoſe, which now
ſo preached, were no more of our
Church, the true <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> than
thoſe that make merchandize of the
kingdom of heaven now in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would be
reckoned to be, if that Church were
again reſtored to her Priſtine Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
which I believe, God would in
mercie do, by throwing down and
out of her, all the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
crept in in ſeveral ages; who, for
their own ends, defiled her with
damnable Tenents and Abſurdities.</p>
               <p>The beloved Church of God, I
obſerved to him, we were, though
now thus beclouded. The Moon,
to which that Church is compared,
is not alwayes at full, ſhe has wanes
and changes, and Eclipſes alſo, yet
ſtill a Church, as that a Moon.</p>
               <p>I beſeech you, is not now the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion at
ſtake? and doth it not clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to all that love her, what diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170032:57"/>
theſe unſent, bold and empty
Babblers have done us? Thoſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds
are like thoſe Vagabond
<hi>Jews</hi> in the 19 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the 13
<hi>verſ.</hi> who took upon them to call
over them that had evil Spirits, the
name of the Lord Jeſus, ſaying, <hi>We
adjure you by Jeſus, whom</hi> Paul
<hi>preacheth, to come forth;</hi> yet no good
is done by them, out they come not,
the evil Spirits are where they were,
not caſt out, but replied to them,
<hi>Jeſus we know,</hi> he is ſent of God,
Paul <hi>we know,</hi> he is ſent of <hi>Jeſus,
but who are you?</hi> who the Devil ſent
you? Well: unſent of God they
finde them: What doth that man
poſſeſſed with the evil Spirits do?
He leaps upon them, over-comes
them, prevails upon them, ſo that
they fled out of the houſe naked and
wounded. This ſpread over the
Countrey, and the Name of <hi>Jeſus</hi>
was magnified; ſo ſhall his Name
alſo be magnified by us, or you in
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170032:58"/>
Authority, if you ſuppreſs thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
vagabond, giddy, bold, empty,
ſcandalous (what ſhall I call them?)
Itinerates, froward &amp; factious Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,
diſhonourers of Gods true
Religion, Church, and our Nation.</p>
               <p>By ſober men are not theſe things
and times to be lamented? And are
not wiſe men, if now in power, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to help diſtreſſed Religion,
thus crying out, <hi>O Religion, Religion!
thou that art the ſtrongeſt of policie,
which teacheſt to rule well, and to be
ſo ruled?</hi> Pray, did not the fear of
God, which is the beginning of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
not fear of man, make <hi>David</hi>
wiſer than his Teachers? And doth
it not ſtrengthen more than ten
mighty men? Oh! its Excellencie
invites you to ſide with it; though
now ſeemingly down, it will raiſe it
ſelf, and all that love it. Haſte you,
be ye of this bleſs'd number. But to
the matter.</p>
               <p>All thus done at Church, I went
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170032:58"/>
to the Earl of <hi>Cork</hi>'s houſe, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to enter the Parlour, where
that day were ſate divers Perſons of
quality at Dinner: I was refuſed
enterance, though my unworthy ſelf,
formerly by the good favour of that
Earl and Counteſs, was one they
were pleaſed to admit to their own
Table, for ſome moneths: but now
denied enterance I was. Well; I
watched my opportunity, my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
being of another nature, than
eating; it was to do the will of my
Father which is in Heaven, which
was to let that moſt incomparable
Lady, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Boyl</hi> (for
other I may not call her, whom God
Almighty hath ſet apart &amp; choſen,
to ſo much Honour and bliſs, as to
be his <hi>Queen,</hi> and the <hi>beloved</hi> of
God,) on my knees I told her, That,
in obedience to the Commands of
God, I had that day in the Church
of <hi>Youghall,</hi> Proclaimed our <hi>King,</hi>
and her good ſelf his <hi>Queen.</hi> From
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170032:59"/>
my knees I roſe, went out, amde no
diſturbance (though the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
there, ſo ſoon as he ſaw me,
I well remember, roſe up) and was
for my being had out: but having
done what I could not chooſe, my
duty ſo much deſired, I took my ſelf
away, for I neither ſpake more, nor
did more, but quietly went away.
Now comes the ſign given me for
confirmation of my Faith, that the
things Propheſied ſhall come to
paſs, obſerve how it is made good to
me, both for day, perſons, ſtate, and
place.</p>
               <p>Dinner there ended, a Coach with
ſix Horſes is made ready, which in
that place I never ſaw before: into it
gets the Counteſs of <hi>Cork,</hi> the Lady
<hi>Broghall,</hi> the Lady Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
Boyl,</hi> the Lady <hi>Frances Boyl,</hi> the
Earl of <hi>Cork</hi> on Horſ-back, the Lord
of <hi>Broghill</hi> likewiſe mounted, and
all theſe well accountred, &amp; no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
attended: In good equipage
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170032:59"/>
they ride through and out of this
Town of <hi>Youghall,</hi> unto the <hi>Strand,</hi>
where the ſeveral <hi>Horſ-matches</hi> were
that day run. Well; they all gone,
my ſelf rode after; coming thither,
was looked at by all for my fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noons
work, the <hi>Governour</hi> of the
Town there; on the Strand I rode,
to others I told what I had in the
Church, did not madly rave, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
any the leaſt diſturbance; ſtayed
to the laſt; rode off the Strand, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
betwixt the Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi>
and the Governour <hi>Colonel Saunders;</hi>
told them what God Almighty
would have done and come to paſs;
rode next them all through the
Town; no diſturbance all this while;
yet the Lord of <hi>Broghill</hi> told me ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times I muſt forbear ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
otherwiſe he would order
me, and committed I ſhould be.
He was as good as his word; for out
of my Lodging I was fetch'd, and
had to Priſon, but by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170032:60"/>
Warrant, he not ſeen in it.
Truely, I think I may take his word
at all times, for what he promiſeth;
hear my reaſon:</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> ſome 17 years ago, I
furniſhed upon Bills of exchange,
one of his <hi>Brothers</hi> with a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
ſum of money for his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
own uſe; after that near upon
one hundred pounds more, for this
Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> who was not then
at age; his Elder Brother gave me
his Bond, Parrole and Honour, to
pay thoſe Bills of exchange, given
me for repayment in <hi>England:</hi> This
his Brother was killed in the Wars
of <hi>Ireland;</hi> my money not paid by
him the Bills were drawn upon, nor
ever by that his elder Brother; the
principle killed, and my whole debt
ſeemingly dead alſo, being very
great. My ſelf now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I
reminded this Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> of
what by Parrole, he was debter to
me, with its conſideration for 17
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170032:60"/>
years, upon Bill of exchange, ſigned
by his elder brother, but never paid,
his Lordſhip not being at age, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
not bound, otherwiſe than in
point of Honour, by his Parrole.</p>
               <p>Truely, the long time, and my
diſcontinuance beyond the Seas, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
made no former Application to
him, had worn both out of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
but upon diſcourſe both came
to his Lordſhips reminde; No ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
ſo, but we conſented to refer all
allowances and demands of Intereſt
to the <hi>Earl</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi> and M. <hi>Robert
Boyl</hi> his youngeſt. This done, by
conſent, his Lordſhip a few dayes
after told me, Well, if my brothers,
to whom we have referr'd this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſee no ground in Law, poſſibly
to proceed upon his Lordſhip have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not given either ſpecialty, or
promiſe ſince his being at age, to pay
the moneys, ſo not liable in Law;
If thus they proceed (ſaid his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to me) yet come you to me,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170032:61"/>
and I will compoſe you in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>But his Lordſhips brothers, whom
I found conſcientious alſo, in ſix
words (as I may ſay) compoſed me,
and I have my money: and theſe
grounds I have for the taking of his
Paroll, my impriſonment, and the
preſerve of his Paroll with Honour;
and to thoſe that will preſerve it,
Honour is due, as here to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:
for the publiſhing of this Act
I was debter, either to the invite, or
elſe to the ſhame of others, that have
more of Title, but leſs of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Good Men direct into, not lead
out of the way; I am where I was,
and go on to let you know, that this
day, Thurſday the 12 of <hi>January,</hi> all
thoſe Perſons being thus there, and
in ſuch good equipage, upon the
ſame place, the ſign given me for
my confirmation, and others alſo,
is fully made good to me, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170032:61"/>
alſo my not commitment, that
day, together with the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of people, from parts far
more remote than I intended my
Summons, for the invite in of the
<hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> that day, to
that place, for to let them know this
buſineſs of the Lords.</p>
               <p>Thus the work of the Lord is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on to the greateſt advantage,
and ſo brought to paſs, whileſt we
onely think to do our own wills, how
doth he make us to effect his? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Creature walks blindfold, onely
he that dwells in light ſees whither
they go. We are for Horſ-races,
yet ſee how we fall under his decrees
unawares, that we might the more
adore the depth of his Providence.</p>
               <p>For the rumore of what I had ſaid
and done that day, and the next,
ſpred over the Country; Poſt it
went to <hi>Dublin;</hi> in <hi>England</hi> it was
in a ſhort time; and as the Cloud of
<hi>Elias,</hi> raiſed from the Sea, at firſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170032:62"/>
appeared but as an hand-breadth, ſo
this rumour, raiſed upon the Strand
of <hi>Youghall,</hi> by the Sea-ſide, little
then, as it was, now as that Cloud
raiſed by that Prophet, ſpread over
the whole Heavens and Earth, and
falls upon it alſo, what to do? but
even as his, To glad the people, and
make fruitfull the Earth. Publick
meetings and great concourſes of
people, fitteſt to diſperſe general
mercies to the Sons of men. The
<hi>Iriſh</hi> deſire to know nothing more,
nor enjoy any thing on Earth, before
their own habitations; not to be
tranſplanted, and to have the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Government reſtored. Why, they
are ready to die of an over-joy. Oh,
the wiſdom and loving kindneſs of
the Lord! Who can do other than
obey him?</p>
               <p>Well, the third day in Priſon I
am, and for Treaſon too, there I
paſs a moneth, or ſix weeks, no offer
for inlargement: On a ſudden, If I
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170032:62"/>
will go out, I may, but I muſt go
preſently aboard a Ship, there bound
for <hi>England,</hi> ready to depart: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
requeſts I made before that time,
that I might be ſent over Priſoner
to the General, <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> to
whom I was deputed; but not in
any hearkened unto. Well: Go I
would, yet poſitively I ſaid, that
untill I had once more been with the
Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> and given him
my Propheſie in writing, under my
Hand and Seal, delivered and left
with him the moſt material parts of
it; I would not go: that done I would
go, and then his Lordſhip ſhould
diſpoſe of me as he pleaſed, I would
afterwards in all things readily obey
him.</p>
               <p>His Lordſhips <hi>Secretary</hi> and the
Earl of <hi>Corks</hi> both with me, then
making the offer of inlargement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the terms as before: which when
I refuſed, except upon my own
terms, they fairly told me I ſhould
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170032:63"/>
ly there three moneths longer, then
be proceeded againſt, and for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
hang'd: To which I replied, Let
them burn me alſo, if they could;
I would not go out but upon thoſe
terms.</p>
               <p>Appear to the people I would,
had they put me in publickly, and
will they take me out privatly? I
would appear to the people, even to
all that were there, that I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged;
<hi>Mad</hi> I was not, the buſineſs
was the Lords, and he would bring
it to paſs, and deliver whom he had
ſent and commiſſionated, in the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
time. I bade them be gone, told
them I would do all that, and more,
which was to leave another of my
Propheſies, under my own hand, at
the Houſe I lodged in, the Widdow
<hi>Merricks,</hi> written in Parchment,
boxed up, and hanged over my Beds
head, in the Chamber I lodged in,
which I pronounced ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Chamber of the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170032:63"/>
for ever. My Propheſie I
wrote, gave it to the Widdow <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi>
Son in writing; a Man grown
he is; he keeps it ten dayes, or more,
then returned it me, and told me his
Mother durſt not ſuffer it to be
hanged up, Here was obedience to
Governours: I would it had always
been ſo.</p>
               <p>Well: the Ship is gone, in Priſon
I remain, my Keeper again begins
(new it now was not) to practice
ſome of his former Tricks upon me;
Falſe Prophet he calls me; a Child
of his, ſome 2 or 3 years old, is alſo
taught to call me ſo himſelf owns
the teaching of it; which when I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to forbear, or elſe tell me
upon what ground he did it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to me, he had good grounds.</p>
               <p>You are (ſaid he) for the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
keeping of <hi>Dayes</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi>
as in particular, that in the time of
<hi>Lent</hi> we ſhould do well to faſt, pray,
and examin our ſelves, that ſo,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170032:64"/>
through Gods mercies, we may, as
you ſay, become worthy receivers
of his moſt bleſſed body and bloud,
for the Remiſſion, of ſins, at the feaſt
of his Reſurrection at <hi>Easter;</hi> Nay,
you are for a <hi>Pasſion Sermon</hi> alſo,
upon <hi>good Friday</hi> (as you call it,)
when all dayes are alike: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
alſo of the <hi>Nativity</hi> of
our Lord, the <hi>Deſcending</hi> of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt,</hi> and divers other Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
things and times; all which the
true Prophets of the Lord have
cried down, and long ſince declined,
as moſt abominable and Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Here lay his proof, when I
asked him who thoſe Prophets were,
he told me the Godly Miniſters and
Prophets the <hi>Parliament</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,
&amp; appointed to hear preach.
I replied little, onely told him ſome
reaſons, that induced me to be of
that judgement; yet withall it was
worth his conſideration, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what became of thoſe Children
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170032:64"/>
that mocked the <hi>Prophet,</hi> againſt
whom the Lord ſent <hi>Bears</hi> out of
the Wood, to tear them in pieces
and devour them.</p>
               <p>Well: reconciled we were, he told
me it ſhould no more be ſo, neither
did his Child any more provoke me;
but on the contrary I loved it, and
the Child me. Upon a ſhort time
after he told me, If I were a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
then he was a Dog: I reminded
him, ſuch expreſſions did not well
become; he might in that Propheſie
unhappily of himſelf; Dogs were
without, <hi>when Prophets were in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
I obſerved to him, he did all
without reaſon, told him I forgave
him and his Son formerly, and that
I prayed for both, that God would
be pleaſed to forgive them; (It is
true, I did ſo, and do ſo) that he
would be pleaſed to have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. He bid me keep my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to my ſelf, he nor his had no need
of them, and deſired them not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:170032:65"/>
He was often girding at me, quiet
I could not be for him; I ſaw he
loathed me, which made me ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
think on thoſe evil Spirits,
that though they knew it was our
<hi>bleſſed Lord,</hi> yet raging, asked him
why he was come to torment them
before their time: Good he told me
I could not be, becauſe I approved
not of one Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi> whom the
Parliament power had put in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
at <hi>Youghall,</hi> and ſettled upon him
an handſom Sallery of ſome an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and twenty pounds <hi>per annum.</hi>
His name implies he may be Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
though ſome ſuſpect he is not
yet fitted for the building up the
Houſe of God. God be pleaſed to
make all men wiſe and better; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the beſt accompliſhed is fitteſt
for his ſervice.</p>
               <p>This being Sunday, and my keeper
going then to hear this Mr. <hi>Wood,</hi>
Command is given, none muſt come
to me; locked up I am: Things thus
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170032:65"/>
hightening, and his prejudice en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
againſt me, my Bed the
night before taken from under me,
ſent for away, after he came from
M. <hi>Woods</hi> Sermon, my bolſter, ſheets,
and whatſoever I had of his, taken
away from me by himſelf, ſo great
a zeal brought he home with him,
from his ſo good Preacher M. <hi>Wood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well: to this condition being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
my ſelf not very well, not
uſed to ſuch affronts, not ſuch lodge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the ſeaſon winter, truely I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and prayed moſt of that night;
abandoned I now ſaw my ſelf almoſt
by all, nothing but hard uſage and
averſneſs do I meet with in all men,
to this buſineſs of the Lords, which
much troubled me: And truely, I
might here obſerve to you, that I
beſought <hi>God Almighty</hi> to direct, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver,
and enable me to get from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe great oppreſſions of men,
which without him I could not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.
Obſerve, I beſeech you, God
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170032:66"/>
withdraws not our helps, but for a
further advantage, however our
hopes may ſeem croſſed. Where his
name may gain, we cannot complain
of loſs: <hi>'twas ſo here; the work was
the Lords,</hi> and he was pleaſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
me, I ſhould grow from ſtrength
to ſtrength, untill I arrived at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
peace in <hi>Zion:</hi> and how that for
his <hi>Glory, Honour, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Names
ſake,</hi> he would bring it all to paſs, &amp;
it ſhould be marvellous in our eyes.</p>
               <p>Thus beſeeching the Lord, I
prayed, (and now do pray the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he firmly believe, as I do,
it being true) I had that night this
Viſion, or Call of the Lord, <hi>Come
away, bring your writings, come away,</hi>
reitterated juſt as the people you
read before did, when they ſaw the
Light and Crown in the Heavens,
bowed to God and it, it being of
Heaven, they all ſaid, <hi>Come we will
follow it;</hi> ſo here, <hi>Come away, bring
your writings, come away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:170032:66"/>
I could here truely obſerve to you,
that although my ſo civil Landlord,
was warm that night in a good Bed,
(I cold and had none) in Bed with
him ſuch another Saint, his Wife,
educated &amp; married from the houſe
of the once, no leſs zealous, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
than theſe two, the Lord <hi>Brook;</hi>
whoſe Servants they were either
both, or one: Yet on a ſudden ſhe
riſeth and runneth, the ſtrong water
is fetched, my Landlord very ſick,
nay, very ill, his Childe had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been ſo: This ſtrong water
was to be fetched out of the next
Room where I was pounded up; ſo
know it I did, indeed his wife told
me the reaſon of her haſte and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming:
Well; the ſtrong water he
had, and my prayers alſo for his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
and Gods forgiveneſs to
him: and though he formerly bade
me keep them to my ſelf, he nor
his had no need of them, his Child I
believe fared not the worſe for me,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170032:67"/>
for it after loved me, when well:
himſelf then had them, as alſo the
ſtrong water; if of any validity, God
Almighty have the glory, he had
the recovery then; but a Fool is not
alwayes to be anſwered in his folly.</p>
               <p>This I ſhould not have obſerved,
but that it is in reverence to what
himſelf hath very often told me, he
was that <hi>Thomas a Diddimus,</hi> that
ſhould not believe any thing of my
Propheſie, untill he ſaw it come to
paſs: the rather becauſe it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thoſe whom God approved
of, and ſet up to his glorie; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he took the liberty to call me
<hi>Traitor,</hi> as to them, and <hi>falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi>
as in reverence to their Godly
Miniſtery; ſuch was his zeal, but
whether well guided, or of God,
that's the queſtion. But I leave him
in his Dog-kennel, for ſo his then
habitable houſe was formerly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
as himſelf told me one time:
and truely, me thinks upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170032:67"/>
and action, it may well retain
the former name, if it hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued,
Dog kennel.</p>
               <p>Day being come, I penned a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
preſenting the whole Viſion,
<hi>Come away, bring your writings, come
away,</hi> to the Secretary of the Lord
of <hi>Broghill,</hi> entreating him, that he
forthwith impart it to his Lord, and
others concerned for the ordering of
affairs in thoſe parts, beſeeching they
would, after addreſs made to God
Almighty for his guidance, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
diſpoſe of me as he ſhould
pleaſe to direct them to do: They,
I humbly conceive, did ſo; for that
day, or the next morning I had word
ſent me, that I might go whither I
would. Yet obſerved to me it was
by that Gentleman, which brought
me my enlargement, that I ſhould
not proclaim the King in the ſtreets.
Truely, I was never guilty of any
ſuch madneſs, neither did it ſo much
as once come into my thoughts.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170032:68"/>
Had I not been guided by God, in
the penning of my Propheſie, to do
ſo in the Church, I ſhould never
have done it; but then and there
wrote, I could no more decline do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, than I can now to pray for
all men, even his and my own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
No, they are the Commands
of God, which carry me on; and not
to conform to them, I neither can
chuſe, or dare omit.</p>

                  <p>THis very morning, being now
the 7 day of <hi>September</hi> 1654.
was I a ſecond time rouzed, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
early from my bed, by a great
<hi>Crack,</hi> or <hi>Canon,</hi> to riſe and go to
work, to bring forth this my Book
to the World, in it concerned: defer
it I dare not, though I have been by
ſome Miniſters, but moſt of all by
my other ſeeming Friends, my Wife
and Children crying to me alſo, not
to publiſh it, all men I have yet ſent
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170032:68"/>
to, and all means hitherto failing
me, for money to get it out. Nay,
I have lain theſe 20 dayes, the moſt
troubled and diſconſolate imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for want of money to go on
with it: Tried all I know almoſt;
would have pawned what I had left,
that I might raiſe money to do it;
am refuſed by all men hitherto I
know; out I would have had it
come before the <hi>Parliament</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
as believing it would highly
diſpoſe them to ſerve <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Country,</hi> ſo invite the Lord to
ſend deliverance, and heal our Land.
But I ſee in this, as in all other of
Gods proceedings, I muſt pray to
him, depend upon him, abide his
good pleaſure; his own time is the
beſt; ſo is his way alſo; he will do
his work himſelf: It may be he is
pleaſed to ſee what good effect the
Sermon Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> gave
them on Munday laſt will operate,
and have upon thoſe <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170032:69"/>
alſo what the <hi>Protector</hi> did after
communicate unto them. At the
Sermon I was, I heard all; in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
how he well adviſed to turn
from all ſin, that God would be
pleaſed to return to us, and that they
thoſe now worthy <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> called
of Gods goodneſs, as I believe, for
the healing of our grievances: For,
as Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> obſerved, there was
election of perſons for works, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by the Lord, as well as to
grace and glory. <hi>David</hi> might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to build Gods Houſe, but <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
ſhall. You ſee my main riſe of
all this Book, and unparalel'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
begins there, as that <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
did,</hi> adviſeth the rebuild of his
Houſe, the reſtore of his Miniſters,
the giving them for maintenance
what God hath given, and to every
man his juſt intereſt, and then ſee
how be eſtabliſheth the Land, &amp; the
<hi>Kings</hi> Throne, which <hi>Kings</hi> Throne
I wiſh he had fuller preſſed, he hath
done it in ſome other works of his;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170032:69"/>
where he hath obſerved, that the
Houſe of King <hi>Solomon</hi> was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as <hi>Davids,</hi> when they thought of,
&amp; ſo did build up the houſe of God.
But he is wiſe, he leaves that
work for the <hi>Protector;</hi> if he doth not
know it, I do: he ſhall help to builde
Gods Houſe, and bring in his <hi>King</hi>
too, and that will eſtabliſh his own
houſe alſo, the moſt Honourable of a

to death, if this come not to paſs.</p>
                  <p>He went on, he adviſed them to
keep us from falling into, or return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Red-ſea of bloud, which
we, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had paſſed
through. Let him now take the
comfort of my Book, <hi>and this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of the Lord Almighties,</hi> as I
had of his Sermon, in many good
obſervances. There is an end of all
the Wars in the Chriſtian World;
and I hear ſince that <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi>
did that day tell you at a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,

See now to what purpoſe my Gun
hath wakened me this morning, to
call you all to your duty, us to pray
for you, that you forthwith fall to
it, and work as men, whom God hath
highly honoured, and now called to
be the reſtorers of our <hi>Religion,
Peace,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> of our <hi>Nation,</hi> and
our <hi>King;</hi> who, becauſe the beſt in
the World, God having made him
ſo, for our good &amp; happineſs. Bring
him preſently, that our rejoycing be
not deferr'd, nor the World kept

Gods time, which I beſeech him for
his name and mercy ſake be pleaſed,
O Lord, to haſten.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> look to
your ſelves, our <hi>King</hi> is CHARLS
STUART, the General of all our

ſo dearly beloved of the Lord of
Hoſts; againſt whoſe ſword put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Earth ſhall ever prevail.</p>
                  <p>O Lord, <hi>thou haſt wakened me,
and I will do my duty, this ſhall now
come in that formerly was not, and my
Book ſhall out in Print, to the World
concerned, if I go naked; for thou
knoweſt</hi> (O Lord) <hi>it had been out
before now, if I had had either money
to have done it, credit, or goods, to
have borrowed money on.</hi> At home
I continue diſcontented, enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
becauſe it is not publiſhed,
fear I do, that it's not coming out
time enough, the major part in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>
will be wanting to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they not yet underſtanding what
God will have done; were my Book
but once read by thoſe <hi>Members,</hi> for
whom, with <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> I firſt
intended it, I then ſhould fear no
Votes in <hi>Parliament,</hi> contrary to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170032:71"/>
Gods glory, and the <hi>Kings juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
with a Parliament;</hi> for divide
them I can not.</p>
                  <p>In what a troubled condition I
am at home I have ſhewed you; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
and deſerted by all, unable to
effect any thing of my ſelf. See now
how God works for me, and carries
on his own work, for his own glory,
as aſſured me he would, that it may
be marvelous in my eyes, as well as
yours: For to paſs it muſt come,
that's the ſeal of my Commiſſion,
the time and way is his own ſecret.</p>
                  <p>What doth the Lord now do, my
ſelf being at loſs? Upon the 12 of
<hi>September,</hi> to my unpararel comfort,
<hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> doth this work of
the Lords; it is poſſible too, when
he intends onely to eſtabliſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
The Lord often makes us to
be moſt highly inſtrumental to
bring his good pleaſure to paſs, when
ſinfully we may intend onely the
carrying on of our own unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170032:71"/>
proud, and ambitious end, I
know not, but it was ſo here with
him, and no otherwayes: but I do
know, that in the end, thou <hi>Oliver
Cromwel,</hi> ſhalt delight to do the will
of thy God and thy King; in the firſt
place alſo, not minding thy ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thy duty performed to them:
in which doing thou canſt not fail of
being abundantly happy; otherways
diſquieted, and miſerable beyond all
compare.</p>
                  <p>The 12 of <hi>September</hi> the Houſe
door that's ſhut up, out go all you,
or the moſt of you, whoſe froward
principal of Presbytery, or other,
(call it what you will) is not clear
for the glory of God, and Honour
of his King, but our Sovereign
CHARLES STUART; whoſe
power &amp; unqueſtionable right with
Parliament <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> takes
into his own hand, ſuffers it not to
come into yours onely, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
very well when you formerly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170032:72"/>
forced it from the King into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
onely, where God and our
Laws had never placed it. How
you abuſed it! Though your preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Oaths, and Votes, at the firſt,
were high, deep, and many, to the
contrary; all that you might not be
diſtruſted; his perſon and his honour
alſo you would preſerve; yet ſee,
misimployed this Militia you did,
and turned it was to the deſtruction
of his perſon &amp; honour: the laſt you
firſt wounded him in, that you might
the better kill him in his body: done
it was to the perpetual ſhame of
them that did it, profeſs you what
you will for <hi>Religion, Presbytery,
Anabaptiſm, Independency,</hi> or any

multiplied with your Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and ſucceſſes.</p>
                  <p>Truely my charitie leads me to
believe, there were ſome Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
refuſed to ſettle the Militia in
the hands of <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170032:72"/>
it might the ſooner return into
thoſe hands, which their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are now troubled that they ever
forſt it from: which unhappie Act,
I am of opinion, firſt ſet us together
by the ears, moſt haſtened, and ſo
enabled the Contrivers of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
War; which the Lord in
mercie hath now put an end to. If
ſuch another Vote engage us not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh,
from returning to which Red
ſea of Bloud, good Lord deliver us;
as Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> preached,
adviſed, and prayed.</p>
                  <p>But this Militia is now ſafe
where it ſhould be, in the hands and
power of the beſt Subject, <hi>Oliver

                  <p>See how the ways of God are
paſt finding out! O Lord, never any
man loſt by referring all to thy
good time, and beſt way. I do not
in the leaſt doubt thee <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well;</hi>
                     <pb n="136" facs="tcp:170032:73"/>
I know God hath, or will fit
thee for the work, who onely hath
thus directed, and over-ruled, that
his name may have the glorie, and
thy perſon the greater honor; forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
all on earth for the command
of heaven. The intereſt in the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
is a Crown-Jewel, which God
will have thee (<hi>O Cromwell</hi>) not
ſuffer to be divided from the Crown,
but give it to the ſupply and making
of a better than that which bad
men have by violence taken and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
amongſt the Self-deniers, as they
call themſelves: But thou, <hi>Oliver
Cromwell,</hi> wilt prove thy ſelf one,
they onely promiſed to do what
thou canſt not but do; make him
a Glorious King; for by thy means
God will have it ſo. Diſtruſt him
not, you Members, yet diſſenting,
who have a clear mind to do the
work of the Lord. Obey <hi>God,</hi> and
your <hi>King,</hi> with him: Gods Word,
and the known Laws of the Land
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170032:73"/>
will beſt direct in both. Comply
with <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> he is for the
ſervice of God, and his duty to his
Kings juſt intereſt with a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
you underſtand not how high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God will make him ſubſervient to
both. My Book is coming to you,
to let you know how, much we are
miſtaken in him, and how tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
much we are for ever obliged
to our mercifull God, whoſe work
this is alone, to the amazement of
the World, both for time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
his goodneſs making it marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in our eyes.</p>
                  <p>I could not ſleep the night of that
active day the inſtrument for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
was preſented; God keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me waking to his glory, and my
own content: for as his Gun, and
Call, hath ſet me to work at other
times, ſo here I roſe and wrote this
Letter to <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> the very
next morning; &amp; becauſe but ſhort,
I here give it you, that you may ſee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170032:74"/>
my actions are all above-bord, and
that this work on Earth comes from
above in Heaven: to paſs it muſt
come, God will have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Sr. Yeſterdays actings, laſt nights

hath ſet theſe words upon this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,

                  <p>Prudence it is not, to truſt the
<hi>Militia</hi> in thoſe hands, who after
they had forced it from whence
God Almighty had placed it,
(whatſoever they pretended,) uſed
it to the diſtroying of him. Sir, you
are not of theſe bad men beloved,
neither is there clear thoughts in all
of them to do good: ſome are not
fit to be truſted; Pray God amend
them all.</p>
                  <p>Sr. Part with nothing out of
your own power; that is, or may be
miſ-inployed, hurt the Church of
God, or <hi>Regal</hi> rule. You are of
Heaven directed, doubt it not in the
leaſt, to be highly ſub-ſervant to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170032:74"/>
both: have courage (Sir,) fear not
the leaſt; I know you are hated, and
not underſtood by the moſt, who
would deſtroy you.</p>
                  <p>Sr. I had a Book ready to publiſh
20 dayes, or more before the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
opened; the higheſt imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for your advantage, and effecting
what God will have done; by the
turning of good men to comply
with you in all things, and not to
fear any ill, becauſe God is on your
ſide.</p>
                  <p>Sr. All my friends have abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
me, and money I could not get
to Print it, moſt men conceiving
this Parliament would ruin you, ſo
hang me, if I ſided with you. Thus
deſerted and oppoſed by all, I could
not get it out; but I ſee God works
for me, when man oppoſeth: ſo doth
he for you; Go on (Sir,) you are

thine is as my ſelf ſuſpended for a

                  <p>Well; my ſelf gotten out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,

               <p>HAving paſſed a few dayes in

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170032:77"/>

attending all opportunities and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible

whom not meeting with, I
wrote unto him ſeveral times, to
give him to underſtand, that I had
received of the Lord the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable

to communicate to his good
ſelf, being therein concerned, as
much as any, and to whom from
priſon in <hi>Youghall</hi> God had pleaſed
to ſend me, for that very purpoſe, &amp;
therefore beſought him to hear me.</p>
               <p>After much attendance, and not a

<hi>White-Hall</hi> the opportunity onely
to ſpeak to him, made my ſelf known
to him, but he had not the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
at that time to hear me in
the things I ſo much deſired; yet
then told me he would ſpeak with
me.</p>
               <p>That further opportunity I had
not, though continued ſeeking it,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170032:78"/>
it, and reminded him by Letters of
his promiſe, untill one Saturday in
<hi>June,</hi> a little before the death of
the <hi>Portugal,</hi> when, and where, it
pleaſed Almighty God to afford me
a moſt convenient one at <hi>Hampton

to hear me out to the full, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me both his patience and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

was preſent Sr. <hi>Gilbert Pickering,</hi> and
a Gentleman or two more, whom I
knew not; for all which I returned,
as in duty Obliged, firſt to God, next
to his Lordſhip, all poſſible prayers
and humble thanks.</p>
               <p>And now leaſt any thing might
ſcape his Lordſhips obſerve, which
it is poſſible did my recital, he hath
this ſecond review of it; but printed
more particularly for the World of
men in it ſo highly concerned: for
I cannot be quiet, untill to them I
publiſh it alſo, this being a light not
to be hid; the univerſal ſplendor of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170032:78"/>
the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion muſt break
forth, alſo the obedience of men to
the Lord, who I conceive and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is now coming in mercy, and
wayes of making himſelf known to
the Chriſtian World, Jews, and
Heathen in mercy; but in judgement
to others; for the evil doer ſhall not
abide in this ſo great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
a change. On earth whom is
the Lord pleaſed to make his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy
for rule? his favour and loving
kindneſs is the higheſt to our <hi>King,</hi>
CHARLS the Second, CHARLS
the Great, CHARLS the good, <hi>King</hi>
of the whole World: theſe are the
words and declared pleaſure of the
ever living and our moſt mercifull
God, which I dare not conceal, nor
longer keep uncommunicated, but
muſt publiſh them to all concerned;
to have an end of all the Wars in the
Chriſtian World, with the reſt in

               <p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:170032:79"/>
I confeſs, after I had wrote to the
<hi>General,</hi> I could not but alſo do ſo
to his <hi>Majeſty</hi> my King: the import
of both refers onely to my duty, in
the diſcharge of which I onely can
have quiet. The Original of all
Letters to them I have, being to
each five, in all ten: in any of them
not the leaſt thing adviſed to but, as
I conceive, and ſo believe the mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
both of them to the perform of
ſuch their duties, as are moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with God Almighty: the one
how to rule well, the other ſo to
obey: things the moſt to be deſired
of good Kings, &amp; good Subjects; of
which I wiſh the whole world were
made up of. I have therefore in
the end of the book given two of
thoſe Letters to publick view, that
at once my inward thoughts may
appear, to the excite of walking, as
beſt becomes the moſt excellent of
Kings; and the higheſt of Subjects,
where the meaneſt alſo have to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170032:79"/>
that in fearing God, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
their King, they are bleſt
here, and ever ſo to be hereafter;
omitting it, miſerable to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>From which ſin of Rebellion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
compared with that of witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft,
we have good reaſon to pray,
<hi>The Lord be pleaſed to deliver us;</hi>
eſpecially when covetuouſnes is
joyned therewith, the root of all
evil ſins, which ſome men therefore
will have the World juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as a Witch, in the end to be
burnt: becauſe it, and its lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
hath ſo bewitched us, as to
prefer them before the ever living
God, and our walking according to
his will, revealed in his word: which
is to fear <hi>God,</hi> honour the <hi>King,</hi> not
to ſide with thoſe, that are given to
change; but to keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
do the thing that is Juſt,
Honourable, and good, that is to
all men as we would they ſhould do
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170032:80"/>
unto us. If we will take any thing
by violence, let it be the Kingdom
of Heaven, which ought to be our
<hi>devoir,</hi> not other mens rights, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of birth, or eſtates; which ought
to be our reſtore. Write, O Lord,
all theſe things in our hearts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
us to keep thy Law, which is
the Commandments of God, and
not of men.</p>
               <p>I have now done referring to all
of Dream, and my own Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that, yet what God was
pleaſed to have me obſerve; alſo
finiſhed ſome of my Viſions, which
refer to this, as I humbly conceive,
moſt material; and therein I have
obſerved what I could not but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>For that of Propheſie, truely I
believe, I may without any deluſion,
or ſpirit of pride, call it the words
and good pleaſure of the ever living
God: and ſo far am I from believing
it to be other, or that it will not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170032:80"/>
come to paſs, that I could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<hi>Youghall,</hi> before I had given it
under my hand, ſealed with the Coat
of the Right Honourable Lord of
<hi>Broghill,</hi> and upon my knees deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it, before no leſs than twenty
other Honourable and good witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that if it came not to paſs they
put me to death.</p>
               <p>Now that I may not appear other
than what I was at that time, to the
praiſe and honour of God, well in my
ſences; not mad, but true to what I
have received of the Lord; no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor,
nor yet a lying Prophet, or
one that would delude by lying va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
and ſpeak when and what not
commiſſioned of the Lord: I do
here again confirm, agree unto, and
conſent, that if it come not to paſs
(the things in the Propheſie I refer
to onely, which are of the moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
and ſtrangeſt nature, there is
the moſt improbability by outward
appearance) if theſe come not to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170032:81"/>
paſs, I ſay, I conſent that you firſt
ſhew me to the World from place
to place, afflicting my body, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that burn my book, and by death
put an end to my dayes, as I conceive
deſervedly I ought to ſuffer, if I
ſpeak as from the Lord, when never
ſent. For allowance of which, to me
it ſeems there is good warrant in
that <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the eighteenth
Chapter, from the twentieth verſe
to the end, being the word of God,
to which words of God and its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
I refer all I have ſaid and
Propheſied, to be tried by, as being
the moſt ſure rule, againſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to which word of God, no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
or Prediction of man can
ſtand, as I firmly believe: which
indeed the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to me, when I gave him the
knowledge of my Propheſie, by
word of mouth. But if this be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
Scripture, yet not contrary to
Scripture, then I ſay, in my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170032:81"/>
it is a work fit for the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of a Prophet, or if it be for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
explain of ſome things in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
not untill now, or yet fully
revealed, or well underſtood, then
alſo hath it warrant: but any new, or
giddy Tenets I will never force to
my own deſtruction out of this holy
word, O Lord; which to do, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
is the greateſt ſacriledge in the
whole world. But willingly I do,
as I wiſh all men would refer all to
thy moſt holy word, of which, I
conceive wiſe men, and the body of
that miniſtery, thou haſt ſent into the
world, to be the fitteſt Interpreters
to our well underſtanding of it: for
to and with ſuch thou haſt promiſed
to be aſſiſting with thy holy Spirit
for their enablement unto the end
of the world, and that neither Hell,
nor the Devil ſhall ever prevail over
or againſt them: And thoſe thus bleſt
and ſo ſent, I believe are not the
<hi>Pope</hi> nor his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> who for their
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170032:82"/>
own ends make marchandiſe of the
Kingdom of Heaven, that they may
keep up their own upon earth, ſo do
<hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> &amp; others, to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of God, &amp; the ſcandalizing
of his <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, which
ſhall now flouriſh beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare.
But thoſe ſhall ſuddenly fall
and melt away, as greater and leſſer
ſnow-bals; this is certain.</p>
               <p>And now methinks I hear ſome,
as I read thoſe did in the firſt of the
<hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, and the ſixth,
ask our Lord, <hi>Wilt thou at this time
reſtore again the Kingdom?</hi> Truely
I know nothing to the contrary, but
it will be ſo, if you will but break off
from your ſo much beloved, and too
long lain in ſins and impieties, it
may now preſently be. Certainly
there is no better way to haſten its
coming, yet the next verſe tells you,
<hi>It is not for you to know the times and
ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in
his own power.</hi> Read it, the caſe there
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170032:82"/>
juſt as ours, The Scepter departed
from <hi>Judah,</hi> the Government forſt
out of the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the
people deſire nothing more than the
return of it; Nay, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are the Perſons that enquire
if it may not be at this time: Yet
obſerve our <hi>Lords</hi> anſwer, even to
them; <hi>It is not for you to know what
the Father hath put in his own power,</hi>
for ſhame ſeek the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and its righteouſneſs; which
doing, all other things ſhall in due
time be given unto you. Your ſelves
are the cauſe it is not already come
to paſs, by your continuance in ſin.</p>
               <p>Suffer me but a few words, and I
have done; there is an end you hear
of all the Wars in the Chriſtian
World; but as yet you ſee it not:
God be thanked for what you do
ſee, more probability than ever. Is it
not very far advanced here on earth?
Have we not that already with ſome
Nations &amp; People we never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170032:83"/>
leagues of perpetual peace (as
I have heard) and are we not with
others in treaty? Nay, very far
agreed towards that purpoſe? Who
well underſtand the Scriptures know
it is very frequently in them uſed:
that very expreſſion by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
ſent of God, the preſent tenſe
for the future, there is an end, that
is, it is ſo decreed in Heaven, and it
ſhall be ſo on Earth; it being the
ordinary phraſe of the Prophets, by
reaſon of the infallible certainty of
the events, to ſpeak of things to
come, as already paſt; the inſtances
are obvious and infinite.</p>
               <p>See here another motive to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
that you may forthwith reap
this ſo great a bleſſing of peace on
Earth, that which makes Heaven
ſo deſireable and lovely, having in
it the bleſſing of peace. And yet will
you be mad to go on in ſin, and
make the Prophets, ſent to you for
amendment of life, mad alſo? as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170032:83"/>
your iniquities continued in will
do: it did ſo to that good Prophet,
<hi>Hoſea</hi> the 9. and the 7. as before.</p>
               <p>I haſten to an end; there are 18
<hi>perſons</hi> you read of, that ſhall never
dye, but be taken up into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> that never ſhall
have end. Theſe are the very words
of this the Lords Propheſie, his
almighty dictatings; of which words
and their ſtrangeneſs, I may ſay, as
the prophet <hi>Zacharia</hi> did in a viſion
the Lord gave him, referring to the
rebuild of his Temple, reſtore of his
worſhip, and delight in his ſervice,
to which all are enjoyned to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting:
begging and inviting them,
as mine doth, firſt to ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Heaven, his glory, worſhip,
and ſervice on earth.</p>
               <p>This Prophet <hi>Zacharia,</hi> in the 5.
verſe of that 4. Chapter, you may
there read, having ſeen that Viſion,
was asked by the Angel of the Lord,
if he knew what the Viſion ſhewed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170032:84"/>
him was, he anſwered, no my Lord.
A ſecond time he anſwered the very
ſame words in the 13 verſe, no my
Lord, read on, and you ſhall finde
informed he was by the Angel, that
Prince and Nobels, the High Prieſt
and the other Prieſts under him, are
the Perſons the two Olive Trees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token;
and the Candleſticks there
lighted, let us ſee the perfection of
beauty and brightneſs, the Lord will
have to be in his houſe. Certainly
where holineſs is commanded, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
richneſs, and decency were never
forbidden in the houſe of God.</p>
               <p>And now to do this, doth not the
two green Olive Trees on each ſide
drop golden Oil, to carry on the
work?</p>
               <p>King &amp; Houſe of Peers, Biſhops,
Prieſts &amp; Deacons, ſee here all your
duties, Prince, Prieſt, &amp; people muſt
be aſſiſting with purſe and hand to
the rebuild of Gods houſe, for his
publick Worſhip and ſervice, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170032:84"/>
when done, nay, doing, obſerve how
he bleſſed the Land, never the like
before for peace and plenty.</p>
               <p>And here learn alſo not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
if I yet know not in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to underſtand thoſe words, <hi>they
ſhall never die.</hi> There was a time,
untill the Angel gave that ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Prophet to underſtand what
himſelf did reply to, he underſtood
not. A Propheſie is a wonder ſent
to poſterity, leaſt they complain of
want of wonders, it is a letter ſealed,
and ſent, which to the bearer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is but Paper, but to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,
and opener, is full of power.</p>
               <p>To ſuch another <hi>non ultra</hi> was the
Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> brought, in his 12.
Chapter and the 8. verſe, where he
ſaith, <hi>I heard, but I underſtood not
what ſhould be the end of theſe things,</hi>
the next verſe tells that Prophet, the
words were cloſed up, and ſealed
untill the end; the laſt verſe of that
Chapter aſſures him he ſhall <hi>ſtand
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170032:85"/>
in the Lot at the end of the dayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A thouſand difficulties might
ariſe out of the particularities of ſo
ſtrange a meſſage, as all this his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
is; yet obſerve, when things
of ſuch nature have been dictated to
the moſt bleſſed Saints in holy writ,
as <hi>our ever bleſſed Lady,</hi> and others,
from theſe we hear of no more obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
no more interrogations. The
faithfull heart, when it once hears,
or knows the good pleaſure of God
Almighty, argues no more, but
ſweetly reſts in a quiet expectation,
<hi>Behold the ſervant of the Lord, be it
unto me according to thy word.</hi> And
thus without all ſciſcitation, we
are to go blind-fold whither he will
lead us. All diſputations with God
(after his will known) ariſe from
infidelity. Great is the myſtery of
Godlineſs, and if we will give nature
leave to cavil, we cannot be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as good B. <hi>Hall</hi> obſerves.</p>
               <p>Tis true we read in holy Writ,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170032:85"/>
that wiſe, valiant, and good Kings,
and other perſons of Honour, have
been ſo eminently juſt, holy, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municably
good to all here on earth,
as of them it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall not die.</hi>
Nay, we ſee their renown lives now:
That is the meaning of not dying
there in one place, and though to
wicked mens ſenſe ſuch Godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſeem to die; as in the book of
Wiſdom the 3 <hi>Ch.</hi> ſecond verſe, yet
it did but ſeem to them: ſo dead they
are not, their renown ſhall never
die.</p>
               <p>Again, we read of <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi>
thoſe good Prophets, ſo lived they
with God, though here on earth, as
that he took them to himſelf moſt
miraculouſly by tranſlation, never
ſuffering them to lie buried in the
earth, nor their bodies to return to
duſt; whoſe Souls were all heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mindedneſs, and converſation ſo
continually above, that the took
their bodies thither alſo, they did
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170032:86"/>
never die. Be it in either of theſe
two ſenſes, here is as much honour
&amp; happineſs, as mortality is capeable
of, agreeable to thy word (O Lord)
it muſt be, or it can never ſtand, nor
as I believe, come to paſs. But my
hand is upon my mouth: thy will be
done, and by man for ever be thou
praiſed, O Lord, and now ſeeing
the events of things are the beſt
commentaries upon Propheſies, the
beſt way for theſe <hi>eighteen perſons</hi> &amp;
all others is to walk with God, as
<hi>Enoch</hi> did all his dayes on earth, in
a Godly ſorrow for ſin, weeping for
his own and others; and then taken
up into Heaven alſo they may be, as
<hi>Enoch</hi> was, who never died, but was
tranſlated into the Kingdom of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Christ,</hi> that never ſhall have
end.</p>
               <p>You have heard what the Lord is
doing. The converſion of the <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Heathen</hi> at hand, alſo the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> things
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170032:86"/>
mighty, ſtrange, and wonderfull,
which to paſs he will bring for his
own glory, name, and mercies ſake,
making theſe things <hi>marvellous in
our eyes.</hi> And did he not alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
work wonderfull things, that
we Gentiles might be wrought upon,
to come into the knowledge of his
Law? whoſe fulneſs is now with
the <hi>Jews</hi> to come in. The <hi>Heathen,</hi>
a people that have not heard of the
Scriptures; the <hi>Jews</hi> not believing
in the Goſpel: who, although the
beloved ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to whom
the promiſe is for converſion, yet
an obſtinate, crooked, and wilfull ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.
Even to convert <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi>
we may alſo look for ſigns,
in, or from Heaven: all whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
we have little hopes to ſee
effected otherwayes than by ſigns &amp;
wonders, in, or from Heaven. For
this ſixteen hundred years paſt the
Goſpel not heard of by the one, not
heeded by the other, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170032:87"/>
not <hi>our ſelves</hi> coſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
deer; and many wonders he did
before the people would confeſs him
the Son of God: in Heaven ſigns, on
earth opening the Graves, the dead
bodies ſhewing themſelves to thoſe
that knew them, himſelf aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up into Heaven alſo, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of many witneſſes need of all
for converſion, I have done.</p>
               <p>But remember, Reader, and all
you that hear of what the Lord is
doing, and bringing by his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power, of his good will, to paſs in
the World, for the honour of his
name and this profeſſed <hi>Protestant</hi>
Religion and good of ſuch as fear
him. Take warning, go not on in
your ſins, break off by ſpeedy and
unfeigned repentance, and practice
you, as well as invite others, to a
more holy obedience than ever; leaſt
that when God giveth deliverance
to his Church and people, you be
found to be of the number of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170032:87"/>
to whom he renders ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
at the ſame time; Remember
I have warned you; and believe me
alſo, I could not have any quiet,
untill I had done ſo. Thus in all
ages God hath ſent his Prophets to
forewarn, before he conſume a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
or in mercy deliver them. I
have done my duty, do you yours,
repent and live. The number was
but few I told you, though all that
were then in being, who when they
ſaw this <hi>Crown</hi> in heaven, worſhipped
God, and ſaid, <hi>This is of Heaven, we
will follow it.</hi> Which when done,
with my ſelf, hear we did pleaſant
ſounds in Heaven, and ſaw the earth
ſhine with plenty, amongſt men good
will, all praiſing God, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
thoſe bleſſings; I once more
tell you they were but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
make haſte, be you of it.</p>
               <p>Before judgement is gone out, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is ſeaſonable; but you may
cry to late. From this <hi>Citie</hi> was the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170032:88"/>
Kingdom fyrced, let O Lord, if it
be thy good pleaſure, the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
tears and thy mercy ſpare it
from an heap of ruin: a City that
hath been, and yet is the harlot, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Baſtard conceptions, and
prodigious births; confuſion ſhe
hath brought forth, that hath filled
the world and land, to her diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
with God and men. Spare us,
O Lord, we beſeech thee, and have
mercy upon us, even upon us alſo,
thy moſt unworthy ſervants.</p>
               <p>Here I have ended, but becauſe
God hath, as I formerly obſerved
to you, of his wiſe delay, ſuſpended
the publiſhing of this book, for his
own time, which certainly is the beſt
and fitteſt, as alſo that my Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
on him may be the more,
as his mercies the greater when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
afforded us, I muſt yet a
little go on; and one inſert more
be pleaſed to allow me, it being
for the General good. Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170032:88"/>
preſent your eye, and entertain
your ear, as of Gods mercy he hath
done mine, for your benefit upon
the day and night of the 5. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
laſt, being our Lords day,
on which we did commemorate
Gods deliverance afforded us from
the <hi>Gun-powder Treaſon</hi> I dare not but
do it, mark it, it is conſiderable, &amp; of
the Lord himſelf, being the Lord of
Hoſts, who hath delivered us, doth
deliver us, and will deliver us: all
good grounds to truſt him, and a
ſet Text of Scripture it is for that
day to be Treated on.</p>
               <p>A good Act of Parliament we
have, for the thankfull and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
commemoration of that ſo
great a mercy, that God was pleaſed
then and ſo to deliver, Our, ſo good,
ſo wiſe, ſo well-accompliſhed King
and his poſterity, to ſit upon his
Throne, and to ſway the Scepter of
theſe Kingdoms for ever, as we ſee
God hath now ſo appointed, whoſe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170032:89"/>
ways admit of no variation, or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of turning.</p>
               <p>Deliver he did, we ſee, the houſe
of <hi>Peers,</hi> and <hi>Perſons</hi> of Honour, in
duty waiting upon their <hi>King.</hi>
Deliver he did the wiſe and learned
<hi>Authors</hi> of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church
and Religion: with them alſo the
<hi>Judges,</hi> both together the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters
of his word and his Laws.
Deliver he did alſo thoſe <hi>Worthies</hi>
of the houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> called
thither by their <hi>King,</hi> and ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the wiſe, obedient, and then
quiet people of the land who were:
and becauſe ſo, ſhared in that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and long enjoyed they and
we the Bleſſings that ſucceeded of
peace, order, riches, beauty, in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
worſhip of God Almighty,
in his Churches, to the wonder, as
well as to the envie of the world.
Here was a Parliament of Gods and
good mens choiſe and bleſſing, For
Majeſty and Honour well met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170032:89"/>
And this, when ſo, he delivers
from that horrid &amp; unparrall'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
until thoſe times, the like not
heard of. And what to do I beſeech
you, but to let us ſee how precious
in his ſight we are, when met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as thoſe, to fear God, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
our <hi>King,</hi> love brotherly
love, all applying our ſelves to live
and do according to his will reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his word and our known
Laws, the onely rule we ſhould go
by, and conform unto; applying our
ſelves to theſe, not to our own will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
thoughts, for confuſion, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs,
rebellion, irreligion, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of thoſe people, whoſe perſons,
peace, and propriety we come to
preſerve and maintain: not for our
ſelf-ends, to kill that we may divide
the ſpoil. Something like him I have
heard of in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who
upon the words ſpoken in a viſion
to the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter, Ariſe, kill and
eat,</hi> all things are now <hi>Common,</hi> to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170032:90"/>
pleaſe the then <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> at diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> gave this
gloſs upon that Text, that is, ſaith
he, your <hi>Holineſs</hi> may make War
with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> kill them, and
devour their eſtates: up and do it,
ariſe, take, kill, and feed upon them.
Thus his <hi>unholineſs</hi> &amp; ſuitable Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
force miſ-interpretations of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Writ to their own and others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<hi>Peter's</hi> ſucceſſors they
pretend to be, and in the worſt of
things they certainly follow him,
nay, exceed him: draw their ſword
they do, cut not off the ear onely
with <hi>Peter,</hi> but the heads of Kings
and Potentates, which wicked action
our Lord reproves, healing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
wounded when but an ear, to let
us ſee his Kingdom was not to be
carried on by the ſword, and ſhew us
he doth he had no need of a fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Clergy, he made no Apoſtle
to offer violence, no Biſhop in Buff
with back-ſword to help on with
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170032:90"/>
Presbytery, no Prieſt, or Deacon to
kill and ſupplant, that he might get
his more pious, and therefore more
peaceable brothers living; becauſe
it is better than his own, which when
he hath by violence gotten, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth
himſelf, but ſtarves, or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
thoſe he pretended to feed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and do more good for both in
body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>No, theſe are not the men fit to
build God a Church, he needs no
ſuch hackers, or hewers in Field, or
Pulpit, ſuch furious fighters, and
raſh zealous Clergy: Go on to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
<hi>Peter</hi> further, the very next ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of danger, they deny
their Lord and Saviour, for ſwearing

of perſecution come upon them
then they are <hi>Sidonians,</hi> or <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,</hi>

a Temple not yet dedicated to any

them and it what you pleaſe, for they
are reſolved to ſide with the ſeeming

               </p>
               <p>Oh! and have not we ſuch <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
if but one, too many, but the

at the converſion of ſuch ſinners

perſwading they are the Lords Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
outward ſucceſs going on that

whoſe depraved judgements, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

thus ill principled? this Propheſie
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170032:91"/>
tells you: They, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
and their Factors ſhall fall: &amp; what
is become of ſuch a Parliament, or
Parliaments, who have been ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled,
your ſelves ſee; gone out they
are, like a ſnuf of the worſt lights,
&amp; left a ſtinck behinde them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the memory of the juſt, and good,
God imbalms, for our imitation, and
is not ſpoken of, nor remembred
otherwayes than moſt odoriferouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
even as the ſweet Oyl poured
on our Saviour, leaving a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
renown in all ages of ſweetneſs,
and goodneſs, to the immortal ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that Saint that did it, as in
<hi>Matthew</hi> the 26 verſ. 13. whoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial
for good works ſhall never
die, but ſtill lives, and ſhall for ever.</p>
               <p>Well; that day the 5 of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
you ſee is properly due for
thanks to Gods delivering a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made up of King, Lords, and
Commons: Let no man therefore
dare to have thoughts of promoting
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170032:92"/>
any other, but ſuch a one; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be by praying to God, and
patiently waiting his good pleaſure,
humbly, and fervently praying that
theſe worthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,</hi>
now met in Council for the
general good, who cannot but know
and finde themſelves imperfect,
without the better parts of the <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
of a Parliament, whilſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are leſs profitable Members
than they might be, to Gods glory,
Religions luſter, the Kingdoms
ſtrength and peace, alſo the peoples
rejoycing; Let us not ceaſe to
pray, (I ſay,) that they forthwith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to be ſo compleated
as may beſt pleaſe God, and be moſt
warrantable by the Laws of this
Land, which ought not to be broken
through, nor can they be nulled,
but by the powers that quallified
them to become binding: They
are the very words, (I heard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obſerve) upon the Tryal of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170032:92"/>
the Earl of <hi>Straford,</hi> when proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt for making his paper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrants,
or meſſengers of force to
out-value, being ſent out againſt any
ſubject, the then Laws eſtabliſhed:
which had their ſtamp put upon
them, and onely made currant by the
aſſent of the Crown, the conſent of
the Houſe of Peers, and allowance of
the Houſe of Commons all proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
in any other caſe, pretend what
they will, it was Treaſon. Law I
have not, I confeſs my ignorance,
thoſe Gentlemen certainly knew
this to be Law, and gave it ſo there,
but good conſcience I am ſure I
have, and ought to have, there ought
not to be faſt and looſe when we
pleaſe, that we may the better pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
wickedneſs by a Law of our
own making: thus we ſtrengthen our
ſelves, and would be exempt from
puniſhment when we do amiſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to live according to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
we pleaſe to take, in the faireſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170032:93"/>
paſtures of other mens demeans and
birth-rights, making our fences to
others every way offenſive, but for
our ſelf as much ſecurity as knavery
can contrive, &amp; violence maintain.
Now if they will have us keep this
5 of <hi>November,</hi> as moſt commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it is we ſhould to Gods glorie
and our thankfull rememberance;
let them alſo keep us up ſuch a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and warrantable Laws as
God in mercy then delivered and
continued us, if they will not, then I
adviſe to appoint another day, that
all thoſe may meet, who with the
Devil, Jeſuits, and Sons of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
Sectaries, or others, call them
what you will, all who have made
their wicked plots take by ſeeming
righteouſneſs, onely pretenſions to
reform Religion, amend the Laws
and circumciſe ſuperfluous things, as
evil counſellors, or known offenders:
yet have blown up, rooted out and
for ever deſtroyed, as much as in
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170032:93"/>
them lay, Kings, Religion, Liberty,
the peace and honour of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
let the lovers of thoſe confuſions
meet in a thankſ-giving to their
God for their ſucceſſes alſo, and let
us ſee who they are, and then <hi>if God
be the Lord, ſerve him, if Baal, ſerve
him,</hi> for we may not longer halt in
things of God and Religion, declare
your ſelves you wicked ones, be no
longer Hypocrites and evil doers,
the Devil hath helped you to do
that above ground, in the ſhape of
an Angel of light, that he could not
effect under ground by powder, and
your younger brothers, the Jeſuits:
I have heard of thoſe that have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at their wicked ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
by more bloud-ſhed than you,
but never of any that came to them
by more Perjury &amp; Hypocriſie, than
thoſe that were not long ſince our
Egyptian Tax-maſters, the ſcandal
of the Proteſtant Religion, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
of our Nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:170032:94"/>
Remember, I have adviſed you to
repent and do your <hi>firſt and beſt
works, from whence you are fallen,</hi> or
elſe know <hi>your judgement ſleeps not,</hi>
a day, a night, a moment will do it,
the Sun roſe and ſhined gloriouſly
that very day, the evening whereof
would have ſhewed you <hi>Sodom, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah,</hi>
&amp; her neighbour fornicating
Cities all in aſhes: <hi>Thou Fool, this
night ſhall thy Soul be taken from
thee,</hi> &amp; as in the 12 of <hi>Acts,</hi> verſ. 23.
<hi>on a ſudden in a moment the Angel of
the Lord ſmote</hi> Herod, <hi>and he was
eaten up of Worms:</hi> who knows not
that in the twinkling of a eye we ſhall
be changed, and our Saviour comes
to ſome, ſurprizing them as a thief
in the dead of night and ſleep of ſin?
I before ſhewed you your general
condition from whence Gods Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
onely can awake, but I would
not end in a judgement, the Lord

                  <hi>Scotch</hi> prayer for all your Gueds, but
that you may repent and live. Now
give me leave to preſent your eye
with what God did mine that laſt
Sunday night, being <hi>Gun-powder
Treaſon,</hi> having that day received the
moſt bleſſed Communion of the
body and bloud of our Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching
him for patience, that I
might bear his Croſs, which indeed
was caſt upon me the Saturday and
Sunday night, of that very day, juſt
as my <hi>Goaler</hi> did at <hi>Youghall,</hi> ſo here
called I am Seducer, falſe Prophet,
deluded, not ſent of God, fooliſh
babbler, and worſe: See how doth
God comfort me, when man thus
miſuſeth me, juſt as when my <hi>Goaler</hi>
ſo abuſed me, and took my bedding
from under me, and locked me up,
then the Lord, that very night, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
me deliverance and comfort
by his Viſion and call; <hi>Come away,
bring thy writings, come away;</hi> and I
did ſo; for this his Call opened
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170032:95"/>
the Priſon doors to me; ſo here that
very night for my conſolation, the
Lord ſhewed me very ſtrange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
in Heaven for beauty and
curious works, as firſt a vail, or
covering, which, after I had well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
paſſed away, then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
forthwith opened, and there
did I ſee one, who was juſt for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
as our Lord is in his general
Pictures Portraited and repreſented
to us; which ſight raviſhed my Soul,
and brought from me this expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
O it is the coming of the Son of
Man for the converſion of ſinners;
forthwith a vail came over me, that
I could ſee no longer into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:
I then run and haſted to get
from under that vail, that I might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
look up where I was, ſo much
raviſhed above in the Heavens, ſo
preſſing forward that I might get
from under the vail; and ſo I was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the ground, and ſo moved
untill I came beyond the vail, which
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170032:95"/>
impeded my ſight, being got from
under it I looked up again into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
where I ſaw what I cannot ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or ſet out unto you.</p>
               <p>Help me, O Lord, my ſoul is too
narrow to expreſs that glory and
raviſhment thou ſhewedſt me there
and then: the Heavens yet opening
I ſaw a beautifull place much about
the bigneſs of a quadrangle of a
Colledge, and in ſuch a figure alſo,
within which ſate ſome four and
twenty perſons, all in order as being
in four ſtraight lines from ſide to
ſide, ſo adorning the whole: they were
all arrayed in long white robes,
richly Crowned they were, and he
that late in the middeſt the richeſt,
on each hand of him ſate alſo one
very richly arrayed and Crowned;
all of them in order and beauty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any expreſſion. I was given
to underſtand it was the coming of
the Son of man, I can ſay no more,
onely tell you what it was not
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170032:96"/>
there was in it no diſagreeing, no
confuſion, no ſtriving for priority,
no ſupplanting of one the other, all
obedience, all beauty, all holineſs,
every one continuing in his own
ſtation, lovely throughout beyond
all compare or expreſſion; certainly
it was to let me ſee that at hand his
coming is for the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
if they would but get them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in readineſs to receive and
meet him with prepared hearts, he
would come and dwell with them in
beauty and holineſs for our amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or elſe take them to himſelf,
unto either of which happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
O Lord, fit us and we ſhall
be fitted: I end, believing God hath
now made this book fit for the preſs
and you: Obſerve to amendment of
life.</p>
               <p>Help out, O Lord, with the book,
and into thy favourable loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the ſons of men: this day is
the firſt leaf of this book Printed,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170032:96"/>
to finiſh which, if thou help not, O
Lord I cannot give it birth; I have
not this day on penny in the world,
yet I doubt not by thy providence
this very day to carry on thy work,
this book, nor thy power and loving
kindneſs to effect the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
in it contained.</p>
               <p>And now, O Lord, be thou plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to help ſo thy moſt unworthy
ſervant, and carry on this thy great
work, ſtrange and mighty to thy
own glorie, and good of all men, as
I ſet forth the truth of all, and deſire
from the bottom of my heart, that
thou, O Lord, mayeſt have the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of all, and we men the comfort:
O Lord, I may not doubt thou wilt
do it, for thy glory, mercy, and
name ſake; I ſee it already done, as
thou haſt promiſed; though it be
thus ſtrange, yet it is thy work and
thou wilt do it, that it may become
marvellous in our eyes.</p>
               <p>Thus I end in the very words,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170032:97"/>
which ends my own Commiſſion: in
truth alſo be pleaſed, O Lord, to
help all men of thy goodneſs, as thy

            <p>WHat! my Book conceived in
ſin, and before born, or come
into the World, but five ſheets out,
and in three of them ſhall I be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to be guilty of pride and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?
Certainly I will beſtir my
ſelf, the rather, becauſe a wiſe and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170032:97"/>
good man tells me he fears the good
intented to Gods glory, Religious
luſter, and the Kings intereſt will all
ſuffer in the publiſhing of it; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe grounds he perſwaded me
to deſiſt from Printing, which I can
no more refuſe to do, than I can to
breath &amp; live: what ſhall I wound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of theſe in the leaſt? Three things
as precious to me, as had I ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
lives they ſhould all not come
into the ſcale with one of them?</p>
            <p>Moreover, I have preſented it in
my intentions to the Lord Protector
for his protection and defence, and
ſhall I not preſent it innocent? I
know him ſet up to be a terrour
to the evil doer and deceitfull man,
but to calumniated, injuriouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
honeſt and innocent men a
Protector, and comfortable Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
with all reverence and humility
be it ſpoken, thy glory, O Lord,
ſhall have the praiſe of this happy
Poſt-ſcript. I know it is for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170032:98"/>
good to me, as well as for the
worlds clearer ſatisfactions: by ſuch
ſeeming oppoſitions and wiſe delays
hath thy Providence reſerved it, and
me in the fitteſt time to become pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick,
and for the fulleſt diſcovery
of truth, it is now made much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than formerly intended, that all
things, time and circumſtances may
be fully examined, and clearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired

made appear any ground for ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
deluſion, or viſible falſhood. I
fear neither, the charge, as Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder
makes a noiſe, but you ſhall
quickly ſee it turned into ſmoke and
and vaniſh.</p>
            <p>I am to demonſtrate unto you why
I ſhould not juſtly be condemned of
pride for theſe words in the 55 page,
<hi>O Lord, let the World, [as I do,] ſtand
amazed, love thee, and fear thee for
ever,</hi> what! Arguments of innocency
brought to convince of evil? be
pleaſed to look back but two pages,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170032:98"/>
the 53. and ſo on you have the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of thoſe words. God of his
providence guiding me, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
time to ſo full a Scripture, which
I there obſerved for my confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in that my over-ruled deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of falling upon my face; Have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
read that portion of Scripture,
not till then known to me, 7 months
after done; and my ſelf then penning
what I there Printed, I could not
but in a thankfull obedience, with all
poſſible humility in my private
Chamber fall upon the ground, and
praiſe the Lord for it: I beſeech
you let it not be laid to my charge
as pride, be pleaſed to read it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>O Lord, let the whole World,
[as we all ſhould do,] ſtand amazed
at thy goodneſs, therefore praiſe and
love thee for ever.</hi> This will take me
in, and I have what I intended
there.</p>
            <p>The next is in the 56 page, where
I ſay, <hi>I expected more alteration al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170032:99"/>
ready than I have yet ſeen; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
I did the Summer past, would
have made the certain things to come
to paſs, much more apparent before
now than they yet are.</hi> Here confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
my ſelf miſtaken is inferred, I
clearly demonſtrate that ſent of
God as one of his Prophets, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be; for they are alwayes guided
in words of truth and certainty.</p>
            <p>I could refer you to what follows,
and faſten this yet non-accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon your ſelves, by reaſon of
your continuance in ſins and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and well might too, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
I will my ſelf to ſatisfie reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
men in all poſſible wayes and
things; yet obſerve, before I end
that very Section in the two laſt
pages of it, 68 and 69. you ſhall
there read that <hi>I being brought from
what I had of Viſion, dream, or my own
dictates,</hi> there is the cauſe of thoſe
words to that which is certainly
Propheſie immediately following,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170032:99"/>
and the words of God, by which
onely I abide as infallably true, and
will come to paſs: going on you may
there ſee the Scripture quoted, <hi>What
is the reſt but as Chaff to Wheat, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dream, Viſion, or Dictate:</hi> by that
Propheſie I will abide whileſt I am
in this World, yea, O Lord, though
men attempt to kill me, I will yet
truſt in thee. So that all conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I doubt not but to be cleared in
ſober mens judgements.</p>
            <p>Next in page 63 I there tell you,
you are unworthy of a man ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you; your eyes have ſeen what
<hi>Ariſe Evans</hi> ſaid already fulfilled,
and this methinks might free me
from this cavil, together with the
known hard meaſure, as impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and affronts late times have
put upon him; whileſt the good man
(other I can not call him) hath for
your good indured ſo much, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
worn himſelf out, that you
might turn and live: yet him you
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170032:100"/>
aſperſe; Too many of you miſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him Mad, Fooliſh, Babbling
miſtaken fellow. I confeſs I knew
him not untill my return from
<hi>Ireland,</hi> many times I viſited him,
and he me, when I lodged at Saint
<hi>Jameſes</hi> upon this imploy, waiting
for the Protector, I ſtill reſerved
my ſelf in all things, of what I have
here Printed.</p>
            <p>Curious I was to know the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of things coming ſo to his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
the times alſo, his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
I enquired after, looked into
him as narrowly as I could, obſerved
the effects and fulfill of things Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted,
and what more I could think
on, ſtill reſerving my ſelf, having
underſtood the manner, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
his alwayes being directed to
the word of God, in conformity to
that his word, adviſing all men to
turn from ſin, that God might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
in mercy: I could not but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
him ſent of God for that very
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170032:100"/>
imploy, if this be to be deceived,
then am I alſo? but I ſuſpect it not
in the leaſt; he is for the rebuild of
Gods Houſe, the reſtore of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and Worſhip, the invite-home
of the King, a far greater rule gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to him of God, than to any of
his Predeceſſors, alſo the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the ſpreading of
the Proteſtant Religion, to which
purpoſe and ſpeedier invite of him
home, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> ſhall be
highly ſubſervient: when done, the
Land and people bleſt. This being
his principles in all this, and more, he
is in the right, and ſent of God he is,
I will not cry any of you mercy, for
what I have ſaid of him it is too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
he deſerves more, he will go for
a man ſent of God, of whom you
are unworthy, whoſe good admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
you ſeem to contemn, as you
have done his perſon: but mark the
end of that man, it will be happines,
I ſuſpect yours: me, thinks I can right
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170032:101"/>
him in what you ſo much ſlight him,
it is now come to my minde, he told
you the King ſhould be reſtored by
<hi>May</hi> laſt, as you ſay, obſerve now
upon the 3 <hi>January,</hi> 3 Moneths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>May,</hi> I tell you from God,
he is, and ſhall be here Crowned
King of <hi>England, Scotland, France,</hi>
and <hi>Ireland,</hi> Defender of the faith, in
Heaven its done, and ſo I proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him on the 12 of <hi>January</hi> 1653.
In the Church of <hi>Youghall</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God.</p>
            <p>Now to us he is come, I ſee him
already come, ſo might you alſo,
but that you have neither faith nor
good works, in my laſt letter, at the
opening of this Parliament, I wrot
to the King theſe very words. Sir, I
ſee you already come to your crown
and dignity, onely I do not ſenſibly
touch you, but reſtor'd you are. S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> do
but ſtand ſtill a little put all iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from your heart, believe in God,
and your ſelf with others ſhall ſee it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170032:101"/>
ſo ſuddenly, God will have it ſo,
you may not doubt it.</p>
            <p>The next and laſt alſo, I hope,
I am ſure the greateſt, to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to is how I dare be ſo
proud as to ſtile my ſelf ſo often a
Prophet, nay, a great Prophet alſo.</p>
            <p>Here, O Lord, in all poſsible hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of ſoul and body, I do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my ſelf to be the moſt unworthieſt
of the Sons of men, and well know that
of merit there is not any thing on this
ſide Hell, but it is too good for me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee onely, O Lord, I do for thy
Almighty guidance and deliverance
herein; thou canſt do it, and make
this word good, and I know wilt of thy
mercy: thy honour being at ſtake, I dare
not doubt thy power, nor diſtruſt thy
loving kindneſs, who hath aſſured,
that I ſhould by thy enablements grow
from ſtrength to ſtrength, until I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
at perfect Peace in <hi>Sion:</hi> it
is the introduction to thy commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
given me for my conſolation
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170032:102"/>
and inablement in this thy imploys.</p>
            <p>Yet I will give you ſome reaſons
to beget belief in you alſo, and true
ones too, or elſe may the ground
open and ſwallow me, if I be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any conſpiracy, and Hell for
ever continue me, if in this, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious
againſt thee my God: it is
the black portion of falſe Prophets,
&amp; may it be mine alſo, &amp; that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too, if I have any Commiſſion
for this but thine, or any aim more
than thy glory: the reaſons of my
belief I will give you truly, and as
they fell out, ſome of which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
concealed in modeſty, becauſe
they referred ſo much to my own
honour, yet I now ſee when calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated
I am, and ſuſpected of pride,
God clears me, and more than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences
me, he will now give
Honour to me and mine, yea, ſuch
Honour, as I was never, in the leaſt,
worthy of.</p>
            <p>Reaſon 1. VVhen I was the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170032:102"/>
ſecond time before the Lord
of <hi>Broghall,</hi> in the preſence of thoſe
perſons of Honour deſired, declaring
the viſion of the fire that fell down
from Heaven upon me in my bed,
and the man ſent of God called me
three times by my name, <hi>Walter
Goſtelow,</hi> asked me if I did ſee the
fire that came down from Heaven,
whch I replyed to as you there may
read, yea, I did then I ſay, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time being before his Lordſhip
and thoſe preſent, declaring that and
others of my viſions and revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
in particular one that related to
my Eldeſt Son <hi>Richard Goſtelow,</hi>
theſe words laſt of all on a ſudden
came from me. His Father is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and his Fathers Father was a
Prophet: aſtoniſhed I was, my
very next action amazeth me alſo:
ſpeaking to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Boyl</hi>
appointed of God, Wife to our King
CHARLES STVART when
I come to tell that Lady ſo, I am
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170032:103"/>
thrown upon my face, thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
I was in theſe two actions of
words and demenor, any reaſon for
theſe two proceedings I cannot give
neither of them having ever been
in my thoughts or purpoſe, but when
done, to none preſent more ſtrange
than to my ſelf. Now mark Gods
providence, as in the book you have
it, he guideth me to a Scripture,
there obſerved to you, for the ſo
falling upon my face, gives me ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for my ſo doing: for the
other of words I promiſe ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
but firſt obſerve.</p>
            <p>That a ſecond time in the dictate
of Gods Propheſie which I ſtand to
and will never alter or abate one
word upon my life, there in the end
of that Propheſie theſe words are,
<hi>pronounce this houſe a bleſſed houſe,
and this Chamber ſhall for ever be
called the Chamber of the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
for that ſecond time <hi>Prophet</hi>
ſpoken by me, as for all the words
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170032:103"/>
there, I can give no reaſon but over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
providence, it was no pride,
no imagination, no, it was Gods
pleaſure, and his will and promiſe
by me to be declared to all people,
and it was no more what I fancied,
or would have come to paſs than
I wiſhed well to <hi>Olliver Cromwel,</hi>
who is in that Propheſie and happy
alſo a man I hated to the utmoſt,
till God then, as before, reproved
me, do you tell me off fancy you
talke fooliſhly, I believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
and I pray for O: <hi>Cromwell</hi>
the Propheſie is Gods, the duty is
mine and all yours, God hath or
will change O <hi>Cromwel</hi> to his own
glory, and your amazement, as well
as mine, he hath aſſured it me, and
I do you, take it for Propheſie, I do.</p>
            <p>The third time <hi>Prophet</hi> is after
dictated, as ſoon as light appeared,
I roſe, before I dreſſed my ſelf I
write, that upon the 12 of <hi>January,</hi>
in the Church of <hi>Youghall,</hi> a man
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170032:104"/>
ſent of God for that very imploy, <hi>A
Prophet, his name Walter Goſtelow,</hi>
will that day in that Church, after
Sermon tell you the things God will
bring to paſs for his glory, mercy,
and name ſake, making them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous
in our eyes. For this third
time <hi>Prophet,</hi> I can give you no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
but over-ruled Providence, juſt
as in that writing I could write <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Cromwell</hi> by no other dignity, or
cogniſance, than the General of all
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces, as you may there
read, ſo here you have to obſerve the
word <hi>Prophet,</hi> ſpoken before the
Propheſie, ſpoken in the Propheſie,
and wrote after the Propheſie, in all
over-ruled I knew not of it untill
done. Yet further obſerve that in
the dictate of Propheſie, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are
not to be tranſplanted, fulfilled that
is for your ſatisfaction; the time for
their tranſplanting by Act was <hi>May</hi>
laſt, I am aſhamed, I will not call it
an Act of Parliament, it was ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170032:104"/>
to Gods good pleaſure, or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
compaſſion, to ſweep all, that
they might have all, therefore tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
they are not, <hi>May</hi> is paſt;
tranſplanted they ſhall not be, upon
this I will put it, burn me if they be.
God hath altered that unmercifull
decree, ſcattering thoſe that made it,
given theſe poor Subjects &amp; us bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Law-makers, more mercifull men
in the room of them, who, having
God before their eies, for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
have learnt. <hi>Be ye alſo mercifull,
as your Heavenly Father is mercifull.</hi>
Such as theſe ſhall hereafter ſit at
Helm, and ſway the Scepter of theſe
three Kingdoms, juſt and mercifull
men ſent of the omnipotent and
mercifull God.</p>
            <p>In the Propheſie written, the ſign
there given me, which I was alſo
over-ruled to write, as well as the
name <hi>Prophet,</hi> is made good to
me, fulfilled that is alſo, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
witneſſes I have enough to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170032:105"/>
prove both, for times, perſons, and
place.</p>
            <p>There is ſome ground for further
proof, which I cannot wholy paſs
over, nor decline the giving it to
your conſideration, juſt as it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to my ſelf, being put upon
all poſſible proof, one night forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
after Mr. <hi>Barrel</hi> the Merchant,
and <hi>John Merrick</hi> came up into
my Chamber, and began thus with
me, Mr. <hi>Gostelow</hi> here is happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
below a thing that very much
amazeth us, &amp; ſome others. I asked
what is it? we are amazed we won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
at it, ſay they, ſpeak, what is it.</p>
            <p>The little Childe, ſay they, that
came from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nurſes, to
which the widdow <hi>Merrick</hi> is Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother,
and Mr. <hi>Landey</hi> Merchant
her Son in Law, Father, That Child
you know is very weak, &amp; can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeak any thing, what it learned
at Nurſe is <hi>Iriſh,</hi> we were ſpeaking
below to the Childe, and asking it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170032:105"/>
ſome things in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
what you were, the Childe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
twice what we underſtood not,
at laſt plainly in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a Prophet,
this they admiring, came up to me
then in bed, and tell me: you have
the men, the matter, and their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
if this be ſo, God hath ſent
me one witneſs more out of the
mouth of this Babe.</p>
            <p>Out of all which give me leave to
obſerve to you, for I do it with all
the humility that is imaginable in
the World, but do it I muſt, I ſee
Gods glory is at ſtake, and ſo alſo
your and my well being, for turning
from ſin to amendment of life, that
we may repent &amp; do the firſt works,
ſo for ever live bleſſed and happy;
God hath here ſent me a Scripture
this laſt Sunday out of the Pulpit,
and the mouth too of one of his
Miniſters, ſo full is it to give you
and me ſatisfaction for this word
<hi>Prophet,</hi> my over-ruled ſpeaking and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170032:106"/>
writing of it, that it is to me as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
and as full of Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the other Scripture his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
guided me to, for the proof
of my over-ruled deportment, in fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
down upon my face; and becauſe
ſo very full, I will give it you in the
very words, as I had done that, and
let me tell you, the Lord Protector
did obſerve part of this Scripture to
me, when I imparted theſe things to
him, who then well adviſed me to
fear God, and walk in his wayes in
all humility, and for theſe things,
which were ſo very ſtrange, if to his
glory, good pleaſure and his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
he would bring them to paſs, not
being contrary to Scriptures, though
ſpoken out of my mouth: as it came
happily then from him, ſo now alſo
from a worthy Gentleman Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
God never yet left me in my
greateſt ſtraights. You have the
words in the ſecond Epiſtle of S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
the firſt Chapter and the laſt
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170032:106"/>
verſe. For <hi>the Propheſies came not
in old times by the will of man, but
holy men of God ſpake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost,</hi> and I am
ſure they wrote ſo alſo, but that this
be not laid to my charge, as the
greateſt pride of all, yet ſpoken, or
aſſerted by me; I beſeech you pray
for me to this purpoſe, for I am
bold to tell you my heart is fixed,
O Lord, my heart is fixed upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſincerely to keep thy Law, to
love and ſerve thee above all things
in the World; but for any ſanctity,
merit, or righteouſneſs in me, O
Lord, which is not thy onely grace
of good will, I abominate and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own
it for ever: pray for me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, that in all the inundations
of evil I may be preſerved by the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
kindneſs of the Lord, and that
in all the mutations of this World,
whatſoever God would be pleaſed
to make me, and that I may be ſo
ever found, the moſt humble, lowly,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170032:107"/>
penitent, juſt, wiſe, mercifull, meek,
patient, faithfull ſervant of our Lord
and God, and King my Maſter; O
Lord, I love thy Houſe, Worſhip
and Service, and place were thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
dwels; be it in thy Temple, or
in man that delights to do thy will,
which is to fear God, &amp; honour the
King. I am unworthy, O Lord, yea,
O Lord, I am unworthy and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unfit, but thy wayes, O God, are
paſt finding out, who dares aſſume
the name of a Prophet, not I, O
Lord, let me rather from my Soul
chuſe to die than live a falſe one,
which is to be a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> and
accurſed for ever.</p>
            <p>But doth it not manifeſtly appear
a delation, having then alſo ſaid my
Sons Fathers Father was a Prophet,
to this I am yet a debtor to ſay what
I can.</p>
            <p>My Father Mr. <hi>Richard Goſtelow,</hi>
lived and died, where I was born,
in <hi>Preſcot-houſe,</hi> a place antiently
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170032:107"/>
known (in my memory) it had
groves and good walks about it,
ſome religious houſe I conceive it
to have been, an Altar and
Chappel I have known in it, the
Parriſh is <hi>Croppredy</hi> in <hi>Oxford ſhire,</hi>
ſcituate ſome three miles from <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
My Elder brother, bearing his
name, now lives in it, but truly I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
knew my Father to have any
the leaſt repute to be a Prophet; a
very general repute he had to be
an honeſt, juſt and charitable man, ſo
had alſo his three brothers, which
I well knew: but ſeeing the glory
of God and my own reputation is
to be ſpoken too, and my ſelf neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
to defend both in all poſſible
I can, Give me leave to preſent you
in what things he was like a Prophet,
and this the Countrey well knew of
him. He was a lover of Gods houſe,
Worſhip and Miniſters; further he
married a ſecond Wife, with whom
he had a very conſiderable eſtate
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170032:108"/>
when himſelf in debt, her eſtate he
imployed and put out in his own
name, yet moſt juſtly gave her the
procedes of it, and when he dyed,
left her near four times as much as
he left to all his children, which were
then nine, yet ſhe had no childe by
her former husband nor him, hardly
any kindred had ſhe known to my
Father: this he did in good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I will next ſhew you how he
was mercifull and patient, remitting
very high injuries and bearing his
Croſs. It falls out often that the
richeſt Wives are not the beſt, I have
heard him traduced, reproached,
contumeliouſly uſed and more of
ſuch dirt thrown at him, from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that of all others ſhould not
have done it in wiſdom or duty. Yet
he hath born it not provoking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
Nay, at that very time he hath
taken me apart, and commanded
me to pray for that very party, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
to be obedient to her in good
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170032:108"/>
obſervance of her, telling me it was
the Croſs God had ſent him, and
his duty it was to make the beſt uſe
of it, though others curſe, yet let
us bleſs and pray: next he was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
known to be charitable and
full of compaſſion, to the poor he
often gave fleſh, bread, and corn,
his man, I know, he ſent amongſt
them to diſtribute; mony ſeveral
times, me he hath ſent alſo in one
hand a note to whom to give, in the
other hand a purſe of money, to one
a ſhilling, to others more, to ſome
two as he judged their neceſſity; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing
at good times as <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi>
&amp; others bountifully. But what
is all this to a Prophet, I will come
a little nearer, often it fell out that
the continual dropping within dores
drove him to ſeek his quiet without
dores, and when gotten into his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
walks, he would pray and weep;
long alſo as well as frequently would
he do thus. I but what is this to prove
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170032:109"/>
him a Prophet? I will come a little
nearer to you as he came nearer his
end. A mild &amp; ſlow way of dying he
had, in which gentle ſickneſs he wept
much, but withal declared himſelf
it was not that he was affraid to dye,
his tears were occaſioned by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-joy
he had that he was going to
ſo wholy a God, to ſo mercifull
a <hi>Jeſus,</hi> to ſuch bleſſed company, and
to ſo glorious a place, all this told
me and you, proves him not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
which I have pronounced him:
I am coming a little nearer to you,
my ſelf Prentiſe at <hi>London</hi> when he
was thus drawing towards his end,
he was pleaſed to ſend me a little
money, with it a letter, having a great
deal of good counſel in it, well mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me of my condition as a ſervant,
remembering me of the duty I owed
to God, next to my maſter, and
charged me not to be wanting in the
performance to either, but with all
faithfullneſs to apply my ſelf will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170032:109"/>
to diſcharge it, this indeed
ſpeaks him a Wiſe and good Father,
and a childe of God, but not a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
            <p>In this my laſt obſerve to you I
come neareſt, &amp; may come home at
laſt that his letter written with his
own hand directed to my ſelf I have
bearing date 1620 in the end of it he
doth pronounce me bleſſed and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
firſt hear on earth, in Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly,
ſo it reads ſomething
like the great bleſſings that befell
<hi>Joſeph</hi> when ruler in <hi>Egypt</hi> under
his <hi>King</hi> and Maſter, who is there
mentioned by him for my imitation;
whilſt a ſervant for my conſolation:
after in that letter of my Fathers
there is too much Honour for a Son
of my demerit, both to God and
him, whoſe commands I have not
conformed too at all as I ought, to
paſs I ſay it may come and that will
prove him to all a Prophet, but if
it do not, <hi>O Lord thou ever ralleſt me
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170032:110"/>
to ſay ſo, let not man I beſeech thee lay
this to my charge,</hi> to ſpeak me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
alſo further proud, 'tis for truth
ſake and the Worlds ſatisfaction, if
I can, that I write this in his praiſe,
not for vain and fooliſh oſtentation:
you ſee five leaves of the book was
printed, &amp; all material things of high
concernment there ſpoken and quite
finiſhed, my ſelf not minded, but
forasmuch as in what I wrote my
ſelf preſently after Gods pronounced
Propheſie, wherein I ſay I was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled.
There are alſo things referring
to my ſelf and poſterity I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of; I ſhall therefore reſerve that,
as judging it fitteſt to ſhew privately
to my King, when time beſt ſerves,
his moſt excellent Majeſty being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Throne: and now ſeeing God
hath ſo over-ruled &amp; brought about
this publiſhed honour to my decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Father, which I never in the leaſt
thus intended, as here happily ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated,
give me leave to reminde
you that in the book you ſhall read,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170032:110"/>
when I was awake, and at the end of
<hi>Broad-ſtreet,</hi> ſeeing the Heavens open,
and my Saviour upon the Throne,
I did there ſee my Father <hi>Richard Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelow</hi>
amongſt the Patriarchs, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
and Apoſtles, waiting upon
that Throne, and this is no new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
thing made by me now, the
better to delude with (as ſome have
traduced me) I can produce you
witneſſes that I have for many years
ſince, but in all comfortable humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and not otherwiſe, ſpoken it.</p>
            <p>Truth I will give you throughout
and nothing elſe; this book will paſs
far from home, inquired into, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
every part of it will be; obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
alſo with deſire from ſome, with
ſorrow of others for its fulfill, with
what concerns my ſelf and Father,
as to the name of Prophet, I have
done: forget not in the book, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, the paſſage of the Goaler
when he ſo abuſed and reproached
me by the name of falſe Prophet,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170032:111"/>
from whoſe bitter words and hard
uſage, God in his own time, which
is ever the beſt, delivered me on a
ſudden by his Call, and that nights
Viſion, <hi>Come away, bring your Papers,
come away,</hi> it is but a little, I have
more to ſay, and that is of Crop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predy
Church and Pariſh, where my
Father lies interred, my ſelf was
Chriſtned; and then I have done this
long Poſt-ſcript.</p>
            <p>This Pariſh of Croppredy is 7 or 8
miles about, good Land all of it is,
being in a Countrey very populous,
Churches it hath in that one Pariſh
four, and one little Chappel of eaſe,
the Tythes of the whole, as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
rightly informed, are worth 8
hundred pound <hi>per annum,</hi> there doth
reſide &amp; officiate in thoſe Churches
now 4 Gentlemen, whoſe Milk, Pigs,
Eggs, Nuts, and Apples, with other
petty Tyths altogether, are worth
ſomewhat above 100 pound <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
the Corn, Hay, and Peaſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170032:111"/>
worth 6 or 7 hundred pound, that is
ſtollen from the Church, firſt by the
Roman Impropriator, the Lord
<hi>Abbot,</hi> Biſhop, or what he was then
called, I know not, ſtollen it is, that
Clergy, ſay they what they will,
were the great Thieves, who robbed
men firſt by perſwading our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
to give to Gods glory, and
after ſtole it from the Church to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
their Abbies, Covents, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
ſo robbed they have the Prieſt
of his maintenance, and God of his
true worſhip &amp; ſervice, which ſhould
alwayes have been truely maintained
with that given. Thieves you ſee
they were, and now pray what are
we elſe, receive we do, buy and ſell
what they ſtole, which in other
caſes, leſs conſiderable, we make
death by the Law.</p>
            <p>Fain would I ſee our Miniſters
generaly wiſe, good and charitable,
I may never expect to ſee alſo, their
maintenance once made, what cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170032:112"/>
it ought to be good alſo.
Gentlemen, if any in the World, it
is to you Schollers I ſpeak, when
wiſe, good, and charitable, doubt
not you have a God and a King that
will remedy this villenous knavery,
Theft, and Sacriledge, which hath
undone ſo many, and made us of
the Proteſtant Religion looſe our
renown, becauſe we have followed
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this way of
Thieving; for we reſtore not, which
amongſt other ſins of the greateſt
magnitude now help to pronounce
her down-fall, ſhe ſhall fall, ſo ſhall
Church Robbers, doubt it not: if
our Saviour did but whip out thoſe
that bought and ſold in his Temple,
what think you he will do to thoſe
that buy and ſell his Temples, and
ſteal the endowments, and wonder
not at it, that <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> will
aſſiſt in this, God hath ſet him up
for his glory, and your maintenance,
and for me his moſt unworthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:170032:112"/>
I ſhall have a hand, or a pen in
it alſo, you read where and what of
his mercy brought me to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
ſeeing his Temples lay waſte,
his Miniſters unprovided for, and the
people untaught, becauſe the means
is ſtollen from the Church; if I fall
ſhort in this, let me never ſpeak
more, thou, O Lord, haſt made me
after dumb, ſpeak and write this for
thy glory, and I do truely ſay, I
love <hi>thy Temples and the place where
thy honour dwels;</hi> alſo to ſee thy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
well provided for, that thy
name, nor the Proteſtant Religion
be not evil ſpoken of, but that we
may by well doing invite others to
be of it, ſo communicably good to
all.</p>
            <p>One paſſage more of Croppredy,
and I have done: here it was and
about my once Fathers houſe alſo,
that our glorified King perſonally
defeated, Sr. <hi>William Waller,</hi> a kinde
defeat it was, he took no pleaſure in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170032:113"/>
the purſuance of his enemies to
death, he took from him there part
of his Militia, the field-Guns, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
not many of his men, yet a
defeat it was, he recovered it not.</p>
            <p>The Militia was that often &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
knife we fooliſh and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
children cried for, which have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gotten, knew not how to uſe,
but to our own, as others deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
fooliſh and diſobedient Subjects,
as well as Children we are found to
be. For with it we carry on all our
committed violences and outrages,
yet, for all that, men profeſſing and
practiſing the Law, tell us this is
Law, certainly they ſpeak falſly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they mean Club-law.</p>
            <p>Poſt-maſter <hi>Prideaux,</hi> baiting and
purſuing in the Gall of bitterneſs,
Sr. <hi>John Stowel</hi> upon his Trial, part
of which I heard had this expreſſion
he admired any now would oppoſe,
or indeavour to wrong the ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Infant-Common-wealth, very
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170032:113"/>
finely ſpoken Sir, your ſelf the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and God-father of that ſo new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
named Innocent Babe; ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries
from the mouth of ſome blind,
not yet nine dayes old, <hi>P. P.</hi> or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes
in the Law, would not be much
wondered at, neither can ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
us: we well know that ſober,
honeſt men and Counſel learned in
the Law; for ſuch there are, go
not out of the certain track and
known rule of the Laws, ſuch run
true all along, open not the mouth
to ſpend in vain, hate to miſguide
us, deceive us they will not, fearing
leaſt we, as they, ſhould catch what
we purſue not, and ſo miſs of truth,
the onely deſired good and Royal
Game <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Lawyer with a double heart
and two tongues imployed, the one
to ſtifle truth, the other to maintain
falſhood, I would onely have ſuch
tongues cut out, when ſo ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed;
to ſuch wicked ends God
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170032:114"/>
never gave them: for we ſhould praiſe
the Lord with all our hearts &amp; with
our tongues next. For others that
cloath and inrich themſelves with
bribes and the wages of unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(for certainly of both theſe
wicked ſorts we have had too many
Lawyers) ſuch I would onely have
their skins flead off them, and hang'd
up over that place of judicature they
cauſe to be ſo evil ſpoken of: I
have read, or heard that ſo good a
courſe was once taken for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
and deter of evil Judges
and ſuch Lawyers.</p>
            <p>Undeniable it is, that not long
ſince wickedneſs was practiſed and
committed by a Law amongſt us,
the Lawyer, he as the witneſs falſly
accuſed, the Sequeſtrator, he ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,
the Committee man he le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied
the Eſtate, or ſold it; if the
Rent was low, then it was fitteſt for
one of the Godly party to grow rich
by; moſt Trypartite, as a three cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170032:114"/>
Cap, all of one piece, they have
hanged together; truely, if theſe
evil doers will not repent, and bring
forth better fruits, making their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
to appear, as good <hi>Zacheus</hi>
did, when truely converted, who
ſhewed it by his words and actions.
<hi>If I have wronged any man, I reſtore
to him fourfould, and for the reſt of
my goods I give the one half of them
to the poor,</hi> you have it in the 19 of
<hi>Luke,</hi> verſe 8. if they would nor
thus uprightly turn, repent, &amp; live,
truely they ſhould uprightly and
perpendicularly hang together, as
being brethren in iniquity; and this,
I believe, would be pleaſing to God
and man, whom they have injured,
and are indebted to: you wicked
Judges, Committees, and Lawyers;
repent of your Club-Law, too long
practiſed upon the perſons &amp; Eſtates
of men of worth and honour, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
the one, devouring the other;
tell me, if you can, from whence had
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170032:115"/>
you theſe preſidences for Law? not
from God, he is a God of mercy;
not from his word, that's a word of
truth, not from our well conſtituted,
and better known Laws; thoſe are
for defence, not offence; Come, I
will tell you whence you are, you ſay
you are of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but
you do the works of you Father the
Devil, and if I miſtake not, it was
to men of your profeſſion and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
our Saviour ſaid ſo, that could
not erre.</p>
            <p>Some gave that for Law, which
was not: when time was, they did
help to undo a good <hi>King;</hi> and run
a way after: others of you have
played the ſame game ſince; and it
is not improbable will ſhew us ſuch
a trick alſo; but ſtay a little, and
take ſome of my counſel before you
ſtir, what you gave and took for
Counſel was too dearly bought,
neither worth what 'twas ſold for,
nor at all fit to be followed: thoſe
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170032:115"/>
you have deſtroyed or decoyed of
your own party will ſhortly tell you
ſo; be you ruled by me for the
time to come, if you go on to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in the Law, do in all your caſes
and cauſes as I have done in this
of mine, preſented in this book: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
it aright, carry it one no other
ways, preſent it not falſly in any one
circumſtance, ſpeak the whole truth,
which done, pray to God Almighty
that he would be pleaſed to give
you a ſentence in favour, if in truth
and uprightneſs of heart, be aſſured
he will: deſire onely that the Lord
may have the glory of it, and man,
his Creature, the benefit of his juſt
but mercifull and righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>My imploy is not to flatter any

Bar, Sir <hi>John Stowel,</hi> in his fixed
heart was ſincerity, reſolution and
uprightneſs, in his head was wiſdom
and diſcerning, in his mouth and

Lord, as little Children, Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted
of the fleſh, the World, and the
Devil,</hi> thus being, Heaven is then
open to us, and that's a Kingdom:
For your Infant Common-wealth,
truely it died (almoſt as ſoon as
born, or named, I fear not Innocent
alſo; how have you lead me out of
the way, I muſt return to Croppre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
where I was named an Infant.</p>
            <p>From Croppredy-Field his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
went into the Weſt the ſame
Summer, there God gave him ſuch
another ſucceſs, but greater &amp; over
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170032:117"/>
a greater number: out of their hands
he took all the Militia, but their
perſons go free, not a man periſheth
by his good will.</p>
            <p>Who would not have expected
that theſe mercies, God having caſt
his Enemies into, and under his own
diſpoſe, and all pardoned, who would
not I ſay have preſumed theſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages
of mercy and unparalell'd cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
would have won his Subjects
to a better obedience, than forthwith
to fight him afreſh, O my God, I
heard his majeſty ſpeak theſe words
at <hi>Southam</hi> in <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day before <hi>Edge-hill</hi> fight, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then, and there importuned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to hang 80 men that night ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
To perſwade him to it, thus
ſome reaſoned, the Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>
is near you, the preſent doing it will
deter your Enemy, make his men,
that love you not, run away, whoſe
fear, if not affection, will be your
great advantages: they were ſo many
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170032:117"/>
and ſo powerfull, that thus coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled,
as indeed my good King had
but his good conſcience, mercy, and
a few perſons of Honour on his ſide,
of which very ſmall number was the
Lord <hi>Henry Wilmot,</hi> and the Lord
<hi>Willowby,</hi> Son to the Earle of <hi>Linſey,</hi>
whoſe Father was mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the next day at <hi>Edge-hill,</hi> of
which he died in a few dayes after,
nay, ſo bold and ſo preſſing were
theſe in his preſence, that they told
him, Sir, if we muſt take theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
and you pardon them, when can
you hope to ſee an end of this Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
they went on to importune him
to hang but 70 of them, yet ſtill to
do it preſenlly, as therein being his
advantage; his Majeſty wiſely and
mercifully replied, his deſign was to
make a conqueſt of their judgements
and affections by clemency and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
and not to murder their
perſons, they grew more impatient,
preſſed him then to hang 60. his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170032:118"/>
found out wiſe delays for not
doing of that preſently, to 50 to 40
to 30 to 20 they fell, ſtill his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
ſtood unmoveable, at laſt ſome
of them ſwore, as I take it, thereby
to diſpoſe him, that paſſing the other
day by <hi>Coventry,</hi> the Enemy had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and hang'd four of his men: to
ſecond him, another ſaid, they had
hang'd five of his, more of them
went on, three of theirs, two of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others,
his Majeſty to get rid of
them, and it may be to enquire into
the truth of it alſo, (firſt I did ſo)
told the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would preſently take an
order with them, now ſee the order
taken by him, twelve inlarged, and
of them continued, not a man ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Perſon, yet to this good
King was laid the falſe charge of
his being guilty of all the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in the three Kingdoms. To
witneſs this truth in my Kings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
when his Majeſty was upon his
Trial, I being near a hundred miles
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170032:118"/>
from <hi>London,</hi> heard of their quick
proceedings againſt him, and had
the Saturday night before his death
a very ſtrange Viſion concerning
him; I made haſte towards <hi>London,</hi>
that he might have the benefit of
this my witneſs in that killing and
falſe charge: but upon the way met
with the ſad news of his being Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred,
ſo that in this action the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs
that was done, was quickly
done: but I will not wound afreſh,
or grieve a man of you that did it,
or had a hand in the bringing to paſs
what God would have done, that
his name might have the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and you now no leſs happy in
his Sons rule over you: can you but
repent of this, as of all your other
ſins, God forgives, and of the Kings
forgiveneſs you may not doubt, the
<hi>Stuarts,</hi> as the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> are
very mercifull Kings, King <hi>James</hi> a
<hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> King CHARLS, of
ever bleſſed memory, praieth God to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170032:119"/>
forgive all his Enemies, when inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
is made for bloud, then, O
Lord, let them be found that ſhed
mine be ſprinkled with thine, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
thee: CHARLS the ſecond,
our King, will not conſent that his
ſeeming greateſt Enemy in the
World, <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> ſhall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
be taken off, an act pleaſing
enough to many, when the remove,
but of that one man onely, might
probably without more bloud-ſhed
ſet him upon his Fathers &amp; his own
Throne; yet ſee how he Governs,
he will not ſo much as hear of it,
you have it obſerved to you in the
<hi>wiſe Admonition</hi> to <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi>
when <hi>Wiſeman</hi> and others propoſed
his murther to him, no at no hand,
he allows it not, he will wait upon
God in all his lawfull wayes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himſelf to be <hi>Charls</hi> the
good, if not <hi>Charls</hi> the Great. And
being thus principled, ſee, what is
the happy ſucceſſes of his ſo doing,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170032:119"/>
God gives to him the Crown for
ever, and <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> his ready
ſubjection, this is counſel I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, but firſt given me of God,
his Majeſty had it from me in <hi>April</hi>
laſt, as I take it, to forgive all his
Enemies, even O: <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and to
refer all to Gods own times &amp; way;
&amp; it may be thou O: <hi>Cromwell</hi> doth
owe me ſomething for thy well being
at this day, I am ſure thou doeſt to
God Almighty, give him the glory
and praiſe of it in thy better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for the times to come, and I
have all I deſire; I have but done
my duty, and my reward is above
in Heaven, whither I moſt humbly
beſeech God of his infinite goodnes,
and never to be diſpaired of mercie,
take my good King, thee, me, and
all men, even the greateſt ſinners
now on earth. Whom, though the

to make of ſuch the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170032:120"/>
wickedneſs, then it is turn and
live for ever, you have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
lay hold on it. If any man
now diſtruſts his own ſafety and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
it is onely he that keeps
cloſe his ſins, or as Hypocrites ſeem
onely to repent, <hi>he that covers his

and forſakes them, ſhall finde
mercy of God and his King.</hi>

I give you the reaſons promiſed:

            <p>I will onely ſhew you the Crown

            <p>This my ſo long and juſt defence

why <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and
no more in the dictate of the Lords
Propheſie, when as all others have
accompanying them their Titles and
Seignories, and further, why I could
not pen him by any other Title than
the General of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
although I did upon the then
writing of that Propheſie ſo much
endeavour it, yea, I tried and varied
it ſeveral times but could never do
it, forthwith when done, was given
me this for reaſon, which indeed I
have already given the General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
when I declared the whole to
him, as now to you the Reader.</p>
            <p>The fountain of honour is Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in God, derivative in Kings, not
at all in the people, for proof of this
you have the written Word of God,
his moſt holy Scriptures: confirmed
to me further by God, when the fire
fell down from Heaven in that Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
all about my Beds feet, and his

meſſenger called me three times by
my name, <hi>Walter Goſtelow,</hi> alſo ſpake
to me, ſaying, you well underſtand
the Scriptures, Kings are of God,
eſpecialy yours; from thence iſſues
true honour, not from the people,
for this reaſon is it in the Propheſie,
<hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> and no more, by
him that ers not, the Lord.</p>
            <p>See, it is then true honour, and
worth having, onely when conveyed
in its right Channel, otherwayes it
is juſt as the Calf the people ſet up,
which wiſe-men know is not of
God, and therefore worſhip it not.</p>
            <p>Sleep yet a little in <hi>Windſor</hi> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

I came thither with the now

honours and favours by your moſt

I was a Catholick; your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
further demanded of me what
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170032:126"/>
Catholick, I anſwered the beſt, ſaid
your Majeſty it is then Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
is it not. I bowed before
your Majeſty as in duty, and replied
it was Catholick <hi>è Proteſtant, a la

            </p>
            <p>Your Majeſty, whom God hath

deſiring my converſion, I humbly

my Religion I liked ſo well, as not
to change it.</p>
            <p>Madam, be pleaſed to ſee now
how God more than retributes, and
no otherwayes recompenſeth this

my good, (as intended) my unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

but alſo to more than your whole

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170032:126"/>
and them into his only true Church,
that Church, which is not that of
<hi>Rome,</hi> into one of whoſe Chappels

            <p>Madam, in obedience I did ſo, be

I have heard very many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and ſome good ones too in
the Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
tending to mortification, yet never
was I of the Roman Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
in all things. No, Madam, it
is their unwarrantable Innovatious,
Traditions, Superſtitions, Exceſſes,
and Idolatries of the Prieſts and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
for <hi>Rome,</hi> and his unholineſs,
the Pope and that Hierarchy. That

from, that is the cup of fornication
ſhe hath made the Kings and Princes
of the Earth drunk with, for which
wicked acts of hers, they and all
ſhall now hate her, God hath ſaid
it in this his Propheſie, down ſhe
ſhall, her fatal time is come, and
her ſelf muſt drink the dregs of that
cup of fornication, hers it is, and
take it ſhe ſhall, the Lord will have
it ſo, ſhe ſhall fall. Yet Madam,
the Lord is good to all his, though
of that Church, for he will purge
her as your Majeſty ſhall further
read anon.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed ſo excelling <hi>Queen,</hi> I
moſt humbly beſeech your favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
allowance, that I go on to wait
upon my own King, and Gods true
Church, in this his buſineſs and my

            <p>And now, O my King, rejoyce
fully, there is no place for ſorrow
(but for ſin) how like thy Saviour
was thy Father, who dying, prayed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170032:127"/>
his Father in Heaven, to forgive
thoſe Murderers on Earth, that ſo
deſpitefully uſed him, it is not all
the indigne cruelties of men that can
rob him of thoſe rich mercies; thou,
my King, prayedſt for them dying,
wicked, &amp; ſinfull people, you would
be miſerable, but he will not let you;
Father forgive them they know not
what they do: <hi>Bleſt art thou, O Land,
when thy King is the Son of Nobles,
who, becauſe faithfull unto death, I
will give him a Crown of life:</hi> as in
the 11 of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> and the 17.
alſo <hi>Revelations</hi> the 2. and 10.</p>
            <p>I am now in Heaven in the this
dayes diſcharge of my duty, I fear
you Rebels, and all evil doers, as I
do the Devil, not at all. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to thee O. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> the ſo
much beloved of the Lord, which
we now ſeeing wonder it ſhould be
ſo: But God judgeth not as man
doth, when he pleaſeth the Lion
ſhall lie down with the Lamb, 'tis ſo
here.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:170032:128"/>
               <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> I expect thee,
nay, I believe thee no more ill by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed,
if ever; no more rebellious, no
more ambitious, except it be of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more juſt and good in all wayes
of Honour and obedience, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
thou, or encreaſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municably
good to all, the high end
thou was born for: there now lies
thy choice and complacencie, and for
thy former wayes, as errors of thy
judgement, not want of zeal to God's
glorie, be comforted, it offends not
that our affections are moved with
zeal, but that they are inordinate:
thou art not onely now thy ſelf a
deteſtor of them, when inordinate,
but a dehortor of others from the
like phrenſie-practiſes; ſo that of
the mercie of God changed, or to us
made known, thou here helpeſt to
make good what our already glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
King Propheſied to his now ſo
Highly Honored and reſtored hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Son and people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:170032:128"/>
That thoſe his Subjects, which
had erred by the artifice of others,
or miſguided zeal, would, when they
ſaw the errors of their wayes, and
the villenous practiſes of thoſe, that
had deluded and ſeduced them, their
eyes ſo opened, they would then
moſt hate them and beſt obey their
King, here is this now fulfilled in
our dayes and eyes: O you people
of this Land and the world alſo,
judge now, was not my King and
Soveraign a great Prophet, as well
as the beſt of Kings.</p>
            <p>O you deceivers! who traduced
him in his Honour, that you might
the better Murder his Perſon, and
divide the inheritance; if there yet
lives any of you, (for your time is
but ſhort, except you repent) <hi>the
bloud-thirsty and deceitfull man ſhall
not live out half his dayes.</hi> Whether
can you turn to be in quiet, or to be
beloved, who hates you not, that is
either wiſe, or good. But God is
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170032:129"/>
mercifull, he is the beſt of Paterns, his
mercie is over all his works, and his
compaſſions fail not, I muſt obey
him, and let you know where your
well-being lies, you bad men once
gave the worſt counſel and it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd,
now take the beſt, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it, from God &amp; me, come forth,
humble your ſelves, leave no ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented
of: Murder and Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
are two great ones, confeſs to
God and to his glory, forſake all,
that was of the Devil in you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Gods houſe, Miniſters,
Worſhip and Service, violence to
Man thy Brother, reſtore to God
and Man what is not your own, but
ſtollen from both; make all poſſible
amends you can, for otherwayes I
do tell thee, whomſoever thou art,
whether yet in this Kingdom, or
fled already into another, that God
will give deliverance to his Church
and people, but render vengeance to
his adverſaries both at once, <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:170032:129"/>
the 32. verſe the 43. and this
he will do, that ſo wherein the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
dealt proudly, God might ſhew
himſelf above them, <hi>Exodus</hi> the 18.
and the 11.</p>
            <p>My next obſerve is how doth
God Honour that Religion, which
to have been of, the World hath
counted madneſs: The Jews, the
Heathen, the Roman and our ſneak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Schiſmaticks, thoſe that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſpiſed Chriſt, or falſly told
you with them he was, and no where
elſe, they are all now truely ſhewed,
his delight was, and favour is, where
they thought and taught him not to
be, with the faithfull Profeſſers of
that ſo ancient true Church of God,
but lately ſo much deſpiſed, and by
them contemned Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
to whom, becauſe the pureſt,
God is now pleaſed to give ſo much
Honour, beauty, and renown, for the
former contempt, perſecution and
aſhes of her glorified Profeſſers and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170032:130"/>
Martyrs, of which number it is now
demonſtrative our late King is the
greateſt: ſee, God judgeth not as
man doth.</p>
            <p>This is righteous judgement,
which himſelf Propheſied you
ſhould have hereafter when falſly
condemned him, and had provided
your ſelves of thoſe at your backs,
and about your Bar of Juſtice, for ſo
it was, a Bar of Juſtice, where you had
placed your Criers for Juſtice, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
as their fellows did againſt our
Lord, Crucifie him, Crucifie him,
ſpit upon him you did too, as I have
heard, condemn him you did that I
am ſure of, no end of your malice,
his bloud you thirſted for, as alſo
the Miniſters of the Lord, you had
it, you have taken them, yet ſee, as
he prayed, you are found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled
with the bloud of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
when inquiſition is made for his
and others, and thus he prayed for
you, you would never confeſs your
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170032:130"/>
ſelves guilty, but God ſees it, and
forgives it too, with him there is
mercie, if you confeſs and forſake
your ſins, making all poſſible amends
and for the time to come, all your
dayes walk before him in a holy
obedience: to this end he in mercie
hath ſent me to you, that you might
truely repent and live.</p>
            <p>My next obſerve is the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall, a Church you ſee
ſhe is, ſo I ever, believed her to be,
once a pure one in whoſe Churches
often, both in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a good inſtructive Sermon to
amendment of life I have heard, and
truely in their Churches alſo I have
often performed, I hope, acceptable
Devotions, beſeeching God that
when the people came into thoſe
Churches to pray and to learn, that
they might go forth, do, and practiſe
for the time to come better things,
to which end I believe our pious
Fore-fathers built them, pray and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170032:131"/>
beſeech we ſhould for the people
there aſſembled, that God then
would be pleaſed to hear in Heaven,
alſo ſend thither to officiate ſuch
Paſtors and Teachers, as might be
moſt agreeable to his holy Word,
ſo more to Gods glorie and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
good, that the people might
not longer be deluded by thoſe
jugling villains, which make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
of the Kingdom of heaven,
and hold the people in ſinfull igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
turning almoſt all their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,
and (miſcalled) Devotions
into (<hi>fineneſſes</hi>) crafty frauds to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
themſelves by: juſt one with our
late temporizers are thoſe Jeſuits,
ſuch a ſtall do they both make of the
Pulpit, from thence teaching dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Doctrines, contrary to the
word of God, calling evil good, and
good evil, one of whoſe Tenents is
the depoſe of Kings; yea, &amp; killing
them too, if they rule not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their fancies, is't not pity the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170032:131"/>
Kings of the Earth ſhould allow ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of you reſidence in any of their
Territories: fire brands you are,
whoſe damnable Tenents are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
contrary to the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens:
in this I couple you together,
Rebels both, Jeſuits and Sectaries,
I would I could exempt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian,
the froward, and worſt, are
not guiltleſs: our late King was in
the right, when he adviſed our now
Soveraign his Son not to have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
againſt the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
in regard of the ill meaſure
dealt to him his Father, aſſure your
Majeſty he doth, it was by ſuch done
who were no true Sons of that
Church, the Church of <hi>England</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hord,
as the Church of God ſhould
do, all ſuch damnable practices and
wicked Tenents. See here again, my
King, was not your glorified Father,
a light of Heaven ſhining in a dark
place, as in the midſt of a wicked and
froward generation, to keep your
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170032:132"/>
feet &amp; judgment in the way of Gods
Commandments? Behold now the
goodneſs of God in letting the world
ſee, that the Proteſtant Religion
taught no ſuch corrupt Doctrine,
neither were the major part of the
people of <hi>England</hi> ſo ill principled,
I have heard, and from a good hand
alſo, that the reformed Churches of
<hi>France</hi> did upon that Act of cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
off the King, aſſembled their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
and Paſtors, who declared and
Printed to the World, as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Rochel</hi> of good account aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me, that the word of God
warranted ſo ſuch damnable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in Subjects, and for their
Reformed Church of <hi>France,</hi> as the
true Church of <hi>England,</hi> they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taught nor allowed any ſuch
Doctrine of Devils, or practiſes of
wicked men.</p>
            <p>Behold, I ſay, how God hath freed
this his Church from that aſperſe,
and this our Nation from that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170032:132"/>
the leſſer and inconfiderable:
number, never yet included the
greater and the wiſer: it was well
obſerved by Mounſiour <hi>Cauſabon,</hi>
a learned and Honourable Father of
the Church of <hi>France,</hi> by King
<hi>James</hi> he was invited hither, and
reſts Honourably interred in <hi>Weſt-minster
Abby.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it was the violence of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not our choice that
hath excluded us: becauſe we could
not love her errors, ſhe hath ejected
our perſons.</p>
            <p>Theſe are thoſe wicked ones, that
had rather rend the Church, than
want their wills, who can be content
to ſacrifice truth, peace, millions
of ſouls, Kings and all, to their own
ambition and covetuouſneſs; one of
which ſins alone is the root of all
evil, what is it then with the reſt of
their rabbel, but I may not aggravate
where God hath pardoned, if we
repent and bring forth better fruits:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170032:133"/>
This alſo was propheſied, that their
ſeditions, and madneſs, would at
once be the ſcandal of the true
Church of God, and give advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
to the falſe, which is the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> know you not that
I ſpeak truth?</p>
            <p>Well, down they muſt, both fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-workers
of iniquity. Sectaries
and Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> a Church you
ſee ſhe is call'd, though adulterous,
and Idolatrous, we read the Lord
calls the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo
guilty, yet his people, and you my
people <hi>Iſrael;</hi> when at the ſame
time he ſends his Prophets to let
them know, that for theſe very ſins
his puniſhments were haſtening to
come upon them, yea to lay them
waſte, and caſt them out of the land;
as thoſe rebellious <hi>Iſraelies</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſo that of <hi>Rome</hi> a Church.</p>
            <p>Thus we allow the greateſt robber
to be a true man, though a notorious
Thief, much the better, this keeps
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:170032:133"/>
him not from the gallows, to which
a true man comes not but to look
on and be premoniſhed, by ſo ſad
a ſpectacle, here me thinks we might
be reconciled, take now the beſt of
all ſides, ſomething good in all
hold it faſt, put that together;
and you have the onely true Church,
againſt which you ſee the gates of
Hell ſhall never prevail, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the ſtrength and yet power
of that Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we cannot
take away the Hay, and ſtubble,
and miſtempered morter, her Babel-builders
have raiſed her to this
height with, that her confuſion, as
her fall, may be the greater, the
Lord himſelf comes to do the work,
down they muſt, and this Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall, he hath ſaid it.</p>
            <p>But ſee the loving kindneſs of the
Lord extended to the Sons of men,
and to that Church alſo, in that he
tells them not onely of her fall, but
whither they ſhall repair for ſafety,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170032:134"/>
even under his wings, into his
Church, and to the Obedience of
his King, CHARLS STUART,
by the Lord now declared Defender
of the Faith.</p>
            <p>Here's a viſibility and Church, the
Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
alſo a rule given and a ſword
put into the hands of the General of
all his Forces, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> by
name, againſt whoſe rule and ſword
never ſhall any proſper that riſeth up
or is drawn; firſt proved in Gods
word for the defence of his Church,
now alſo by this his Propheſie, and
immediate dictate from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Well what is to be done, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
turn to this ſo mercifull Lord
your God withall your hearts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
a faſt, and keep it truely, and
let us know when you do it, that we
may pray together, God would be
pleaſed to have mercie upon you, and
now ſo direct all your Counſels to
his glorie, for the promotion of the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170032:134"/>
true Proteſtant Religion, the juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of all men, beſeeching God
for his guidance in all things and
times for the beſt, doubt not then,
but we ſhall all live together in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly-love,
and the Land be bleſt.
The King preſently invite home,
when come, a general Council aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
to reform all amiſs in the
Church and Houſe of God, begin,
here, and you do, what God by our
late King, by <hi>Haggai,</hi> by <hi>Zacharie,</hi>
by his Prophets, and by me now
ſent unto you, the moſt unworthieſt
of all adviſe too. You ſee we all
agree in the way, it is undoubtedly
the only courſe to remedy all amiſs.</p>
            <p>Thus to promote Gods glorie,
your Soveraigns Honour, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
his poſterity hath been the
moſt of your pretenſions, now let
it be the beſt and ſpeedieſt of your
practiſes; do this and live, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
of the World, wicked men, and
Devils, but the joy of Saints and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170032:135"/>
Angels, alſo the dearly beloved of
the Lord and good-men you will
be, or elſe put me to death; I will
neither run nor hide my ſelf to avoid
it, <hi>Walter Goſtelow</hi> dwelling in <hi>Broad-ſtreet</hi>
aſſures you of it, God having
firſt aſſured him for manner and
matter, as you read.</p>
            <p>The next in order is, the poor
<hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhall not be tranſplanted, ſee
here is the Bears skin you divided,
before taken into power to diſpoſe
of Your cruel Act was, that after
laſt <hi>May</hi> it muſt be death for any, not
qualified as you there pleaſe to ſet
down, if taken on this ſide the River
<hi>Chanon:</hi> Mercifull men you are, &amp;
juſt too, as you would have us miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe,
but pray what is become of
your ſelves? are not ſome of you
gone thither? the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation is
not, God put it into the heart of
<hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> to turn you out,
that would be turning of others out,
that you might divide the ſpoil,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170032:135"/>
which your ſelves make, no, they
ſhall not be tranſplanted, to Gods
glorie and my comfort, this part of
his Propheſie is fulfilled already, as
well as his ſign given me for the
ſtrengthning of my Faith and yours:
here alſo you ſee God judgeth not as
man doth, there are hundreds and
thouſands of that Nation, I firmly
believe, and I have good ground for
it alſo, which hate that Rebellion as
they did the Contrivers of it, and the
Actors of all Rebellion, the Devil &amp;
his inſtruments, with this poor and
oppreſſed Nation I have ſpent ſome
time, I know this to be true, and
now to their comfort I here aſſure
it them in Print, they ſhall not be
tranſplanted, they and the Land al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
may be made much better by our
good example, peaceably and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
co-habiting: the Land affords
room enough, and would be made
good too, if wiſe-men ſate at Helm,
which I aſſure them ſhortly will, in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170032:136"/>
the mean time, and at all times I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
them to the remedy of two
things, to ſpeak truth, and not to
give themſelves to idleneſs &amp; ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the Devil being the Father of
all lies, and the other his forge for all
villanies: our own good example in
this may much the ſooner remedy
both: for the former, they hate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of us, and uſe it as a rod of our
own making for to ſcourge us with:
for the latter, our pride and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes
makes them chuſe rather
to ſteal and hang, laze and ſtarve,
than work for their beggerly, proud,
&amp; Schiſmatical Lord-like uſurpers.
There is a great increaſe of a ſort of
ſeeming ſtrict, and conſciencious
living people gotten thither, they
call them Anabaptiſts, in <hi>Criſtmas</hi>
week 1653. to <hi>Youghall</hi> came one
they called Doctor <hi>Lamb,</hi> this Wolf
caſt many there then upon their
backs into the water, to hear, as well
as ſee, what he did, I went; he told
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:170032:136"/>
them that to be ſprinkled onely, as
uſed in <hi>England,</hi> made us no more
Chriſtians then thoſe were that liv'd
in <hi>France, Rome,</hi> or <hi>Spain;</hi> Nay, no
more than ſuch as lived in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteſt
place of the World and had
never heard of Chriſt; 'twas what he
did our. Saviour onely injoyned, and
our Lord himſelf was not baptized
untill about 30 years of age, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
firſt alſo; truely at this I could
not keep ſilence, I obſerved our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
alwayes believed, and was
baptized when he pleaſed, and for
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> certainly
he traduced and falſly ſlandered
them, this Doctor further added,
wicked men, having power in their
hands, had for theſe many years per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted
the true people of God,
which they were, &amp; laboured alſo to
ſuppreſs his Ordinances, which was
to baptize &amp; believe, as they did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
it is long to tell you more what
I ſaid in the defence of my faith and
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:170032:137"/>
Church, in fine, two of his party.
Sword men in that place, ſtood up
and cloſe to me alſo, and told me
we had no Church in <hi>England;</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it was like to come to force
of Argument, I went out and ſtaid
with others to ſee the two then to
be ducked, the woman near ſixty
years old could hardly be gotten
down, ſhe hanged ſo about this
Doctor <hi>Lamb;</hi> when in the water,
under water he could not get her,
the man, <hi>Young</hi> by name, dived
like an old duck, Doctor <hi>Lamb,</hi> after
he had well werted them, laught at
both: all this I ſaw and heard, theſe
things I hope will be amended:
when I was in priſon, I wrote to
the Lord of <hi>Broghill,</hi> that I would
witneſs thoſe words, ſpoken by
<hi>Lamb,</hi> to the ſlander of Gods word
and his Church, it is before you
Gentlemen theſe things require a
remedy, you imagine not what a
ſtrange ſort of cattle we have in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:170032:137"/>
               <hi>Ierland</hi> for Religion, mercifulneſs,
civility, you may finde better in
<hi>America,</hi> and upon my conſcience
many of them will be ſooner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to the Proteſtant Religion,
than too many of thoſe Saints will
ceaſe to be villains, to the great
diſhonour of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and deterring of thoſe poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to come in to it; I am aſhamed
of it, that men, which pretend to
piety, ſhould have ſo little; my Land-lord
the Goaler is a Saint to ſome
of them, yet what you have read of
him is true: preachers and wiſe men
they have amongſt them, as they
call them, that will tell you, me they
have, I am ſure of it, that there is
no Hell, and that their conſciences
never yet troubled them, though
they daily ſwear, whore, drink
drunk, beſides other wickedneſſes,
indeed what not, for ſin by links is
made a chain, to this they came,
their conſcience ought not to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:170032:138"/>
them, for who ever yet reſiſted
Gods will; for your Miniſters, which
tell you this and that ſtory out of
what they call the word of God, it
is but to this end, that they may
the better pick your pockets, when
you are amazed and over-awed by
them, and ſo went on, I do tell you
<hi>Moyſes</hi> was no more a Prophet than
the reſt of the Magitians, onely
more cunning in ſmiting them firſt,
they were all alike ſay theſe, I am
afraid to tell you what I have heard
amongſt the wicked <hi>rabble</hi> there of
new opinioneſts, if you will tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplant
any in <hi>Ireland</hi> tranſplant theſe
and your Anabaptiſts, and when
they have brought theſe wicked
ones to a true belief, let them then,
as the <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> be rebaptized: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Heathen ſend them alſo,
continue them not here to make
rents in Church &amp; government, for
they would conform to neither, had
they force: they told me the Lord
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170032:138"/>
was now coming to take the power
out of wicked Governors hands,
and to put it into theirs, and truely
that power I expected would have
been exerciſed on me, for the ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſtept up cloſe to me, when
Doctor <hi>Lamb</hi> could reaſon no more;
you are miſtaken in them if you
think them meek, they are furious
and not wiſe, I will not call them
fools, although their own words are,
they deſire to live and not ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
conſcience, and then all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be well with them, you
have heard how their conſciences
ſtands affected.</p>
            <p>Doth not this clearly ſhew you,
that what our ſo late, but ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and wiſe King CHARLS Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied,
is now come to paſs and
fulfilled in your eyes. Your diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

               <p>SIR, Mine of the tenth preſent, I
hope is received by you, it was
directed to Mounſieur <hi>Renier Bazine</hi>
Merchant, reſiding in <hi>Rue de Maviſe
Parroles</hi> PARIS: my charge to
him that forthwith he carry it to
you, Sir, or my Soveraign, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver

underſtand is done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> This is to deſcribe to you
the two Ladies, <hi>Frances</hi> the Elder,
and <hi>Elizabeth Boyl,</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. daughter

choſen, by the Almighty, Wife for
our Soveraign Lord the King: the
the Elder, Sir, is lamed by a fall ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

but with the deepeſt halting that is
imaginable, hardly without leading;
ſhe is very vertuous, and ſome 18

               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:170032:140"/>
For the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Sir, ſhe
hath the moſt lovelieſt face ever eies
beheld, the moſt of Majeſty in it,
nothing but lovelineſs in every part
of it, Excellency throughout: her
hair is brown, her eyes black, her
mouth little, her teeth the beſt,
her complexion, as that of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
brown, but moſt lovely, and
comely as ever eyes beheld: her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the perfection of workman-ſhip,
none did I ever ſee ſo made as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble
it: ſhe is aged about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
ſhe dances well, ſhe ſpeaks very
good <hi>French,</hi> ſhe delights in reading,
ſerving of her God, and obeying her
Parents; the Chaplain in that houſe
is Doctor <hi>Mollines,</hi> Son to him of

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> You may not doubt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of her Soul and minde,
whom God hath ſet apart to be ſo

                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:170032:141"/>
and his delight; for ſhe cannot be
other, all that ſee her admire her
outward perfections and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and for charity and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
two good adorns, ſhe is already
eminent, as a <hi>Queen Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> Let me be believed in a word,
ſhe is a Queen of Queens, and an
Angel on Earth: and this is my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
that the Lord hath in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
given ſuch a Lady to my King,
that will go hand in hand with him
in all paths of vertue and godlineſs;
that ſhe is as well a Nurſing Mother
to the Houſe of God, as his moſt
bleſſed Majeſty by God appointed,
and ſo commanded to be a Nurſing
Father to us, and all his now happy
people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I ſpake truth to you, and all
of the Lords doing for our King,
whom as his Queen God Almighty
ever bleſs, and let their rejoycings
in his good will and commands be
not deferr'd, to the joy of our hearts
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:170032:141"/>
admiration and obedience of the

               <p>O my King, fail not, I beſeech
you of the moſt ſincere performance
of your Devotions, by faſting and
prayer every Friday, and let there
be no looking back, nor return to
any ſins whatſoever: let not any of a
bad life, that will not be reformed,
eat one bit of your bread, or receive
a favour from you, more than pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for his, or their amendment and
puniſhment, where it is not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

frequent in Devotion and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the moſt bleſſed Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>O my King do you truely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:170032:142"/>
and ſo pray for the very worſt
of your Fathers, Mothers, and your

right, who ever loſt by referring all
to his Almighty power, times, and
goodneſs? Thus ſhall your Fathers
Counſel be followed, his ever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

live in you, to the joy of

turning for you, and to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the hearts of all, or moſt of all
to love true Religion, your juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
brotherly love, in which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

God be you the firſt and moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
I may not doubt of it, for
whom God Almighty hath reſerv'd,
nay, declared ſuch everlaſting loving
kindneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I do truely tell you, I could
with the moſt ardent deſire &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
hazard endeavoured to have
hang'd, or murdered all your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170032:142"/>
but God hath reproved me, I
can now do nothing with more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
than to pray for them, yet let's
not truſt them, that's a folly I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
God to deliver us from: the
wiſdom of the Serpent is not denied,
though the innocency of the Dove
be injoyned, both moſt excellent for
imitation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I have no intelligence more
than with the common, it is believed
that ſome dayes ſince from <hi>Holland</hi>
came expreſſes of the confirmation
of peace, I believe after this ſummer,
within a ſhort time, there will be
an end of all the Wars in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

reporting your affairs at <hi>Ratisbon</hi>
to be well advanced, and in good
condition; humane wiſdom, the
ſtrength of allies, and confederates
for the probable carrying on or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
of your juſt intereſt may
not be neglected, or refuſed: but
Sir, I do hope; Nay, believe, that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170032:143"/>
the Almighty will do this great work
for the good of all without bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
if we give over to abuſe his

honour &amp; name ſake he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to bring all theſe things to paſs
for you, this Land, &amp; Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
and although mighty, ſtrange,

               <p>MY belief, as my hopes is, that
what your Lordſhip was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to ſay unto me, I ſhall in the beſt
&amp; fitteſt time reap the ſpeaking with
you: I did return to my Lodging at
Saint <hi>James</hi> the Tueſday, I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
your good ſelf, but there I met
with this affront, as to have it diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of in my abſence, contrary to
my order and expectations, affronts
in other places alſo: Indeed, Sir, I
meet with little elſe but averſneſs to
good in men, I have ſince expected
your Lordſhips Command, or the
happineſs of ſeeing you, neither yet
come to hand, or eye, did not the
goodneſs of God, from the mouth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170032:144"/>
of ſuch as his Providence guided me
to hear Preach, let me ſee what I
am to expect from man, though of
my own Religion, my Spirits would
fail me: the Jews ſo ill treated the
Prophets ſent to them in their times,
and we, no better, follow their bad
examples.</p>
               <p>My Lord, be not backward to
hear and conſider the great good, the
Lord is pleaſed to do and bring to
paſs for the honour of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Religion, the general good of
all men, amongſt whom more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
our Soveraign CHARLS
STUART and your good ſelf, ſo ſure
as the Heaven is over my head,
and the Earth under my feet: I do
believe his Majeſty and ſome others,
of which number you are, to be bleſt
with long life, honour, as much as
mortality is capable of here, &amp; ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
happineſs hereafter: My Lord,
as theſe things are the decree of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
ſo are they to all aſſured the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:170032:145"/>
ſtrongeſt Obligations of the ſtricteſt
obedience upon Earth: I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
wrote to my King, I could
not do otherwayes. Firſt to let him
know what God is pleaſed to aſſure
ſhall be done for him, next to minde
him of his dayly duty, how that
without holineſs no man ſhall ever
ſee the face of God to his comfort:
Further, that he forgive all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Mothers, and his own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
for no man yet ever loſt by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
all to God; in this he will
beſt imitate his glorified Father, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in Heaven, who prayed dying
for forgiveneſs to thoſe that put him
to death. For the remitting of the
higheſt injuries we have the beſt of
patterns our Lord himſelf.</p>
               <p>My Lord, if I have any other end
than the glory of God, the honour
of the Proteſtant Religion, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of my duty, to the command
of my God in my deſire to ſpeak
with you, then do thou, O Lord,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170032:145"/>
whom I believe hath deputed me to
theſe very ends, never ſuffer me to
ſee your face: Therefore, good my

ſpeak with you, which done, as God
ſhall direct, I ſhall afterwards haſte,
as concerned into other Kingdoms,
to thoſe in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and this, when
communicated to your good ſelf, I

for his name and mercy ſake hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
me he will bring it to paſs, and
it ſhall be marvelous in our eyes.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ever ſhall continue
to pray that God would bleſs, and

            <p>MY Lord be pleaſed to allow
this Poſt-ſcript, I dare not
omit it, your Lordſhip hath heard
me, and now read my Propheſie, I
believe divers others alſo, that of
<hi>Elenor Channel,</hi> who was ſometimes
taken dumb, a Propheſie very high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſiderable, failing out in a time
much about mine, the matter one
with mine, ſent upon that imploy
of the Lords to your good ſelf, as
moſt conſiderable in this Kingdom;
diſquieted, as I was, untill ſhe had
communicated, or made known the
whole, to you onely addreſſed: Now
becauſe it is ſo very full, and falls in
ſuch a conjuncture of time with
mine, and but ſhort, I have printed it
at the end of this.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I well remember you
were pleaſed, after the good Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
given me to ſerve God, and to
walk according to his will revealed
in his word, to let me underſtand
your ſelf formerly had, and now late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:170032:146"/>
alſo, ſome things preſented unto
you, which were ſince come to paſs
alſo; but to rely on Viſions, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
we ſhould not, having the
more ſure word of God, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
to reſt on, good counſel it was,
I agree all, and the beſt to avoid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion;
the Propheſie being the
Lords, I cannot have a diſ-eſteem
of one word of that.</p>
            <p>My Lord; is not all I have ſaid
unto you agreeable to the word of
God? Is it not your duty to fear
God, Honour, and obey your King,
to aſſiſt the rebuild of Gods Houſe,
the reſtore of his Miniſters and their
maintenance, not to ſide with thoſe
that are given to change? to be in
love with all men, alſo with juſtice,
mercie, and forgiveneſs; to ſeek firſt
the Kingdom of Heaven and its
righteouſneſs, and then all other
things leſs conſiderable unpurſued
ſhall be given unto you? My Lord,
do this and live for ever happy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:170032:147"/>
Now becauſe its poſſible this hath
not been done by you, certainly not
by the Nation, ſee, God ſends his
Prophets unto both, and that you
may know they are his, they bring
nothing contrary to Scripture; 'tis
true they come to you in a unwont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ſeeming ſtrange way, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that is this: To perſons of
Honour, or a people the Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
mercy too, it hath been his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomary
manner of proceeding, to
ſuch he ſends his Prophets, that they
may repent and live, and ſhall Gods
mercy, your own happineſs, and the
Kingdoms welfare become our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
your deſtructions, if not hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto? No, God forbid, do you as
all others what I have adviſed too,
and be happy, Nay, you ſhall do it.</p>
            <p>There is a Gentleman of known

of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

Religion was much inſiſted,
upon, and diſcuſſed it was, whether
in ſo large a ſence you intended it, as
to take in the Sectaries and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

all; my Lord, in fine there was ſo
much ſaid to his Majeſty, and ſuch
clear ſatisfaction given to your

that it brought your Lordſhip
to a moſt humble and thankfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
and ſo bowing before his
Majeſty, you came both into one
Boat, where the King kindly and
with good affection imbraced you,
and ſo went away both together in

good underſtanding. That done,
this Gentleman heard the Bells ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly

to carry on the Famous and Learned

            <p>Sir, In this Book you will finde

God having been pleaſed to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
it to the World in his own
way by Propheſie, your Brethren
expect a deliverance &amp; reſtauration,
not far off, becauſe all the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies

            <p>Sir, It is my firm belief, that in
our Kings Raign, CHARLS STUART,
<hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
you will have deliverance,
Peace, and Protection, the ground

            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:170032:152"/>
About the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. year of my age I
was in ſeveral of your Synagogues,
my eldeſt Brother a Studient and
fellow of <hi>Corpus Christi</hi> Colledge in
<hi>Oxford,</hi> there with me, to obſerve, &amp;
accompliſh himſelf for the good of
others. He, Sir, having converſed
with divers of your <hi>Rabbies,</hi> did after
tell me what they ſo believed, as not
to be moved from.</p>
            <p>That for a people ſo beloved of
God, and to whom the promiſes of
the Almighty were ſo peculiarly
good, ſo many, ſo frequently afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and made known, as to the Jews
they were, your <hi>Rabbies</hi> could not be
perſwaded, that <hi>Shilo,</hi> or the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>
could be come into the World,
and they not know of it, to whom,
ſay they, he was promiſed as a King
to deliver, reſtore, and govern them
in this World; take heed, Sir, the
love of this world, deceives a world,
thus to bound the Almighty, and
herein to place your happineſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170032:153"/>
your miſapprehend of
him, &amp; what was Propheſied by your
own of him, <hi>David</hi> tells you, as well
as others, his Kingdom was not of
this World, he came to his own,
which were your ſelves, but ye refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
him, he after turned to us the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
who indeed injoy him, that you
yet hope for. I wonder, Sir, you ſee
not this clearly fulfilled and proved
to you in your own Prophets, as alſo
in that ſo excellent piece of Hiſtory,
you are carrying on, <hi>Joſephus,</hi> was
not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> deſtroyed and made
a heap of ſtones? all which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
long foretold it ſhould be ſo,
and that Generation ſhould not paſs
untill all were fulfilled, as in the 22
of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the 32 verſe, referring
to the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that
it was fulfilled, <hi>Joſephus</hi> his ſtory
confirmeth, and the continuance of

ſhould never be forgotten, but with
the Goſpel be Preached to all ages,
as in <hi>Matthew</hi> the 26. and the 13.
your ſelf, Sir, living in the Chriſtian
World cannot but ſee, read, and
hear this fulfilled, the Fathers of our
Church &amp; Proteſtant Religion have
publiſhed to the World the fulfill of
your allowed Propheſies, and ſhewed
it you clear as the Sun. Sir, have
you ever lain ſo long under Gods

            <p>That God will in mercy gather

            <p>The Proteſtant Religion, the
Kings Honour, <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> alſo,
the peoples juſt Right and Intereſt
muſt flouriſh, live, and be injoyed
to all good mens comfort; whileſt
deſtruction muſt be ſuffered by thoſe
onely which continue Rebellious,
and will not be reformed; whoſe
remove will be our rejoycing, as

That you, forthwith apply your
ſelves to do his will, and that's to
be more than Conquerors. A King
&amp; rulers on Earth, whoſe right it is
not, ſhall ſtinck on Earth, (as he
that made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin) and howle
in Hell too very ſhortly, but as the
memory of the juſt, good, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
ſhall begin to live for ever on
Earth, and that ſhortly too, ſo ſhall
thine, <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> and others,
declared in this Gods Propheſie, be
taken up with thy King into the
Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour
<hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> that never ſhall have
end; then alſo ſhall good people, &amp;
ſuch ſubjects go, as the ſheep in this,
Propheſie, to the right hand, wicked
&amp; Rebellious ones, as the Goats, to
the left hand, unto the former hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
God of his mercie, I beſeech
him, bring us all, from the later, God
deliver us all, he onely can do it
that hath ſaid and ſpoken now by
me, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall fall;
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170032:160"/>
But our Church for ever flouriſh.
God ſave the KING. <hi>Amen,</hi> yea,
let all the people ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
