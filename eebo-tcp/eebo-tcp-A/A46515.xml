         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by Our Royal Proclamation of the date the 12 day of <hi>February</hi> 1686/7 We were graciouſly pleaſed for the Cauſes, and on the Terms therein mentioned, to grant Our Royal Tolleration to the Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Religion therein named; With and under certain Reſtrictions and Limitations; All which are in the ſaid Proclamation more at length expreſſed: We now taking into Our Royal Conſideration the ſiniſtruous Interpretations, which either have, or may be made of ſome Reſtrictions, therein mentioned. Have thought fit by this Our Royal Proclamation, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Declare, that We will Protect Our Arch-Biſhops, and Biſhops, and all Our Subjects of the Proteſtant Religion, in the free Exerciſe of their Proteſtant Religion, as it is by Law Eſtabliſhed, and in the Quiet and Full Injoyment of all their Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without any Moleſtation or Diſturbance whatſoever. And We do likewiſe by Our Soveraign Authority, Prerogative-Royal, and Abſolute Power, Suſpend, Stop and Diſable, all Penal and Sanguinary Laws, made againſt any for Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed by Law, in that Our Ancient Kingdom, or for Exerciſing their reſpective Worſhips, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Rites and Ceremonies; All which Laws are hereby Stopt, Suspended and Diſabled to all Intents and Purpoſes. And to the end that by the Liberty thereby granted, the Peace and Security of Our Government in the Practice thereof, may not be Endangered, We have thought fit, and do hereby ſtraitly Charge and Command all Our Loving Subjects, that as We do give them leave to Meet and Serve God after their own Way and Manner, be it in privat Houſes, Chappels, or Places purpoſely Hired or Built for that uſe, ſo that they take care that nothing be Preached or Taught among them which may any ways tend to Alienat the Hearts of Our People from Us, or Our Government, and that their Meetings be peaceable, openly and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held, and all Perſons freely admitted to them, and that they do ſignifie and make known to ſome one or more of the next Privy Counſellors, Sheriffs, Stewards, Baillies, Juſtices of the Peace, or Magiſtrats of Burghs-Royal, what Place or Places they ſet a part for theſe uſes, with the Names of the Preachers.</p>
            <p>And that all Our Subjects may enjoy ſuch their Religious Aſſemblies with greater aſſurance and protection, We have thought fit, and do hereby Command, that no Diſturbance of any kind be made or given unto them, under pain of Our Royal diſpleaſure, and to be further proceeded againſt with the outmoſt ſeverity; Provided always, that their Meetings be in Houſes, or Places provided for the purpoſe, and not in the open Fields, for which now after this Our Royal Grace and Favour ſhown (which ſurpaſſes the Hopes, and equals the very Wiſhes of the moſt zealouſly concerned) there is not the leaſt ſhadow of excuſe left; Which Meetings in Fields We do hereby ſtrictly prohibite and forbid, againſt all which We do leave Our Laws and Acts of Parliament in full force and vigour, notwithſtanding the Premiſſes; And do further Command all Our Judges, Magiſtrats, and Officers of Our Forces, to proſecute ſuch as ſhall be guilty of the ſaids Field-Conventicles or Aſſemblies with the outmoſt Rigour, as they would avoid Our Higheſt Diſpleaſure; For We are confident none will, after theſe Liberties and Freedoms We have given to all, without reſerve, to ſerve God in their own way, preſume to meet in theſe Aſſemblies, except ſuch as make a pretence of Religion, to cover their Treaſonable Deſigns againſt Our Royal Perſon, and the Peace of Our Government. And Laſtly, To the end all Our good Subjects may have notice of this Our Royal Will and Pleaſure, We do hereby Command Our Lyon King at Arms, and his Brethren Heraulds, Macers, Purſevants, and Meſſengers at Arms, to make timeous Proclamation thereof at the Mercat-Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> And beſides the Printing and Publiſhing of this Our Royal Proclamation, It is Our expreſs Will and Pleaſure, that the ſame be paſt under Our Great Seal of that Our Kingdom <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> without paſſing any other Seal or Regiſter.
