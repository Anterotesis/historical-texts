            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the morning Lieut. Gen. <hi>Fleetwood</hi> had order to advance with his brigade on the other side Severn, &amp; all things being prepared for the making of a bridg, &amp;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94876:4"/>
having cleared our passages with a forlorne, we laid a bridg over severn in that place where the river Team runs into it, so that by that means we had an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to lay another bridg over the river Team which accordingly was done, our foot disputed the hedges with much courage and resolution, the fight began on the other side of Severn, and our Foot from this side began it, they clearing the way for the rest to come over after them, the right Wing of Lieut. Generall <hi>Fleetwoods</hi> Forces came over the bridg that was made over Team, while the left Wing disputed the bridge at <hi>Poyke</hi> a quarter of a mile beyond the River, which dispute lasted a long time, and was very hot, but the Lord gave our men to gaine ground of the Enemy, till we had beaten them out of the ground, the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges was very hot for a while, but the Lord owned us in this Contest, and the Enemy fled before us; while this was doing, the enemy rallying made a very bold sally out on this side of the Towne, and came with great bodies of horse and foot, supposing most of our Army had been drawne out on the other side, they gave our men a very hot salute, and put them to a little retreat, and disorder; but in a short while the Lord gave us victory on this side also, our foot did very noble and gallant service, and they disputed with them not onely the hedges, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them boldly to the very mouth of their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which was planted on their Mountaine works, at length we gained their works, (and planted their great Guns against them in the Town) and we heare that some of our horse and foot are in the <hi>North</hi> and
