         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

King of this Realm; out of which Laws may be gathered four things: Firſt, that every man had means, and was authorized to ſue in this Court, in their own Shire or County; that no man ought to ſue out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or to draw his Plea from thence without good cauſe: both which things do plainly appear in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Law. Thirdly, that the King himſelf had a high Court of Juſtice, wherein it ſeemeth that he ſate in perſon: as theſe words do demonſtrate, Let him not ſeek to the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And laſtly, that the ſame Court of the Kings did judge, not onely according to meer right, and Law, but alſo after equitie and good conſcience. And after this order, and in theſe two Courts, was all Juſtice adminiſtred. This Court continuing (untill the time of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, and ever ſince during the times and raigns of the antient Kings) and doth yet continue (in manner) the ſame forme, and ſubſtance that it then was, (and will do in deſpite of thoſe ſycophants, that have had

               <p>The Sheriff nor his Officers can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not break a mans houſe in the night time to execute any proceſs, or to do any miniſteriall act: for the Law giveth no colour to break a mans houſe by night.</p>
               <p>No diſtreſs can be made in the night, but for damage feaſant.</p>
               <p>The Bayliff may attach a man by his Goods, citing him to appear, and anſwer ſuch a day, at ſuch a mans Suit, in ſuch a Court, and for ſuch a cauſe; Or he may onely give the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant warning (in the preſence of 2. others) to appear ſuch a day, in ſuch a Court, and at ſuch a mans Suit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is good enough; and if an Attachment be made, it muſt be of ſuch Goods (of the Defendants own proper Goods) as are movea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, <hi>viz.</hi> by meere Chattels Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonalls,
