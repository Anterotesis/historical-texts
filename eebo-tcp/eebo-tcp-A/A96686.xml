         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Civill peace and quiet of that Government, in an open

troubleſome, but much more at <hi>Roade Iſland,</hi> having gotten
a ſtrong party to adhere unto him, affronting that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as <hi>Plymouth</hi>) in their publique adminiſtration of

<pb facs="tcp:116142:3"/>
referre your Honours, being compiled as briefly as may bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>Gorton</hi> being there whipt in his perſon, and thence baniſhed
with ſome of his principall adherents, they went next to
<hi>Providence,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and ſome others have
built a ſmall Towne. This people receiving them with all
humanity in a cold ſeaſon, when the former places could no
longer beare his inſolencies; hee ſoone undermined their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
gained a ſtrong party amongſt them to his owne,
to the great diſtraction of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and the better
party there, contending againſt their Laws, and the execution

the neighbour Governments become affected with <hi>Gortons</hi>

unwarrantable meanes, &amp;c. Now the Government of the
<hi>Maſsachuſets</hi> having uſed all due meanes and none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing,
but their gentleneſſe anſwered with the greateſt
contempt that might bee: At the next Meeting of the
Commiſsioners for the United Colonies they complained of <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>

and the reſt of the <hi>Nanohigganſet Sachims,</hi> who
were knowne to bee in a deepe Conſpiracy againſt all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh

Diſcourſe, you will eaſily condeſcend unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there being nothing
(I thanke God in it) affirmed by mee, but as it is affirmed
hereunto I may ſafely depoſe. A ſecond thing is, that yee will
never ſuffer <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> this peſtilent diſturber of our
Societies, any more to goe to <hi>New-England</hi> to diſquiet
the peace thereof. My third requeſt is, that yee will

liberty in the line of their Government, which includeth their
very ſeat, even <hi>Shawamet</hi> it ſelfe, where <hi>Gorton</hi> and his

conſideration, how deſtructive it will prove to the well-being
of our Plantations and proceedings there, (who by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

Hereupon many of the chiefe of <hi>Providence</hi> ſent meſſengers with a
Letter to the Governour and Councell of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> deſiring
aide againſt <hi>Gorton</hi> and his company; but they were anſwered, that
not being within our Juriſdiction nor conſederation we had no
ground to interpoſe in their quarrells. Soone after ſome of thoſe
men tendred themſelves and their lands to come under our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and were received.</p>
            <p>There live neere to <hi>Providence</hi> two ſmall Indian <hi>Sachims</hi> called
<hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Socononoco,</hi> who though they are as free as the great
<hi>Sachim</hi> of the <hi>Nanohigganſet:</hi> Yet <hi>Myantonimo</hi> the then <hi>Sachim</hi> of
of <hi>Nanohigganſet</hi> (being a very proud and ſterne man) kept them in
great awe. This poore <hi>Sachim Pumham</hi> had a large parcell of land
neer <hi>Providence,</hi> very convenient for plantation, which <hi>Gorton</hi> and
his company (being now about 13, or 14.) taking notice of, and
fearing they ſhould not be able to keep their power long where they
were, dealt with <hi>Myantonimo</hi> for this parcell of land, promiſing him
a good parcell of <hi>Wampam</hi> for it. And becauſe they knew that
<hi>Pumham</hi> was the true owner of it, they dealt with him alſo; but he
refuſing to ſell it (for hee dwelt upon it, or very neare to it) they
cauſed <hi>Myantonimo</hi> to ſend for him, and having drawn a Writing
purporting the ſale thereof for a certaine conſideration to bee given
to both of them, <hi>Myantonimo</hi> ſigned it, and hee for feare of <hi>Myanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo</hi>
ſet his mark to it alſo, not knowing what it was. But when
<hi>Gorton</hi> tendred him the conſideration for it, hee utterly refuſed it, it
being the Indians manner not to account any thing ſold, till the
party have received the thing it is ſold for.</p>
            <p>But upon this colourable title <hi>Gorton</hi> and his company enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the land, and build ſome houſes, and withall much wrong the
Indians with their cattle, and having <hi>Myantonimo</hi> their friend, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves very inſolently toward the poor Indians, who (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no friends or meanes to relieve themſelves) came and tendred
themſelves and their lands to the government of the <hi>Maſſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uſets,</hi>
who (by order of the Court) gave notice thereof to <hi>Myantonimo,</hi> and
appointed him to come or ſend to the next Court at <hi>Boſton,</hi> to ſhew
his title or intereſt (if hee had any) to the ſaid <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Socono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noco</hi>
or their lands. At the time appointed hee came, and preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they were his vaſſalls, but it appeared clearly both by a
writing from Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and the teſtimony of ſome other En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
in thoſe parts, and of divers other Indians no way related to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116142:7"/>
them, that they were free <hi>Sachims;</hi> ſo as <hi>Myantonimo</hi> having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to reply, the Court received the two Indian <hi>Sachims</hi> with their
ſubjects and lands under the government and protection of the
<hi>Maſſachuſetts;</hi> and upon that writ to our neighbours of <hi>Providence,</hi>
intimating the ſame to them, and adviſing <hi>Gorton</hi> and his company,
that if they had any juſt title to the lands they poſſeſſed, they ſhould
come, or ſend ſome for them to ſhew the ſame to the Court, and
offered them ſafe conduct. This letter from the Court they tooke
in great diſdaine, and returned ſcornfull and menacing anſwers by
word of mouth, and a good time after they wrote a letter to the
Court full of reproach and blaſphemies, not onely againſt the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
but againſt the Churches and Ordinances, as by the Copy
thereof hereafter following will appeare. Notwithſtanding theſe
provocations and daily wrongs offered to thoſe few Engliſh their
neighbours (who had formerly ſubmitted themſelves to our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment)
wee ſate ſtill neare halfe a yeare, and before we attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
any thing againſt them, wee adviſed with the Commiſſioners of
the united Colonies, who (upon teſtimony of their inſolent and
injurious courſes, and peruſall of the letter they ſent to us) left them
to us to proceed according to Juſtice. Whereupon the Court ſent
againe to them by two of their members, who carryed letters (to
require and perſwade them to come and give ſatisfaction,) and a ſafe
Conduct withall; but they entertained thoſe Meſſengers as they
had done the former, threatening to whip one, whom they tooke
along with them; and ſent us word, that if wee had any thing to
ſay to them, wee ſhould come to them, and wee ſhould have juſtice
there, and that if wee came with force, they would meet us half the
way. Our meſſengers returning with theſe ſcornfull anſwers, the
Court reſolved to ſend ſome force to fetch them in; and in the
mean time there came a ſecond letter from them; (the Copy whereof
is hereafter alſo ſet downe) but before wee ſent forth our ſouldiers,
wee wrote to them to this effect: <hi>Viz.</hi> That although the injuries
and provocations wee had indured from them were very grievous,
yet that our Juſtice and moderation might appeare to all men, wee
had condeſcended ſo farre to their owne propoſition, as wee would
ſend ſome Commiſſioners to them, to heare their anſwers and alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
and if thereupon they would give us ſuch ſatisfaction as
ſhould bee juſt, wee would leave them in peace; if otherwiſe, wee
would right our ſelves by force of Armes: And ſignified withall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116142:8"/>
that wee would ſend a ſufficient guard with our Commiſſioners; for
ſeeing they would not truſt themſelves with us upon our ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
wee had no reaſon to truſt any of ours with them upon their
bare curteſie. Accordingly about a week after wee ſent three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
and 40 Muſqueteers with them, with inſtructions, firſt
to ſpeak and treate with them, and to require ſatisfaction according
to Juſtice, and if it were denyed, then to take them by force, and
bring them priſoners to <hi>Boſton;</hi> and to take withall ſo much of their
ſubſtance as ſhould ſatisfie our charges. By the way as they went
they met with another letter from them, letting them know, that
they feared them not, but were prepared for them: And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they had fortified themſelves in one houſe (ſome 12 of them)
and had lined the walls with earth (Musket proofe) and had made
Flanckers, and provided victualls, &amp;c. to indure a ſiege. So that
when our Commiſſioners came to the place, they would admit no
parly. But after a while, by the mediation of ſome of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
they were content to parley, and offered to referre the cauſe
to Arbitrators, ſo as ſome of them might bee of <hi>Providence,</hi> or of
<hi>Roade</hi> Iſland. Our Commiſſioners were content to ſend to us
to know our minds about it, and in the meane time ſate ſtill. Such
of the Court as could meet, returned anſwer that their Propoſition
was neither ſeaſonable nor reaſonable, nor could it bee ſafe or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
for us to accept thereof: 1 Becauſe they would never
offer nor hearken to any termes of agreement before our ſouldiers
had them in their power. 2 Becauſe the ground of their Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
was falſe, for wee were not parties (as they pretended) but
equall Judges between the <hi>Indians</hi> and others who were complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and themſelves, (and yet in a caſe of warre, parties may bee
Judges.) 3 They were no State, or Body politique, but a few
fugitives living without Law or Government, and ſo not honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for us to joyne with them in ſuch a way of reference. 4 The
parties whom they would referre it unto, were ſuch as had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
by us, and all the Governments in the Country, and ſo not
likely to bee equall to us, nor able to judge of the cauſe: and their
blaſphemous and reproachfull writings, &amp;c. were not matters fit
to bee compoſed by Arbit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ement, (being deeply criminall) but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bee purged away by repentance and publique ſatisfaction, or
elſe by publique puniſhment. For theſe and other reaſons, the
Commiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>oners were required to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d according to their Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116142:8"/>
And thereupon they intrenched themſelves about the
houſe, and in few dayes forced them to yeeld, and ſo brought them
to <hi>Boſton,</hi> where they were kept in priſon till the Court ſate, and
had their dyet from the Cookes (as good meat and drinke as the
Towne afforded.) The next Lords day they refuſed to goe to the
Church aſſembly, except they might have liberty to ſpeake there, as
occaſion ſhould be. They were anſwered by ſome of the Magiſtrates
that it appertained to the Elders to order the affairs of the Church,
but they might preſuppoſe they ſhould not bee denyed ſuch liberty,
ſpeaking words of truth and ſoberneſſe. So in the afternoon they
came, and were placed in a convenient ſeate before the Elders.
Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> the Teacher taught then (in his ordinary courſe) out of
<hi>Acts</hi> 19. of <hi>Demetrius</hi> ſpeech for <hi>Diana</hi> her ſilver ſhrine. After Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Gorton</hi> deſired leave to ſpeake, which being granted, hee tooke
occaſion from the Sermon to ſpeake to this effect, That in the
Church now there was nothing but Chriſt, ſo that all our Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
Miniſters, and Sacraments, &amp;c. were but mens inventions,
for ſhew and pomp, and no other then thoſe ſilver ſhrines of <hi>Diana.</hi>
He ſaid alſo, that if Chriſt lives eternally, then he died eternally, and
other ſpeeches of like kinde. And indeed it appeareth both by his
ſpeeches and letters, that it was his opinion, that Chriſt was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in <hi>Adam,</hi> and was that image of God, wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
and that the chiefe worke and merit lay in his <hi>Inanition,</hi> when
he became ſuch a thing, ſo meane, &amp;c. and that his being borne
after of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuffering, &amp;c. was but a manifeſtation
of his ſuffering, &amp;c. in <hi>Adam.</hi> Another of them ſaid that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
was Chriſt, and ſo was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> They cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Magiſtracy among Chriſtians an Idol; yet they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
a Magiſtracy in the world to bee ſubjected to as an Ordinance
of God, but onely as naturall; as the father over his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and an hereditary Prince over his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Their firſt appearance before the Court was upon the Lecture day
at <hi>Boſton,</hi> before a very great Aſſembly, where firſt the Governour
declared the cauſe and manner of all the proceedings againſt them,
and their Letters were openly read, and they had liberty to object,
and anſwers were given, as followeth:</p>
            <p>Firſt, to their plea, That they were not within our Juriſdiction;
it was anſwered: 1 If they were not within ours, yet they were
within the Juriſdiction of one of our confederates, who had refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116142:9"/>
them to us. 2 If they were within no Juriſdiction, then was
there none to complaine to for redreſſe of our injuries in way of
ordinary Juſtice, and then we had no way of relief but by force of
Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to their plea <hi>Of perſecution for their Conſcience, &amp;c.</hi> It
was anſwered, that wee did not meddle with them for their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
otherwiſe then they had given us occaſion, by their owne Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and free ſpeeches amongſtus, for wee wrote to them about ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Controverſies onely, and gave them no occaſion to vent their
blaſphemies and revilings againſt the Ordinances of Religion ſet up
with us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for their title to the <hi>Indians</hi> lands: wee had divers
times deſired them to make it appeare; but they alwayes refuſed,
even to our Commiſſioners, whom (according to their owne
motion) wee ſent laſt to them: and ſince they were in priſon,
wee offered them to ſend for any witneſſes they would name
to us for that end, but this alſo they refuſed. So that our
title (by the Indians ſurrender) appeareth good, and having
regained poſſeſſion, we need not queſtion them any further about
that.</p>
            <p>Their Letters being read and their Subſcriptions acknowledged,
they were demanded ſeverally if they would maintaine thoſe things
which were contained therein. Their anſwer was, that they would,
in that ſenſe they wrote them, and ſo were returned to priſon. The
next day they were brought before the Court ſeverally to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
upon particulars, (many of the Elders being deſired to bee
preſent) becauſe they had ſaid they could give a good interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of every part of their Letters. But the Interpretation they gave
being contrary to the words, they were demanded if they would
then retract thoſe words, ſo plainely different from their pretended
meanings. But this they refuſed to doe, ſaying, that then they
ſhould deny the Truth; for inſtance in one or two. Their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were directed, one of them, <hi>To their Neighbours of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets:</hi>
and the other, <hi>To the great honoured Idoll Generall of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uſets,</hi>
and by a meſſenger of their owne delivered to our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and many paſſages in both Letters particularly applyed to
our Courts, our Magiſtrates, our Elders, &amp;c. and yet upon their
examinations about their meanings in their reproachfull paſſages,
they anſwered that they meant them, of the corrupt eſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116142:9"/>
in generall, and not of us. So, whereas in their Letter they
charged it upon us, as an errour that we teach, <hi>That Chriſt dyed
Actually onely,</hi> when he ſuffered under <hi>Pontius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilate;</hi> and before,
onely in <hi>Types,</hi> &amp;c. upon their examination they ſaid, that their
meaning was, that his death was actuall to the faith of the Fathers
under the Law, (which is in effect the ſame which we hold:) Yet
they would not retract their words they had written. The Elders
conferred many houres with them before the Court, and by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
thereof they diſcovered divers blaſphemous opinions, which
they maintained, we will inſtance one which was mentioned before,
delivered by <hi>Gorton, viz.</hi> that the Image of God wherein <hi>Adam</hi> was
created, was Chriſt; and <hi>Adams</hi> looſing that Image was the death
of Chriſt, and the reſtoring of that Image in the Regeneration, was
the reſurrection of Chriſt: and ſo the death of him that was borne
of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was but a manifeſtation of the former. Maſter
<hi>William Tompſon</hi> one of the Elders had ſpent ſome time with them
before in the priſon about the opinions which they held forth, and
they had profeſſed their agreement with him (for ſubſtance) in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
point, ſo as he came to the Court with a purpoſe to ſpeak in their
behalf, but when he heard themſelves diſcover thus upon their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
examinations, he ſhewed how he had beene deluded by them.
For they excell the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> in the art of equivocation, and regard
not how falſe they ſpeake, to all other mens apprehenſions, ſo they
keepe to the rules of their owne ſecret intentions. Being asked why
they ſpake againſt the Ordinances of the Miniſtery, Sacraments, &amp;c.
ſeeing the Scripture allowes them? They anſwered that they were
ordained onely for the time of Nonage, but after the Revelation
was written, they were to ceaſe, becauſe we finde no mention of
them in that booke.</p>
            <p>They were unlearned men, the ableſt of them could not write
true engliſh, no not in common words, yet they would take upon
them to interpret the moſt difficult places of Scripture, and wreſt
them any way to ſerve their owne turne. As for inſtance, Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
preſſing <hi>Gorton</hi> with that in <hi>Act.</hi> 10. Who can forbid water, why
theſe ſhould not be baptiſed, &amp;c. He interpreted thus, who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but theſe have beene baptiſed, ſeeing they have received the Holy
Ghoſt, &amp;c. ſo he allowed them to have beene baptiſed. This ſhift
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was put to, that he might maintaine his opinion, <hi>viz:</hi> that ſuch
as have beene baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, need not the baptiſme
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116142:10"/>
of water. Divers dayes were ſpent both by the Court and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in labouring to bring them to repentance, but all in vaine. They
continued obſtinate. Whereupon they agreed to ſentence them,
but firſt they brought them in publique before a great Aſſembly,
and there (out of their Letters and Speeches) they laid upon them
this charge, <hi>viz.</hi> they were found to be blaſphemous enemies of the
true Religion of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of all his holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and likewiſe of all Civill Government among his people, and
particularly within this jurisdiction. Then they were demanded,
if they did acknowledge this charge to be juſt, and would ſubmit
to it, or what exception they had againſt it? They anſwered, they
did not acknowledge it to be juſt, but they fell into ſome cavilling
ſpeeches, ſo they were returned unto priſon againe. Being in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
they behaved themſelves inſolently towards their keeper, and
ſpake evill of the Magiſtrates, ſo as the keeper was forced to threaten
them with Irons, to keepe them quiet.</p>
            <p>After all meanes uſed to reclaime them, and not prevailing, they
were brought before the Court to receive their ſentence, which was
this. <hi>Gorton</hi> and ſix more of them, were to be ſent to ſeverall townes,
there to bee kept to worke for their livings, and to weare an Iron
chaine upon one leg, and not to depart the limits of the Towne,
nor by word or writing to maintaine any of their blaſphemous or
wicked errours upon paine of death, except in conference with any
of the Elders, or any other allowed by ſome Magiſtrate to conferre
with them; and this to continue during the pleaſure of the Court.
Three of the Company (becauſe they had not their hands to the
Letters) were ſet at libertie, two of them upon a ſmall ranſome as
priſoners taken in warre, and the other, freely, for that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them in his Maſters houſe, where they were taken; a fourth
being found to be a plaine ignorant young man was diſcharged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
onely enjoyned to abide a time in one of our Townes, but hee
went away and returned no more, contrary to his promiſe. There
were two other who were brought in after; (but not by force) the
one of them diſclaiming to have any hand in the Letters, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
preſently; the other was kept a while in priſon, and after
upon his ſubmiſſion &amp;c. was releaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gorton</hi> and the other ſix remained in the ſeverall Townes all that
Winner; and then in regard of their wives and children (who were
like to be much diſtreſſed by their husbands abſence) they were ſet at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116142:10"/>
liberty, and baniſhed upon paine of death if they were found in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part of our juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>After the Court had paſſed ſentence upon them for their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

we ſent to fetch ſo many of their Cattle, as might defray the
charges they had put us to, which amounted to about one hundred

every of them a part for the ſupport of their families, and ſome of
them had no Cattle at all.</p>

have againſt us; the proofe wherof, every occaſion brings forth;
Wee cannot but conclude, that no act ſo ill which that ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

that it is the name of Chriſt called upon us, which you ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt;

which is the occaſion you have now got to contend; we
wiſh your words were verified, that they were not elſewhere to be

of the place where they are. For, we know neither the one
nor the other, with all their aſſociates and Confederates, have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to enlarge the bounds, by Kinge <hi>Charles</hi> limited unto you.</p>
            <p>Behold therfore in this your act, a Map of your ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
(to uſe your owne phraſe) for we know that the Spirituality
of your Churches, is the Civility of your Commonweale, and the
Civility of your Comonwealth, is the ſpirituality of your Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the wiſdome of man, being the whole accompliſhment of them
both; of which Tree, you delight dayly to eate (finding it faire and
beautifull) to gaine Conformity with your maker. In theſe
your Diſſembling ſubjects; groſly profane amongſt us, but full
of the ſpirit of your purity, when they are with you, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the brand your ſelves have ſet upon ſome of them, the Cauſe
wherof was never yet removed, though it abide not upon their
backe; Nor yet the Cauſe of your Commitment of them unto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
according unto your Law, for if that were removed, you
ſhould doe them wrong, in not reſuming your vomit into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Concoction againe; Nor are we ignorant of thoſe diſgracefull
tearmes they uſe, and give out againſt you, behind your backes,
their ſubmiſſion therfore can bee to no other end, but to ſatisfie
their owne luſts, not onely conceived, but in violent motion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their Neighbours, who never offered the leaſt wrong unto
them, only the propoſition of Amity, is object ſufficient, for theſe
mens enmitie.</p>
            <p>Even ſo the paſſions of ſin, which are by the Law, having force
in your Members; you going about with great labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
to ſatisfie them by your ſubmiſſion unto the word of God,
in your Faſting, and feaſting, in Contributing, and treaſuring, in
retiredneſſe for Study, and bowing of the backes of the poore, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth in labour to maintaine it, and in the ſpirit of that hireling,
raiſing up, your whole ſtructure and edifice, in all which you
bring forth nothing but fruit unto death, ſome labouring for a price
to give for the keeping of their ſoules, in peace and ſafe eſtate and
Condition, and ſome to have their bodies furniſhed with riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and eaſe, and further then the Lord Jeſus agrees with theſe,
you mind him not, nay you renounce and reject him, and with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116142:12"/>
theſe (according to your Acceptation and practice) he holds no
Correſpondency at all, being the Conſultation and operation of
that his onely adverſarie, man being that which you depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
and not the Lord, Crying out in way of Elevation, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauding
his miniſters, when in the meane time, you know not what,
nor who they are, profeſſing them under a mediate Call of Chriſt,
though formerly, they have beene Called immediately by him, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſhowing your ſelves to be thoſe, that deſtroy the Sacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God: For if you make Chriſt to be that to day, in ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his miniſters; which he was not yeſterday, and that in the
tyme of the Goſpell alſo, (to ſpeake acording to your Law) to be
found in them both, you therin affirm, that he hath beene that to
his miniſters, which now he is not, and to make the Son of God to
have beene that which now he is not, is to make a Nullitie of
him, not to be at all, for he is the Lord that changeth not, no not
a ſhadow therof is found in him, ſo that you plainely Crucifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your ſelves, the Lord of glory, and put him to an open ſhame;
So that as you know not, how Chriſt, converſing with his
father in heaven, is found on the earth, amongſt the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers,
no more do you know, how in his converſing with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi>
on the earth, he concludes himſelfe to be in heaven, with
his father. On this foundation hangeth the whole building of
your Doctrine, concerning the ſufferings of Chriſt, you Annihilate
the Croſs, then the which, the Saints have no other Conſolation:
and prepare no better a place then Purgatory, for the honourable
fathers of our Lord: For you conclude, that Chriſt dyed in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,
and purpoſe God, in the time of the Law, but actually onely
when he hanged on the Croſſe in the dayes of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
that hee was crucified in the types and ſhadowes of the law, but
in the truth, and ſubſtance, when hee appeared borne of the Virgin
<hi>Mary:</hi> So muſt you alſo conclude that the fathers under the law,
were only ſaved, in purpoſe and Decree, in Type and ſhadow, but
actually and ſubſtantially onely at the Comming of Chriſt in the
fleſh: therefore deale plainely with thoſe that depend upon you for
inſtruction (as your Anceſtours in the papacie have don) and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
a place of purgatorie, provided for them in them meane, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which, your Doctrine hath no foundation. For if you raiſe up
a ſhaddow, without a ſubſtance, and the ſubſtance of him that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
in light, without a ſhaddow, you play the part of Wiſards, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116142:13"/>
Necromancers, not the part of true Naturaliſts, in the things of the
Kingdome of god.</p>
            <p>So that as farre as theſe men are from beinge honourable and
loyall ſubjects, ſo farre are you from being voluntaries in the Day of
Gods power, and from yeelding ſubjection unto the Beauties of
holineſs. Such alſo is your profeſſed Rule, and Government, in
the things that concern the Kingdom of our God, they are infinitly
beyond, and out of the Reach of that Spirit which is gone out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
you, the Capacity wherof can no wayes comprehend, the

it cannot know thoſe Cherubims of glory, neither can it heare
the voice of that lively Oracle, ſpeaking onely from off the covering
Mercy-ſeate, and not elſewhere to be heard; We ſpeake not but
what wee know, theſe things are out of its Juriſdiction; Therfore
dumb in telling Juſtice, nor ſpeakes it any of that Righteouſneſſe
and glory, compryſed in another circuit, then ever you were yet
made Lords of: Long therfore may you boaſt, of your Juriſdiction
before ever you attaine unto a <hi>Jurisprudentia,</hi> in theſe things.</p>
            <p>In that you tell us wee offer you wrong, by a pretended purchaſe:
you are as much miſtaken in the purchaſe, as in the wrong, For it
is right that we are about to do, neither is our purchaſe a pretence,
but precedentiall, not onely in this Civill reſpect, but may alſo
admoniſh all men, to take heed, how they depend upon falſe and
ſelf-ſeeking interpreters, when both themſelves, and they that
have the viſion, are ignorant of the Contract, and Covenant of
God. Thence it is, that you teach, that the ſpouſe of Chriſt, upon
Contract with her Lord, may conceive the ſeed of immortalitie, and
bring forth fruit unto God, when as yet the day of mariage, that
great Feaſtivitie, and ſolemnization, of the Conſolations of God,

for ſome of them committed part of their ſuppoſed right unto us,
profeſſing it was, that they might have help, to injoy the reſt; But
when they ſaw, wee would not be Abetters unto them without,
much leſſe contrary unto Covenant, then they flye unto you for
help, Their poſſeſſion, beeing a meere intruſion, as all the Natives
know and ever exclaymed againſt them for the ſame, And ſo may
our Countrymen alſo, whoſe eyes are not dazled with envie, and
eares open to Lyes, as we know yours are, elſe you had heard both
ſydes ſpeake, before you had Judged.</p>
            <p>But wee profeſs right held, according to no ſuch intereſt, but
upon the ground of Covenant onely, knowne in its nature; In the

with the nature of all fruit ariſing from their accord and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie,
together with their Diſtinct, Harmonicall, Reciprocall, and
Joint properties, and operations of them both: Such is the tenure
wee hould, and maintain, before men and Angels, and oppoſe it
againſt man and Divell, Not in taking up unto our ſelves, certaine
offices and officers which wee can teach children to bee, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and from thence preſently to conclude, the poſſeſſion of the

we have payd our vowes. But when that Dark cloud deſcended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Never doth it ſhine but in the night, never is it dark to Iſrael but

and accordingly, have made the whole way, and will of
our Lord, the ouldneſſe of the letter, both to your ſelves, and to all
that have an eare to liſſen unto you; Thence it is that the day of
Lord, is a day of Darkneſs and Gloomineſs unto you, but of Joy
and gladneſs unto us; yea, it lifts up our head onely, and then
is our ſalvation neere; For wee know the worthies of <hi>David</hi>
doubled about the bed of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which expell all feare in the
night, handling the ſword with ſuceſs, making the adverſaries
nothing but meat to feede upon, ſo that the tyme of your feares
is the time of our Courage and Conqueſt, for when you feare
errour, ſchiſme, Rents and Confuſions in Church and ſtate, then do
wee know the Meſſenger of the Covenant, the Lord whom wee ſeek
is ſpeeding his paſſage into his holy temple: For who (under the
terrors of your ſpirit) may abide his Coming, hee being like a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners

            <p>In that you invite us unto your Courts to fetch your equall bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
juſtice, upon this ground, that you are becomne one with
our adverſaries, and that, both in what they have, and what they
are, and wee know them to bee ſuch, as profeſs the day of the Lord
an unhallowed thing. Now, if wee have our opponant, to prefer
his action againſt us, and not only ſo, but to bee our Counſell, our
Jurie, and our Judg, for ſo it muſt bee, if you bee one with them (as
you affirm) wee know before hand, how our Cauſe will bee ended,
and ſee the ſcale of your equall Juſtice turned alreadie, before wee
have layd our Cauſe therein, and cannot but admire, to ſee you ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ſo contrarie to your owne received principles: For you
know not how to finde Chriſt as a Ruling and teaching Elder
both in one perſon, therfore he is not Complete amongſt you by
your owne law, except in ſeverall perſons, and you may thank tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
elſe you know no more how to finde both a king and a
prieſt in him, and yet in your way of making tender of your Juſtice
unto us you know how to become one with our adverſaries (ſo) as
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116142:14"/>
if wee deale with them, wee deale with you, and if wee have to doe
with you, wee have to doe with them alſo, yea further, wee know,
that the chiefe amongſt you, have profeſſed wee are not worthy to

ſee the place of our abode any more; Now that they have brooded
upon their law, to take away life, they muſt much more bring it up,
in taking away all means of life, Witnes our prohibition, that no
powder ſhould be ſould unto us for our money, and that in a time
when you could not thinke your ſelves ſafe, in all your owne, ſelf
proviſion and worldly furniture, except you diſarmed a company
of poor Indians, whom <hi>Aaron</hi> your Leviticall Sacrificer hath made
Naked, as hee doth all thoſe which triumph in a Calf, though the
moſt coſtly and beautifull, that the Jewells and eare-rings of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
either in Language, or art, can poſſibly bring forth: your
owne amazements upon meer Rumors, may teſtifie the truth hereof;
ſo then; wee are Judged by your law before our Cauſe bee hard, or
our ſelves brought forth under the liberties of it, which thing is
well pleaſing unto us, to have our Condition conformed unto
<hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God, who was dead in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> account, before he
was brought forth, and ſo it was with Chriſt our lord, in the dayes
of <hi>Herod</hi> alſo, who is our life (at which you ſtrike) and makes
all things, yea, Death it ſelf, lively, and advantagious unto us.</p>
            <p>Wee cannot but wonder, that you ſhould read the Scripture, and
not finde them fulfilled, in, and amongſt your ſelves, when as they
appeare ſo apparantly, that he that runs may read them: what think
you of <hi>Herod,</hi> when the Lord had delivered <hi>Peter</hi> out of priſon, and
releaſed him of thoſe bonds, and brought him from that thraldom,
which he had ſo Cruelly impoſed upon him, to gaine the favour of
the Jewes, and that by a power ſupereminent, tranſcending the
bounds of his authoritie, and by a wiſdom ſurpaſſing the Depth of
his Counſell, and policie, to fynd out, together with his ſouldiers
and Champions, he preſently goes downe to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>

or hath a ſecret grudg or perturbation of mind, manifeſted in an

of power and policie, to ſubject the word of God in the meſſinger

with all egarneſſe to make himſelf a god, by Raigning over the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116142:15"/>
and eſtates of men; yea, though they be but ſuch, as <hi>Tyrus</hi> and

to his affectionate and politicall project, he ſitting uppon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

this is the ordinance of god and not of man, immediately the angel
of the Lord ſmites him, and hee that ever acknowledged himſelf, to

Shame and Contempt of the people, ſhall (thorow that angell of

            <p>Lend your eye yet farther, to parallell your practiſe perſonated

            <p>Wee demand, what think you of thoſe two witneſſes, prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Sackcloth, a thouſand two hundreth and threeſcore Dayes:
thoſe two olive trees, and two candleſtickes, ſtanding before the God
of the earth? are theſe guiltie and vile perſons, out of whoſe hands
(by the power of your miniſtries) you are delivering and releaſing
the world? then indeed are your wayes juſtifiable: But if theſe bee
the Juſt, Choſen, and peculiar friends of God, yea ſuch, as without
which, his truth and Righteouſneſſe are not juſtified, his wiſdom,
and holineſſe maintained and upheld in the world, in point of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by Chriſt, then are your wayes wicked, and to bee abhorred;
for in your profeſſed Courſe, you are they, by whom theſe are
ſlaine, and put to Death, and all your glory is to keepe their
Corpes unburied in your ſtreetes, and yet you know not what you
are doing, no more then you know what theſe witneſſes are, whom
you are altogether ignorant of, for your Libraries never ſaw them,
and you ſee not but by their eyes, for theſe are two, and never more,
nor yet leſſe, yea ever the ſame, they are olive trees, elſe no witneſſes,
and alſo Candleſticks, elſe both the former faile, yea, are not at all.
Wee muſt tell you what theſe are, elſe wee cannot declare how you
kill them, for it is not our intent to open unto you the houſe of the
treaſures, the ſilver and the gold, and the ſpices, and the precious
oyntment, nor the houſe of our armour, becauſe you take all as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116142:16"/>
execrable, and put all to a profane uſe that commeth from us; but
theſe two witneſſes are the life and death of our Lord Jeſus; or, in
the true language of heaven alſo, the ſtrength and the weakneſſe of
Chriſt, for hee was crucified through weakneſſe, but hee liveth by
the power of God: this is the word of the Lord in <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> Not
by an army, nor by power, and ſo deprives him of all ſtrength, but
by a ſpirit, that the greateſt mountaine, or loftieſt hill in the world
cannot ſtand before, but becomes a plaine, which with facility and
eaſe hee paſſeth upon; thence it is that hee doth not onely lay the
top or the head ſtone of all, but alſo the loweſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

and then onely is the voice of ſhouting heard, Grace, grace in the
houſe for ever; and then doth the day of ſmall things become the
day of joy and triumph, yea, of parting the rich ſpoiles and prey
of all the world, for then hee that doth but turn and lift up his eyes
he cannot looke beſides that great flying book of the Curſe that is
gone forth over the whole earth.</p>
            <p>Without theſe two witneſſes jointly uttering themſelves in every
particular Scripture undertaken to bee divulged by any, no evidence
nor teſtimony of God is given, or brought in at all, but a meere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
of lies for the ſoules of men to betake themſelves unto; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
theſe two pipes of the olive trees emptying themſelves into the
bowle of the candleſticks, no unction nor oyle at all is found in
them, and that being wanting, the light of the Sanctuary is gone
out; ſo that the light appearing amongſt you is onely the light of
<hi>Balaam,</hi> whoſe eye was open, which you may read either <hi>Shethum</hi>
or <hi>Sethum,</hi> for that opening is nothing elſe but the ſhutting up of the
holy things of God, ſo that in ſeeing you ſee not, but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
onely in the light of that beaſt, who puts the witneſſes to death,
as <hi>Balaam</hi> did in the ſight of that dumbe beaſt of his whoſe eyes
were opened to ſee the angel before him; ſo that while you thinke
it is our wiſdome to ſtoope unto you for light, wee never come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

Moſt impious it is to put to death two ſuch Noble witneſſes, that
have power to ſhut heaven that it raine not in the dayes of their
prophecying; to turne the waters into bloud, and to ſmite the earth
with all manner of plagues as oft as they wil, whom that ſpirit that

or containment, for the heaven of heavens cannot containe
him, yet have you not dared to graſpe and inviron that power in the
heavens, and therefore have reſolved and concluded that hee onely
rules upon the earth in theſe dayes by his Deputies, Lievtenants,
and Vicegerents, whereby you limit, and ſo deſtroy the holy One
of Iſrael; for give him that in one time, or place, which afterwards,
or elſewhere you deny him, and you make a nullity of him unto
your ſelves, and in ſo doing, you kill that other witneſſe, namely,
the death or weakneſſe of the Lord Jeſus: for you muſt have man
to bee honourable, learned, wiſe, experienced, and of good report,
elſe they may not rule among you; yea and theſe things are of
man, and by man, as appeares, in that they onely officiate ſo, as
man may diſanull and take it away againe; witneſſe your change of
officers, conſtantly ſpeaking for us herein; thus have you ſlaine
alſo the death or the weakneſſe of Chriſt, who profeſſeth himſelfe
to bee a worm and no man, the ſhame and contempt of the people;
and theſe faithfull and true witneſſes thus ſlaine, you muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
deny buriall, and keep them both in open view in your ſtreets,
or otherwiſe all your pompe and glory falls to the duſt whence it
came, and on which it feeds. Nor can you ſend your preſents one
to another of your acts of Juſtice, power to protect, wealth, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and friends wherewith you gratifie each other; and where
theſe are thus ſlaine, and their corps lie in open view, none of the
gentiles, peoples, tongues, and kindreds ſuffering their carkaſſes to
bee put in graves, there is that great City which ſpiritually is <hi>Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where our Lord is crucified; but after three dayes and an

ſtand up upon their feet to the terrour of you all: Nor doe you
thinke that wee onely inveigh againſt the great ones of this world
for thus doing, for wee know that the baſeſt peaſant hath the ſame

as your onely glory. Our Lord gives you in charge not to ſweare

with nothing but oathes in their mouthes, why doe you not bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
the ſcriptures in this point? <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It hath beene ſaid of old, Thou ſhalt not committ adultery, but
I ſay unto you, hee that looketh on a woman to luſt after her, hath
committed adultery with her in his heart already: ſo alſo it hath
beene ſayd of old, Thou ſhalt not forſweare thy ſelf, but I ſay unto
you, ſweare not at all: ſo that if it be adulterie, to looke to Iuſt, it
is alſo forſwearing a mans ſelf, to ſweare at all; if the one be adultery,
the other is perjury, if one be admitted in ſome caſes, the other alſo,
ſo that in preaching the toleration, nay the duty of an oath, you
preach the toleration, yea the duty of adulterie it ſelf; So that our
Lord plainly evinceth unto all mens conſciences, not onely the guilt
but the folly and madneſſe of the oath of man, ſhewing how farre
it is, either from inveſting into place, or demonſtrating Cauſes, ſo
that hee that concludeth upon honour, and power, received from
the oath of man, or upon knowledge and bouldneſs, to judge in
a cauſe, from that teſtimony without the which he could not have
it, is as vaine in his thoughts, as if hee ſhould herupon conclude, I
have now altered the frame of heaven, which is no leſs ſtable then
the throne of the great God, or demoliſhed the earth, which is as
firme as his foot-ſtoole for ever, or made a fraction in the orders of

or renew it with the Eagle at his pleaſure, hereby doth man (in this

            <p>So that however you boaſt of the Ordinances of God, yet he tels

you there is no more then yea, yea, and nay, nay, in them, for what
is once nay, is ever nay in the Ordination of Chriſt, and what is

a kingdome of leſſe extent hee profeſſeth not, nor can hee approve
or acknowledge any that doe, no more then light can approve of

            <p>So that hee which profeſſeth on this wiſe, it is yea, I am a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,

you tell the people, that by ſorrow, compunction, and anxiety, and
trouble of minde, they communicate in the ſufferings of Chriſt,
out of which condition their comfort is to flow, is nothing elſe
but to conclude the ſonne of God to be Belial, yea, to affirme him

the death of Chriſt, take it in this parable, verily, as farre as the
weakneſs of God is ſtronger then man.</p>
            <p>Country-men, for wee cannot but call you ſo, though wee finde
your carriage towards us to bee ſo farre worſe then theſe Indians,
wee adviſe you to take things together, and what God hath joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
let none dare to put aſunder: So that if you bee aſhamed of
the croſſe in Baptiſme, bee aſhamed of the Baptiſme alſo, for ſuch
as the croſſe is, ſuch is the Baptiſme, therefore your anceſtors goe
beyond you in that, to joyne croſſing of the aire, and ſprinkling
with the element of water together, but where ever Baptiſme ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of Chriſt is, there is the croſſe of Chriſt alſo,
they can no more bee ſeparated, then his ſcepter and kingdom can,
for where the one is, there is the other alſo, and as they are co-incident,
ſo are they co-apparant; So that if ever you ſee the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme
of Chriſt truly in uſe, and exerciſed upon any, you do as truly
ſee that party partaking and communicating with the croſſe and
ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and to ſee perſons in ſuch eſtate,
and to conclude that afterwards they may bee worthy of cenſure,
yea poſſibly unto an <hi>anathema maranatha,</hi> is nothing elſe but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a totall and finall falling away from the grace of God, as
your fathers have done before you; for no grace greater then the
croſſe of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Behold therefore you deſpiſers, the vanity and abomination of
all your baptiſmes, how prejudiciall they are to the croſſe of
Chriſt: bee aſhamed and return in time, or hee ſhall bee a ſwift wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
againſt you for ever, when your repentance ſhall come too
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116142:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
late; but you thinke the croſſe of Chriſt is not, but onely in bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the back under every burden, and cringing and crouching unto
the luſt of every man, otherwiſe his <hi>Shebett</hi> is not fit, nor ſuiteth it
at all with your Regiment, unleſſe ſo ſervile, that every man may
ſerve his owne luſts of him, to get wealth and honour, friends and
allies, by ſetting bounds and limits unto the holy Word of God;
ſome in the way of one device, and ſome according to another, and
he that will not either walk as a dumbe beaſt, (worſe then <hi>Balaams</hi>
Aſſe) and ſay nothing, or elſe give a ſenſe of the holy writings
to maintaine the deviſed platforme, if mercy muſt bee uſed, not to
hang and burn, yet baniſhment is ready waiting upon them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall you know by the Rod of his power that comes out
of <hi>Sion,</hi> that hee will bee Ruler, even in the midſt of his
enemies.</p>

               <hi>Per</hi> us whom you ſtile your neighbours of <hi>Providence,</hi> you have
ſaid it, <hi>Providence</hi> is our Hold, the neighbourhood of the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
wee profeſſe. And for the lookings on, and turnings aſide of
your Prieſts and Levites, without either unction, or bowells of

finding no remedy, doe plainly teſtifie unto all men the nature of
your travailes and neighbourhood what it is, that neither the

unto the ſoules and bodies of men, is nothing elſe but a meer device
of man, according to the ancient cuſtomes &amp; ſleights of Satan, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
himſelf into an angel of Light, to ſubject and make ſlaves
of that ſpecies or kinde that God hath honoured with his owne
Image, read <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. Chap. wherein (if it be not like <hi>Lots</hi> love unto
the <hi>Sodomites</hi>) you may ſee, the viſage or countenance of the State,
for wee know the ſound of all the muſick, from the higheſt note
of wind-inſtruments, ſounding, or ſet up by the breath or voices
of men, (to have dominion and rule as though there were no God
in heaven or in earth but they, to doe right unto the ſonnes of
men) unto the loweſt tones of the ſtringed inſtruments, ſubjecting
themſelves to hand or skill of the deviſed miniſtrations of men,
as though God had made man to bee a vaſſall to his owne ſpecies or
kinde, for hee may as well bee a ſlave to his belly, and make it his
God, as to any thing that man can bring forth, yea, even in his
beſt perfection, who can lay claime to no title or terme of honour
but what the duſt, rottenneſſe, and putrefaction can affoord, for
that of right belongeth ſolely to our Lord Chriſt. Woe therefore
unto the world, becauſe of the Idols thereof; for Idols muſt needs
be ſet up, but woe unto them by whom they are erected.</p>
               <p>Out of the aboveſaid principles, which is the kindome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and of the devill; you have writ another Note unto us, to
adde to your former pride and folly, telling us againe, you have
taken <hi>Pumham,</hi> with others into your Juriſdiction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that upon good grounds (as you ſay:) you might have
done well to have proved your ſelfe Chriſtians, before you had min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
your ſelves with the heathen, that ſo your children might
have knowne how to put a diſtinction betwixt yours and them in
after times, but wee perceive that to bee too hard a worke for your
ſelves to performe, even in time preſent. But if you will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
Juſtice and Government with that Indian, wee adviſe you to
keep him amongſt your ſelves, where hee, and you may performe
that worthy worke: Yet upon a better ground, wee can informe
you, that hee may not expect former curteſies from us, for now by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:116142:21"/>
your Note, wee are reſolved of his breach of Covenant with us, in
this his ſeeking and ſubjection unto you, which formerly hee hath
alwayes denyed; let him and you know therefore, that hee is to
make other proviſion for his planting of corne hereafter, than up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Mſhawomet,</hi> for wee will not harbour amongſt us any ſuch
fawning, lying, and cadaverous perſon as hee is, after knowledge
of him, as now in part you have given unto us, onely hee ſhall have
liberty ſufficient to take away his corne, habitation, or any of his
implements, ſo be it hee paſſe away in peace and quiet, which might
in no caſe bee admitted, if it were ſo that wee lived by blood, as
you doe, either through inciſion of the noſe, diviſion of the eare
from the head, ſtigmatize upon the back, ſuffocation of the veines,
through extremity of cold, by your baniſhments in the winter, or
ſtraugled in the fleſh with a halter. But we know our courſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
the kingdome of God and his righteouſneſſe, renouncing
that of darkneſſe and the devill, wherein you delight to truſt, for
without the practiſe of theſe things, you cannot kiſſe your hand,
bleſſe the Idol, nor profeſſe your vowes and offerings to bee paid
and performed. O yee generation of vipers, who hath fore-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
you, or fore-ſtalled your mindes with this, but Satan himſelfe,
that the practice of theſe things is to fly from the wrath to come;
Whereas the very exerciſe and performance of them, is nothing elſe
but the vengeance and wrath of God upon you already, in that
mankind, ſo harmonically made in the Image of God, is in the
exerciſes of the kingdome, become the torturer and tormentor, yea
the executioner of it ſelfe, whilſt thoſe of you that are of the ſame
ſtock and ſtem, worke out, yea, and that curiouſly, through the
law of your mindes, the death and deſtruction of one another;
when as, in the meane time, the ſame nature or ſubſiſtance, in the
way of our Lord Jeſus, ſaves both it ſelfe and others. You tell
us of complaints made by the Indians, of unjuſt dealings and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
done unto them, why doe they not make them knowne to us,
they never complained to us of any thing done unto this day, but
they had ſatisfaction to the full, according to their owne minde, for
oft wee know, in what they expreſſe unto us, although our wrongs
inſufferable done by them lie ſtill in the deck, for wee know
very well, wee have plenty of cauſeleſſe adverſaries, wanting no
malice that Satan can inject, therefore wee ſuffer much, that in the
perfection and heighth of their plots, they may receive the greater
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116142:22"/>
rebuke and ſhame for their baſeneſſe, in the eies of all the world.</p>
               <p>To which end wee have not onely committed our condition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
writings, but them alſo into the hands and cuſtody of ſuch
friends, from whom they ſhall not bee taken by any, or by all the
governments of this Country, as formerly they have beene, that ſo
our wrongs might not appeare; therefore never picke a quarrell
againſt us in theſe things, for wee know all your ſtiles and devices,
that being you now want ſuch as old malicious <hi>Arnauld,</hi> one of
your low ſtringed inſtruments, to exerciſe his fidle amongſt us, and
wee are void of your benediction alſo, ſprung out of the ſame ſtock
to make rents and diviſions for you to enter to gaine honour unto
your ſelves in having patients to heale, though they lie never ſo
long under your hands, your chirurgerie muſt bee thought never
the worſe. Wanting theſe or ſuch like of the Engliſh, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
the liberties, God hath given us into your hands, now you
worke by your coadjutors, theſe accurſed Indians; but you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in us, we are not a Cope fitted for your ſo eager appetite, no
otherwiſe, then if you take it downe it ſhall prove unto you a Cope

that <hi>Myantonimo,</hi> one of the <hi>Sachims,</hi> of whom wee bought it,
ſhould loſe his head for ſelling his right thereof to us.</p>
               <p>As alſo a miniſter affirmed that Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> ſhould ſay to him,
that wee ſhould either bee ſubjected unto you, or elſe removed

               <p>For wee are reſolved, that according as you put forth your ſelves

you put forth your hand to us as country-men, ours are in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

ſpeedily kindled.</p>
               <p>For your purſuite of us, ſtill, to come your Courts, to receive

ſince our comming into this Country, you have beene the violent
agents, and wee the patients. To feare therefore to come amongſt
you as ſuch as have done wrong, the cauſe vaniſheth in us, ſo muſt the

               <p>Alſo the earth is the Lords and the fullneſſe thereof, and when,
and where hee ſhall call wee will goe, but not at the will and luſt of
ſorry men to play their parts with us at their pleaſure, as formerly
they have done, and as it is apparant you deſire to doe, for if your
luſts prevailed not over you in that kinde, you might well thinke
that wee have better employments then to trot to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>
upon the report of a lying Indian, or Engliſh either, as your factors

               <p>But know this Oyee—that ſo long as wee behave our ſelves as
men, <hi>walking in the name of our God,</hi> where ever wee have occaſion

nor ſhall wee faile through God, to give teſtimony even in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of the hope that is in us, whether his queſtion may concerne
the rice or ſucceſſion either of Prieſt or Peere. In the meane time
we ſit in ſafety under the cloudy pillar, while the Nations roare

and conjectures, as all the fathers have done before you, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viners
and Necromancers of the world, who are gone to their owne

of things as they are indeed and ſhall remaine and abide
as a law firme and ſtable forever, wee ſay and can make it good,
you know nothing at all, therefore ſuch as can delight themſelves
in preaching, profeſſing, and executing of ſuch things, as muſt end
as the brute beaſts doe, nay take them away for preſent and they
have loſt their honour, religion, as alſo their God; let ſuch wee
ſay, know themſelves to bee that beaſt and falſe prophet, no man of
God at all. In the meane time wee looke not on the things that
are ſeene, but on the things that are not ſeene, knowing the one are
temporary, the other eternall. Nor doe wee thinke the better of
any man for being inveſted into places or things that will in time
waxe old as doth a garment, neither judge we the worſe of any man
for the want of them: for if we ſhould we muſt condemne the Lord
Chriſt, as ſo many doe at this day.</p>
               <p>Wee demand when wee may expect ſome of you to come to us,
to anſwer and give ſatisfaction for ſome of theſe foule and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
wrongs you have done, not to the Indians, but to us your
country-men: not to bring in a Catalogue, as we might, take this
one particular abuſe you are now acting; in that you abet, and
backe theſe baſe Indians to abuſe us. Indeed <hi>Pumham</hi> is an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
perſon, as becomes a Prince of his profeſſion, for having crept
into one of our neighbours houſes, in the abſence of the people, and
felloniouſly rifled the ſame, hee was taken comming out againe at
the Chimney-top: <hi>Soccononoco</hi> alſo hath entred in like manner into
one of our houſes with divers of his companions, and breaking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
a cheſt, did ſteale out divers parcels of goods, ſome part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
as ſome of his companions have affirmed, are in his cuſtody at

your proceedings with theſe perſons, by whom you are ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably

them; wee could tell you alſo that it is nothing with theſe fellowes
to ſend our cattle out of the woods with arrowes in their ſides, as
at this preſent it appeares in one even now ſo come home, and it is
well they come home at all, for ſometimes their wigwams can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, and wee have nothing of them at all; yea they can do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere
over our wives and children in our houſes, when wee are
abroad about our neceſſary occaſions, ſometimes throwing ſtones,
to the endangering of their lives, and ſometimes violently taking
our goods, making us to runne for it if wee will have it, and If wee
ſpeake to them to amend their manners, they can preſently vaunt
it out, that the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> is all one with them, let the Villanie
they doe bee what it will, they thinke themſelves ſecure, for they
looke to bee upheld by you in whatever they doe, if you bee ſtronger
then them which they have to deale withall, and they looke with
the ſame eye your ſelves doe, thinking the multitude will beare
downe all, and perſwade themſelves (as well as they may) that you
tolerate and maintaine them in other of their daily practices, as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Sabbath-breaking, taking of many wives, groſſe whoredomes,
and fornications, ſo you will doe alſo, in their ſtealing, abuſing of
our Children, and the like, for you have your diligent ledgers
amongſt them that inculcate daily upon this, how hatefull wee are
unto you, calling us by other names of their owne deviſing, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them in hand, wee are not Engliſh men, and therefore the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of envy of all that are about us, and that if wee have any thing
to doe with you, the very naming our perſons ſhall caſt our caſe bee
it what it will, as it is too evident by the caſe depending betweene
<hi>William Arnauld</hi> and <hi>John Warner,</hi> that no ſooner was the name of
Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> mentioned amongſt you, but Mr. <hi>Dudley</hi> diſdainefully
asking, is this one, joyned to <hi>Gorton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> unjuſtly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame ſpeech, refuſed the oath of the witneſſe calling him
knight of the poſt: are theſe the wayes and perſons you trade by

Lord ſhall lay ſuch honour in the duſt, and bow downe your backes
with ſhame and ſorrow to the grave, and declare ſuch to bee Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatiſers

ſuch kinde of labours, no more then the beſt of you in former times

of your Magicians, which doth make mad and drunke ſo many in

ſo can it heale and pacifie the conſciences at preſent, but the leaſt

then you did to yours. The Lord hath added one to our
hands, in the very concluſion of it, in that effuſion of bloud, and
horrible Maſſacre, now made at the Dutch plantation, of our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Country-men, women, and children, which is nothing elſe,
but the compleate figure in a ſhort epitomie of what wee have writ,
ſummed up in one entire act, and leſt you ſhould make it part of
your juſtification, as you do all ſuch like acts, provided they bee not
upon your owne backes, concluding them to be greater ſinners then

For wee aske you who was the cauſe of Miſtreſſe <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> her
departure from amongſt you, was it voluntarie? No, ſhee changed
her phraſes according to the dictates of your tutors, and confeſſed
her miſtakes, that ſo ſhee might give you content to abide amongſt
you, yet did you expell her and caſt her away; no leſſe are you the
originall of her removall from <hi>Aquethneck,</hi> for when ſhee ſaw her
children could not come downe amongſt you, no not to conferre
with you in your own way of brotherhood; but be clapt up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by ſo long impriſonment, rumors alſo being noiſed, that
the Iſland ſhould bee brought under your Government, which if it
ſhould, ſhee was fearefull of their lives, or elſe to act againſt the
plaine verdict of their owne conſcience, having had ſo great and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
proofe of your dealings before, as alſo the Iſland being at
ſuch diviſions within it ſelfe, ſome earneſtly deſiring it ſhould
bee delivered into your hands, profeſſing their unity with you, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
denyed it, profeſſing their diſſent and diviſion from you,
though for what themſelves know not, but onely their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
pride to exerciſe the like tyranny.</p>
               <p>From theſe and ſuch like workings having their originall in
you, ſhee gathered unto her ſelfe and tooke up this fiction, (with
the reſt of her friends) that the Dutch plantation was the Citie of
refuge, as ſhee had gathered like things from your doctrines before,
when ſhe ſeemed to hold out ſome certaine glimpſes or glances of
light, more then appeared elſewhere whilſt there was ſuch to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, in whom there might bee ſome hope to exalt the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof, higher then could bee expected from others, but
you know very well you could never reſt nor bee at quiet, till you
had put it under a Buſhell, <hi>ideſt,</hi> bounded and meaſured the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and immenſe word of God, according to your owne ſhallow,
humane, and carnall capacities, which, howſoever may get the
higheſt ſeates in your Synagogues, Synods, and Jewiſh Synedrions,
yet ſhall it never enter into the kingdome of God to be a doore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
there. Do not therefore beguile your ſelves in crying out
againſt the errours of thoſe ſo miſerably falne, for they are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things which they held but branches of theſame root your ſelves
ſo ſtoutly ſtand upon, but know this that now the axe is laid to the
root of the tree, whereof you are a part, and every tree that brings

downe, and caſt it into the fire: Neither doe you fill up your
ſpeeches or tales, (wee meane your Sermons) but that wee affect
not the Idolizing of words, no more then of perſons or places.
For your ſelves know the word is no more but a bruit or talke, as
you know alſo your great and terrible word Magiſtrate, is no more
in its originall, then Maſterly, or Maſterleſſe, which hath no great
luſtre in our ordinary acceptation. Therefore wee looke to finde
and injoy the ſubſtance, and let the ceremony of theſe things,
like vapour vaniſh away, though they gather themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
clouds, without any water at all in them, the Lord is in the mean
time a dew unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and makes him to grow like a lillie, caſting
out his roots and branches as <hi>Lebanon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſay, fill not up your talk as your manner is, crying, that ſhee

(making no more of Chriſt but a ſemblance and ſhadow, as

in open Court that as the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> was Chriſt, (<q rend="inline margQuotes">"for

deny Chriſt to dye actually onely when crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi>
becauſe man ſinned actually (which they make to be Chriſts death)
long before; meane while the reader may take notice with a holy
aſtoniſhment and horrour of the heavy curſe of God in blinding
theſe bold men with ſuch a palpable and groſſe ſpirit of deluſion

               <p>Now ſome of theſe blaſphemies might have beene the better borne

               <p>THE reaſon wherefore nothing is anſwered to the great charge

already by a former treatiſe printed: but more eſpecially becauſe

               <p>But ſince by courſe thou art next to caſt thine eye Gentle Reader
upon the ſumme of a Preſentment which the Court at <hi>Road Iland</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
from their Grand Jewry being preſent when <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> had
ſo much abuſed their Government in the face of the Country, yea in
open Court, their owne eyes and eares bearing witneſſe thereunto,
they I ſay preſented theſe abuſes to the Court, as ſuch which they
conceived ought not to bee borne without ruine to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore beſought the bench to thinke of ſome one pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for examples ſake as well as otherwiſe to bee inflicted on
the Delinquent.</p>
               <p>And therefore that thou maiſt ſee the occaſion thereof, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
that an ancient woman having a Cow going in the field where
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:116142:33"/>
                  <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> had ſome land. This woman fetching out her Cow,
<hi>Gortons</hi> ſervant maid fell violently upon the woman beating and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly
abuſing her by tearing her haire about her, whereupon
the old woman complaining to the Deputy Governour of the place,
hee ſendeth for the maid, and upon hearing the cauſe, bound her
over to the Court. The time being come and the Court ſet, <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
appeares himſelfe in the defence of his maid, and would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
his maid to appeare or make anſwer, but ſaid expreſly ſhe ſhould
not appeare, and that if they had any thing againſt her they ſhould
proceed with him. And though hee was lovingly diſſwaded by
ſome of the Bench not to engage himſelfe but let his maid appeare,
yet hee refuſed: but when hee could not bee prevailed with, the
action was called and witneſſes produced, ſworne, and examined:
which being done, hee moved for another witneſſe to bee called,
which hee perſwaded himſelfe and the Bench was an honeſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and would ſpeake the truth. Now ſhee being ſworne, ſaid,
Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> I can ſpeake nothing will helpe your maid. And indeed
her whole teſtimony was againſt her and for the old womans cauſe,
whereupon hee openly ſaid, Take heed thou wicked woman, the
earth doth not open and ſwallow thee up. And then hee demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Court if hee ſhould have equity and juſtice in his cauſe or
no? To which was anſwered, if he had either plea or evidence to
produce in his maids cauſe it ſhould be heard. Then hee nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one <hi>Weekes</hi> who could ſay ſomething to it. <hi>Weekes</hi> was called
and required to take his oath before hee ſpake; at which <hi>Gorton</hi>
and <hi>Weekes</hi> both of them jeered and laughed and told the Court they
were skilled in Idols, and that was one, and ſtood ſtoutly a long time
to make it good. Hereupon ſome of the Court put him in mind how
they had forewarned him of ſuch carriages fearing he would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſome extreames. At length the Governour gathering up the
ſumme of what was witneſſed, commends it to the Jewry. At which
time <hi>Gorton</hi> ſaid, the Court had perverted Juſtice and wreſted the
witneſſes, with very many high and reproachfull termes; and in
the midſt of his violence throwing his hands about, hee touched the
Deputy Governour with his handkerchiefe buttons about his
eares (who it ſeemes ſate at a Table with his backe towards him)
whereupon the Deputy ſaid, what will you fall about my eares? To
which <hi>Gorton</hi> anſwered I know not whether you have any eares or
no? and if you have, I know not where they ſtand; but I will not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:116142:33"/>
touch them with a paire of Tongues. The Governour often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon the Jewry to attend the Cauſe, was as often interrupted
by him. Whereupon many of their Freemen being preſent, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the Court they would not ſuffer ſuch inſolencies, profeſſing they
were troubled the Court had borne with them ſo long. For which
in briefe, hee was committed, but when the Governour bade the
Marſhall take him away; hee bade take away <hi>Coddington,</hi> which
was their Governours name: a thing I thought meet to explaine, leſt
thou ſhouldſt not underſtand it by the Heads of the Preſentment
here following, abuſing all and every particular of the Magiſtrates
with opprobrious terms. But note when hee was committed upon
his mutinous and ſeditious ſpeeches, <hi>Weekes, Holden, &amp;c.</hi> his abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
ſtopped the way with ſuch inſolency, as the Governour was
forced to riſe from the Bench, to helpe forward the Command
with his perſon, in clearing the way, put <hi>Weekes</hi> in the ſtocks, and
was forced to command a guard of armed men to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and the peace of the place: And this they did becauſe of
ſome fore-going jealouſies; and now taking occaſion to ſearch the
houſes of that party that adhered to him, they found many of
their peeces laden with bullet: and by meanes hereof they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to continue their guard, whilſt upon their baniſhment they were
forced from the Iſland.</p>
               <p>And however it were enough for a Book alone to relate all the
particulars of his inſolent carriage, yet take notice onely of two
or three particulars: 1 When hee was cenſured to bee whipt and
baniſhed, he appealed to <hi>England;</hi> they asked to whom? Hee ſaid
with a loud voice, <hi>To King Charles.</hi> They told him, hee ſhould
firſt have his puniſhment, and then afterwards hee might complain.
To which hee replyed, take notice <hi>I appeale to King Charles, Calo,</hi>
or <hi>Selah;</hi> the party who was preſent told mee hee could not tell
which, but that word was ſpoken with an extraordinary high
and loud voice.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing to be obſerved, was, that after hee had been ſo
deſervedly whipt, ſome of his faction ſaid, Now Chriſt Jeſus had
ſuffered.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, although the weather was very cold, the Governour
going away after execution of Juſtice upon him, yet he ran a good
way after the Governour, drawing a chaine after one of his legs,
the upper part of his body being ſtill naked, and told him, He had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:116142:34"/>
but lent him this, and hee ſhould ſurely have it again. All this I
had from a man of very good repute, who then lived with them,
and was an eye and eare witneſſe to all theſe proceedings.</p>
               <p>In the next place take notice good Reader, that when hee went
from hence well whipt, as before, and entred upon his baniſhment,
the place hee went to (in a ſharpe ſeaſon) was a Town called <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
where Mr. <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> &amp; divers others lived, who in regard
of the ſeaſon, entertained them with much humane curteſie, but
the <hi>Gortonians</hi> anſwered all like <hi>Aeſops</hi> ſnake, as thou maiſt read
by the ſeverall Letters of the chief Inhabitants of that place, by
a notorious faction there alſo by them raiſed, to the great diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

of our Townſmen which were in peaceable Covenants with us,
which now by their declamations doe cut themſelves off from us,

wee can gather, to have no manner of honeſt order, or government
either over them or amongſt them, as their writings, words, and

courſes. Yet in briefe to commit ſome few of them to your
moderate Judgements, leſt wee our ſelves ſhould bee deemed ſome
way blinded in the occurrences of things, here is a true Copy of
their Writing incloſed, which <hi>Francis Weſton</hi> gave us the 13. of
this preſent Moneth, they having alſo ſet up a Copy of the ſame
on a tree in the ſtreet, in ſtead of ſatisfaction for fifteene pounds,
which by way of arbitration of eight men orderly choſen, and
all cauſes and reaſons that could bee found, daily and truly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and conſidered jointly together, when hee the ſaid <hi>Francis
Weſton</hi> was found liable to pay, or make ſatisfaction in Cattle or
Commodities, but on the 15. of this preſent moneth, when wee
went orderly, openly, and in a warrantable way to attach ſome of
the ſaid <hi>Francis Weſtons</hi> Cattle, to drive them to the Pound, to make
him, if it were poſſible, to make ſatisfaction: which <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi>
and his company getting notice of, came and quarrelled with us
in the ſtreet, and made a tumultuons Hubbub; and although for our
parts wee had before-hand moſt principally armed our ſelves with
patience, peaceably to ſuffer as much injury, as could poſſibly be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

born, to avoid all ſhedding of blood, yet ſome few drops of blood
were ſhed on either ſide: And after the tumult was partly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and that we went on orderly into the Corne-field, to drive the
ſaid Cattle, the ſaid <hi>Francis Weſton</hi> came furiouſly running with a
flayle in his hand, and cryed out, Helpe Sirs, helpe ſirs, they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſteale my cattle, and ſo continued crying till <hi>Randall Holden,
John Greene,</hi> and ſome others came running and made a great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry,
and hollowing and crying, Theeves, theeves, ſtealing cattle,
ſtealing cattle, and ſo the whole number of their deſperate compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
came riotouſly running, and ſo with much ſtriving in driving,
hurried away the cattle, and then preſumptuouſly anſwered, they
had made a reſcue, and that ſuch ſhould bee their practiſe if any
men at any time, in any caſe attach any thing that is theirs. And
fully to relate the leaſt part of their ſuch like words and actions,
the time and paper would ſcarce bee profitably ſpent, neither need
wee to adviſe your diſcretions what is likely to bee the ſad events
of theſe diſorders, if their bloody currents bee not either ſtopped,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116142:36"/>
or turned ſome other way. For it is plaine to us, that if men
ſhould continue to reſiſt all manner of order, and orderly anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
one of another in different caſes, they will ſuddenly practiſe,
not onely cunningly to detaine things one from another, but, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
in publike, juſtly or unjuſtly, according to their own wills
diſorderly take what they can come by; firſt pleading neceſſity, or
to maintaine wife and family; but afterwards boldly to maintain
licentious luſt, like ſavage brute beaſts, they will put no manner of
difference between houſes, goods, lands, wives, lives, blood, nor
any thing will bee precious in their eyes: If it may therefore pleaſe
you of gentle curteſie, and for the preſervation of humanity and
mankinde, to conſider our condition, and lend us a neighbour-like

               <p>I Doe not onely approve of what my neighbours before me have
written and directed their Reaſons to a ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with us, concerning <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> and his Company: but
this much I ſay alſo, that it is evident and may eaſily bee proved,
that the ſaid <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> nor his Company are not fit perſons to
bee received in, and made members of ſuch a body, in ſo weake a
ſtate as our Town is in at preſent.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>My Reaſons are, Viz.</head>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> having ſhewed himſelfe a railing and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
perſon, not onely in and againſt thoſe ſtates of Government
from whence hee came, as is to bee proved; but alſo here in this
Towne ſince hee have ſojourned here; Witneſſe his proud chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,
and his upbraiding accuſations in his vilifying and oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious
terms of, and againſt one of our Combination moſt wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and ſhameleſly reviling him, and diſturbing of him, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with him, who was imployed and buſied in other private oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
having no juſt cauſe ſo to revile and abuſe him, ſaying alſo
to him (and that of another ſtate) in a baſe manner, they were
like ſwine that held out their Noſe to ſuck his blood, and that now
hee and the reſt of his Company would goe and wallow in it alſo;
which are Indeed words unſufferable; and alſo deſpitefully calling
him Boy, as though hee would have challenged the field of him,
in ſuch an inhumane behaviour as becomes not a man that ſhould
bee thought to be fit by any reaſonable men to be received into ſuch
a poor weak ſtate as we are in at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another of his Company, one who is much in eſteem
with him, who openly in a ſcornfull and deriding manner, ſeeing
one of the five men that was choſen by the Towne, and betruſted in
the Towne affaires, comming towards him in the ſtreet, hee asked
of one that ſtood by him, who that was; the other anſwered him,
it was one of the five men appointed for managing of our Towne
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:116142:37"/>
affaires, or the like: Yea, ſaid hee, Hee lookes like one of
the five, which words import not onely a ſcorning and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of his perſon of whom then hee ſpake, but alſo a deſpiſing and
ſcorning of our Civill State, as it were trampling it under foot,
as they had done by other States before they came hither, who
were of greater ſtrength then wee are; for which cauſe I cannot
ſee ſuch perſons to bee fit to bee received into ſuch a State as our
Towne is.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I cannot finde theſe men to bee reaſonable men in their
ſuite unto the Towne, to be received in as Townſmen, ſeeing they
have already had a plaine denyall of their requeſt, and that by the
conſent of the major part of the Towne, or very neare, &amp;c. and
are yet unanſwerable; and alſo that they ſeeing that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to our Towne, hath brought the Towne into a hurry,
almoſt the one halfe againſt the other, in which eſtate no Towne or
City can well ſtand or ſubſiſt; which declareth plainly unto us,
that their intent is not good, but that their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>bode ſo long here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, is in hope to get the victory over one part of the Town,
but ſpecially of thoſe that laid the firſt foundation of the place, and
bought it even almoſt with the loſſe of their lives, and their whole
eſtates, and afterwards to trample them under their feet, as ſome
of their words hold forth, or elſe to drive them out into the ſame
condition, to ſeek out a new <hi>Providence,</hi> and to buy it with the like
hardneſſe as they firſt bought this place; theſe, and many other
like reaſons that may be ſhewed, declare that they are not fit perſons
to be received into our meane and weake State.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and ſeeing hee who is ſo well knowne to bee the
ring-leader unto the breach of peace, that have been ſo notoriouſly
evill to bee a trouble of Civill States where hee hath lived, that are
of farre greater force then wee are of, ſpecially that State who have
their Commiſſion and Authority from the Higher Powers; what
may wee then expect if he could get himſelf in with, and amongſt ſo
many as wee ſee are daily ready to tread us under their feet, and
his, whom he cals friends, &amp;c. Surely, firſt a breach of our civill peace,
and next a ruine of all ſuch as are not of his ſide, as their daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
doth declare; <hi>Ergo,</hi> they are not fit perſons to be received into
our Towne, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it bee objected, as ſome have blaſphemouſly ſaid,
that wee are perſecutors, and doe perſecute the Saints, in not
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:116142:37"/>
receiving of them into our Towne-fellowſhip, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I anſwer, there cannot bee proved the leaſt ſhew
of any perſecution of thoſe perſons, either by us, or by any other
amongſt us to our knowledge. For 1 they have quiet abode a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, none moleſting or troubling of them, nor any thing
they have. 2 It cannot bee proved but by their owne relation, the
which hath been diſproved; that they were ſent out from thoſe
places from whence they came for Religion, neither are they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with here for any ſuch matter, but rather that they themſelves
in their bravery are more ready to meddle with others. 3 They
themſelves and others of their followers, have rather been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers
and perſecutors of the Saints of God that lived here before
they came, and doe but waite their opportunity to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
manifeſt in that they intend; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot bee truly ſaid of
any, that any perſecution is offered by us unto them, if it could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be ſaid of them that they are Saints.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be further objected, that we doe not give them the
liberty of men, neither doe wee afford them the bowells of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
to give them the meanes of livelihood amongſt us, as ſome have
ſaid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this I ſay; 1 there is no State but in the firſt place will
ſeeke to preſerve its owne ſafety and peace. 2 Wee cannot give
land to any perſon by vertue of our combination, except wee firſt
receive them into our ſtate of combination, the which wee cannot
doe with them for our owne and others peace-ſake, &amp;c. 3 Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
their neceſſity have been ſo much pleaded, it is not knowne that
ever they ſought to finde out a place where they might accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
themſelves, and live by themſelves, with their friends, and ſuch
as will follow after them, where they may uſe their liberty to live
without order or controule, and not to trouble us, that have taken
the ſame courſe as wee have done for our ſafety and peace, which
they doe not approve nor like of, but rather like beaſts in the ſhape
of men to doe what they ſhall thinke fit in their owne eyes, and
will not bee governed by any State. And ſeeing they doe but here
linger out the time in hope to get the day to make up their penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths
in advantage upon us, we have juſt cauſe to heare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
of ſo many of our Neighbors that live in the Town orderly
amongſt us, and have brought in their complaints, with many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
againſt them, and not to admit them, but anſwer them as unfit
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:116142:38"/>
perſons to bee received into our meane State, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe Reaſons and much more which have been truly
ſaid of them, doe not ſatisfie you, and the reſt of our neighbours,
but that they muſt be received into our Towne-ſtate, even unto our
utter overthrow, &amp;c. then according to the order agreed upon by
the Towne, I doe firſt offer my houſe and land within the liberty of
the Towne unto the Towne to buy it of mee, or elſe I may, and
ſhall take liberty to ſell it to whom I may for mine advantage, &amp;c.</p>

whereas hee tels us in the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> of denying <hi>cohabitation, and
of whippings, confinement, impriſonment, chaines, fines, baniſhment.</hi> I
confeſſe all theſe things befell him, and moſt juſtly: for hee was

Laſtly in this <hi>pag.</hi> hee tels us of his hardſhip divers nights together,
that himſelfe and the reſt of his mutinous companions, as <hi>Weekes,
Holden, &amp;c.</hi> endured, which was juſt with God and man, for extream
evils muſt have extreame remedies, and yet tis well knowne tis not
a full dayes journey from <hi>Roade Iſland</hi> to <hi>Providence.</hi> And whereas

what was the ground of his troubles there, that ſo all men may

refuſed, ſaying, hee had as good intereſt in the houſe as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>
had. And when hee was brought before Authority, ſtood ſtoutly
to maintaine it to our amaſement. But was ordered to depart and
provide other wayes by a time appointed. And not long after
there comming a woman of his acquaintance to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> divers

ſtood in juſtification of his practiſe and refuſed to obey the command
of the Court (who ſeconded the Governours order.) He was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
till hee could procure ſureties for his good behaviour till the
next Court which was a generall Court, and there to anſwer to this
contempt. The time being come and the Court ſet, <hi>Gorton</hi> was
called; But the Governour being wearied with ſpeech to other
cauſes, requeſted one of his Aſſiſtants who was preſent at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
and privy to the whole cauſe to declare the ſame. This
Aſſiſtant no ſooner ſtood up to ſhew the Country the cauſe of his
bonds in the great affront hee had given the Government, but <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
ſtretching out his hand towards his face ſaid with a loud voice,
<hi>If Satan will accuſe the brethren, let him come downe from Jehoſhuahs

                  </gap>and and ſtand here,</hi> And that done, in a ſeditious manner tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himſelfe to the people and ſaid, with his armes ſpread abroad;
<hi>Yee ſee good people how yee are abuſed! Stand for your liberty; And let them
not bee parties and judges,</hi> with many other opprobrious ſpeeches of
that kinde. Hereupon divers Elders of Churches being preſent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
leave of the Governour to ſpeake, complaining of his ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
carriage, and requeſted the Court not to ſuffer theſe abuſes, but to
inflict condigne puniſhment. And yet notwithſtanding all wee did
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:116142:41"/>
to him was but to take the forfeiture of his foreſaid bonds for his
good behaviour. Nay being but low and poore in his eſtate, wee
tooke not above eight or ten pounds of it, leſt it might lie too heavy
upon his wife and children. But he muſt either get new ſureties for
the behaviour till the next generall Court, or ſuch time as he departed
the Government, or lie in priſon till hee could: now hee knowing
his outragious paſſions which hee could not reſtraine, procured
ſureties, but immediately left <hi>Plimouth</hi> and went to <hi>Roade Iſland,</hi>
where upon complaint of our perſecutions hee found preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
there: yet ſoone afterward he abuſed them in a greater meaſure
and had heavier yet too light a puniſhment inflicted on him, and all
for breach of the civill peace and notorious contempt of Authority
without the leaſt mention of any points of Religion on the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
part, but as before.</p>
            <p>And whereas in <hi>pag.</hi> 4. Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> further accuſeth us that they
were deprived and taken away from their quiet poſſeſſions, &amp;c. Such
was his carriage at <hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> at his firſt ſettling as
neither of the Governments durſt admit or receive him into cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
but refuſed him as a peſt to all ſocieties. Againe in the ſame
<hi>pag.</hi> he accuſeth <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> to have denyed them to be
in our Government, <hi>but when wee perceived the place to bee a refuge for
ſuch as were oppreſſed then, &amp;c.</hi> 'Tis true that <hi>Plimouth</hi> gave way to
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> and his company to ſit downe at <hi>Providence</hi> and have
never moleſted them to this day, but refuſed <hi>Gorton</hi> and <hi>Weekes, &amp;c.</hi>
upon <hi>Weekes</hi> his ſollicitation when I was at <hi>Providence</hi> for the reaſons
before mentioned, &amp;c. And for thoſe particular relations he makes of
<hi>Robert Cole, William Arnold,</hi> and <hi>Benedict</hi> his ſonne, I wave, as
not being ſo well acquainted with their caſes, but ſee hee writes
with a venomous pen; onely take notice he would make it a great
crime in them to trade on the Sabbath (as it is) when himſelfe at
that time denyed the ſanctification of it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 5. hee complaines that powder was traded to the Indians
and denyed to them. <hi>Anſw.</hi> If it were traded to the Indians, for
my part I approve it not, it being againſt the expreſſe law of the
Country, and a large penalty annexed: but there was good reaſon
to refuſe it to them which held ſuch familiarity with Malignant
Indians eſpecially during the time of their confederacy againſt
us.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 6. he ſpeakes as if hee had beene under ſome cenſure of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:116142:41"/>
               <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> at the time of the warrant there by him ſpecified, how
truly copied I know not: but am ſure at this time he was perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
under no cenſure of theirs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 7. hee accuſeth Magiſtrates and Miniſters for bringing in
all the accuſations that came in againſt them. Who but publique per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould take notice of publique inſolencies? And as for Mr.
<hi>Collens</hi> his ſtory I am a ſtranger to, but beleeve it is miſreported as
well as others.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 8. hee manifeſts hee durſt not live under a forraigne Prince,
meaning the Dutch, having never been falſe to his King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
&amp;c. with many ignorant ſwelling words; as if it were treaſon
to ones Prince to live under a forraigne State though an Ally. And
in the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> hee would lay the death of Miſtris <hi>Hutchenſon</hi> who
was mother in law to Mr. <hi>Collens,</hi> on us: although they went from
<hi>Road Iſland</hi> which is not under the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> where ſhee had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſome yeares after her remove from the <hi>Bay,</hi> and not from the
<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to the Dutch of her owne accord where they were cut
off by the Indians.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag</hi> 9. he ſhewes how they bought lands of <hi>Myantonimo</hi> Prince
of thoſe parts. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Hee was not the Prince of that part as
was proved publiquely at <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> himſelfe being preſent. 2. He
had no proper right in it, as is ſhewed at large elſewhere.</p>
            <p>In the ſame <hi>pag.</hi> he beginneth a large letter full of railing blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
which continueth to <hi>pag.</hi> 31. and however it bee not exactly
ſet downe as it was ſent, yet I admire at Gods providence, for hee is
falne into the ſnare he laid, this being brought againſt him to accuſe
him of blaſphemy, before a Committee of Parliament, who called
in his book, and referred him to the Houſe, &amp;c. but I forbeare to ſhew
his folly here, which is referred to another place and his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
diſcovered therein.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 32. hee ſaith the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> had no
ſhew of any thing againſt them but Religion, and yet the whole
carried on in his owne way as well as what wee now print, ſhewes
it was in the right of two Indian <hi>Sachims,</hi> namely <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cononoco,</hi>
who placing themſelves under the protection of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets</hi>
complained of violence offered them by Mr. <hi>Gort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to doe them the like juſtice wee doe one to another, wherein walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the ſame rules of righteouſneſſe towards them, they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:116142:42"/>
have the leſſe cauſe to take offence at us.</p>
            <p>From <hi>pag.</hi> 33. forward, are many Letters which I cannot beleeve
al is in them, and therfore remain jealous of his ſincerity in Printing
them.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 37. hee holds forth converſion to be the ground of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> ſending to them, now to that end, ſaith hee, they ſent
a Miniſter. 'Tis true, there was a gracious young man one Mr. <hi>Joh.
Bulkley</hi> then a Student, but in no miniſtery, went to teach to the
Company they ſent to guard their owne Commiſſioners, and to
bring in <hi>Gorton</hi> if need required: but I dare not beleeve what hee
affirmes. And for the Copy of a Letter hee fathers upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
ſent by the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſet;</hi> I conclude
'tis rather ſet downe upon memory then right, becauſe of ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
I have by me to make uſe on elſewhere, which ſeeme to
hold forth the contrary, and ſo I doe not credit it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 38, &amp; 39. hee relates how their wives were frighted at
mens preſenting their muskets at them, &amp;c. and ſuffering ſuch hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
as occaſioned death, &amp;c. Which muſt alſo bee falſe, for honeſt
men have depoſed there was no ſuch preſentment, and that their
wives came freely and familiarly to them, both before and after they
were taken. So alſo hee affirmes our men would allow of no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
but private, or elſe they would diſpatch them in a quarter of an
houre, which I will never beleeve, becauſe I know the men to bee
men fearing God, and durſt not proceed as hee relateth it.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 40, &amp; 41. he alſo taxeth the Commiſſioners and ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
with breach of Covenants in time of treaty, as, <hi>breaking open
their houſes, desks, killing their cattle, &amp;c.</hi> All which is falſe, for oath
is made to the contrary, which I ſhall make uſe of before my
Lord of <hi>Warwick</hi> Governour in chiefe, and the reſt of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Committee for foraign Plantations in due time and place, that
whereas they were by agreement to have two houſes for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
being about 40 men, they made uſe of but one, nor did any of
theſe things laid to their charge.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 45. he would make <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Soconon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and was the firſt ſtirrer and contriver of this generall Plot,
that they might all joyne together to deſtroy the Engliſh; but the
<hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> refuſed to joyne with them, knowing if that were
once done, the next ruine muſt be their owne. Afterward having
ſubdued many ſmall peoples, and one as great as themſelves, and
and ſome Engliſh planting more neare then the body of our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
though without wrong to him, or any of them, hee cut off
Captaine <hi>Stone</hi> his Barke and Company, and after this killed divers
ſtragling Engliſh. This ſtirred up the Engliſh to take revenge: The
<hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus, Sachim</hi> of the <hi>Moheges</hi> ſeeing this, becauſe
it was againſt their comon Enemy, offered their ſervice to joyn with
the Engliſh: the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> did no conſiderable ſervice in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the <hi>Moheges,</hi> who did as much as could bee expected, but
the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> rather gathered up the ſpoile, to the great offence
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Moheges,</hi> ſeldome ingaging in any fight. The
Engliſh killed and deſtroyed this people utterly, ſo that thoſe that
were left remaining utterly deſerted the Countrey, and the Engliſh
wonne it, and are now poſſeſſed of it. After this victory, <hi>Myan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonimo

Covenants ran to this purpoſe, To confirme their League between
the Engliſh and them, and either to other, and to hold forth a
league of perpetuall peace between them. And in caſe any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
ſhould ariſe between theſe two Indian <hi>Sachims,</hi> or their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the party offended ſhould complaine to the Governour of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neetacut,</hi>
who was to mediate and to determine the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his two friends and their people: And in caſe the injury were
great, and the party wronging would not ſtand to the foreſaid
award and determination, then it ſhould not onely bee lawfull for
the wronged to right himſelfe by force of Armes, but for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
party alſo to aſſiſt the innocent in that kind. And to this they
all firmed as before.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nanohigganſet Sachim</hi> never regarded this Covenant, the
<hi>Mohege Sachim</hi> ever faithfully obſerved it. But <hi>Myantonimo</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nohigganſet</hi>
had thoughts now to proſecute the <hi>Pecoats</hi> deſigne, and
to deſtroy the Engliſh, (the <hi>Pecoets</hi> Nation being rooted out by
Gods juſt judgement as before) and travels farre and neare to draw
all the Indians in the Countrey into this horrid confederacy with
him; but this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> would not bee wonne, though he would have
taken his daughter in marriage, but ever acquainted the Engliſh
with his working. At length an inferiour <hi>Sachim,</hi> ſubordinate to
<hi>Nanohigganſet</hi> affronts him and his men, hee complaines to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
they ſend to this inferiour <hi>Sachim,</hi> hee ſleights their admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
goes on his courſe; whereupon the other demands leave to
make warre upon him, not requiring any aide. Still the Engliſh
forewarne the other party of the evill they were like to being upon
themſelves; till at length they profeſſe they have had peace enough, &amp;
now it is time to war. Whereupon the Engliſh give way to <hi>Vncus</hi> to
revenge himſelfe, he doth it; the other are beaten. Now <hi>Myantonimo</hi>
he prepares an Army of above 1000 men, and comes upon a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> without any reſpect to Covenants, and took <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi>
at advantage, not with above 300 men; by which meanes they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet

force, routed the other, ſlew neare upon an hundred, and forced
them to fly: But Mr. <hi>Weekes</hi> one of <hi>Samuel Gortons</hi> company (as I
am credibly informed) lending the Great <hi>Sachim</hi> a complete Armor;
and having it on in the fight, was not able to fly ſo faſt as his men,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116142:43"/>
and was taken by this meanes. Yet ſuch was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> reſpect ſtill to
the Engliſh, as hee kept him till hee ſent to the Engliſh, <hi>viz.</hi> to the
Right Worſhipfull <hi>George Fenwicke</hi> Eſquire, to know what he ſhould
doe with him, who lived next to him, Hee wiſhed him to follow
their owne Cuſtome, and to deale with him, as if hee had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
with him, or there were no Engliſh in the land to adviſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
Hereupon hee reſolved to have killed him forthwith, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Cuſtome. But no ſooner were the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> got
home, who had loſt divers Sachims, Captaines, and chiefe men in
this fight, but they ſend to Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> &amp;c. who ſent a Note to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
with a command by the bearer, that they put him not to death,
but uſe him kindly and returne him. This the Meſſenger either ſaid
or they ſuppoſed came from the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Governour, and did
much daunt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> and his men: but to cleare up all, they adviſed
with the Gent. of <hi>Coneetacut,</hi> who wiſhed him to keep him priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and to adviſe with the Commiſſioners of the United Colonies
whereof they were part, whoſe meeting would bee ere long by
courſe at the <hi>Maſſachuſets:</hi> which counſell hee followed, and entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Governour of <hi>Coneetacut (Myantonimo</hi> alſo deſiring it) to
keep him ſafe for him till then, whereupon hee was brought to
<hi>Hartford:</hi> And many gifts were ſent to the priſoner; which hee
beſtowed like himſelfe, ſome on him that took him, ſome on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus,</hi>
ſome on his wife, ſome on <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> brother being a great Captaine,
and ſome on others where he had received kindneſſes, and this was
all the ranſome was paid, there being not ſo much as a ranſome
propoſed by the <hi>Nanohigganſets,</hi> nor ſet down by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus.</hi> But hee
adviſing with the Commiſſioners, they conſidering how many ways
beſides open hoſtility he had ſought the life of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus,</hi> by poyſon,
ſecret murther, witchcraft, &amp;c. adviſed him to put him to death,
there being no ſafety for him whilſt hee lived, being ſo reſtleſſe in
his practice againſt his life; and therefore wiſhed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> to proceed
with him according to their owne Cuſtome towards priſoners of
Warre, which is to put them to death; according to which advice
he proceeded, knowing now that none of the <hi>Engl.</hi> would intercede
for him. And hereupon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> went to <hi>Hartford</hi> and demanded
his priſoner, and led him to an houſe of his owne, out of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of the Engliſh, and there killed him, where was an Engliſh
man or two by to prevent their accuſtomed cruelties, in cutting off
not onely the head and hands of their priſoners when they are
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116142:44"/>
dead, and make bracelets of the fore-joints of their fingers, &amp;c. but
to torture them whilſt living with moſt inhumane cruelties. After
this, the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> would warre upon him in revenge of his
death; wee forbade them, and at our next meeting of Commiſſioners
to conſult about the Weale publike of the United Colonies, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> pleaded they had taken a ranſome for his
life, and his life alſo, which the other denyed; Wee ſent for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and ſent to the great <hi>Sachims</hi> of <hi>Nanohigganſet</hi> to come alſo, or
appeare by Commiſſioners; but they ſent foure Commiſſioners with
full authority to treate, where we found neither ranſome, nor co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of ranſome in the leaſt meaſure. And ſo a truce was agreed on, &amp;
if <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> brake it, we were then freed from our engagement to defend
him any further, for they deſired no more: And if the <hi>Nanohiggan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets</hi>
broke it, then it ſhould be lawfull for us the United Colonies to
take part with him, &amp;c. But the truth is, though before they had
ſo neare neighbours of the Engliſh, as <hi>Gorton,</hi> &amp;c. and till <hi>Myanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo's</hi>
Government, as they were the moſt in number, and moſt
peaceable of all the <hi>Indians,</hi> yet now they were changed, as if they
had not been the people, and had their Tutors, Secretaries, and

judgement. And in <hi>pag.</hi> 48. hee is full of many ſcoffs, as if hee
and his <hi>Gortonians</hi> would not, nor did ſhoot at all, when as I
have oath to prove they ſhot alſo at the other, but the truth is, I
heard ſome ſay that their powder was ſo dampe and moiſt as they
could not without great difficulty diſcharge a peece, which I well
beleeve might bee the reaſon they ſhot no more then they did.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 49. hee chargeth Captaine <hi>Cooke</hi> with breach of Articles:
And yet I have it atteſted upon oath, that there were none agreed on;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:116142:44"/>
onely they deſired they might not goe bound; which was eaſily
aſſented to, they behaving themſelves quietly. And for their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
I never heard the number to be ſo great by farre; but asking the
Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> about them, hee profeſſed they did
not amount to halfe their charges. And if any aske by what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
they went out of their own Government to do ſuch an act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Know that his former ſeditious and turbulent carriage in all parts
where he came, as <hi>Plymouth, Roade-Iſland,</hi> a place of greateſt liberty,
<hi>Providence</hi> that place which relieved him in that his ſo great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and his ſo deſperate cloſe with ſo dangerous and potent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and at ſuch a time of Conſpiracy by the ſame Indians, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the wrongs done to the Indians, and Engliſh under the

of all Civill Government, as well as that particular, and his blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
againſt God needleſly manifeſted in his proud letters to
them, one whereof hee hath printed, and the other I have herewith
publiſhed for him. All theſe conſidered, you ſhall ſee hereby cauſe
enough, why they proceeded againſt him as a common enemy of
the Countrey. And as ſuch as one, the ſaid Commiſſioners being
then met together at <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> by courſe, for the Weale of the
whole, upon juſt complaint ordered and thought meet that the
Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> ſhould call them to accompt, and
proceed with them ſo farre as ſtood with righteouſneſſe and juſtice:
And by their declaration thou maiſt eaſily ſee they went no further,
for they refuſing ſafe conduct to come to anſwer to the matters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, forced them upon this charge needleſly, which they
made them beare part of as before. So that here's cauſe enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
blaſphemy for their proceeding with them I ſuppoſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 51. he chargeth <hi>New-Engl.</hi> Miniſters to pray in the ſtreets:
but take notice I have been there theſe 26 yeares, and better, but
never heard of ſuch a practiſe, till I now reade it in his Book.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 52. he ſaith, the Governour to ſatisfie the people, ſaid, <hi>we
were apprehended for divers groſſe opinions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> You may
ſee in the laſt Section but one there was cauſe enough. And yet for
Opinions, let mee tell you that you held, That that Image of God
after which man was created was Chriſt; and that when <hi>Adam</hi> fell
Chriſt was ſlaine, &amp;c. And as for your opinion concerning Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> by way of ſad complaint told me, you denyed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116142:45"/>
any true Churches of Chriſt to bee in the world: alſo Baptiſme it
ſelfe, and the Lords Supper, Sabbath, Magiſtracy as it was an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
uſed amongſt Chriſtians. And for the Lords Supper, that
it is but a ſpell, the Miniſters Necromancers, and the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants
drunke with the juice of the grape, &amp;c. And for this laſt
paſſage here mentioned, the Reader ſhall have it at large in a ſecond
Letter ſent by him and his companions to the Government of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> concealed by himſelf in his Book, though he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to have printed all, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In</hi> pag. 53. <hi>as he abuſeth others, ſo Mr.</hi> Cotton <hi>and Mr.</hi> Ward, <hi>in
affirming that Mr.</hi> Ward <hi>put himſelfe into a paſſion, and ſtirred up</hi>

thanks, and returned this anſwer to it</hi> verbatius: <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi>
having made mee a Margent note in the 53 <hi>page</hi> of his Booke, I hold my

any ſpeech with any priſoner at a window, nor ſhould I need it in <hi>New-England,</hi>

by the way ſo much honeſty and godlineſſe as gained my good opinion
and affection towards him: I hearing that hee was affected with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel
Gortons</hi> blaſphemous conceits and carriages, and therefore now

him in the open priſon yard, who ſhedding many teares might happily move
me to expreſſe my affection to him, which <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> calls paſſion:
After ſome debate about his new opinions, I remember I uſed a ſpeech to
him to this effect: That hee ſhould doe well and wiſely to make ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of his errours at his conſcience would permit; telling him
that Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> whom hee had ſo much reverenced in <hi>Old England,</hi>
and <hi>New,</hi> had given him a godly example in that kinde, by a publique
acknowledgement upon a ſolemne Faſt day with many teares; That in the
time when errours were ſo ſtirring, God leaving him for a time, he fell into a
ſpirituall ſlumber; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad it not been for the watchfulneſſe of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the Elders, &amp;c. hee might have ſlept on; and bleſſed God very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially
for awakening him, and was very thankefull to his Brethren, for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116142:45"/>
their watchfulneſſe over him, and faithfulneſſe towards him: wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>earers;
and therefore it would bee no ſhame for him to doe the like.</p>
            <p>Concerning Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> were I worthy, I would preſume to ſpeake
that now of him, which I have ſaid more then many times of him elſwhere,
That I hold him ſuch an eminent Worthy of Chriſt, as very few others have
attained unto him; and that I hold my ſelfe not worthy to wipe his ſlippers
for matters of grace, learning, and induſtry in the worke of God.</p>
            <p>For the Author <hi>Samuel Gorton,</hi> my ſelf and others farre more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
take him to bee a man whoſe ſpirit is ſtarke drunke with blaſphemies

            <p>Thus much of the Anſwer and teſtimony of that Reverend and

all men, by caſting mire and dirt in the faces of our beſt deſerving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 54. he accuſeth Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> for ſtirring up

from the time of their liberty to my departure from <hi>New England,</hi>
which is not much above two moneths, I have heard many preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
godly men affirme, that <hi>Sam. Gorton</hi> and his company needleſly
in their writings and conference belched out ſuch blaſphemy as
they thought God was offended with the Country for giving them
the liberty they had. And that you may the better ſee his carriage,
(it being the manner of the Countrey to let their priſoners come to
heare the Word preached) Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> &amp;c. being there after Mr.
<hi>Cotton</hi> had ended his Sermon on a Sabbath day, asked leave to ſpeake,
which Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> aſſenting to, the Governour being preſent gave
him leave, where with a loud voice before the whole Congregation
being very great, hee declared, <hi>That the Miniſtery of the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Cenſures, and other Ordinances of Religion in the hands of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
are like the ſilver Shrines of</hi> Diana <hi>in the hands of the craftſmen
of Epheſus, &amp;c.</hi> And if the truth of this be queſtioned, I have teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
upon Oath to make it good.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 55, 56, 57. many things might bee excepted againſt, as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116142:46"/>
in <hi>p.</hi> 55. his great reſpect manifeſted to that government, becauſe deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the State of <hi>England,</hi> which what it was thou maiſt largely
ſee in certaine Obſervations of a godly Divine annexed hereunto,
upon his owne two contemptuous and blaſphemous Letters, or
rather Bookes, wherein are 48 ſeverall aſperſions caſt on them.
Secondly, his appealing, <hi>pag.</hi> 56. from their Juſtice when their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
enjoynes none.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 56, &amp; 57, the Queſtions as hee hath ſet them downe, and
the relation about the time allowed him to give his anſwer; I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether he have dealt fairely therein, becauſe hee is ſo often
found faulty.</p>
            <p>To paſſe by his Anſwer, and his large explanation of himſelfe,
<hi>pag.</hi> 58. and come to 59. &amp;c. and ſo the reſt of his Anſwers to the
Queſtions to 64. I anſwer, though I know not whether hee doe
right as hee ſtates things; yet this I know, being atteſted by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
perſons, That hee then maintained, <hi>that God made man after
his owne image; and that God hath but one image, and that is Chriſt; and
this was the Incarnation of Chriſt, his exinanition by which we are ſaved.</hi>
And when it was objected, wee are not ſaved by the incarnation of
Chriſt, but by the death of Chriſt. <hi>True, ſaith hee, therefore</hi> Adam
<hi>fell, and ſo deſtroyed Gods image, and that was the death of Chriſt.</hi> When
it was objected againe, <hi>Adams</hi> fall was not our ſalvation, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,
but the death of Chriſt was our ſalvation: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Adams</hi> fall could not be the death of Chriſt. Hee would by
no meanes either revoke or explaine his ſpeech (though much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
thereunto) to agree with the principles of Chriſtian Religion.
Being further demanded what he then thought of that Chriſt in
whom we beleeve, borne of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> and who ſuffered under
<hi>Pontius Pilate?</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That that Chriſt was a ſhadow, and but
a reſemblance of what is done in mee and every true Chriſtian.</hi> And now
judge good Reader, whether this be like what hee mentioneth, or
whether it were a trifle not worthy the mentioning: But if he will
be ſo unfaithfull as to omit it, I dare not.</p>
            <p>As for his cenſure, <hi>pag.</hi> 64. I know not whether it bee right

            <p>As for his long and tedious Letter to Mr. <hi>Green,</hi> from <hi>page</hi> 66 to
74. I paſſe it by, as he ſaith Mr. <hi>Green</hi> did. But in 74. hee would

make it an aſperſion upon Mr. <hi>Endecot</hi> for ſaying <hi>that God had ſtirred
them up to goe out of their owne juriſdiction to fetch them from their owne

and yet have lived in <hi>New-England</hi> from the beginning, being
now above 26 yeares. I wiſh hee ſtudy not, nor affect theſe things,

            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 80. Hee tels a tale of a tub, of <hi>Myantonimo's</hi> being ſlain
as hee marched, which is falſe, for hee was put to death, and in an
houſe, but not upon a march. And is it to bee wondered at, that
two Engliſh were preſent to ſee the manner of their proceeding in ſo
weighty a cauſe as one Prince putting another his perfidious enemy
and captive to death, eſpecially when they were required by the
Commiſſioners to forbeare their accuſtomed torments and to give
him honourable buriall, which they did and had thanks returned
by the <hi>Nanhigganſets</hi> for thoſe particulars. Now if any would know
how it was done? It was onely at one blow with an hatchet on the
ſide of the heade as hee walked eaſily in the roome (expecting no

to this charge.</p>
            <p>To let paſſe <hi>pag.</hi> 81. what hee ſaith about <hi>Myantonimo's</hi> death
as being anſwered before, and come to <hi>pag</hi> 82. &amp;c. where he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a conſultation held amongſt the Indians to put themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſubjection of the State of <hi>England, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> Wee heard
indeed of this deſperate plot by this unfaithfull people, who had
beene in Covenant with the ſeverall Governments long before, but
never obſerved any one Article farther then it might further their
owne deſigne which was to bee abſolute Lords of the Country
though with the ruine of us all. And truly had he not publiſhed this
and the following diſcourſe wee could never have proved it though
wee heard of it both from Engliſh and Indians. And however <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antonimo</hi>
dyed, yet the plot liveth and continueth to this day. Now
though I dare not ſay, nor doe I thinke they joyne with them
in aiming at the ruine of all the Engliſh, yet they joyne with them
in many of their Councels, contrive their ſturdy anſwers by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and become their Secretaries. Who knowes not that they
cannot write? and who knowes not their owne anſwers from thoſe
that come under your hands? And if the State of <hi>England</hi> (which

then were their plot accompliſhed: for they might and would
worke freely our ruine when as wee might not take up armes againſt
them, but by vertue of warrant or writ from hence procured upon
our complaints here, which alſo would bee ſix months in ordinary
courſe in procuring and returning, when as in one of theſe all our
throates might bee cut, and thoſe hopefull beginnings ſo much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

this High Court of Parliament to take into ſerious conſideration,
and treate with their ſeverall Ambaſſadors about it, as a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
in it ſelfe, and ſuch as hath beene pernicious to French
and Dutch, and may bee deſtructive to them and us, if ſome due
courſe bee not taken. But to returne from my humble requeſt to
the State, to my anſwer to <hi>Samuel Gorton;</hi> although this be a moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
vaunt of his, yet I truſt the State will make ſuch uſe of it as
never to ſuffer this deſperate crew to live ſo neere our malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
the <hi>Nanohiganſ.</hi> and that they will not only countenance the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the <hi>Maſſachuſ.</hi> Government againſt them, but hinder the ſaid
<hi>Gortons</hi> returne thither, by forbidding him to ſet foot on that land
of <hi>New-England</hi> he hath filled with ſo many troubles in all the parts
where he hath beene.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 91. Hee taxeth <hi>Plimouth</hi> to joyne with the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to
fruſtrate their Government by vertue of their new Charter. 'Tis
true, we would have had the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> to have then ſent, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
a reaſon to the State of their proceedings, knowing as before
that Mr. <hi>Gortons</hi> journey was for evill and not for good: but they
being then taken up with more weighty concernments neglected it:
but <hi>Plimouth</hi> did then petition the right honourable <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of
<hi>Warwicke</hi> the Governour in chiefe of the Engliſh plantations in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
and the reſt of that honourable Committee joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
with him, that wee might enjoy our ancient limits of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
granted in our letters Patent, and withall ſhewed that
their Charter for the limits of it now granted, was contained
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116142:48"/>
within our line of Government: and truſt I ſhall now receive an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.
Tis true alſo that we ſent Mr. <hi>John Brown</hi> furniſhed with theſe
following inſtruction to ſignifie to all that were intereſſed in that
new erected Government as followeth by Commiſſion given at
<hi>New-Plimouth, Nov.</hi> 8. 1644.</p>
            <p>1. That a great part of their ſuppoſed Government is within the line of
the Government of <hi>New-Plimouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That wee aſſuredly knew that this ever to hee honoured Houſe of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament
would not, nor will when they ſhall know of it, take from us the moſt
ancient Plantation, any part of the line of our Government formerly granted;
it being contrary to their Principles.</p>
            <p>3. To forbid them and all and every of them to exerciſe any authority or
power of Government within the limits of out Letters Patents.</p>
            <p>4. To certifie them that <hi>Coweeſet</hi> is not onely within the ſaid limits,
but that the <hi>Sachim</hi> thereof and his ſonnes have taken protection of this our
Government. And therefore to forbid them to enter upon any part of his or
their lands without due order and leave from our Government.</p>
            <p>Now theſe inſtructions were ſigned by the Governour. And Mr.
<hi>Browne</hi> going to <hi>Roade Iſland</hi> for this end came very ſeaſonable
when a publique meeting was appointed for your new Magiſtrates
and people, (but as he reported, for a moſt vile end; <hi>viz.</hi> to take into
conſideration a new diſpoſall of the lands formerly given out, as if
ſome had too much and ſome too little, &amp; for now reſpect of perſons,
and their eſtates was to bee laid aſide.) And here note that Mr. <hi>Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Briuton, &amp;c.</hi> that we at <hi>Plimouth</hi> had ſpeciall eye to,
when wee commended them thither, abhorred their courſe, abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from their meetings, looked upon themſelves as perſons in great
danger, and bemoaned their condition to divers their friends, being
now overwhelmed with cares and feares what would bee the iſſue
of things. And note that now alſo Mr. <hi>Samuel Gorton</hi> that before
had ſuffered ſo much by authority for his evill doing, and was
come to deny it and preach againſt it, being now by theſe Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
called to place, accepts it, and became a Magiſtrate amongſt
them, &amp;c. But whereas hee intimates, as if Mr. <hi>Browne</hi> had onely
done his meſſage (according to his inſtructions) in a private way
from houſe to houſe, therein hee wrongs him: for hee did it pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely
in the place of their Aſſembly, who were ſo daunted at it as
they brake up, and did no act intended for that day, as hee rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it: but ſome would have had him impriſoned, others puniſhed,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:116142:49"/>
others ſent to the Dutch and ſo for England. Yea Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
told Mr. <hi>Brownes</hi> ſonne that his father had done that which he
deſerved to die for, and were hee in any other place it would coſt
him his life. So fit for Government were theſe men, as to judge a
peaceable claime of right without any further diſturbance or ſtirre
made ſhould thus deſerve. Neither indeed have wee further ſtirred
then as before, ever reſolving to reſt in the determination of the
right honourable the Governour in chiefe and the reſt of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Aſſiſtants of that Committee bee truſted with the affaires
of the Forraigne Engliſh Plantations, aſſuring our ſelves what ever
might proceed either from miſinformation or want of due know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
what was formerly done, would bee rectified upon the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and complaint made: Such were our thoughts of
them, and the juſtice wee expected, and ſtill hope to receive from
them. And thus much for anſwer to that complaint.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 92. He layeth another groſſe aſperſion upon us, in ſaying,
<hi>There was diſtance and alienation of affection betweene</hi> Plimouth <hi>and the</hi>
Maſſachuſets <hi>at their fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt comming, each thinking I am holier then thou:
and as if wee were now united on purpoſe to ſcatter them.</hi> The world
knowes this to bee moſt falſe. Never people agreed better, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
both religious and civill Communion with each other, and
helping and being helpfull one to another upon all occaſions: which
is ſo well knowne, as if hee had not more then ordinary boldneſſe
hee durſt not affirme it. Nor came the men of <hi>Plimouth</hi> from <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi>
as hee reporteth but <hi>Leyden,</hi> a people that many of that
Church of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> would hardly allow communion withall:
but his pen is no ſlaunder, at leaſt will not bee where this anſwer
ſhall follow it. And for his relation of the manner of the Indians
mourning for their Prince his death; Truely had hee dyed a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
death, 'tis their manner not onely ſo to mourne for their
great <hi>Sachims</hi> which are Princes, but for ordinary men, women and
children as hee well knoweth or might know.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 93. He further complaines of <hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> for
offering to goe out againſt the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> to cut them off by the
ſword. And ſo complaines alſo of Captaine <hi>Standiſh &amp;c. Anſw.</hi>
I told you before how the Commiſſioners for the United Colonies
meeting at <hi>Hartford</hi> by courſe, whoſe meeting alwayes begins the
firſt Thurſday in <hi>Septemb.</hi> ſent for both the <hi>Nanohigganſets</hi> and
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus,</hi> who appeared, and a league agreed on: but the <hi>Nanohig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:116142:49"/>
broke againe, and warred upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> needleſly. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Colonies admoniſhed them againe and againe: and after no
admonition nor perſwaſions would ſerve, wee were then forced
to call the Commiſſioners together at an extraordinary ſeaſon on
purpoſe, who finding it meet to take up Armes in the behalfe of
<hi>Vncus</hi> our Confederate, whom by the agreement of the <hi>Nanohig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſets</hi>
ſundry times, at divers meetings wee were bound, and
it was made lawfull to doe. Hereupon the Commiſſioners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
as before, ſent out their Warrants to their ſeverall
and ſpeciall Governments, and accordingly Forces were raiſed
at a dayes warning. But before this, in ſtead of hearkening
to righteous Counſell, they threatened alſo the Engliſh, ſaying,
they would make heapes of our dead bodies and cattle, as high
as their houſes, burne our habitations, make ſpoile of our
goods, and uſed our Meſſengers very diſcurteouſly, &amp;c. And
for Captaine <hi>Standiſh,</hi> this I heard him relate, that being at
the place of Rendezvouze, before the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Forces came,
obſerving that ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Providence</hi> received
the <hi>Indians</hi> into their houſes familiarly, who had put themſelves
alſo into a poſture of Armes, and the place within a mile of <hi>Secunck</hi>
or <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ehoboth</hi> where Captaine <hi>Standiſh</hi> lay; hee ſent to <hi>Providence,</hi>
and required them to lay aſide their neutrality, and either declare
themſelves on the one ſide or other: For the warre being once
begun, hee would not beare with their carriage in entertaining, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
and relieving the common enemy, but would diſarm them,
&amp;c. And whether neceſſity put him not upon this courſe, or no, let
the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>And for the five hundred pound, 'tis true their hearts fayled to
ſee <hi>Plymouth</hi> Forces appeare, and <hi>Maſſachuſ.</hi> both Horſe and Foot
upon their march on the one ſide their Countrey, under Mr. <hi>Edw.
Gibbons</hi> who was choſen Generall of the United Colonies, with
the help of <hi>Wooſamequin,</hi> whoſe conſtancy to <hi>Plymouth</hi> is wel known,
and <hi>Pumham</hi> and <hi>Socononoco</hi> with reference to <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> with all
their men, attending the Engliſh word of command. And on the
other ſide their Countrey the forces of <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

with all the ſtrength of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus,</hi> waiting but for the word from the
Commiſſioners to fall on. Now I ſay they were daunted eſpecially
becauſe it came ſo ſuddenly upon them, wanting Mr. <hi>Gorton</hi> and his
friends who were not yet come; Hereupon they reſolved to go to the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:116142:50"/>
Commiſſioners to <hi>Maſſachuſ.</hi> and compound, and did ſigne new
Articles to obſerve the peace not onely with the United Colonies
but with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus, Wooſamequin, Pumham,</hi> and <hi>Socononoco,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our Confederates, including all the Engliſh in the land, to
make ſatisfaction for wrongs to <hi>Vncus,</hi> and to pay five hundred
pounds to the united Colonies, for the charge they put us to, which
indeed would not neare make it good, if they had paid it: but as
at other times, ſo now, notwithſtanding their Hoſtages, they abuſed
us groſly, firſt ſending falſe perſons: ſecondly, breaking all other
their Covenants, and came at laſt to a reſolution, they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
give the money (which is a Beade, as current as coin in all that
part of <hi>America,</hi> of their owne making) to the <hi>Mowhakes</hi> at once, to
cut us off, then to pay it according to Covenant.</p>
            <p>And thus contrary to my reſolution, I ſee a neceſſity of more
large anſwers then I intended; and indeed otherwiſe I ſhould ſpeak
riddles, and not ſatisfie the Reader. Although were it an Hiſtory,
I have many remarkable paſſages which here for brevity ſake I muſt
omit. And if any think wee doe needleſly ingage in the troubles
betweene the <hi>Indians?</hi> 1. Let them know if wee ſhould not here
and there keepe correſpondency with ſome of them, they would
ſoone joyne all together againſt us. 2. The quarrall betweene
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> and <hi>Nanohigganſet,</hi> aroſe upon his cleaving to us: For the
great <hi>Sachim Myantonimo</hi> would have marryed <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncus</hi> daughter, and
ſince <hi>Peſſachus</hi> that ſucceeded him would have marryed <hi>Wooſamequins</hi>
daughter, and all in policy to take them off from us; ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
wee are neceſſitated to it. And 3. we are not out of hope in
time to bring them to the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by a ſmall Treatiſe of that kinde. But this one thing I deſire
the Reader to take notice of, that when that great Prince <hi>Myanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimo</hi>
hee ſo much admires, had offered violence to <hi>Wooſamequin</hi> (who
was under the protection of <hi>Plymouth</hi>) and miſſing his perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
onely with the plunder of his goods: Upon <hi>Wooſamequins</hi>
complaint to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that Government alone, it being before the
Union, ſent Captain <hi>Standiſh</hi> with a few men, not above 20. who
ſent a meſſage over the Bay of Salt water which parts <hi>Wooſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mequin</hi>
from them, <hi>Either to make reſtitution of his goods ſo injuriouſly
taken, or elſe to expect him to fetch them with a vengeance to their coſt.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they ſent over every particular that could bee demanded, even
to a woodden diſh, and ſalved up all againe; but this was before
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:116142:50"/>
any malignant Engliſh ſate down ſo neare them, and held counſell
with them, before they had violated our perſons to them, reported
us to bee baſe and low, out of favour with the King and State, &amp;c.
things very unworthy, abominable to be named, but that in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the abuſed Governments of the Country, I am forced do dang
ſuch ſtrokes at theſe proud and turbulent enemies of the Countrey.</p>
            <p>Next in <hi>pag.</hi> 94. that hee relateth of Mr. <hi>Williams; viz,</hi> the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
taking him with them that were ſent to the <hi>Nanohigganſets,</hi>
In that troubleſome time, <hi>viz. being one caſt out of the Church</hi> (Mr. Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
ſhould preach) <hi>It was all one to take counſell of a witch, and that
thoſe that did it were worthy to die.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Wilbour</hi> one of
the meſſengers <hi>was ready to die,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>for feare hee ſhould have been
hanged.</hi> This I cannot beleeve for theſe two Reaſons: 1. Becauſe
all men that know Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> know his moderation, wiſdome and
piety to bee ſuch, as ſuch an expreſſion was not like to drop from
him. 2. The ſtricteſt Government in <hi>New-Engl.</hi> that I know, takes
no advantage in the law at a mans perſon for being excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
inſomuch as if he have an office, he holds it nevertheleſſe, and
this, I know practiſed, and therefore his relation unlike. But that
the Meſſengers were directed to another for their interpreter I know,
and that ſome took offence at their practiſe I know alſo, but upon
different grounds, which I forbeare to mention, being now to
anſwer Mr. <hi>Gorton,</hi> and not Mr. <hi>Williams.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 93. which is the laſt <hi>page</hi> in his Booke that I ſhall need to
make anſwer to, and the thing hee there brings againſt us is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a doctrine one of their wives ſhould heare delivered at <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets</hi>
when ſhee came to viſit them, from <hi>Matth. 24. 29. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding
to</hi> Hebr. 12. 26, 27. briefly this doctrine there delivered,
<hi>ſhould make the doctrine of the Apoſtles and the Churches in their times to

                  </gap>. That the Miniſtery of the Apoſtles was and ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
&amp;c.</hi> which I deſire the Reader to turne to; but bee aſſured
through Gods mercy, by meanes of the late Biſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi>
perſecutions of the godly here, wee are ſo excellently furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with ſhining Lights of the Goſpel, as no ſuch blaſphemous
traſh as this could bee there delivered, and ſo many able hearers,
as if it ſhould have been delivered by any, the Lord with-drawing
his preſence from him, it would have been forthwith excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
and publiſhed to the world. But I am confident if ſuch a
thing were there heard, it was either from one of their owne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:116142:51"/>
or diſciples made by them. And therefore I will paſſe by
the anſwer alſo, as not concerning any difference between him and
us, and ſo the reſt of his writings to that end, and could wiſh that
<hi>Narciſſus</hi>-like hee were not ſo much in love with his owne ſhadow,
leſt it prove his ruine; there needing no other matter againſt him
then his owne words and writings to render him odious to the
State here, as well as to <hi>New-England</hi> from whence he came.</p>
            <p>AND now that I have finiſhed what I conceive neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Mr. <hi>Gortons</hi> ſcandalous and ſlanderous Bookes, let me
briefly anſwer ſome objections that I often meet withall againſt the
Country of <hi>New-England.</hi> The firſt that I meet with is, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the riſe and foundation of our <hi>New-England</hi> Plantations; It
being alledged (though upon a great miſtake by a late Writer) that
diviſion or diſagreement in the Church of <hi>Leyden,</hi> was the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nay cauſe of the firſt Plantation in <hi>New-England;</hi> for ſaith the
Author, or to this effect, when they could no longer agree together,
the one part went to <hi>New-England,</hi> and began the Plantation at
<hi>Plymouth,</hi> which he makes the mother, as it were, of the reſt of the
Churches, as if the foundation of our <hi>New-England</hi> Plantations
had been laid upon diviſion or ſeparation, then which nothing is
more untrue: For I perſwade my ſelfe, never people upon earth
lived more lovingly together, and parted more ſweetly then wee
the Church at <hi>Leyden</hi> did, not raſhly in a diſtracted humour, but
upon joynt and ſerious deliberation, often ſeeking the minde of
God by faſting and prayer, whoſe gracious preſence we not onely
found with us, but his bleſſing upon us from that time to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
to the indignation of our adverſaries, the admiration of
ſtrangers, and the exceeding conſolation of our ſelves, to ſee ſuch
effects of our prayers and teares before our pilgrimage here bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
And therefore briefly take notice of the true cauſe of it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that that poor perſecuted flock of Chriſt, by the malice
and power of the late Hierarchy were driven to <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
there to beare witneſſe in their practiſe to the Kingly Office of
Chriſt Jeſus in his Church: and there lived together ten yeares
under the United States, with much peace and liberty: But our
Reverend Paſtor Mr. <hi>John Robinſon</hi> of late memory, and our grave
Elder Mr. <hi>William Brewſter,</hi> (now both at reſt with the Lord) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116142:51"/>
amongſt many other inconveniences, how hard the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
was where we lived, how many ſpent their eſtate in it, and were
forced to return for <hi>England;</hi> how grievous to live from under the
protection of the State of <hi>England;</hi> how like wee were to loſe our
language, and our name of Engliſh; how little good wee did, or
were like to do to the Dutch in reforming the Sabbath; how una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there to give ſuch education to our children, as wee our ſelves
had received, &amp;c. They, I ſay, out of their Chriſtian care of the
flock of Chriſt committed to them conceived, if God would bee
pleaſed to diſcover ſome place unto us (though in <hi>America</hi>) and
give us ſo much favour with the King and State of <hi>England,</hi> as to
have their protection there, where wee might enjoy the like liberty,
and where the Lord favouring our endeavours by his bleſſing, wee
might exemplarily ſhew our tender Country-men by our example
(no leſſe burthened then our ſelves) where they might live, and
comfortably ſubſiſt and enjoy the like liberties with us, being
freed from Antichriſtian bondage, keep their names and Nation,
and not onely bee a meanes to enlarge the Dominions of our State,
but the Church of Chriſt alſo, if the Lord have a people amongſt
the Natives whither hee ſhould bring us, &amp;c. Hereby in their
grave Wiſdomes they thought wee might more glorifie God, doe
more good to our Countrey, better provide for our poſterity, and
live to be more refreſhed by our labours, then ever wee could doe in
<hi>Holland</hi> where we were.</p>
            <p>Now theſe their private thoughts upon mature deliberation
they imparted to the Brethren of the Congregation, which after
much private diſcuſſion came to publike agitation, till at the length
the Lord was ſolemnly ſought in the Congregation by faſting and
prayer to direct us, who moving our hearts more and more to the
worke, wee ſent ſome of good abilities over into <hi>England</hi> to ſee
what favour or acceptance ſuch a thing might finde with the King.
Theſe alſo found God going alongwith them, and got Sir <hi>Edwin
Sands</hi> a religious Gentleman then living, to ſtirre in it, who procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Sir <hi>Robert Nawnton</hi> then principall Secretary of State to King
<hi>James</hi> of famous memory, to move his Majeſty by a private moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to give way to ſuch a people (who could not ſo comfortably
live under the Government of another State) to enjoy their liberty
of Conſcience under his gracious protection in <hi>America,</hi> where
they would endeavour the advancement of his Majeſties Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116142:52"/>
and the enlargement of the Goſpel by all due meanes. This
his Majeſty ſaid was a good and honeſt motion, and asking what
profits might ariſe in the part wee intended (for our eye was upon
the moſt Northern parts of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irginia</hi>) 'twas anſwered, Fiſhing. To
which hee replyed with his ordinary aſſeveration, <hi>So God have my
Soule 'tis an honest Trade, 'twas the Apoſtles owne calling, &amp;c.</hi>
But afterwards he told Sir <hi>Robert Nawnton,</hi> (who took all occaſions
to further it) that we ſhould confer with the Biſhops of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
and <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c. Whereupon wee were adviſed to perſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his firſt approbation, and not to entangle our ſelves with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which cauſed our Agents to repair to the <hi>Virginia</hi> Company, who
in their Court demanded our ends of going; which being
related, they ſaid the thing was of God, and granted a large
Patent, and one of them lent us 300 <hi>l. gratis</hi> for three yeares, which
was repaid.</p>
            <p>Our Agents returning, wee further ſought the Lord by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
and ſolemn Faſt, for his gracious guidance. And hereupon
wee came to this reſolution, that it was beſt for one part of the
Church to goe at firſt and the other to ſtay, <hi>viz.</hi> the youngeſt and
ſtrongeſt part to goe. Secondly, they that went ſhould freely offer
themſelves. Thirdly, if the major part went, the Paſtor to goe with
them; if not, the Elder onely. Fourthly, if the Lord ſhould
frowne upon our proceedings, then thoſe that went to returne, and
the Brethren that remained ſtill there, to aſſiſt and bee helpfull to
them, but if God ſhould bee pleaſed to favour them that went, then
they alſo ſhould endeavour to helpe over ſuch as were poore and
ancient, and willing to come; theſe things being agreed, the major
part ſtayed, and the Paſtor with them for the preſent, but all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
(except a very few, who had rather wee would have ſtayed)
to follow after. The minor part, with Mr. <hi>Brewſter</hi> their Elder,
reſolved to enter upon this great work (but take notice the difference
of number was not great;) And when the Ship was ready to carry us
away, the Brethren that ſtayed having againe ſolemnly ſought the
Lord with us, and for us, and we further engaging our ſelves mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
as before; they, I ſay, that ſtayed at <hi>Leyden</hi> feaſted us that were
to goe at our Paſtors houſe being large, where wee refreſhed our
ſelves after our teares, with ſinging of Pſalmes, making joyfull
melody in our hearts, as well as with the voice, there being many
of the Congregation very expert in Muſick; and indeed it was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116142:52"/>
the ſweeteſt melody that ever mine eares heard. After this they
accompanyed us to <hi>Delphs Haven,</hi> where wee were to imbarque,
and there feaſted us againe; and after prayer performed by our
Paſtor, where a flood of teares was poured out, they accompanyed
us to the Ship, but were not able to ſpeake one to another for the
abundance of ſorrow to part: but wee onely going aboard (the Ship
lying to the Key) and ready to ſet ſayle, the winde being faire) wee
gave them a volley of ſmall ſhot, and three peeces of Ordinance,
and ſo lifting up our hands to each other, and our hearts for each
other to the Lord our God, we departed, and found his preſence
with us in the midſt of our manifold ſtraits hee carryed us tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And if any doubt this relation, the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as I heare, at
<hi>Delphs</hi> Haven preſerve the memory of it to this day, and will inform
them.</p>

ſtanding to the Southward for the place wee intended, wee met
with many dangers, and the Mariners put back into the Harbour
of the <hi>Cape,</hi> which was the 11. of <hi>November,</hi> 1620. where
conſidering Winter was come, the Seas dangerous, the ſeaſon
cold, the winds high, and being well furniſhed for a Plantation, we
entered upon diſcovery, and ſetled at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where God being
pleaſed to preſerve and enable us, wee that went, were at a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds charge in ſending for our Brethren that were behinde,
and in providing there for them till they could reape a crop of their
owne labours. And ſo good Reader, I have given thee a true and
faithfull account, though very briefe, of our proceedings, wherein
thou ſeeſt how a late Writer, and thoſe that informed him, have
wronged our enterpriſe. And truly what I have written, is far ſhort
of what it was, omitting for brevity ſake many circumſtances, as the
large offers the <hi>Dutch</hi> offered us, either to have removed into <hi>Zealand,</hi>
and there lived with them: or if we would go on ſuch adventures, to
goe under them to <hi>Hudſons</hi> River (where they have ſince a great
plantation, &amp;c.) and how they would freely have tranſported us,
and furniſhed every family with cattle, &amp;c. Alſo the Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
that joyned with us in this expedition, whom wee ſince
bought out, which is fitter for an Hiſtory, then an anſwer to
ſuch an Objection, (&amp;c. I truſt will be accompliſhed in good time.) By
all which the Reader may ſee there was no breach between us that
went, and the brethren that ſtayed, but ſuch love as indeed is ſeldome
found on earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:116142:53"/>
And for the many plantations that come over to us upon notice
of Gods bleſſing upon us, whereas 'tis falſly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aid, they tooke <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
for their preſident as faſt as they came. 'Tis true I confeſſe
that ſome of the chiefe of them adviſed with us (comming over
to be freed from the burthenſome ceremonies then impoſed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)
how they ſhould doe to fall upon a right platforme of
worſhip, and deſired to that end ſince God had honoured us to lay
the foundation of a Common-weale, and to ſettle a Church in it, to
ſhew them whereupon our practice was grounded; and if they
found upon due ſearch it was built upon the Word, they ſhould be
willing to take up what was of God. We accordingly ſhewed them
the Primitive practice for our warrant, taken out of the Acts of the
Apoſtles, and the Epiſtles written to the ſeverall Churches by the
ſaid Apoſtles together with the Commandements of Chriſt the
Lord in the Goſpell, and other our warrants for every particular
wee did from the booke of God. Which being by them well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſidered, they alſo entred into Covenant with God and
one with another to walke in all his wayes revealed, or as they
ſhould bee made knowne unto them, and to worſhip him according
to his will revealed in his written word onely, &amp;c. So that here
alſo thou maiſt ſee they ſet not the Church at <hi>Plimouth</hi> before them
for example, but the Primitive Churches were and are their and our
mutuall patternes and examples, which are onely worthy to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
having the bleſſed Apoſtles amongſt them which were ſent
immediately by Chriſt himſelfe and enabled and guided by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
Spirit of God. And truly this is a patterne fit to bee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of all that feare God, and no man or men to bee followed
further then they follow Chriſt and them.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly ſhewed that the foundation of our <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi>
Plantations was not laid upon Schiſme, diviſion, or Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but upon love, peace, and holineſſe; yea, ſuch love and mutuall
care of the Church of <hi>Leyden</hi> for the ſpreading of the Goſpel, the
welfare of each other, and their poſterities to ſucceeding generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as is ſeldome found on earth: And having ſhewed alſo that the
Primitive Churches are the onely pattern which the Churches of
Chriſt in <hi>New-England</hi> have in their eye, not following <hi>Luther, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin,
Knoxe, Ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

they follow Chriſt and his Apoſtles; I am earneſtly requeſted to
cleare up another groſſe miſtake which cauſed many, and ſtill doth,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:116142:53"/>
to judge the harder of <hi>New-England,</hi> and the Churches there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(ſay they) <hi>The Church of Plymouth which went firſt from Leyden,
were Schiſmaticks, Browniſts, rigid Separatiſts, &amp;c. having Mr.</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binſon
<hi>for their Paſtor, who made, and to the laſt profeſſed ſeparation from
other the Churches of Chriſt, &amp;c. And the reſt of the Churches in New-England
holding communion with that Church, are to bee reputed ſuch as
they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For anſwer to this aſperſion, Firſt, he that knew Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi>
either by his Doctrine daily taught, or hath read his Apology pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
not long before his death, or knew the practiſe of that Church
of Chriſt under his government, or was acquainted with the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
counſell he gave that part of the Church which went for <hi>New-England</hi>
at their departure and afterward, might eaſily reſolve the
doubt, and take off the aſperſion.</p>
            <p>For his Doctrine, I living three yeares under his Miniſtery, before
we began the worke of Plantation in <hi>New-England;</hi> It was alwayes
againſt ſeparation from any the Churches of Chriſt, profeſſing and
holding communion both with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Churches, yea,
tendering it to the <hi>Scots</hi> alſo, as I ſhall make appeare more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly 
anon. Ever holding forth how wary perſons ought to bee
in ſeparating from a Church, and that till Chriſt the Lord departed
wholly from it, man ought not to leave it, onely to beare witneſſe
againſt the corruption that was in it. But if any object, he ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and wrote largely againſt it; I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
hee wrote largely againſt it, but yet let me tell you, hee
allowed hearing the godly Miniſters preach and pray in the publick
Aſſemblies; yea, hee allowed private communion not onely with
them, but all that were faithfull in Chriſt Jeſus in the Kingdome
and elſewhere upon all occaſions; yea, honored them for the power
of godlineſſe above all other the profeſſors of Religion in the
world, nay, I may truly ſay, his ſpirit cleaved unto them, being ſo
well acquainted with the integrity of their hearts, and care to walke
blameleſſe in their lives, which was no ſmall motive to him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
us to remove from <hi>Holland,</hi> where wee might probably not
onely continue <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but have and maintain ſuch ſweet communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with the godly of that Nation, as through Gods great mercy we
enjoy this day.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, I confeſſe he was more rigid in his courſe and way at
firſt, then towards his latter end; for his ſtudy was peace and union
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:116142:54"/>
ſo far as might agree with faith and a good conſcience; and for ſchiſm
and diviſion, there was nothing in the world more hatefull to him:
But for the government of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it was in the
Epiſcopall way, the Liturgy and ſtinted prayers of the Church then;
yea, the conſtitution of it as Nationall, and ſo conſequently the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
communion of the unworthy with the worthy receivers of the
Lords Supper, theſe things were never approved of him, but wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
againſt to his death, and are by the Church over which he was
to this day. And if the Lord would be pleaſed to ſtir up the hearts
of thoſe, in whom (under him) the power of Reformation lies, to
reform that abuſe, that a diſtinction might once be put between the
precious and the vile, particular Churches might be gathered by the
powerfull preaching of the Word, thoſe onely admitted into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
whoſe hearts the Lord perſwades to ſubmit unto the Iron
rod of the Goſpel; O how ſweet then would the communion of the
Churches be! How thorow the Reformation! How eaſie would
the differences be reconciled between the Presbyterian and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
way! How would the God of peace which commandeth love
and good agreement ſmile upon this Nation! How would the ſubtle
underminers of it be diſappointed, and the faithfull provoked to
ſing ſongs of praiſe and thankſgiving! Nay, how would the God
of order be glorified in ſuch orderly walking of the Saints! And
as they have fought together for the liberties of the Kingdome, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
and Civill; ſo may they joyn together in the preſervation
of them (which otherwiſe, 'tis to be feared will not long continue)
and in the praiſes of our God who hath been ſo good to his poore
diſtreſſed ones, whom he hath delivered, and whom he will deliver
out of all their troubles. But I have made too great a digreſſion, and
muſt return.</p>
            <p>In the next place I ſhould ſpeak of Mr. <hi>Robinſons</hi> Apology, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the maketh a briefe defence againſt many adverſaries, &amp;c. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is both in Latine and Engliſh, of ſmall price, and eaſie to bee
had, I ſhall forbeare to write of it, and onely refer the Reader to it,
for the differences between his congregation, and other the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches.</p>
            <p>The next thing I would have the Reader take notice of, is, that
however the church of <hi>Leyden</hi> differed in ſome particulars, yet made
no Schiſme or ſeparation from the Reformed Churches, but held
communion with them occaſionally: For we ever placed a large diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:116142:54"/>
between thoſe that grounded their practiſe upon the Word of
God (tho differing from us in the expoſition or underſtanding of it)
and thoſe that hated ſuch Reformers and Reformation, and went
on in Antichriſtian oppoſition to it, and perſecution of it, as the late
Lord Biſhops did, who would not in deed and truth (whatever their
pretences were) that Chriſt ſhould rule over them. But as they often
ſtretched out their hands againſt the ſaints; ſo God hath withered
the Arm of their power, thrown them down from their high &amp; lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſeats, and ſlain the chiefe of their perſons, as well as the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
that he might become an example to all thoſe that riſe againſt
God in his Sabbath, in the preaching of his Word, in his Saints, in
the purity of his Ordinances. And I heartily deſire that others may
heare and feare withall.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was uſuall for our Members that underſtood
the language, and lived in, or occaſionally came over to <hi>London,</hi> to
communicate with them, as one <hi>John Jenny</hi> a Brewer long did, his
wife and family, &amp;c. and without any offence to the Church: So
alſo for any that had occaſion to travell into any other part of the
Netherlands they daily did the like: And our Paſtor Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> in
the time when Arminianiſme prevailed ſo much, at the requeſt of
the moſt Orthodox Divines, as <hi>Poliander, Feſtus, Homlius, &amp;c.</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
daily againſt <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> (in the Academy at <hi>Leyden</hi>) and others
the grand champions of that error, and had as good reſpect amongſt
them, as any of their own Divines; Inſomuch as when God took
him away from them and us by death, the Univerſity, and Miniſters
of the City accompanied him to his grave with all their accuſtomed
ſolemnities; bewayling the great loſſe that not onely that particular
Church had, whereof he was Paſtor; but ſome of the chief of them
ſadly affirmed, that all the Churches of Chriſt ſuſtained a loſſe by
the death of that worthy Inſtrument of the Goſpel. I could inſtance
alſo divers of their members that underſtood the Engliſh tongue, and
betook themſelves to the communion of our Church, went with us
to <hi>New-England,</hi> as <hi>Godbert Godbertſon, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, at this very inſtant,
another called <hi>Moſes Symonſon,</hi> becauſe a child of one that was in
communion with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church at <hi>Leyden,</hi> is admitted into
Church-fellowſhip at <hi>Plymouth</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and his children al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

               </gap> communion with the Church at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as ſhe came from
the <hi>French,</hi> to this day, by vertue of communion of Churches; There
is alſo one <hi>Philip Delanoy</hi> born of <hi>French</hi> parents, came to us from <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
to <hi>New-Plymouth,</hi> who comming to age of diſcerning, demanded
alſo communion with us, &amp; proving himſelf to be come of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
as were in ful communion with the <hi>French</hi> Churches, was here
upon admitted by the Church of <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and after upon his remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of habitation to <hi>Duxburrow</hi> where M. <hi>Ralph Partridge</hi> is Paſtor of
the Church; and upon Letters of recommendation from the Church
at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> hee was alſo admitted into fellowſhip with the Church
at <hi>Duxburrow,</hi> being ſix miles diſtant from <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and ſo I dare
ſay, if his occaſions lead him, may from Church to church through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>New-England.</hi> For the truth is, the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches
either of them being a people diſtinct from the world, and gathered
into an holy communion, and not Nationall Churches, nay, ſo far
from it, as I verily beleeve the ſixth perſon is not of the Church, the
difference is ſo ſmall (if moderately pondered, between them and
us) as we dare not for the world deny communion with them.</p>
            <p>And for the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> however wee have had leaſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
offered to hold communion with them; yet thus much I can
and doe affirme, that a godly Divine comming over to <hi>Leyden</hi> in
<hi>Holland,</hi> where a Booke was printed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1619. as I take it, ſhewing
the nullity of <hi>Perth</hi> Aſſembled, whom we judged to bee the Author
of it, and hidden in <hi>Holland</hi> for a ſeaſon to avoid the rage of thoſe
evill times (whoſe name I have forgotten;) This man being very
converſant with our Paſtor Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and uſing to come to hear
him on the Sabbath, after Sermon ended, the Church being to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in the Lords Supper, this Miniſter ſtood up and deſired hee
might, without offence, ſtay and ſee the manner of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and our participation in that Ordinance; To which our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor
anſwered in theſe very words, or to this effect, <hi>Reverend Sir,
you may not onely ſtay to behold us, but partake with us, if you pleaſe, for
wee acknowledge the Churches of Scotland to be the Churches of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
The Miniſter alſo replyed to this purpoſe, if not alſo in the ſame
words; <hi>That for his part bee could comfortably partake with the Church,
and willingly would, but that it is poſſible ſome of his brethren of Scotland
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:116142:56"/>
might take offence at his act;</hi> which he deſired to avoid in regard of the
opinion the Engliſh Churches which they held communion withall
had of us: However he rendered thanks to Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in that reſpect to be onely a ſpectator of us. Theſe things I was
earneſtly requeſted to publiſh to the world by ſome of the godly Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
party, who apprehend the world to bee ignorant of our
proceedings, conceiving in charity that if they had been knowne,
ſome late Writers and Preachers would never have written and ſpoke
of us as they did, and ſtill doe as they have occaſion: But what they
ignorantly judge, write, or ſpeak of us, I truſt the Lord in mercy wil
paſſe by.</p>
            <p>In the next place, for the wholſome counſell Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> gave
that part of the Church whereof he was Paſtor, at their departure
from him to begin the great worke of Plantation in <hi>New-England,</hi>
amongſt other wholſome Inſtructions and Exhortations, hee uſed
theſe expreſſions, or to the ſame purpoſe; We are now ere long to
part aſunder, and the Lord knoweth whether ever he ſhould live to
ſee our faces again: but whether the Lord had appointed it or not, he
charged us before God and his bleſſed Angels, to follow him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then he followed Chriſt. And if God ſhould reveal any thing
to us by any other inſtrument of his, to be as ready to receive it, as
ever we were to receive any truth by his Miniſtery: For he was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
confident the Lord had more truth and light yet to breake forth
out of his holy Word. He took occaſion alſo miſerably to bewaile
the ſtate and condition of the Reformed Churches, who were come
to a period in Religion, and would goe no further then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of their Reformation: As for example, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> they
could not be drawne to goe beyond what <hi>Luther</hi> ſaw, for whatever
part of Gods will he had further imparted and revealed to <hi>Calvin,</hi>
they will rather die then embrace it. And ſo alſo, ſaith he, you ſee the
<hi>Calviniſts,</hi> they ſtick where he left them: A miſery much to bee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;
For though they were precious ſhining lights in their
times, yet God had not revealed his whole will to them: And
were they now living, faith hee, they would bee as ready and
willing to embrace further light, as that they had received. Here
alſo he put us in mind of our Church-Covenant (at leaſt that part of
it) whereby wee promiſe and covenant with God and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to receive whatſoever light or truth ſhall be made known to us
from his written Word: but withall exhorted us to take heed what
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:116142:57"/>
we received for truth, and well to examine and compare, and weigh
it with other Scriptures of truth, before we received it; For, ſaith
he, <hi>It is not poſſible the Chriſtian world ſhould come to lately out of ſuch
thick Antichriſtian darkneſſe, and that full perfection of knowledge ſhould
breake forth at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing hee commended to us, was, that wee ſhould uſe
all meanes to avoid and ſhake off the name of <hi>Browniſt,</hi> being a meer
nick-name and brand to make Religion odious, and the profeſſors
of it to the Chriſtian world; and to that end, ſaid hee, I ſhould be
glad if ſome godly Miniſter would goe over with you, or come to
you, before my comming; For, ſaid hee, there will bee no difference
between the unconformable Miniſters and you, when they come
to the practiſe of the Ordinances out of the Kingdome: And ſo
adviſed us by all meanes to endeavour to cloſe with the godly party
of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and rather to ſtudy union then diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>viz.</hi> how neare we might poſſibly, without ſin cloſe with them,
then in the leaſt meaſure to affect diviſion or ſeparation from them.
And be not loath to take another Paſtor or Teacher, ſaith hee, for
that flock that hath two ſhepheards is not indangered, but ſecured
by it. Many other things there were of great and weighty conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which he commended to us, but theſe things I thought good
to relate, at the requeſt of ſome well-willers to the peace and good
agreement of the godly, (ſo diſtracted at preſent about the ſettling
of Church-government in the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi>) that ſo both
ſides may truly ſee what this poor deſpiſed Church of Chriſt now
at <hi>New-Plymouth</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> but formerly at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi>
was and is; how far they were and ſtill are from ſeparation from
the Churches of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> eſpecially thoſe that are Reformed.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, we profeſſe and deſire to practiſe a ſeparation from the
world, &amp; the works of the world, which are works of the fleſh, ſuch
as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, <hi>Epheſ. 5. 19, 20, 21. 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10, 11. and
<hi>Epheſ</hi> 2. 11, 12. And as the Churches of Chriſt are all Saints by
calling, ſo we deſire to ſee the grace of God ſhining forth, (at leaſt
ſeemingly, leaving ſecret things to God) in all we admit into church
fellowſhip with us, &amp; &amp; to keep off ſuch as openly wallow in the mire
of their ſins, that neither the holy things of God, nor the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Saints may be leavened or polluted thereby. And if any
joyning to us formerly, either when we lived at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> or
ſince we came to <hi>New-England,</hi> have with the manifeſtation of their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:116142:57"/>
faith and profeſſion of holineſſe held forth therewith ſeparation
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have divers times, both in the one
place, and the other, heard either <hi>Mr. Robinſon</hi> our Paſtor, or <hi>Mr.
Brewſter</hi> our Elder ſtop them forthwith, ſhewing them that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
no ſuch things at their hands, but only to hold forth faith
in Chriſt Jeſus, holineſſe in the feare of God, and ſubmiſſion to
every Ordinance and appointment of God, leaving the Church
of <hi>England</hi> to themſelves, and to the Lord before whom they ſhould
ſtand or fall, and to whom wee ought to pray to reforme what was
amiſſe amongſt them. Now this Reformation we have lived to ſee
performed and brought about by the mighty power of God, this
day in a good meaſure, and I hope the Lord Jeſus will perfect his
work of Reformation, till all be according to the good pleaſure of
his will. By all which I deſire the Reader to take notice of
our former and preſent practiſe notwithſtanding all the injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and ſcandalous taunting reports are paſſed on us. And if
theſe things will not ſatisfie, but wee muſt ſtill ſuffer reproach,
and others for our ſakes, becauſe they and wee thus walke,
our practiſe being for ought wee know, wholly grounded on
the written Word, without any addition or humane invention
knowne to us, taking our patterne from the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as they were regulated by the bleſſed Apoſtles in their
owne dayes, who were taught and inſtructed by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, and had the unerring and all-knowing Spirit of God
to bring to their remembrance the things they had heard: I ſay, if
wee muſt ſtill ſuffer ſuch reproach, notwithſtanding our charity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them who will not be in charity with us; Gods will be done.</p>
            <p>The next aſperſion caſt upon us, is, that we will not ſuffer any that
differ from us never ſo little to reſide or cohabite with us; no not
the Presbyterian Government which differeth ſo little from
us. To which I anſwer, our practiſe witneſſeth the contrary.
For 'tis well knowne that Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Noy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> who are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Church at <hi>Newberry</hi> are in that way and ſo knowne ſo
farre as a ſingle Congregation can bee exerciſed in it; yet never
had the leaſt moleſtation or diſturbance, and have and finde as good
reſpect from Magiſtrates and people as other Elders in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall
or Primitive way. 'Tis knowne alſo that Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi>
the Miniſter at <hi>Hengam</hi> hath declared himſelfe for that way: nay
which is more then ever I heard of the other two, hee refuſeth to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116142:58"/>
baptzie no children that are tendred to him (although this liberty
ſtands not upon a Presbyterian bottome) and yet the Civill State
never moleſted him for it: onely comming to a Synod held in the
Country the laſt yeare, which the Magiſtrates called, requeſting
the Churches to ſend their Elders and ſuch other as might bee able
to hold forth the light of God from his written word in caſe of
ſome doubts which did ariſe in the Country: I ſay hee comming
the laſt ſitting of the Aſſembly which was adjourned to the eighth of
<hi>June</hi> next, was in all meekneſſe and love requeſted to bee preſent and
hold forth his light hee went by in baptizing all that were brought
to him, hereby waving the practiſe of the Churches; which he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to take into conſideration they reſted in his anſwer. So alſo 'tis
wel known, that before theſe unhappy troubles aroſe in <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> there were divers Gentlemen of <hi>Scotland</hi> that groaned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the heavy preſſaries of thoſe times, wrote to <hi>New-England</hi> to
know whether they might freely be ſuffered to exerciſe their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall
government amongſt us. And it was anſwered affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
they might: and they ſending over a Gentleman to take
a view of ſome fit place; A River called <hi>Meromeck</hi> neare <hi>Ipſwich</hi>
and <hi>Newberry</hi> aforeſaid, was ſhewed their Agent, which he well liked,
and where wee have ſince four townes ſettled, and more may bee
for ought I know, ſo that there they might have had a compleate
Presbytery and whither they intended to have come: but meeting
with manifold croſſes being halfe Seas thorow they gave over
their intendments, and as I have heard theſe were many of the
Gentlemen that firſt fell upon the late Covenant in <hi>Scotland:</hi>
by all which will eaſily appeare how wee are here wronged by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and the harder meaſure as wee heare impoſed upon our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
for our ſakes, nay pretending our example for their preſident.
And laſt of all, not long before I came away certaine diſcontented
perſons in open Court of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> demanding that liberty,
it was freely and as openly tendred to them; ſhewing their former
practices by mee mentioned: but willed not to expect that wee
ſhould provide them Miniſters &amp;c. for the ſame, but getting ſuch
themſelves they might exerciſe the Presbyterian Government at their
libertie, walking peaceably towards us as wee truſted we ſhould doe
towards them. So that if our brethren here ſhall bee reſtrained they
walking peaceably, the example muſt not be taken from us, but ariſe
from ſome other principle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:116142:58"/>
But it will not bee objected though you deale thus with the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
way, yet you have a ſevere law againſt Anabaptiſts, yea one
was whipt at <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> for his Religion? and your law baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them? <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Government have
ſuch a law as to baniſh, but not to whip in that kinde. And certaine
men deſiring ſome mitigation of it; It was anſwered in my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
'Tis true, we have a ſevere law, but wee never did or will exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the rigour of it upon any, and have men living amongſt us, nay
ſome in our Churches of that judgement, and as long as they carry
themſelves peaceably as hitherto they doe, wee will leave them to
God, our ſelves having performed the duty of brethren to them. And
whereas there was one whipt amongſt us; 'tis true wee knew his
judgement what it was: but had hee not carried himſelfe ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly
towards the Authority God hath betruſted us with in
an high exemplary meaſure, wee had never ſo cenſured him: and
therefore he may thank himſelf who ſuffered as an evill doer in that
reſpect. But the reaſon wherefore wee are loath either to repeale
or alter the law, is, Becauſe wee would have it remaine in force to
beare witneſſe againſt their judgement and practice which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them to bee erroneous.</p>
            <p>And yet nevertheleſſe ſaid the Governour to thoſe preferred the
requeſt, you may tel our friends in <hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whither yee are ſome of
you going, ſince the motion proceedeth from ſuch as wee know
move it in love to us, wee will ſeriouſly take it into conſideration at
our next Generall Court. So that thou maiſt perceive good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the worſt is ſpoken of things in that kinde.</p>
            <p>Furthermore in the Government of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to our great griefe,
not onely the Paſtor of a Congregation waveth the adminiſtration
of baptiſme to Infants, but divers of his Congregation are fallen
with him, and yet all the meanes the civill power hath taken againſt
him and them, is to ſtirre up our Elders to give meeting and ſee if
by godly conference they may bee able to convince and reclaime
him, as in mercy once before they had done by Gods bleſſing upon
their labours. Onely at the foreſaid Synod, two were ordered to
write to him in the name of the Aſſembly, and to requeſt his preſence
at their next meeting aforeſaid to hold forth his light hee goeth by
in waving the practiſe of the Churches; with promiſe if it be light,
to walke by it: but if it appeare otherwiſe, then they truſt hee will
returne againe to the unity of practice with them. And for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:116142:59"/>
the two Governments of <hi>Coneetacut</hi> and <hi>Newhaven,</hi> if either have
any law in force againſt them, or ſo much as need of a law in that
kinde, 'tis more then I have heard on.</p>
            <p>For our parts (I mean the Churches of <hi>New-Engl.</hi>) we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
through Gods mercy, the way of God in which we walke, and
according to which wee perform our Worſhip and ſervice to Him,
concurreth with thoſe Rules our bleſſed Saviour hath left upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
by the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, and is agreeable with the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
of thoſe Primitive Churches mentioned in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by the ſame Apoſtles, as appeareth not onely in that Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
Hiſtory, but in their Epiſtles to the ſeverall Churches there
mentioned; yet nevertheleſſe if any thorow tenderneſſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
be otherwiſe minded, to ſuch wee never turn a deafe eare, nor
become rigorous, though we have the ſtreame of Authority on our
ſides. Nay, if in the uſe of all means we cannot reclaim them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>wiſdome that is from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie
to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without
hypocriſie, and the fruit of righteouſneſſe is ſowne in peace, of them that make
peace,</hi> according to <hi>James</hi> 3. 17, 18. And if any differing from us bee
anſwerable to this Rule in their lives and converſations, we do not
exerciſe the Civill ſword againſt them. But for ſuch as <hi>Gorton</hi> and
his company, whoſe wiſdome ſeems not to be from above, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in that it is <hi>full of envyings, ſtrife, confuſion,</hi> Jam. 3. 15, 16. being
therein ſuch as the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks on, <hi>v.</hi> 8. viz. <hi>earthly, ſenſuall;
devilliſh;</hi> who <hi>v. 16. deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evill of dignities.</hi> Theſe
<hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. are <hi>murmurers, complayners, walkers after their own lusts, and
their mouth ſpeaketh great ſwelling words,</hi> being <hi>clouds without water, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
about of winds, trees whoſe fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead,
plucked up by the roots, raging waves of the ſea, foaming out their owne
ſhame, wandring ſtarres, to whom</hi> (without repentance, which I much
deſire to ſee, or hear of in him, if it may ſtand with the will of God)
<hi>is reſerved the blackneſſe of darkneſſe for ever.</hi> Theſe I ſay are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with by another rule, and not to bee borne: who ſuffer as evil
doers, and area ſhame to Religion which they profeſſe in word, but
deny in their lives and converſations. Theſe every tender conſcience
abhors, and will juſtifie and aſſiſt the <hi>higher Powers God hath ordained,</hi>
againſt ſuch carnall Goſpellers, <hi>who beare not the ſword in vaine, Rom.</hi>
13. but execute Gods vengeance on ſuch: for the Civill Magiſtrate is
<hi>the Miniſter of God, a Revenger to execute wrath on him that doth evil.</hi> And
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116142:59"/>
therefore a broad difference is to be put between ſuch evill doers, and
thoſe tender conſciences who follow the light of Gods Word in
their owne perſwaſions, (though judged erroneous by the places
where they live) ſo long as their walking is anſwerable to the rules
of the Goſpel, by preſerving peace, and holding forth holineſſe in
their converſations amongſt men.</p>
            <p>Thus much I thought good to ſignifie, becauſe we of <hi>New-England</hi>
are ſaid to be ſo often propounded for an example. And if any will
take us for a preſident, I deſire they may really know what wee doe,
rather then what others ignorantly or malitiouſly report of us,
aſſuring my ſelf that none will ever be loſers by following us ſo far
as we follow Chriſt: Which that we may doe, and our poſterities
after us, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; our Father, accept in
Chriſt what is according to him, diſcover, pardon, and reform what
is amiſſe amongſt us; and guide us and them by the aſſiſtance of the
holy Ghoſt for time to come, till time ſhal be no more; that the Lord
our God may ſtill delight to dwell amongſt his Plantations and
Churches there by his gracious preſence, and may goe on bleſſing
to bleſſe them with heavenly bleſſings in theſe earthly places, that
ſo by his bleſſing they may not onely grow up to a Nation, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
exemplary for good unto others. And let all that wiſh wel to
<hi>Sion</hi> ſay <hi>Amen.</hi>
