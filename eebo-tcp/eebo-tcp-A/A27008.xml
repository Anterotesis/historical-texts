         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

REVIEW
OF THE
STATE
OF
Chriſtian's Infants.</p>
            <p>Whether they ſhould be entered in COVENANT
With God by BAPTISM, and be Viſible
Members of His CHVRCH, and have any
Covenant-Right to <hi>Pardon</hi> and Salvation?</p>
            <p>Or whether CHRIST, the Saviour of the World,
hath ſhut all Mankind out of his Viſible Kingdom,
and Covenant-Rights and Hopes, 'till they come to
Age? And whether he did ſo from the beginning of
the world, or after his Incarnation?</p>
            <p>Occaſioned by the Importunity of Mr. <hi>E. Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon,</hi>
(and of Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tombes,)</hi>
who called him to this REVIEW in order to
his RETRACTATION.</p>
            <p>An Impartial Reading is humbly requeſted, of thoſe
Diſſenters who would not be found Deſpiſers
of holy Truth, nor ſuch as judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

            <p>I Once more ſtew the World, that is is in the
power of other men, if God permit them,
to hinder us from greater ſervice to the
Church, by making things far leſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to become accidentally at that time more
neceſſary? By which kind of Impediments in
Contentious times, Satan fruſtrateth the better
deſires and deſigns of many of the Servants of
Chriſt, who would fain be better employed; yea,
and uſeth herein the ſervice of ſuch men, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
reſpects are none of his Servants. And thus,
though <hi>Scriptures</hi> be our <hi>General Rule,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God,</hi> and the great <hi>Ends</hi> of all our
life, are the Determiners of the Circumstances
of our Duties.</p>
            <p>The Cauſe of this <hi>REVIEW</hi> is a Letter of
one Mr. <hi>E. Hutchinſon,</hi> ſent me, very large in
conſiderable Oratory, to let me know his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi>
of my laſt (and former) Book of Baptiſm,
and to humble me for the great ſin of abuſing the
world with ſuch frivolous writings, which ſeem
to do ſomething, but prove nothing, and leave
Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> &amp;c. unanſwered; ſo that it is
an Anſwer that he would have: And he vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
urgeth me to Repentance and Retraction
of what I have written for Infants Church-memberſhip,
<pb facs="tcp:61144:3"/>
Covenant and Baptiſm; as did Mr.
<hi>Tombes</hi> more than once before him. Should I
Print his Letter without his conſent, perhaps he
might take it for an injury; and if he would have
it done, it's like he will do it himſelf. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it refereth to a Printed Paper of Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
againſt me, called his <hi>Third Reply,</hi> which
I never ſaw till his Letter informed me of it, I
thought that it was more than himſelf whom he
importuned me to ſatisfie.</p>
            <p>I have told him here truly, how little the
meer difference about the outward Baptiſm of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
doth abate my eſteem and love of any Godly
Peaceable men: Two ſorts of Perſons called Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts
I can live in as friendly concord with, as
with moſt I hold Communion with: Firſt, thoſe
that deny not the Covenant-Rights, and Church-Relation
of the Infants of Believers, confeſſing
them to be <hi>Holy;</hi> but only think that their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
being but the ſolemnization of their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Covenant, and the publick Inveſtiture of
them in their Relation, may, as the Coronation
of an Infant King, be deferred till they come
to ſome underſtanding; of which minde were
<hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Nazianzene.</hi> Secondly, thoſe that
being in <hi>doubt only</hi> of the Sufficiency or Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Infant-Baptiſm, do receive a ſecond or
a third Adminiſtration (as ſome Marryed by Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
lately, were marryed again by Miniſters; and
as Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> pleads for a ſecond Ordination,
<pb facs="tcp:61144:3"/>
eſpecially if Hypothetically done) to ſatisfie their
doubting Conſciences, and then live in peace,
and orderly Communion afterwards with other
Chriſtians, as knowing that in Chriſt Jeſus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circumciſion availeth, nor Uncircumſion,
but a new Creature. I ſay none of theſe ſhall be
more willing of loving Communion with others,
than I ſhall be with them.</p>
            <p>But 1. If men will deny and ſcorn our <hi>Infant-Right</hi>
in the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt,
Pardon</hi> and <hi>Salvation;</hi> and <hi>Viſible Church-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
and will ſo far deny the <hi>Kingdom and
Grace of Chriſt,</hi> as to maintain that he <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all mankind from</hi> any <hi>Viſible Right,
or Hope of Salvation till Adult,</hi> and hath given
ſuch Right no more to Chriſtian's Children than
to Heathens! And if they will make this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the meaſure of their Communion, and will
divide the Church, and Unchriſten, or Unchurch
all that are not as unthankful and injurious to
Chriſt, and to the Holy Seed as themſelves, it is
not I that ſeparate from theſe men, but they
from me, and all ſober Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And I will here add but theſe two or three
Notes to the Reader; 1. If he will peruſe two
ſhort Diſputations which I have lately publiſhed
of <hi>ORIGINAL SIN,</hi> (the Primary and Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary)
he will ſee it fully proved, that both <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi>
and by <hi>Supernatural Revelation</hi> God hath
declared ſuch an <hi>Intereſt of Parents and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:61144:4"/>
in each other,</hi> as is much of the Reaſon of
all that I here plead for: And he that will accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
obſerve the whole current of the Scripture
herein, ſhall find this <hi>Conjunct-Intereſt</hi> aſſerted
from end to end.</p>
            <p>2. I am paſt doubt that it is a principal deſign
of Satan to <hi>mortifie</hi> our <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> it ſelf,
by <hi>keeping Parents from that intelligent and
ſerious Covenanting with God,</hi> in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
dedication of their Children to him,
which the greatneſs of the work and caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth;
and to turn our very <hi>Chriſtening</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Ceremony, or lifeleſs Formality: And
it is not the leaſt part of <hi>my Non-conformity,</hi>
that I dare not deliberately profeſs <hi>my Aſſent
and Conſent,</hi> that <hi>no Parent ſhall be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Church to enter his own Child
into the Covenant of God, nor to ſpeak
one Covenanting, Promiſing, Undertaking,
nor Dedicating word;</hi> (nor muſt be <hi>urged
to be ſo much as preſent)</hi> But that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
and Godmothers;</hi> who never give us
any cauſe to believe that one of many thouſands
of them take the <hi>Child for their own,</hi> nor
ever purpoſe to <hi>Educate him,</hi> or do what <hi>there
they Vow and Covenant to do,</hi> muſt be the
<hi>only Covenanting Undertakers;</hi> and ſo that
ſo much <hi>notorious falſe Vowing to God,</hi> or
<hi>Perfidiouſneſs,</hi> muſt defile our Baptiſm: And
now come theſe Anabaptiſts, and inſtead of
<pb facs="tcp:61144:4"/>
calling the Parents to <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Holy
Fidelity</hi> in ſo great a work, they tell them that
it is none of their Duty at all.</p>
            <p>3. And how light ſoever ſome make of <hi>Unity,</hi>
I know that it's even <hi>Eſſential</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi>
As the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Timber</hi> is to
the <hi>Houſe,</hi> and of <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> to the
<hi>Kingdom;</hi> and of the ſeveral <hi>parts,</hi> to a Clock
or Watch: For the <hi>Form</hi> is Relative. And do
you think then that they befriend Christ or his
Church, who turn the Sacrament of our Union
into the occaſion of our great Diviſion? yea, and
<hi>Unchriſten and Unchurch all the Chriſtian
World in Infancy;</hi> yea, and a thouſand parts
to one of the Chriſtian Church of the <hi>Adult,</hi>
becauſe they are not Re-baptiſed at Age. Paſſion,
and Prejudice, and Partiality (when men have
eſpouſed the Intereſt of a Cauſe as the beſt and
holyest in their eyes) may make men ſwallow ſuch
things as theſe, and think that they ſerve God
in reviling all that are againſt them. Were
we agreed againſt Infants Covenant-Right, when
ſhould we ever be agreed at what Age it is that
they are to be received? and when a Childs
Profeſſion were Valid? But he that thinketh
that 1. All the Chriſtian World will ever
Unite in the Renouncing of all Infants Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Rights
and Hopes. 2. Or that <hi>without
Unity,</hi> (in the <hi>Eſſentials)</hi> or without <hi>Love
<pb facs="tcp:61144:5"/>
and Peace</hi> the Church, of Christ is in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous
State, doth not judge as I do upon the
moſt ſerious thoughts that I am able to exerciſe,
and as I doubt not but I ſhall judge to the
laſt breath, which is not like to be far off.</p>

            <p>WHen I read you general Accuſation
of my <hi>Firey diſcouraging of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
&amp;c. I began to bethink me
who they were in all my life time
that had to my face reproved me, and been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
by any unthankful paſſionate returns of
mine; and not remembring any one in my life, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
you will call my Contradicting men in diſputation
and Altercation in caſe of differences of Judgment by
that name) I did read on, in expectation of fuller
information, and I perceived that it was not <hi>any ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal
rejecting any reproof</hi> of my <hi>preſent Monitors,</hi> that
you meant, but my <hi>publiſhed Writings</hi> againſt thoſe
called Anabaptiſts. I have long had far lowder calls
than yours to <hi>Review my Life and Writings,</hi> and to
judge of them as impartially as I can. Upon the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi>
I am Conſcious, 1. That I never <hi>meddled at firſt
with Mr.</hi> Tombes, till he unavoidably conſtrained me,
by ſending thoſe whom he had prevailed with to me,
to tell me, that if <hi>I would not anſwer him, they muſt lay
their change ſo far on my refuſal to ſatisfie them.</hi> We lived
to gether till then, without any meddling with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
by me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61144:6"/>
2. I find that when he had (without my conſent)
publiſhed theſe Papers which I privately ſent him,
with his Anſwer, I gave not <hi>a word of Reply</hi> to them,
till Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> made it ſeem neceſſary to me, though
it be above 20 years ſince they were written. Surely
my <hi>ſilence</hi> was no <hi>furious Contradiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I find that when Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> publiſhed them ſo
long ago, and they have been in your own hands in
Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his Book, neither you nor others till now
that I know of, ſhewed me any ſuch fury in them.
And thoſe that I have ſpoke with ſay, that there is no
ſuch thing, but that his Reply is paſſionate, (which
I leave to others judgment that yet may read them in
his Book together.)</p>
            <p>4. I find that in 1659. when I endeavoured to
perſwade Mr. <hi>Lambe</hi> and Mr. <hi>Allen</hi> to <hi>Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi>
that I did not ſtrive againſt their <hi>Anabaptiſtry,</hi>
but only to ſatisfie them, that <hi>holding that difference,
they yet ought to ſatisfie themſelves, in that which they
took to be their Duty, and to hold loving Communion with
the Churches and Chriſtians of the other mind.</hi> And when
they had renounced their <hi>Separation,</hi> it was not I but
their <hi>own Light, Experience</hi> and <hi>Conſideration</hi> (by
what other helps I know not) that made them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their <hi>Anabaptiſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. When before that, there was a Treaty in <hi>London</hi>
for the Reconciling of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> &amp; <hi>Iudependents,</hi>
I did firſt at home to the Miniſters of <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi>
mantain by a ſet Diſputation, that it was our <hi>Duty to
ſeek Peace and Communion with the Anabaptiſts;</hi> and
after ſent up the <hi>Terms</hi> of that <hi>deſired Concord</hi> to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Allen,</hi> who at ſome Meetings for that
purpoſe, told me the buſineſs went hopefully on, till
the Confuſions in 1659. diſturbed and overthrew all.</p>
            <p>6. I have above 20 years in Print and Pulpit fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61144:6"/>
told the Churches, that they are greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden
to Gods Providence in permitting the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
to call us ſo lowd to the ſerious confideration of
of our <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and that if thoſe that were Baptized
in Infancy be not brought to as <hi>ſerious underſtanding,</hi>
and <hi>reſolved a renewing</hi> of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> as if they
<hi>had never been Baptiſed before,</hi> yea and paſs not out of
the ſtate of Infant Church-memberſhip into that of
the Adult, by a <hi>ſolemn tranſltion</hi> in <hi>owning of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
theſe Church Corruptions will be continued
which are the Scandal and Temptation of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.
And to that end I wrote a Treatiſe of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. I have Printed in this laſt Book (recited by Mr.
<hi>Barret</hi> in the end of his <hi>Queres)</hi> ſuch an <hi>Offer of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly
Concord</hi> with the Anabaptiſts, (ſuppoſing our
continued difference in that point) even the <hi>very words</hi>
of ſuch a Profeſſion on which both parties may with
mutual forbearance live in brotherly Love and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as never any man did to me accuſe either of
Rigor, Unlawfulneſs, or Inſufficiency to that end.
And if you reſolve that you will have <hi>no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with any in the world,</hi> but thoſe that are of your
<hi>Opinion againſt Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> your Communion will
be narrower than mine, and ſuch talk as this of yours
is never like to draw me to your mind.</p>
            <p>8. I have many years inſiſted more upon the terms
(and improvement) of our <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant,</hi> as
containing that very <hi>Touch-ſtone,</hi> or ſtate of Evidence,
by which both our <hi>ſincere Grace,</hi> and our <hi>right to
Church-Communion</hi> muſt be tryed, than any man that
I know of; of which my <hi>Family Book</hi> is a full proof.</p>
            <p>9. To the Reconciling of men herein, I have oft
ſhewed, that <hi>If our Childrens part in the Covenant of
Grace upon their Parents dedication of them to God, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61144:7"/>
ſo their Church-memberſhip,</hi> were but yielded, the reſt
(whether they ſhould actually be <hi>Baptized with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi>
would be much leſs cauſe of our diſtance and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
than on both ſides it is uſually judged. Yea,
if the Anabaptiſts would but ſay, <hi>[I Dedicate this
Child to God, as far as he hath given me power, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
deſire that God may be his Father, Chriſt his Saviour;
and the Holy Ghoſt his Sanctifier:]</hi> And did ever any
of you prove <hi>this to be a ſin?</hi> And we are ready on
our part to profeſs that <hi>[Infant-Baptiſm will ſave none
at age that conſent not to the ſame holy Covenant.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. I have oft told the world that though the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Churches denyed not their <hi>Childrens part in the
Covenant of Grace,</hi> nor their <hi>right to Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi>
and <hi>Infaut Church memberſhip</hi> by that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
yet the <hi>Time</hi> when Children themſelves ſhould
be <hi>ſolemnly Baptized,</hi> was left in the Churches for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
200 years to every ones <hi>free choice;</hi> ſome (and
the moſt Chriſtians) uſually Baptizing them <hi>quickly,</hi>
and others thinking as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that it would <hi>bind
them faſter</hi> if they <hi>ſtayed ſomewhat longer;</hi> or, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi>
thought, till they were <hi>three or four years
old:</hi> even as one that hath <hi>right to a Crown</hi> in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,</hi>
may have his <hi>Coronation</hi> performed either <hi>then,</hi>
or <hi>afterward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. I have oft told the world that I would have this
<hi>liberty and moderation</hi> again revived, and that I would
have no Anabaptiſt perſecuted or excommunicated for
that his Opinion.</p>
            <p>12. I never perſecuted any of them, nor perſwaded
any to do it; nor never endeavoured to hurt them,
nor denyed them any good that I could do them;
(though I told you truly that even they of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s.
Church that had ſeemed <hi>my old Friends,</hi> ſought my <hi>life</hi>
or <hi>ruine,</hi> by way-ſaying a man that told them he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61144:7"/>
Letters of mine, violently taking them from him
and carrying them up to <hi>London</hi> to the Council, to
<hi>Sir H. V.</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>account</hi> that my <hi>Reviewing Conſcience</hi>
giveth me of <hi>my dealing with the Anabaptiſts,</hi> with
whom to this day I ſtill plead for <hi>Love and peaceable
Communion</hi> upon terms of mutual forbearance: And
whether it be holy Patience and Humility that takes
this for Fire and Fury, and cannot bear it, conſider.</p>
            <p>But yet <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> you copiouſly exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,
and call me to Repent: I thank you unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
for that <hi>honeſt wholſome</hi> word <hi>[Repent]</hi> whether
well or ill applyed. But your many ſcornes at my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings</hi>
ſcarce well agree with the invitation. Were
I like to have Life and Leiſure for ſuch a work, I
would reſolve to Review all my Writings juſt in the
method that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did, and to tell the Readers what
I diſlike in them; which having no reaſon to expect,
I have ſo dealt already with thoſe that moſt needed it,
and corrected others in the later Impreſſions. If you
need no Repentance, and have written as much as I,
and that without any fault, you have been happier
than I. And yet I intend not to give over Writing,
Preaching, Praying, praiſing God, or Conference
with men, becauſe I cannot do any of them innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in a manner that needed no Repentance.</p>
            <p>But upon the full peruſal of your Letter, I muſt ſay,
I never had a more Wordy, Windy, Empty Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to Repentance, that I remember in my life. I
looked ſtill when the <hi>fault was told me,</hi> and <hi>ſome words</hi>
at leaſt named that were guilty of the <hi>folly</hi> or <hi>firyneſs</hi>
mentioned; or ſome of my particular ſins proved,
that I might be convinced: I looked to find ſome one
<hi>Argument</hi> of my Books <hi>confuted</hi> and <hi>proved vain,</hi> or
fallacious. But it renewed in me that grief and pity,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61144:8"/>
for the ſtrange diſeaſedneſs of ſuch Diſſenters, (which
Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> had before cauſed) to find ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Rhetorical Invectives, without one word of
Proof: As if you had prevaricated, and had a deſign
to have <hi>kept me from Repentance,</hi> by telling me I had no
particulars to Repent of that you could ſhew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What do all your Generals of</hi> [no anſwer] <hi>and</hi>
tergiverſation, <hi>and abundance the like ſignifie, to any
man of common ſenſe, unleſs this be the meaning of
them,</hi> [It is Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Opinion and mine that
you are fooliſh, firey, injurious, frivolous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore
you muſt Repent of this, though we ſay nothing that ſhould
convince a reaſonable man.]</p>
            <p>But, <hi>I muſt retract what I have written againſt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts;</hi>
for you invite me to it by a torrent of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Accuſations, and letting me know that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> and
you do think me Hetorodox.] And juſt ſo doth Mr.
<hi>Pen</hi> and the Quakers do alſo: And ſo do the Papiſts,
and with as great confidence and Oratory perhaps as
yours: And ſo do the accuſers of the Non-conformiſts
in many Volumes: and ſo do many other Parties:
And muſt I be therefore of all their minds? Or why
more of <hi>yours</hi> than of <hi>theirs,</hi> if I have nothing from
you but <hi>confident Gnerals,</hi> which <hi>they</hi> can ſay as well
as <hi>you?</hi> Yea thus do the <hi>Infidels</hi> themſelves now uſe
me, and muſt I therefore yield?</p>
            <p>But <hi>I have written</hi> Fierily <hi>against Mr.</hi> Danvers!
1. Did I <hi>begin</hi> with Mr. <hi>D.</hi> or he with me? 2. Have
I ſaid any thing offenſive to him, beſides the detecting
of his marvellous audacity in ſtrange heaps of <hi>untruths</hi>
in matters of Fact? and his lamentable injury there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to the Church of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Sir, I know you not, and ſhould I tell you what a
Spirit in your ſelf, your copious outcryes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream
<hi>tenderneſs</hi> of our <hi>diſſent</hi> and <hi>contradiction</hi> of you,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61144:8"/>
ſhews, and how unlike to the voice of a ſheep of
Chriſt it is to <hi>cry ſo loud,</hi> as if the knife were at your
throat, when we do but <hi>tell the Church</hi> of your <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
and Injuries</hi> to the Truth, upon the <hi>urgency</hi> of
your <hi>reſtleſs importunity:</hi> Should I tell you what <hi>ſtrange
Partiality</hi> you ſhew in finding <hi>Meekneſs, Truth,</hi> and
<hi>Reaſon</hi> in Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Books, and <hi>Folly, Fire,</hi> and
<hi>No-anſwer</hi> in mine, I could not expect that you ſhould
ever the more be convinced, or Repent, but rather
take that alſo for Fiery, as taking me for an uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Monitor. But I deſire you only to ask the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the judicious and impartial herein; for <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to your ſelf</hi> ſhould be no odious thing. And
whereas you tell me over and over what <hi>all wiſe men</hi>
now <hi>think</hi> and <hi>ſay of me,</hi> and of my <hi>Writings,</hi> am not
I an unhappy man that <hi>never met with one</hi> of thoſe
wiſe men, but your ſelf and ſuch profeſſed oppoſites
(Anabaptiſts, Quakers, Papiſts, or ſuch like.)</p>
            <p>But what if <hi>I be fooliſh,</hi> and you <hi>be wiſe?</hi> Cannot
you ſuffer fools gladly, ſeeing you your ſelves are
wiſe? And is your impatient and general Invectives,
and your ſelf-juſtifying, an infallible proof of your
great Wiſdome?</p>
            <p>Brother, upon the deepeſt ſearch that I am able to
make in above 20 years Conſideration, I am ſatisfied
that you <hi>heinouſly wrong</hi> the <hi>Mercy of God,</hi> and the
<hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>true Believers,</hi> and their <hi>Seed,</hi> by denying
them that part in <hi>Gods Covenant</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> which I
have proved he hath ſtated on them in his Word: I
am fully ſatisfied that God never had Church-Laws
on earth, whether in innocency, or ſince the Fall,
which extended not the priviledge of a Covenant and
Church-ſtate to the Infants of the Church, if they had
ſuch (on that ſuppoſition;) and that the Church
<hi>from the dayes of</hi> Adam <hi>till now</hi> hath had Infants mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61144:9"/>
by Gods appointment; and that <hi>Chriſt ſo found
them,</hi> and <hi>ſo continued them;</hi> and that it was <hi>then</hi> a
thing that <hi>none did controvert:</hi> I am ſatisfied fully, that
all that are <hi>Diſcipled</hi> are by <hi>command</hi> to be <hi>Baptized;</hi>
and that <hi>Nations ſhould be Diſcipled,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdoms
of the world made the Kingdoms of Chriſt;</hi> and Chriſt
would have <hi>gathered to his Church the whole Jeruſalem,
as the Hen gathereth her Chickens, and none were broken
off but for unbelief, and therefore the Children of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jews were not broken off;</hi> and that <hi>we are graffed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſame Olive: I am ſatisfied that they that ſo hardly
digeſted</hi> the forbearance of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have <hi>ſilently paſt over the Vnchurching of all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
without one word of exception;</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> have
ſo far <hi>countenanced the Excepters,</hi> as to be <hi>angry with
thoſe that would have forbid Children comeing to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> nor the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have talk'd ſo much of <hi>Baptizing Houſholds.</hi> I
am not hardened enough to reject ſo plain a Text as,
<hi>[The unbelieving Husband is ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>elſe were
your Children unclean, but now they are holy.]</hi> Nor in
that one text to expound <hi>Sanctifying</hi> for <hi>Lawful
Marriage,</hi> and <hi>Holyneſs</hi> for <hi>[Legitimation]</hi> when
the words are never ſo taken elſe in the Bible, and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
hundred times</hi> in another ſenſe: nor to ſay, that
<hi>all Pagans Children are holy if they be not Baſtards.</hi> I
am ſatisfied that man muſt not teach God how to
ſpeak, but carefully enquire what he hath ſpoken;
And if but one Text of Scripture acquaint us, directly
or conſequentially of his mind, we muſt be faithful in
obſerving it: I believe that theſe are <hi>your</hi> thoughts
as well as <hi>mine,</hi> and that you verily think that you
hold cloſe to the Scripture, and that I depart from it:
But as I am as <hi>willing</hi> to underſtand it as you are, and
at as hard a rate of coſt or labour, ſo I well know that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61144:9"/>
one <hi>mistake</hi> once deeply received, doth let in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
more, and fights againſt all the light that would
detect and ſhame it: And he that once accounteth
<hi>Falſhood</hi> to be <hi>Truth,</hi> will account the <hi>Defenders of
Truth</hi> to be its <hi>Enemies.</hi> Otherwiſe how could you
and ſuch others bring your Conſciences to wreſt and
wrangle againſt ſuch abundance of plain Scripture
Texts? Were it but <hi>this one,</hi> what could be plainer?
What is wreſting Scripture if this be not, to force a
ſenſe of <hi>Holyneſs</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> upon <hi>one Text,</hi>
which is never found elſe in any Text, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
or different ſenſe neer ſix hundred times; is this
impartial dealing with Gods word? And do you think
that <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth that as a great and comfortable
priviledge of Believers, which belongs to <hi>Heathens</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
with them? Why do you not your ſelves ſtill
uſe that language then, and ſay, that <hi>the Children of
Infidels are holy,</hi> when too many will ſcarce allow the
title to <hi>any Adult Chriſtians</hi> that are not of your Sect,
much leſs to the <hi>Children</hi> of Chriſtians, though dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
by Baptiſm to God?</p>
            <p>But being called by you to a <hi>Review,</hi> I am again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
that <hi>our Saviour himſelf was a Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
in his Infancy,</hi> even the chiefeſt, that is, the <hi>Head;</hi>
Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> confeſſeth it: Let not your opinions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
draw you to deny it, nor to call my aſſertion
<hi>[rotten dictating.]</hi> If you ſhould, I would ask of you,
<hi>at what age Christ began to be Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Churches
Head,</hi> as we ask the Socinians, <hi>At what age he began
to be God?</hi> And if an Infant was capable of being the
<hi>Head, King, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Prophet Relatively,</hi> though <hi>yet</hi>
he had never <hi>Ruled, Sacrificed, or Taught,</hi> then there
is nothing in the <hi>Infant Age,</hi> which maketh <hi>it</hi> unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being <hi>Members, Subjects,</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> of
Chriſt: And it is like that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> was not deceived,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61144:10"/>
who ſaith that he <hi>Sanctified the ſtate of Infancy</hi> by being
an <hi>Infant;</hi> and we have reaſon to judge, that he did
thereby give us notice that the <hi>Infant Age</hi> is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
to him, nor uncapable of Church Relation.</p>
            <p>Truly Sir, the ſerious thought of <hi>Chriſts Infant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
is a very great confirmation of me againſt thoſe
that exclude all mankind in their Infancy from the
<hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Church;</hi> even as <hi>Chriſts ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
in the Synagogues and Temple, is an inſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
argument with me againſt unlawful <hi>Separations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And God himſelf calling <hi>Infants his Servants,</hi> who
do no <hi>actual ſervice,</hi> Levit. 25. 41, 42. yea and calling
them <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Acts 15. 10. prevaileth more with
me, than the words of any one that ſhall ſay, They
are uncapable of being <hi>Servants,</hi> or <hi>Diſciples.</hi> If the
Infant-age did not render them uncapable of being
<hi>Subjects</hi> of Chriſts Kingdom, and Members of his
Church (Univerſal and Particular) <hi>before Chriſts
Incarnation,</hi> it maketh them not <hi>ſince</hi> uncapable of
the like or ſame Relations.</p>
            <p>And why ſhould I ſuſpect ſuch incapacity? are not
Infants members of <hi>other Societies?</hi> are they not mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of <hi>Families?</hi> and may not a <hi>Family</hi> be <hi>Sanctified</hi>
by dedication to God? are they not members of all
the <hi>Kingdoms</hi> in the world? and is it not the common
<hi>light of Nature,</hi> which teacheth all men ſo to eſteem
them? are not Infants the <hi>Kings Subjects?</hi> and why
may they not as well be <hi>Chriſts Subjects</hi> as the Kings?
Have they not <hi>Right of Inheritance and Honour;</hi> even of
<hi>Crowns, Lordſhips,</hi> and <hi>Lands?</hi> Do any Nations under
Heaven <hi>level all Children,</hi> as if the Parents communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
neither good or evil to them? What reaſon then
to ſuppoſe that Chriſt obliterateth even Natures Laws?</p>
            <p>And if you deny not <hi>Original Sin,</hi> why ſhould you
think that God is ſo <hi>unproportionably</hi> prone to <hi>puniſh</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:61144:10"/>
and <hi>damn</hi> more than to <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>ſave;</hi> as that while
<hi>all Infants</hi> are made <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>miſerable</hi> by their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi>
yet <hi>not one</hi> in the world ſhall have ſo much as a
part in Chriſts meritorious Righteouſneſs, and the
free grace and pardon of his Covenant, upon the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
dedication of him to God,</hi> and <hi>entering him by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
into his Covenant?</hi> Doth <hi>ſin abound</hi> ſo much <hi>more
than Grace,</hi> as that <hi>Condemnation is paſſed upon all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi>
for and by their <hi>Parents ſin,</hi> and the <hi>free Covenant
gift</hi> doth not <hi>pardon any ſin</hi> to any <hi>one Infant</hi> in the
world upon <hi>any condition</hi> which the Parent can perform
(nor any other.)</p>
            <p>You never yet by all your words (for all <hi>words</hi> are
not <hi>Light</hi> and Proof) did convince me that it was <hi>no
Benefit to Infants before Chriſts Incarnation to be Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-members</hi>
of his Church (particular and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,)
Nor that Chriſt came to deprive them all of
that benefit: Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his pretenſes that it <hi>is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
to Chriſtians to have all their Infants put or kept out
of the Church State and Mercies,</hi> is ſo abſurd, againſt
Nature, that I am aſham'd to ſay any more againſt it:
If it be <hi>our Benefit</hi> to have <hi>no Covenant-gift of Chriſt,
Pardon and Life to our Children,</hi> may you not next ſay,
It is <hi>our Benefit</hi> to have them damn'd? And if
it <hi>were</hi> ſo, Nature teacheth us to be loath to receive
our Benefits by ſuch means; as one would be loath
that a Phyſitian ſhould cure his Sickneſs by a draught
of the heart blood of all his Children.</p>
            <p>Sir, I could the eaſilyer bear with your <hi>delay</hi> of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Baptiſm;</hi> if you did not deny all Infants their
<hi>part in the Covenant of Life.</hi> But when you dare not only
<hi>do that,</hi> but reproach our aſſertion of Gods <hi>Covenant-Grace</hi>
to them, as <hi>[Abſurd and Heretical]</hi> it is no
<hi>Fieryneſs</hi> to ſay, that I will not follow you. Where
there is no <hi>Covenant</hi> or <hi>Promiſe</hi> there is <hi>no Hope,</hi> which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61144:11"/>
we can call Divine; and if we have <hi>no Hope</hi> of the
<hi>Pardon</hi> or Salvation of our Children upon any <hi>Promiſe</hi>
of <hi>God,</hi> it is no Promiſe of <hi>Mans</hi> that can keep us
from <hi>Deſpair.</hi> We may not then ſay as <hi>David, I ſhall
go to it]</hi> any farther than to the Grave.</p>
            <p>Nay do you not do worſe than <hi>deprive</hi> us of our
<hi>hopes,</hi> even lay ſuch grounds as <hi>deſtroy and exclude</hi>
them, by a ſentence of damnation? For God <hi>[addeth
to the Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved.]</hi> And if Infants be
not added to the Church, are they not <hi>excluded</hi> from
Salvation? For Chriſt <hi>waſheth and ſanctifieth his Church,</hi>
&amp; he is the <hi>Saviour of his Body only;</hi> And if they are not
of his <hi>Church or Body,</hi> he waſheth them not, nor is
their Saviour effectively. The ſame Text that ſaith, <hi>He
that believeth ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not
ſhall be damned.</hi>] And <hi>He that believeth not is condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
already.</hi>] If therefore you allow them no partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
in their Parents Faith, but require <hi>perſonal Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi>
of them, as neceſſary to their Salvation, according
to the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> you muſt alſo require the ſame of them
to ſave them <hi>from Damnation,</hi> by the <hi>Threatning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did you but leave <hi>Christians</hi> no more hope than
you do <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> of their <hi>Childrens Pardon</hi> and
Salvation, I would not be ambitious of the Joy of your
opinion; much leſs if you <hi>poſitively condemn</hi> them.
And what do you leſs, if finding them <hi>condemned</hi> by
the violated Covenant of Innocency, you totally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them from the <hi>Remedying, Pardoning, and Saving
Covenant,</hi> and from <hi>Chriſts Body</hi> which he doth ſave.</p>
            <p>If you ſay that they may be of his <hi>inviſible Church,
which is the ſaved Body;</hi> I anſwer, 1. What they <hi>may be,</hi>
tells us not <hi>what they are.</hi> If they be not ſo <hi>much as viſible
Members,</hi> who can ſay that they are <hi>inviſible ones?</hi> 2.
They are by <hi>Nature viſible Members of the Kingdom of
Satan,</hi> and <hi>Children of wrath,</hi> and <hi>viſibly</hi> under the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61144:11"/>
               <hi>Laws Condemnation:</hi> Therefore 'till we can prove
them <hi>viſibly by grace tranſlated</hi> out of this ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
their <hi>viſible Condemnation</hi> cannot be denyed.</p>
            <p>And what a jumble make you, if you make a great
part of Mankind to be at once <hi>condemned viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdom of the Devil,</hi> and <hi>inviſible ſaved
members</hi> of Chriſt? Men may be <hi>viſibly Chriſtians,
(Hypocrites)</hi> and yet <hi>inviſibly wicked;</hi> but to be <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
condemned members</hi> of the <hi>Kingdome of Darkneſs,</hi>
and yet <hi>inviſible members of Chriſt</hi> is ſtrange to me;
eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Hypocrites</hi> are <hi>viſibly</hi> what
they <hi>are not really,</hi> and <hi>inviſibly,</hi> becauſe they falſely
profeſs what they have not: But a <hi>condemned Infant</hi>
doth not deceive men by diſſembling, but we <hi>actually
know</hi> that as a child of <hi>Adam,</hi> he is a child of ſin and
death: It is <hi>truly ſo.</hi> Therefore we muſt conclude that
as Gods Word is true, <hi>he continueth ſo,</hi> till he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
by Grace. And the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is the
<hi>Conveyance</hi> of, and title to our gracious priviledges, as
the <hi>threatning</hi> is of wrath.</p>
            <p>Shall not all that are <hi>judged,</hi> be judged by <hi>Gods Law?</hi>
(the Law which they were under?) And what <hi>Law</hi>
ſhall Infants then be judged by? If they are under no
<hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Promiſe</hi> that giveth them title to life, how
can they have <hi>title by it,</hi> or be <hi>judged by it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are they <hi>Juſtified</hi> or not <hi>Juſtified?</hi> If <hi>not Juſtified,</hi>
they are <hi>condemned</hi> certainly; and ſhall not be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for it is the <hi>Juſtified</hi> that are <hi>glorified,</hi> Rom. 8. 30.
But if they are <hi>Juſtified,</hi> either it is by ſome <hi>Juſtifying
Promiſe and Covenant,</hi> or <hi>without:</hi> If <hi>without,</hi> 1. Do
you not give hope alſo to all <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Wicked</hi>
men, that though they are <hi>condemned</hi> by the Law of
Innocency, and not <hi>juſtified</hi> by any <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi>
yet they may be <hi>juſtified without?</hi> 2. And by what
means is it? by <hi>any</hi> or <hi>none?</hi> If by <hi>any,</hi> by <hi>what?</hi> If
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61144:12"/>
by <hi>none,</hi> how know you it? But if it be by any <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Grant</hi>
that they are juſtified, it muſt be by that
of <hi>Grace</hi> which I am pleading for or none. For we
will not now receive another Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To talk therefore of <hi>meer Election,</hi> is nothing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of this that I have ſaid. Election Juſtifieth not, nor
diſſolveth the condemning Sentence of the Law. God
judgeth not men meerly on the grounds of his unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Election, but by his <hi>Word,</hi> which is the <hi>Rule.</hi> And
were it otherwiſe if <hi>unrevealed,</hi> none can <hi>prove it,</hi> and
therefore muſt not <hi>affirm</hi> it: And were it reveled that
God <hi>will ſave ſome</hi> that he <hi>promiſeth not to ſave,</hi> nor
giveth them any antecedent <hi>right</hi> to it; yet 1. No
man could know by this, whether any one in <hi>England</hi>
or Europe, or in the World in his age ſhall ſo be ſaved:
nor whether it be many or few, or more than a dozen
in the world. 2. And no one can know who any of
theſe be? and ſo can have no notice of comfort for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his own. 3. Nor that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Infants ſhall be
ſaved any more than the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things, Sir, are not to be ſubmitted to by all
Chriſtians, for fear leſt you elſe revile them, or leſt Mr.
<hi>T.</hi> ſayes, <hi>Their blood be on their own heads. Auſtin</hi> is
called <hi>Durus Pater Infantum,</hi> for too ſharp a cenſure
on the unbaptized; (though many miſtake him.)
But we ſhould be <hi>harder,</hi> did we leave all <hi>viſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi>
without a <hi>pardoning word,</hi> or any <hi>viſible remedy</hi>
and hope.</p>
            <p>And truly me thinks you too much <hi>honour the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of the Devil,</hi> if you make it viſibly contain all
the <hi>Seed of the Woman,</hi> even of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> till they
come to age. It is <hi>too great,</hi> I will not feign it to be
greater. Were all the <hi>Circumciſed</hi> Iſraelites, and all
the <hi>holy ſeed till Chriſt,</hi> at once both in the <hi>Church,</hi> and
in <hi>Satans Kingdom?</hi> If not, ſure it is not ſo now.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:61144:12"/>
Sure I am that the Scripture tells us of a <hi>larger
Church,</hi> and a <hi>better Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Salvation</hi> under the Goſpel; and do you bring it
down to this, to give us <hi>all up</hi> to the <hi>Devils viſible
Kingdom,</hi> without any <hi>viſible Remedy,</hi> till we <hi>come to
age?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And he is ſcarce ſo <hi>like</hi> to prove a <hi>member of Chriſt
at age,</hi> who is trained up in the <hi>Kingdom of the Devil
till then,</hi> as he is that is educated in the <hi>Houſhold of God.</hi>
There is more of Gods bleſſing to be expected in his
<hi>own Family</hi> than in the <hi>Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Either it is a <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>no Mercy</hi> to be in <hi>Chriſts Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi>
or Church? if none, why do <hi>you</hi> value it? if it
<hi>be,</hi> why ſhould we think that the Saviour of the world
procureth it to <hi>no Infants?</hi> nay that he came to leave
them out. Would you not take it for a Mercy if you
believed that God in Scripture gave it, to all the Seed
of the Faithful dedicated to him? I think you would.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For my part I believe that the</hi> Seed of the Righteous
is bleſſed, <hi>Pſal. 37. 26. and that the Children of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
and the condemned unjuſtified ſeed are not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
That</hi> bleſſed are they whoſe ſins and iniquities are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
and covered, and to whom the Lord imputeth not ſin, <hi>and that</hi> this bleſſing cometh even on the uncircumciſed;
<hi>But not on them who are unpardoned,</hi> and <hi>condemned
already.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hear many ſad Mothers lamenting their dead Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
for fear leſt they are damned: And though I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was a Father, I can perceive what the concerns
and bowels of Parents are. But what would they do,
if they were taught to believe, that no Infant ever in
the world, had any juſtifying, pardoning Promiſe,
nor viſible Remedy, but all till age are under condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
by the undiſſolved Obligation of the Law.</p>
            <p>The Antinomians of late years have attempted to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61144:13"/>
perſwade men, that <hi>ſecret Election juſtifieth from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
and diſſolveth the Laws Obligation, (before it
<hi>did oblige,</hi> even to <hi>non-exiſtent Subjects:)</hi> But few be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
them, the Errour being ſufficiently laid open.
And yet what other than this feigned Antinomian Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
do the Anabaptiſts allow to any Infants in
the world? But the <hi>Obligation</hi> of a <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant</hi> to
<hi>puniſhment,</hi> muſt according to Gods eſtabliſhed order,
be diſſolved by a <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> even by the <hi>Pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Law of Grace.</hi> No doubt but all elect perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Regeneration are in the viſible Kingdom of the
Devil, and heirs of hell, and under the condemnation
of the Law, as undiſſolved, and they not pardoned:
and is this the caſe of the beſt of Infants?</p>
            <p>Had Infants Church-memberſhip been a meer <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Ceremony,</hi> or a meer piece of the <hi>Moſaical Policie,</hi>
giving no right to <hi>any ſpiritual benefits,</hi> nor extended
to <hi>any other but the Jews,</hi> we ſhould have judged of it
as of the reſt: But I dare ſay that I have given full
proof of the contrary in both my Books, not here to be
recited; and have produced more than <hi>[rotten dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates]</hi>
that from <hi>Adams</hi> dayes Infants were eſteemed
as under the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> or the <hi>Curſe,</hi> as belonging to their
Parents, &amp; intereſted in their <hi>actions</hi> &amp; <hi>conditions.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that <hi>any heathen</hi> might have <hi>brought in his children
as Proſelites</hi> into Church-memberſhip with the Jews;
whereas now you allow not <hi>ſo much</hi> to <hi>any Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was before Circumciſion was inſtituted, that
<hi>Marriage</hi> was regulated by God, that there might be
<hi>[a Seed of God]</hi> Mal. 2. 15.] And I will not be ſo
audocious, as to expound that title, of all the <hi>Devils
Children</hi> that be not <hi>Baſtards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſtill you ſay,</hi> There is no Scripture, Preſident, or
Precept for Infants Baptiſm.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 1. Abuſe not your ſelves and others: we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61144:13"/>
are firſt to agree <hi>Whether Infants may be Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and under the Covenant of Grace with their Parents?</hi>
And then we ſhall next conſider, at <hi>what age,</hi> and in
<hi>what manner</hi> they ſhould be <hi>ſolemnly inveſted.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
not differing Queſtions: the firſt muſt be firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved.
2. There is no Scripture preſident for Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
any <hi>Kings;</hi> muſt none therefore be Baptized?
3. Scripture tells us not all that <hi>was then done,</hi> but all
that <hi>muſt</hi> be done. 4. When Baptiſm was firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and practiſed, the <hi>Parents</hi> muſt firſt be <hi>Converted
and Baptized.</hi> 5. Yet over and over the Baptizing of
<hi>Houſholds</hi> is recorded. 6. Infants <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi>
was a thing that they were <hi>before in profeſſion of,</hi> and
no ſort that ever I read of queſtioned it: Therefore
what need Chriſt inſtitute it anew, any more than to
new make the Ten Commandments? 7. If it had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been his meaning to <hi>diſpoſſeſs them all,</hi> he would
have told us ſo in ſome word of Scripture, or ſome
mention ſure had been made of it. 8. But certainly he
told them that <hi>he would have gathered Jeruſalems Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to him,</hi> which is the Nation that was before Gods
Church. 9. And he took Children in his arms and
bleſſed them, and was angry with thoſe that kept them
from him, and ſaid, <hi>Of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi>
10. And how can we obey <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 36, 37. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Children in <hi>Chriſts name, and as belonging to
Chriſt,</hi> if none do viſibly belong to him?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>But I anſwer fully, There is</hi> a full Command for
Infant Baptiſm <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19. Go ye Diſciple me all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Baptizing them.</p>
            <p>Where note, 1. That it is not the <hi>effect</hi> that is made
their duty, but their <hi>endeavour;</hi> elſe the Apoſtles had
ſinned when the hearers believed not, and becauſe all
Nations were not Diſcipled.</p>
            <p>Note that to be <hi>Diſciples</hi> and to be <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> Acts
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61144:14"/>
11. are made all one; and to be <hi>Diſcipled</hi> and to be
<hi>Chriſtened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Note that it is not <hi>here and there one,</hi> but <hi>Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
that they muſt endeavour to Diſciple: And as
the Jews are called a <hi>holy Nation,</hi> ſo it is ſaid, <hi>I will
give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance,</hi> Pſal. 2. and
Iſa. 55. 8. Mal. 1. 10, 11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Converſion of the
Nations and Heathens is promiſed: and the <hi>Word</hi>
and our <hi>Experience</hi> have both ſaid, <hi>The Kingdoms of the
World are become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of his
Chriſt.</hi> But <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Nations</hi> contain Infants;
and he Diſcipleth not a Nation that Diſcipleth no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
in the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtles were commanded to Diſcple whole
Nations: the Infants are parts of whole Nations:
therefore the Apoſtles were bound to endeavour to
Diſciple Infants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is only the capable parts: <hi>but</hi> Infants and
Ideots are not capable parts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have before [and elſe-where fully] pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<hi>Infants capable parts,</hi> as Chriſt was of being Head,
and as Infants are of <hi>Societies,</hi> and of a part in <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants</hi>
with men: and <hi>Ideots</hi> having not the uſe of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
from the birth, are in the ſame caſe with Infants;
and the Diſtracted, after at age, are nothing to our
caſe, but are capable of being Diſtracted members;
and Diſtraction is not Excommunication, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>churcheth
any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. They muſt be made Diſciples by Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If they be made Diſciples any way, they
muſt be Baptized. 2. As a mans <hi>hand</hi> or <hi>foot</hi> doth not
<hi>underſtand</hi> by <hi>teaching,</hi> and yet is <hi>part of a Diſciple</hi>
that's made ſuch by teaching; ſo <hi>Infants underſtand
not,</hi> and yet are <hi>Infant Diſciples,</hi> as being <hi>naturally</hi> ſo
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61144:14"/>
much <hi>appertaining</hi> to their Parents, that by Gods Law
the <hi>Parents Will</hi> goeth for <hi>theirs</hi> in conſenting for their
good. They are <hi>Subjects</hi> before they <hi>obey,</hi> and <hi>ſervants
of God</hi> before they ſerve him (as thoſe were to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
that were born to him in his houſe,) and as Chriſt
was a Prieſt before he Sacrificed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>ſo</hi> they
are <hi>Diſciples</hi> before they <hi>learn;</hi> and made ſuch by <hi>thes
teaching</hi> which <hi>made their Parents ſuch,</hi> and taught
them to dedicate them to God.</p>
            <p>If the King ſhould ſend Embaſſadours to perſwade
the Heathens in <hi>New England</hi> at once to <hi>become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and his Subjects;</hi> would any man doubt but
when the Embaſſadours prevail with <hi>all the Adult</hi> to
become the <hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> they do thereby make the
<hi>Nations,</hi> and ſo <hi>all Infants</hi> as dependents on the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to be Subjects alſo? And if the <hi>ſame ſpeech</hi> of
the <hi>ſame men</hi> make the Parents both <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the
<hi>Kings Subjects,</hi> may it not as truly be ſaid that that
ſpeech made the <hi>Infants Chriſtians</hi> (when the Parents
conſent) as Subjects when they conſent?</p>
            <p>3. If actual Learning or believing were neceſſary
to the Chriſtianity, or Church-memberſhip of all,
then whenever any one were Mad or Diſtracted, or in
an Appoplexy (if not every night while he is aſleep)
he ſhould ceaſe to be a Chriſtian and Church-member.</p>
            <p>And if Infants as part of Nations muſt be made
<hi>Diſciples,</hi> and all that are <hi>Diſcipled</hi> be <hi>Baptized,</hi> (as
the Inveſting act) then here is a plain cmmand to
Baptize Infants: All that muſt be Diſcipled muſt be
Baptized: Infants muſt be Diſcipled: Therefore In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
muſt be Baptized: What have you more for
Baptizing Kings?</p>
            <p>And if men ask for Scripture <hi>Preſedent,</hi> or fuller
proof; 1. I alſo require them to give me any one
Scripture Preſedent, where ever any one that was the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61144:15"/>
Child of a Chriſtian, and not at age when the Parents
were made Chriſtians, was afterward Baptized when
he came to age? Prove that and you will prove
ſomething.</p>
            <p>2. I ask them whether many points in Divinity be
not now taken as neceſſary, or ſure, for which not
the fourth part ſo much is produced out of Scripture as
I have done for the Church-memberſhip of Infants.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing you have ſo importunately called me to
a Review; I will add theſe few things more, [I.]
What Benefits I perceive cometh by Infant-Baptiſm.
[II.] What hurt would come if you could prevail
againſt it. [III.] What ſin you would draw men to
by rejecting it. [IV.] And I will tell you what
thanks therefore I owe to God for preſerving me
from your miſtakes and way.</p>
            <p>I. And I cannot but think that all theſe following
are Mercies not to be deſpiſed. 1. To be <hi>Gods Children,</hi>
and God to be their God and Father. 2. To be Chriſts
Members, and Chriſt to be their Head and Saviour.
3. To have the Holy Ghoſt in Covenant with them,
to give them his Grace and help as ſhall be neceſſary
to them upon the further terms on which it is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to be communicated. (of which more anon.)
4. To have the pardon of all Original ſin, as to the
damning puniſhment, and ſo to have the Laws Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
diſabled. 5. To be members of ſo holy,
ſafe, and honourable a Society as the Church. 6. To
have their Love and Prayers as Members. 7. To have
Parents obliged ſolemnly to endeavour to educate and
uſe their Children as members of Chriſt, fellow Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God.
8. To have right to Heaven, ſo dying, by Gods gift.
9. For Parents and Friends to have comfortable no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of all this. 10. And that they are not under the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61144:15"/>
power and Kingdom of the Devil, as thoſe that are
Rebels againſt the Covenant, or that are without.</p>
            <p>II. Should your perſwaſions prevail againſt Infant-Baptiſm,
theſe evils I think would follow. And
whereas you ſay, that <hi>your Think</hi> is as good as <hi>my
Think,</hi> pardon my modeſty, and while you follow
your own <hi>Think,</hi> give me and others leave to judge of
<hi>mine,</hi> by the <hi>evidence</hi> at leaſt of <hi>probability</hi> which I bring.</p>
            <p>1. I think that Chriſtian Parents would want one
of their <hi>Motives</hi> to live in <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to God, and
to magnifie the Grace of <hi>the Redeemer,</hi> if they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leve
that all Infants are in the viſible Kingdom of the
Devil, and have no Promiſe or Covenant-Grant of
Pardon, Remedy, or Life.</p>
            <p>2. The want of this Demonſtration of Divine Love
would be a diſadvantage to <hi>their Love to God:</hi> For
where much is forgiven, there will be much Love.</p>
            <p>3. It would deprive Chriſtian Parents of all the
forementioned Comforts for their Childrens good,
and leave them to mourn for the dead as thoſe that
have no hopes, which any Promiſe of God alloweth
them.</p>
            <p>4. Parents would be more negligent in the pious
education of their Children, than they are; for their
ſolemn Vow and Promiſe is a great additional Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Young Perſons</hi> would be more <hi>bold in ſin,</hi> when
they know that they are under no Covenant, Vow or
Promiſe to the contrary: And they would uſually <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
their Repentance and Baptiſm;</hi> as <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and
many in thoſe times did; as thinking that [all ſin is
done away when I Repent and am Baptized; but it is
more dangerous to ſin after Baptiſm than before: And
ſo moſt would think it beſt to <hi>live out of the Church,</hi>
and to <hi>die in it;</hi> to <hi>live</hi> as <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>die</hi> as <hi>Chriſtians;</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61144:16"/>
to live after the fleſh as do the wicked, and to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
before death, and to die the death of the
Righteous.</p>
            <p>6. Theſe delayes would do [as delay of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
now doth to many.] even drive away Gods
Spirit, forfeit grace, harden the heart, ſo that few
delayers would be converted.</p>
            <p>7. By theſe delayings of Repentance and liberty of
ſins, wickedneſs would more abound, and ſo Gods
judgments againſt the land be more increaſed.</p>
            <p>8. Pagans and Infidels would be hardened and
encouraged, by the multitudes of the unbaptized,
and the paucity of Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>9. For Chriſtians would be but few in compariſon
of the multitude: juſt as Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> thinks Chriſt
would have it, <hi>[here one and there one.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. And while ſome delayed their Baptiſm in <hi>ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
(as many now do the Lords Supper) and others
to take the <hi>liberty of ſinning</hi> (which were like to be
the common caſe of youth) and others in <hi>ſenſeleſs
negligence,</hi> the Baptized and Unbaptized would grow
(like our Non-conformiſts and Conformiſts) into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
Parties, upon diſtinct Intereſt in point of Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and ſo the unbaptized become the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
(for the moſt part) of the Baptized.</p>
            <p>11. And the <hi>Rich,</hi> and the <hi>Multitude</hi> being uſually
the Unbaptized party, they would be ſtill the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and the <hi>Governours</hi> of the reſt; and the Laws and
Government would be ſuch as the Governours.</p>
            <p>12. And hereupon the Church would be (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the dayes of <hi>Conſtantine)</hi> ordinarily under Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
            <p>13. This Perſecution would detein the moſt from
looking towards Chriſtianity, and ſo hinder multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
from comeing in to Chriſt: and woe to them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61144:16"/>
that ſo offend or hinder ſuch little ones; It were better
a milſtone were hanged about their necks and they
were caſt into the depth of the Sea.</p>
            <p>14. There would then be no <hi>ſanctified Families</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
to God, (except thoſe few that had no
Children.)</p>
            <p>15. <hi>Much leſs would</hi> any Nation <hi>be</hi> Diſcipled, <hi>or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
one Kingdom <hi>be the</hi> Kingdom of the Lord, and of his
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is not the Condition that I deſire and pray
for: If you doubt of all or any of this, look to the
<hi>Eaſterni</hi> parts of the world, and be not worſe than
thoſe that will learn by nothing but experience. Judge
whether under the <hi>Turkiſh Government</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi>
Church be grown better, and whether the Chriſtians
are <hi>more</hi> and <hi>holyer</hi> than heretofore. And yet the <hi>Turks</hi>
give <hi>Liberty of Religion,</hi> which moſt Unbaptized
Princes do not.</p>
            <p>O dreadful Caſe! That ever Religious perſons
ſhould Study, Preach, Pray, and fervently Diſpute
and Write to bring the Chriſtian world to this, as for
the advancement of Religion!</p>
            <p>III. To tell <hi>you of ſinning,</hi> I ſuppoſe will be taken
for <hi>fiery fury;</hi> or a Reproach of the Godly: But I
may tell you why I am not of <hi>your mind,</hi> and what <hi>ſin</hi>
I think <hi>I ſhould be guilty of,</hi> if I were.</p>
            <p>1. God made it a duty for Parents ſolemnly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Children, by Dedication, into the Covenant
of God (as is oft proved.) And how will men an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the non-performance hereof any more than their
<hi>not Praying for them,</hi> or <hi>not feeding or Cloathing them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>What a ſin is it to</hi> rob Chriſt of ſo great a part of
his Church?</p>
            <p>3. What a ſin ſo to deny the <hi>Goſpel Grace</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi>
and to hide ſo much of the <hi>Love of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61144:17"/>
4. What a ſin ſo far to confound the ſtate of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
and <hi>Pagans,</hi> as to their Childrens bleſſing?</p>
            <p>5. What a ſin ſo to <hi>enlarge and honour the Devils
Kingdom,</hi> as to give him all mankind viſibly, till they
come to age?</p>
            <p>6. What a ſin to <hi>rob Parents</hi> of ſo much of their
due comfort.</p>
            <p>7. What a ſin to deprive ſo many millions of <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-pardon,
Grace</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> by hindering the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and conſent?</p>
            <p>8. What a ſin thus to <hi>change</hi> and <hi>take from</hi> the
Word, yea from the very Covenant of God?</p>
            <p>9. What a ſin to vilifie ſo great Mercy, as if it were
none, and to preach ſuch ingratitude?</p>
            <p>10. What a ſin ſo to diſhonour Chriſt, as if ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
ſo much more than his Grace, as that all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
being viſibly condemned, not one in the world
is viſibly pardoned or juſtified?</p>
            <p>11. Yea to make Chriſt ſo like Satan and contrary
<hi>to himſelf,</hi> as to come into the world to caſt or keep
all mankind in Infancy out of the Church and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace; And when his <hi>Name is called Jeſus,</hi>
becauſe <hi>he ſaveth his people from their ſins,</hi> he will take
none for <hi>his people,</hi> till age, nor <hi>ſave</hi> any Infant viſibly
from ſin, either guilt or habit, and ſo be <hi>no Jeſus</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
but the Adult, that we can know of: when yet
before his comeing it was otherwiſe; And ſo to make
the Goſpel much harder than the Law, and the yoak
of Chriſt harder than the yoak of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>12. Yea and to make the Goſpel Church more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and unhappy than all the Pagan Nations were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
whoſe Children might have been Proſelited with
the Parents.</p>
            <p>13. What a ſin is it to teach men to be thus unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and cruel to their Off-ſpring?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61144:17"/>
14. What a ſin to teach all that are not Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
that they break no Baptiſmal Vow or Covenant,
nor ſin againſt it, becauſe they never were Baptized.</p>
            <p>15. And is it nothing ſo to <hi>croſs our Prayers, [Let
thy Kingdom come]</hi> and to pray and endeavour that
Chriſts Kingdom may not extend to any of mankind,
till they actually at age believe.</p>
            <p>But the great difficulty which it will be expected
that I reſolve, is, Whether I do not imply, That all
the Children of true Chriſtians dedicated to God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſaving Grace in their Infancy, many after fall
from it, ſeing experience tells us, that too many prove
ungodly.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, 1. So much of Scripture, and ſo great
and many Mercies muſt not be all denyed, when a
difficulty ariſeth in the way, which we cannot at the
preſent anſwer: Elſe what would become of moſt
mens Chriſtianity it ſelf?</p>
            <p>2. This was no difficulty to the antient Fathers, no
not to <hi>Auguſtin</hi> and his followers, and ſo to all the
known Church of Chriſt for a thouſand years after the
Apoſtles, who commonly held that even of the Adult,
many fall from true Grace, Juſtification, and a ſtate of
Life; ſome appropriating perſeverance to the <hi>Elect,</hi>
(as <hi>Auſtin)</hi> and ſome to the <hi>confirmed in Grace,</hi> and
ſome to both.</p>
            <p>3. It is hard that they that cannot extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
out of ſuch difficulties, will but reproach thoſe
that offer them their help: But this is not the firſt
time that I have ventured upon their Ingratitude: I
ſpeak of it ſtill as a difficulty; but what I have ſaid in
my <hi>[More Reaſons for Infants Church-memberſhip.]</hi>
ſeemeth moſt probable to me, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. All Chriſtians confeſs that <hi>Adam</hi> fell from a ſtate
of Salvation, or right to Life, at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:61144:18"/>
2. <hi>Adams</hi> Grace which he loſt, was a <hi>Power to Love
God, and obey him,</hi> which he could uſe or ſuſpend.</p>
            <p>3. Beyond a meer <hi>Power,</hi> there is in the ſanctified by
the in-dwelling Spirit of Adoption; <hi>Gracious Habits</hi>
of Love and Obedience: What <hi>Adam</hi> had of this I
am not here to determine.</p>
            <p>4. Beyond meer weak <hi>Habits,</hi> there is in ſome,
<hi>ſuch Habits</hi> as are <hi>ſtrong, confirmed</hi> and <hi>radicated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(5. And in <hi>Heaven</hi> above all theſe, there is <hi>full
Perfection.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I apply this, 1. <hi>Actual</hi> and <hi>Habitual, Love</hi>
and <hi>Obedience,</hi> is in the <hi>ſanctified</hi> Adult by the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling</hi>
Spirit; For <hi>Actual</hi> Love and Obedience is
<hi>their Duty,</hi> which the Habit is joyned to.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Vocation</hi> giveth <hi>Faith and Repentance</hi> in <hi>Act,</hi> with
ſome <hi>ſeminal diſpoſition</hi> to the ſaid Acts and Habits of
Love and Obedience, (as <hi>Ameſius Medull. de Orat.)</hi>
not yet <hi>Habits;</hi> and this <hi>Vocation</hi> goeth before <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
Faith</hi> being the Condition on which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Adoption and Sanctification is promiſed.</p>
            <p>3. So much Grace may be given to <hi>Infants,</hi> as was
to <hi>Adam,</hi> as to <hi>meer Power</hi> to do what he did not, and
as the Dominicans call <hi>ſufficient,</hi> or <hi>neceſſary Grace;</hi>
and perhaps ſuch as is the <hi>innitial</hi> Diſpoſition before
full Sanctification. And this much may qualifie them
for preſent <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> For <hi>Actual Love
and Obedience</hi> is not their Duty, and conſequently not
the <hi>proper habit,</hi> beyond a <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>ſeminal Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as of neceſſity to their firſt ſtate of Grace: And
as <hi>Adam loſt this much,</hi> ſo may they.</p>
            <p>4. The <hi>Sanctifying Spirit</hi> of <hi>Adoption,</hi> is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to Infants to work ſuch <hi>Acts</hi> in them as they are
not yet capable of, nor ſuch <hi>Habits,</hi> as in Gods uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
order follow ſuch Acts; But he is <hi>Related</hi> to them as
their <hi>Sanctifier,</hi> becauſe Chriſt will ſend the Spirit as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61144:18"/>
they come to the uſe of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to help them in <hi>holy
Acts,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Habits,</hi> if they forfeit not his help.
Which ſome do (beſides the perfidious neglect of
Parents) and ſo loſe that Infant-Grace.</p>
            <p>5. But all <hi>Gods Elect</hi> ſhall certainly have more than
this <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>ſufficient, neceſſary,</hi> loſable <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition,</hi>
and ſhall at age have actual Faith, Love, and
Obedience if they live.</p>
            <p>6. What ever Infant dyeth in the ſtate of that <hi>Grace</hi> &amp;
<hi>Diſpoſition</hi> (which we call <hi>ſufficient,</hi> &amp; in its nature was
as loſeable as <hi>Adams)</hi> ſhall be perfected in his acceſs to
the perfecting Glory (as all imperfect Saints are,)
and is one of the Elect, and ſhall by Promiſe be ſaved:
(allowing degrees of Glory:) If there be no need,
or evidence of this ſolution, and you have any other
ſurer way, then caſt this by as <hi>[rotten dictating.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I have given you an account of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view:
But yet I here repeat again;<q>That if you
would be contented your ſelves, to ſatisfie your
own Conſciences to be Re-baptized, (as one that
doubted whether he were well Marryed would ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
it by being Marryed over again) and would
afterward live peaceably in communion with your
Brethren, and not appropriate Church-communion
to your Sect. And if you would not deny our Infant
part in the Covenant of Grace, the promiſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and life by Chriſt, and our Infant Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip,
and only delayed the <hi>Baptiſmal Inveſtiture,</hi>
as <hi>Tertullian</hi> deſired, for the more ſolemn inaugura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and obligation; Though I ſhould not be of
your mind, I ſhould live in as loving forbearance
and Communion with you, as with other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But if when we are for Peace, you are for Church-Wars,
and cannot differ from us without Dividing,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61144:19"/>
Unchurching, Unchriſtening, avoiding, and even Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
or Slandering almoſt all the Chriſtians in this
and former ages, in ſuch things I will have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with you.</p>
            <p>The Fathers likened <hi>Re-ordaining,</hi> and <hi>Re-baptizing.</hi>
If any would ſatisfie his own Conſcience with being <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
again</hi> for ſurety, not Unchurching, Degrading,
Avoiding, Reproaching, Perſecuting thoſe that are not
of his mind, I would break no peace with ſuch a <hi>Re-ordained</hi>
Perſon: But if the <hi>Re-ordaining Sectaries</hi> will
ſay as you, <hi>Our way only is right, we only are the true
Miniſters</hi> and <hi>Churches,</hi> and turn like to Donatiſts, I
am not of their mind.</p>
            <p>And I here profeſs, that while I tell you of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from <hi>your Extream,</hi> it implyeth no liking of the
<hi>contrary extream</hi> of thoſe that would confound the
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> &amp; the <hi>Heathens,</hi> ſo far as equally to Baptiſe
all their Children, if any Baptized perſon will but
perfidiouſly promiſe that for them, which they never
made any intelligent man believe that ever they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to perform: Nor can I love the <hi>Hypocritical Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which turneth almoſt all into Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony,
as if they had to do with none but Children;
nor the turning of <hi>Catechiſing</hi> and <hi>Confirmation</hi> into a
<hi>lifeleſs Formality,</hi> to be inſtead of a <hi>ſerious Profeſſion at
age, of the Chriſtian Covenant, and a ſolemn intelligent
tranſition to the Church Priviledges of the Adult.</hi> I
know that it is Satans game, firſt to draw Hypocrites
to <hi>mortifie</hi> Gods Ordinances, and turn Religion into an
<hi>Image</hi> or a <hi>Carkaſs;</hi> and thence to ſtir up others in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sects, inſtead of <hi>Reviving</hi> them, to <hi>Loath</hi> and
<hi>Bury</hi> them. Woe to the World becauſe of Offences,
and Woe to them by whom they come.</p>
            <p>Before I come to my <hi>Fourth</hi> Part, which is my <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi>
to my ſelf, I muſt take notice of ſome more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61144:19"/>
of your <hi>Applicatory</hi> Letter in the way: And if I diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
repeat ſome things, in following ſo diſordered a
Leader, you (at leaſt, whatever others do) muſt take it
patiently, it being far ſhort of the tedious work which
you ſeem to call for: You would have Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi>
his Letter Anſwered, and you would have better
Proof for Infant Baptiſm. It is not <hi>in my power</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the <hi>Reaſons</hi> of my two Books, which you <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
take for none,</hi> to <hi>be no ſound Reaſons;</hi> nor to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
Mr. <hi>Danvers his Books</hi> not to be ſuch a <hi>bundle of
moſt groſs miſtakes and Vutruths,</hi> as I ſcarce ever before
met with, from a profeſſed Chriſtian. If I miſtake, it
is not in my power to do otherwiſe, were I to die
this hour. And if I have offended the Anabaptiſts by
a faithful perſwading them to <hi>Repent</hi> of the doleful
work which they have made in <hi>England,</hi> my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
more accuſeth me for doing it <hi>no more,</hi> than for
doing ſo much. If you take all men for as bad as you
deſcribe me, that <hi>wiſh your Repentance</hi> for <hi>ſuch works,</hi>
and alſo for our <hi>woful Church Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>differ from
you about Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> and that yet beg for <hi>mutual
forbearance,</hi> and <hi>peaceable Communion with you,</hi> I am
not of <hi>your ſpirit or mind, and hope neither to live nor
die in ſo narrow a Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for any more Anſwering any of you, thoſe
that I converſe with, tell me it is needleſs; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
that I have been drawn by Contenders ſo often
to interrupt more uſeful work. If more be needful,
let them do it that have leiſure, and longer life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You ſay, that</hi> It is now a common queſtion whether ever
I will die a Martyr?</p>
            <p>I am ſorry that your Acquaintance are hardened,
and uſed to queſtions that ſo little concern them, and
that are ſo unmeet for their Determination: If Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be the beſt State, how happy hath this Kingdom
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61144:20"/>
been made by the OVERTURNERS? Do you mean
that you doubt whether ever the Anabaptiſts will have
Power enough to effect it? they attempting what
they did againſt me too late, juſt when they and their
Co-partners were a pulling down themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?
Or do you mean, that till we are Martyred
we are not capable of your good Opinion? (And are
all the Anabaptiſts Graceleſs that are yet Unmartyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Or have more Anabaptiſts than Poedobaptiſts
been Martyred in our times?) Or is it only your
Prognoſtick on ſuppoſition of my Tryal? I have more
cauſe to diſtruſt my ſelf, and beg Gods ſtrengthning
Grace, than boaſtingly to foretel, <hi>Though all men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

others ſuffering by proxie for me]</hi> doth but ſhew that you
have not that care of avoiding Falſhoods in matter of
Fact, which might invite us to think that you are
liker than others to be ſound in Doctrine. But had
you not miſtaken, yet I might have admoniſhed you,
not to have condemned every Anabaptiſt that hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
a groſſer <hi>flight,</hi> than a ſick mans going for his
health into the Countrey, when he had neither any
<hi>Flock,</hi> nor <hi>Vndertaking,</hi> nor <hi>Call</hi> to hinder him: At

<hi>Aegypt,</hi> or withdrawing into <hi>the Wilderneſs,</hi> and <hi>into

            <p>2. I have ſo many years looked for my appearing
at the Tribunal of Chriſt, that if I ſhould not be true
to that Light which doth appear to me, I were more
unexcuſable than yet you think me. But will <hi>your

            <p>3. Eſpecially when you ſo unintelligibly recite my

Not that I remember? Such writing as this of

thirty Scripture Teſtimonies or Arguments for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
Mercies, we that ſee no reaſon to invalidate them,
will not ſo deſpiſe God and his Laws and Benefits, as
to deny or reject all, becauſe ſuch a man as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it, and tells us that they are all invalid. If we
muſt take our <hi>Faith on Truſt:</hi> it were more excuſable
to take it from Councils, than from you.</p>
            <p>I have told you my judgement herein ſo often, that
it is the more diſingenuous in you to give it in ſuch
ſenſeleſs or ambiguous words, as <hi>[A Baptiſmal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
running in a Fleſhly Line.] Gods Covenant as
Inſtituted, runs</hi> no where; but is recorded in the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Preached,</hi> and Miniſterially applyed by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
<hi>Mans Convenanting Act,</hi> is abſurdly ſaid to <hi>[run
in a Fleſhly Line.]</hi> But men that <hi>have Fleſh</hi> as well
as <hi>Souls,</hi> do <hi>accept Gods Covenant,</hi> and enter <hi>themſelves</hi>
and <hi>Infants</hi> in the mutual Convenant by dedicating
both to God. <hi>Natural Generation</hi> (communicating
<hi>eſſence)</hi> maketh your Children to be <hi>naturally yours,</hi>
which is ſo <hi>neer an intereſt,</hi> that <hi>Original Sin</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
tells us that God eſteemeth not our <hi>Children na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
guiltleſs</hi> of the Parents Crimes: And he hath
provided a <hi>Remedy</hi> for both, and not for the <hi>Parents</hi>
or <hi>Adult only:</hi> And the Remedy is a <hi>pardoning ſaving
Covenant</hi> procured by a Mediator. This Convenant is
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61144:21"/>
               <hi>Vniverſal</hi> to the Adult, as offered on the condition of
Believing acceptance: And is there <hi>no Promiſe, no
Covenant</hi> for <hi>Infants?</hi> Why ſo? Have they no <hi>need
of Pardon,</hi> and a <hi>Saviour?</hi> or are they left <hi>remedileſs</hi>
as the Devils? Or is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of their Salvation
<hi>without any Condition?</hi> If ſo, is it <hi>to all,</hi> or to <hi>ſome</hi>
only? if <hi>to all,</hi> and ſo <hi>all are Chriſts members,</hi> then
all <hi>(Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans)</hi> Children ſhould be Church-members.
This were to make it run <hi>unto a Fleſhly
Line</hi> indeed? If not <hi>to all,</hi> to <hi>whom,</hi> or to <hi>how many?</hi>
Is it to more than twenty in the world? or more to
Chriſtians Children than others? If it be a <hi>Promiſe</hi> of
<hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> and neither tell to <hi>how many,</hi> nor <hi>to
whom;</hi> 1. This is a ſtrange Promiſe, and is no <hi>mutual
Covenant?</hi> Shew us where in Scripture we may find
it? 2. This then muſt be <hi>another Species</hi> of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace, diſtinct from the Baptiſmal Covenant;
and to feign and add a <hi>ſecond ſort of Covenant</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of adding to the Word of God, than adding
of Ceremonies is. And who can ſay in all the world,
that <hi>any Child of his</hi> hath any part in ſuch a Promiſe?
or that Pagans have not as much of it as Chriſtians?
All Promiſes of Pardon to the <hi>Adult</hi> are <hi>conditional,</hi>
and <hi>ſome means</hi> for certain Title is preſcribed? Is there
<hi>no means</hi> for the certain pardon of our Infants?</p>
            <p>2. But if you will ſay that it is <hi>conditional, what is
that Condition?</hi> That which I have ſtill ſaid is this,
The Condition is, that <hi>they be the Children of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
dedicated to God:</hi> not meerly that they be our <hi>Fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Line;</hi> that doth but make <hi>them ours,</hi> and (with
Gods Law) enable and oblige us to <hi>dedicate</hi> them in
Covenant to him: But being thus <hi>in our power,</hi> and <hi>our
Wills</hi> for them as <hi>their own,</hi> it is <hi>our dedicating them to
God,</hi> that is the <hi>immediate Condition:</hi> And every true
Chriſtian doth <hi>dedicate himſelf, and his Children to God,</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61144:22"/>
as far as he thinks himſelf enabled: This <hi>dedication</hi> is
<hi>virtually</hi> in our <hi>own actual ſanctification,</hi> and <hi>actually</hi>
when we have <hi>Children,</hi> which is <hi>ſolemnized in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
What we devote to God by his Will he doth
accept: And we can ſhew his Promiſes to the Seed of
his Servants, and will not plead againſt our Mercies.
Should we Apoſtatize our ſelves, the Mercies promiſed
to the generations of them that love God, would be
intercepted, and would not run to a <hi>Fleſhly Line:</hi>
But an <hi>Infant by Believers dedicated to God,</hi> is not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi>
but <hi>holy,</hi> and ſo better than a meer <hi>Fleſhly Line.</hi>
To pour out your Clamours againſt our <hi>Proof, full and
plain proof,</hi> of this, from the whole current of the
Scripture, and to vaunt, and talk with ſuch Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
as you do in the dark, as if all this were un-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
(and the very ſecond Commandment were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
caſt out, and Gods own Proclamation of his
Name, <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7.)</hi> and to call for more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
while you cry out of too much; and to talk
againſt <hi>dictating,</hi> while you thus obtrude your <hi>Quaker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Oratory,</hi> Contempt, &amp; Obteſtations, inſtead of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
and Anſwers; this muſt not make us unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Deſpiſers of the Promiſes of God. If you would
thus Hector men out of their <hi>Inheritances,</hi> or the title
of their Infants to them, few would think you argued
cogently: And ſhould the words of ſuch ſelf-conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſingular perſons, which we take to be againſt the
ſcope of Scripture, and conſent of Chriſts Church,
make us give up all Infants Convenant-title to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip,
Pardon and Salvation? You read fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in the Gazetts, that many ſet ſo much by
their Dogs, as to cry them about, and offer great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to thoſe that find them, and will bring them
home; And ſhall all Chriſtians ſet ſo little by their
<hi>Children</hi> (and ſo by all <hi>our own Infant Priviledges)</hi> as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:61144:22"/>
to be hector'd out of our <hi>hopes,</hi> and renounce their <hi>great
and precious Promiſes,</hi> which number them with the
<hi>houſhold</hi> of God: and that by ſuch Rhetorical Canting
as a man of equal wit may uſe, in almoſt any other
Controverſie?</p>
            <p>As <hi>Cicero</hi> wondered at them that pleaded againſt the
<hi>immortality of the Soul,</hi> that ever men would be ſuch
enemies to themſelves, as to ſtudy for reaſons againſt
their own intereſt and hopes; ſo I ſay, Though our
meer Intereſt prove nothing to be true, it tells us,
what we ſhould <hi>deſire;</hi> and when we find <hi>Gods word</hi>
ſo excellently suited to <hi>our Intereſt,</hi> let them diſpute
againſt it that will, for I will not. Let the Enemies of
mankind or of Chriſtians, plead againſt the Intereſt of
mankind and of Chriſtians, and not themſelves.</p>
            <p>It's an unavoidable ſtreight that we are in, between
them that ſilence and ruine us in this world, among
ſuch other things, for not profeſſing our <hi>Aſſent,</hi> that
<hi>[It is certain by the Word of God, that Infants Baptized</hi>
(none in the world excepted) <hi>and dying before actual
ſin, are certainly</hi> Saved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>] not allowing us to preach
Chriſts Goſpel if we cannot ſay that all <hi>This is certain;</hi>
(were it <hi>Faith in Chriſt himſelf,</hi> the <hi>weak in Faith</hi>
ſhould be received;) and <hi>ſuch as you</hi> on the other ſide,
that account us even <hi>Heretical</hi> if we will not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful
to God, as to deny and reject the <hi>precious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
Hopes,</hi> and <hi>Church-relation</hi> of our Children.
You know that with what meaſure you mete it is mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
to you again by many; and that no ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Chriſtians have numbred Anabaptiſts with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
and yet I that have dealt otherwiſe with you,
am your moſt <hi>fiery Adverſary?</hi> And why? Any judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
By-ſtander may ſee, though <hi>you cannot:</hi> juſt as
as <hi>W. Pen</hi> lately ſeemed to think more favourably of
me than of others, till in an open diſpute I had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61144:23"/>
the evil of his cauſe; and then <hi>[he had rather
be a</hi> Socrates <hi>at judgment, than ſuch a nominal Chriſtian
as I:</hi> ſo you and your Brethren that are like you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a Book or two of mine have croſs'd the Intereſt
of your Party, think I deſerve all that you pronounce
of or againſt me; ſo powerful is Intereſt with moſt
mens underſtandings: ſo far as it is your <hi>miſtake of
the Intereſt of Chriſt</hi> that does miſlead you, I eaſily bear
it as the infirmity of a weak and prejudiced judgment:
But ſo far as it is the intereſt of <hi>your Party</hi> which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
againſt the publick intereſt of Chriſts Church it
is <hi>ſelfiſh,</hi> and ſuch as is deſcribed at large in <hi>James</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>As for your talk of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his words againſt
my <hi>Heterodoxes in other matters,</hi> and your ſupercili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
inſulting as if he were <hi>unanſwered,</hi> I ſay, 1. I
take him to be <hi>fully anſwered,</hi> and if <hi>you do not,</hi> that
proveth it not to be as you affirm. 2. What more
ſhould I anſwer? What doth he but recite ſome
ſcrap of my words? Had he done it <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>fully,</hi>
had that been any Argument againſt them? Do I need
to anſwer my <hi>own words,</hi> before any Charge againſt
them be proved, or proof once attempted? Was it
not enough for me to lay down the <hi>Contraries</hi> to my
Doctrines, and leave the Reader to chooſe which he
ſeeth beſt? Dare you not <hi>own the Contraries,</hi> and yet
continue your accuſation of <hi>my words?</hi> Would not
the World (whom I blame not if they think that I
have written too many Books already) condemn me
for a fool indeed, if in the condition that I am in, the
Cant of ſuch men as he and you, ſhould draw me to
write another Volumn in Defence of a Volumn that
defendeth it ſelf to all judicious Impartial Readers,
and that againſt one that <hi>proveth nothing</hi> in it to be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61144:23"/>
And as for thoſe that will not <hi>impartially peruſe the
words</hi> accuſed, I have no reaſon to think that they will
make any better uſe of a <hi>Defence</hi> if I ſhould write it?
And as I am paſt doubt that Mr. <hi>D</hi>'s Quarrels, and
your Juſtification of them, are the effect of <hi>meer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
ſelf-conceit, partiality,</hi> and <hi>paſſion;</hi> ſo if <hi>you</hi>
prove to be the <hi>knowing men,</hi> and <hi>I</hi> the <hi>ignorant,</hi> I am
ſure it is not through my neglect of Study, nor unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs
to know or own the Truth: And I have no
cauſe to envy you the felicity of your greater Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
But if it be a Wiſdom that tendeth to <hi>bitter
ſtrife</hi> and to <hi>confuſion,</hi> and deſtroyeth your Love to
thoſe that differ from you, I will remember that my
<hi>peace</hi> lyeth more on my Love to you, than on yours or
any mans elſe to me.</p>
            <p>As for your talk about my words in my firſt book
that ſome <hi>did then Baptize naked,</hi> I have given you a
true anſwer. To contradict what I ſaid, were to lie:
I <hi>know</hi> not that you Baptize any at all but by report of
others; and ſo I heard that then of ſome ſo credibly as
that I am not able now becauſe you call for proof al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
thirty years after, to disbelieve it: I undertake
not to <hi>prove it now;</hi> (nor that the <hi>Quakers</hi> then uſed
to Quake or Vomit, ſeeing now no ſuch thing is ſeen
among them:) If really it was a miſreport, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any Baptized naked in <hi>England,</hi> nor in other
Lands, I wiſh that no man may believe it. But did Mr.
<hi>Danvers</hi> take this for ſo heynous an injury, and yet
himſelf in2 Books labour to prove, that <hi>for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years Baptizing naked was the ordinary Cuſtome!</hi> O
how far will partiality blind men? Was it the Cuſtome
of all the Churches, and yet a Reproach to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
to ſay that at one time divers did ſo, if fame,
not then denyed by any of thoſe Anabaptiſts that I
converſt with, may be believed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61144:24"/>
To conclude, Sir, The importunity of Mr. <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
and you have not been unprofitable to me: It
hath cauſed me, as you deſired, to Review my old
thoughts of Infants Church-memberſhip and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and to renew my thanks to the God of Mercy,
who hath not left all the <hi>World</hi> in their Infancy unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
nor without a Promiſe or Covenant of Grace;
nor left Chriſtian Parents to mourn for their dead In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
as thoſe that are without hope of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and have no Promiſe on which to ground their
hope: It hath renewed my ſenſe of the great obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that lyeth on believing Parents, both of gratitude
to God, and duty for their Children: It tells me that
they may now love their Children, as the members of
the Church of Chriſt, and need not, nay muſt not
take them as members of the Kingdom of the Devil;
nor yet ſtretch their Brains to prove that there is a
middle Region (like <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or <hi>Limbus Infantum</hi>
hereafter) between the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the
Kingdom of the Devil; And that it is a ſad employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for Parents to diſpute their own Children out of
the Bleſſings of Gods Covenant, and to prove them
to be in Satans Kingdom, and not in Chriſts: Yea it
hath reminded me how much the Intereſt of Infants
in their Parents caſe is founded by God in nature it
ſelf, and to bleſs God for that inſcription in Stone of
the ſecond Commandment, and that marvellous voice
from Heaven, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7. I believe that the Synod of
<hi>Dort</hi> ſaid truly, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 17. That Faithful Parents need
not doubt of the Election and Salvation of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
dying in Infancy, (before the violation of the
Baptiſmal Covenant.)</p>
            <p>And ſeeing God hath pronounced our Children <hi>holy,</hi>
and not unclean, and told us that <hi>of ſuch is the
Kingdom of God,</hi> it remindeth me how careful Parents
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61144:24"/>
ſhould be, as thankfully to dedicate them to God, ſo
carefully to educate them according to their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
remembering that as the Parents Conſent and
dedication of them to God, is the Condition of their
firſt right to the Covenant benefits, ſo thoſe Parents
do <hi>Promiſe</hi> their pious education; and if they after
prove falſe in ſuch Promiſes on their part, they muſt
not charge God with unfaithfulneſs, if it go worſe
with their Children than on ſuppoſition of the Parents
fidelity it had done; (though ſtill at age they may
be accepted upon Repentance and perſonal Belief:]
Of which Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> hath written more judiciouſly
than any on that point that I remember.</p>
            <p>Alſo I have been hereby made thankful that God
kept me from the ſnare of Anabaptiſtry; for though I
lay not ſo much as ſome do on the <hi>meer outward act or
water of Baptiſm,</hi> believing that our <hi>heart conſent and
dedication</hi> qualifieth Infants for a <hi>Covenant Right</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>actual Baptiſm</hi> (which yet is Chriſts regular ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnization
and inveſtiture,) yet I make a great
matter of the main Controverſie, notwithſtanding that
I <hi>hereticate</hi> not the Anabaptiſts for the bare opinion
ſake, nor would have them perſecuted; for now I
better ſee than ever what God hath thus preſerved me
from.</p>
            <p>1. How much elſe might I have been led to, that
tendeth towards the <hi>denying the Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi>
and denying <hi>him to be the Saviour of the world;</hi> yea
how neer might I have been led towards the making
him to be the <hi>Deſtroyer, or Abaddon,</hi> as comeing into
the World to <hi>condemn the world,</hi> and to take <hi>from them
the Promiſes and Hopes of Salvation:</hi> For, 1. I find
that <hi>all are loſt in Adam,</hi> and that <hi>God made an Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Covenant of Grace</hi> with fallen mankind in <hi>Adam</hi>
after his fall, and renewed it with <hi>Noah:</hi> I find that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61144:25"/>
it is but a ſmall part of the world that had the <hi>Law of
Moſes,</hi> the Jews being to the earth, but as one Village
to <hi>England;</hi> and to be King but of a <hi>Village</hi> is not to
be King of <hi>England.</hi> I find that the making of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi>
or <hi>Moſes</hi> his Covenant was <hi>no repeal</hi> of the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Law of Grace;</hi> nor put them into a worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than he found them in. And I find that paſt all
doubt Infants were Church-members, and in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
before Chriſts Incarnation, not only the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
but the Uncircumciſed Females, and all the
Uncircumciſed Males in the Wilderneſs, yea and out
of the Jewiſh Nation, as well as in it, (though the
Covenant of <hi>Peculiarity</hi> was proper to them.)</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding all this, I find, 1. that
many now do exclude all the world out of Chriſts
Kingdom before his Incarnation, except the Jews,
or at leaſt a few rare individuals more, when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
hoped there had been fifty Righteous in <hi>Sodome.</hi>
2. That the ſame men ſuppoſe that ſince Chriſts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,
the old Law of Grace made to mankind in
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> is repealed, and they that cannot
have the Goſpel are left under the meer Law of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
or none. 3. And that <hi>all mankind</hi> in their <hi>Infant
ſtate</hi> is put or left out of the Church of Chriſt, and the
Covenant of Life.</p>
            <p>And had I been ſeduced into all this, 1. To hold
that for 4000 years Chriſt had a Kingdom no bigger
than <hi>England.</hi> 2. That he came to deprive all the
world that have not his Goſpel, of the former Law of
Grace that was made to them. 3. And that he came
to caſt out of their Church-ſtate, or Covenant-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<hi>all mankind while they are Infants;</hi> and to leave us
no hope that is grounded on his Covenant or Promiſe
of any Infants Salvation, or any deſcription or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
whatſoever: Alas, what ſhould I have been
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61144:25"/>
led to? and what guilt againſt Chriſt, and of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Infidelity, ſhould I have incurred, under the
pretenſe of promoting the purity of his Kingdom?</p>
            <p>II. And if God had thus left me, I had been likely
(as I ſee by others) to have gone yet farther, and
narrowed the Goſpel Church it ſelf ſo much, as to
have confined it to the Anabaptiſts; or to have thought
all the reſt of the Chriſtian world uncapable of Church
Communion; I might have come to revile the Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine
of Gods gracious Promiſe or Covenant to our
Children, as <hi>Abſurd</hi> and <hi>Heretical;</hi> and when Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
is the complexion of Goſpel obedience, this <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi>
might have been mine.</p>
            <p>III. And then I ſhould likely have been left to a
proud over-valuing of my own Opinion, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of my Wiſdom and Integrity, as quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all the Chriſtian worlds that differ from me:
And out of a ſelfiſh unobſerved adherence to my own
conceits, to have magnified the Sect that was of my
own mind, above all others.</p>
            <p>IV. And then I might have been ſeduced to have
had a hand in all the Turnings and Overturnings, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up and pulling down, Praying and Unpraying,
Owning and Diſowning, Bloody dayes and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings
for them, that were ſince <hi>Triplo Heaths-Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi>
till 1660. and more than ſo, to have juſtified
them in others, yea and that after Gods moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
diſowning them; yea and to have abhorred and
derided the very name and motion of <hi>Repentance</hi> for
them, and to have deſpiſed the Religious Retreat of
<hi>Nath. Ward,</hi> a wiſe though jocular Interpendent,
though <hi>Repentance</hi> be the only <hi>Plank</hi> after Shipwrack,
and the great and merciful conceſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>V. I might have been drawn hereby to divide
Chriſts Kingdom, and to ſet up Antichurches, whoſe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61144:26"/>
employment ſhould be to cry down others, and draw
men into odious thoughts of one another, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
Chriſtian Love and Concord in the world.</p>
            <p>VI. And hereby I might have been one that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Profeſſors to turn Quakers, Seekers, or Ranters,
to have finiſhed the work that I began.</p>
            <p>VII. I might have been tempted to do all this as
in the <hi>Name of Chriſt,</hi> and for his <hi>Truth, Word</hi> and
<hi>Church;</hi> and ſo to have entitled God to all, and put
his holy Name to theſe works of Darkneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his own Commiſſion for my oppoſing him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>VIII.</hi> I might have been tempted hereby to write
Letters as long and vehement as yours, in as or<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

with my Adverſary for <hi>want of an Anſwer</hi> or <hi>proof,</hi>
when indeed it were the <hi>ſucceſs of his Anſwers</hi> &amp; <hi>Cogent
Proofs,</hi> prevailing with multitudes againſt my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that was the true cauſe of my anger: and when
partiality had filled my heart with bitterneſs againſt
my Brother for ſuch ſucceſs, I might have been drawn
to cover all from my ſelf and others, by accuſing him
of <hi>fieryneſs or folly</hi> in generals, and by ſummoning
him to Repentance and <hi>Recantation,</hi> as the Quakers
do, by the <hi>dreadful Tribunal of God,</hi> when I cannot
reſiſt the Scripture evidence which he bringeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IX.</hi> And I might have been tempted when once
Prepoſſeſſion, Prejudice &amp; Intereſt of Reputation had
engaged me to ſo bad a cauſe, to have ſtudyed all that
I can rake together to maintain it; and to have
ſtretch'd all my wits to have oppoſed all that is
brought againſt it, and to have made it the chief <hi>work
and Religion of my life,</hi> in which my thoughts, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
time and induſtry ſhould be laid out to carry on
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61144:26"/>
this miſtaken and deſtructive cauſe, and to keep the
Churches of Chriſt from Loving-Unity, Communion
and Peace, till they will all unite againſt <hi>Infants
Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm,</hi> which they never
did, nor never will do: Yea, and I muſt have
taught all Chriſtian Parents, that though they muſt
love their Children as they are <hi>their own,</hi> (as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
do) yet that they muſt not <hi>Love any one Infant</hi>
in the world, as a <hi>Member of Christ,</hi> or <hi>of his Church,</hi>
and <hi>in his Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>X.</hi> And by all this, what a <hi>Scandal</hi> ſhould I have
given to the <hi>Atheiſts, Infidels, Papiſts and Profane,</hi> to
harden them in their Contempt of Godlineſs, and
Deriſion, or Accuſations of Religious men; as if
all ſerious Religion among us were but Pride, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
Humour and Hypocriſie, and a Cloak for
our Mala<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies and Crimes. Yea I might have tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to Perſecution, and quieted their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>ſilencing Christs Miniſters,</hi> for the ſake of ſuch,
whom they think they uſe not ſo ill as they deſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XI.</hi> And alaſs what a diſtraction and ſcandal ſhould
I have cauſed to the ignorant and weak, when they
ſee ſo <hi>many wayes,</hi> and hear men calling them <hi>this way</hi>
and <hi>that way,</hi> and terrifying them with Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the charge of Sin, if they be not of <hi>this
mind or of that,</hi> till poor people (that have a plain
Rule left them by Chriſt) are driven out of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or out of their Wits, as not knowing of what
ſide and way to be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XII.</hi> And I ſhould have been like enough to have
been drawn into the <hi>guilt of Perſecution</hi> my ſelf, while I
cryed out againſt Perſecution. I might have <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
my Brethren with my Tongue, and thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to the promoting of the cauſe of God, to blaſt
their juſt Reputation, and to make them by falſhoods
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61144:27"/>
to become deſpiſed, leſt their names ſhould hinder my
deſign. Yea, who knows but I might my ſelf have
joyned with thoſe whom you judged the perſecuting
Silencers of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Ruiners of the
Churches Peace, by endeavouring the continuance of
thoſe <hi>ſame Impoſitions,</hi> and <hi>keeping Miniſters out of the
publick Miniſtry,</hi> and <hi>depriving them of all the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Maintenance,</hi> which in the judgment of the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
themſelves is <hi>heynous ſin,</hi> and all this leſt Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Altering ſuch Impoſitions (unleſs they will
do it as far as the ſaid perſons deſire) ſhould weaken
their Party, and leave them under greater diſagvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages;
and to have thus deſired mens <hi>impenitent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance</hi>
of that which is accounted <hi>heynous Perſecution</hi>
and <hi>Devaſtation</hi> of the Churches, and <hi>ſtarving</hi> many
<hi>thouſand Souls,</hi> and <hi>undoing Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and their <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
might have made all this to be my <hi>own</hi> by <hi>ſuch
conſent,</hi> yea and <hi>endeavour;</hi> and the pitiful ſhift of
<hi>[oppoſing a Comprehenſion, to keep off our own Sufferings,
or our weakening, and the dividing of the Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.]</hi>
might have been an Opiate to my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
for ſo heynous an Iniquity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>XIII.</hi> Yea, who knows but I might have come to
that inhumanity, and immodeſty as to falſifie publick
Hiſtory, againſt the common notice of all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
world; and to have faced down mankind that the
<hi>Novatians</hi> were againſt <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> and ſo were
the <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> and that <hi>Auſtin</hi> wrote divers Books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, as holding that Opinion; and that the
<hi>Brittains</hi> of old were of the ſame mind, and the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi>
ſince, and <hi>Wickliffe</hi> alſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if Learned
men had wondred at my impudence, I might have
comforted my ſelf that my followers will believe me:
yea and to have furiouſly calumniated thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
my ſin, and call me to Repentance, and to have
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61144:27"/>
reproached them as <hi>fooliſh and fiery</hi> who will defend
the Mercies of Chriſt, and their Infant hopes and title
to pardon and ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Theſe and many more evils I might have been ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
into, if <hi>I</hi> had yielded to thoſe reaſonings that
would have drawn me to deny the Graces of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and which in my youth once did cauſe ſome
<hi>doubting</hi> in me, till <hi>I</hi> diligently ſtudyed the point; my
ignorance of the true nature of the Covenant and
Baptiſm, and the weakneſs of many Writers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
againſt the Anabaptiſts, being then my great
Temptations.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, <hi>I</hi> thank you for calling me, <hi>in the
bowels of Chriſt, as I will anſwer it at Gods dreadful Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,</hi>
to a <hi>Review</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> which <hi>I</hi> was drawn by
your Brethren to defend: For it cauſeth me in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view
of the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſons</hi> of it, to renew my
thankfulneſs to God for my preſervation, and that he
hath made any uſe of me to vindicate his Covenant,
and the Mercies given by it to mankind, and for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
me from this fore-deſcribed deluge; and <hi>I</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
proteſt in his ſight, that knoweth my heart,
that if <hi>I</hi> knew, or by ſtudy could find out that Papiſts,
Conformiſts, Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts, or Quakers
were in the right, <hi>I</hi> would quickly and joyfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my conſent, &amp; be glad before <hi>I</hi> die, to joyn with
them, and recant what I have held, or ſaid, or done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them. But the Reaſons which <hi>I</hi> have given in
my two Books, and which Mr. <hi>Joſ. Whiſton</hi> (above
moſt others) hath lately given, ſeem to me unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable.
And yet <hi>I</hi> doubt not but Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> or
<hi>you</hi> can anſwer them all; there being few Cauſes ſo
clear that a man may not talk againſt, as long as his
talking faculty holds out: But do not expect that <hi>I</hi>

               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:61144:28"/>

are deceived by you do require it. Bleſſed be that
Mercy that will ſhortly Reconcile his dark miſtaken
wrangling Children in the World of Reconciling
Light and Love, in the perfect <hi>Vnity,</hi> which Grace
is now preparing us for, and they that live in Faith
and Love, are breathing after: And woe to them
who by dead Formalities elude and hinder mens <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

            <head>Mr. Danvers his Third Reply
Conſidered, at Mr. Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
Invitation.</head>
            <p>BEfore the Receipt of Mr. <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> Letter, I
knew nothing of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his Third Reply,
which I have now peruſed: Though by his Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one would think that he took <hi>open Rebuke</hi> for a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yea acceptable, friendly office; yet finding how
impatiently he receiveth it, and that the detection of
his Voluminous Untruths doth but occaſion him to
defend them, and to ſtir up all his Forces to render the
Reprover odious, and ſo doth but exaſperate his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
I thought my ſelf diſobliged from any farther
attempts to bring him to Repentance; And thoſe that
yet need more to ſave them from the belief of his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall
Miſreports, are perſons that <hi>I</hi> have not leiſure
enough to ſatisfie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> again profeſs, that the experience of theſe laſt
fifteen years, of the <hi>ſtrange incredibility</hi> of ſome men
on both extreams, [the <hi>Violent</hi> and the <hi>Dividing]</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>notorious matters of Fact,</hi> hath done more to bring
me to <hi>great unbelief</hi> of all mankind, ſo far as <hi>I</hi> find
them pre-engaged by Contention, and by a Carnal,
or a ſideing factious Intereſt, than all that ever <hi>I</hi> before
had read, or heard, or ſeen: <hi>I</hi> ſhould once have
thought that <hi>I</hi> had been injurious to humanity it ſelf,
if <hi>I</hi> had thought ſuch men as <hi>incredible</hi> as ſome have
now declared themſelves in Print to be: <hi>I</hi> ſcarcely
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61144:29"/>
now believe any meer humane Hiſtory any farther
than the <hi>agreement</hi> of men of <hi>contrary minds and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,</hi>
in matters of <hi>common</hi> and <hi>eaſie</hi> notice, giveth a
kind of <hi>natural evidence</hi> to it, beyond what it borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the <hi>honeſty</hi> of the Writer; or at leaſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the footſteps of very great Candor, Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and unbyaſſed impartiality ſhall ſpeak more for
my belief, than the Authors moſt confident words or
Oaths. And herein <hi>modeſt men,</hi> and <hi>diſintereſted Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers</hi>
are now believed by me, before all the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
the learned'ſt, and the moſt zealous Contenders
in the world. <hi>Davids</hi> ſaying, that <hi>All men are Lyars,</hi>
and <hi>Pauls [Let God be true, and every man a Lyar,]</hi>
were too much overlooked by me, till <hi>men themſelves</hi>
had told me what they are; and warned me to ceaſe
from man, as vanity.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his accuſations were partly of ſuch
<hi>publick parties</hi> (the <hi>ancient Churches,</hi> the <hi>Novatians,</hi>
the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the old <hi>Brittains,</hi> the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> the
<hi>Wickliffians,</hi> &amp;c.) and partly of ſuch publick <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>
(as <hi>Auguſtines</hi> and many others) as one would
think any Scholar that will read the cited Books might
ſoon ſee whether he or <hi>I</hi> be the falſifyer, eſpecially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a practical matter, in which their Judgments
could not eaſily be hid from all the Adverſaries about
them, no more than from thoſe of their own mind and
way.</p>
            <p>His accuſation of the <hi>Novatians</hi> he neither <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth</hi>
(that <hi>I</hi> ſee) nor <hi>confeſſeth to be a</hi> ſlander; but
ſilently paſſeth all the matter by.</p>
            <p>His Accuſation (for ſuch it is) of the reſt (for
the moſt part at leaſt) he ſtill defendeth. He cannot
Repent of it; and <hi>I</hi> can no more believe him when <hi>I</hi>
have read the Books that are our Records, than <hi>I</hi> can
if he would as fiercely contend, that the Biſhops, or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61144:29"/>
Church of <hi>England</hi> are Anabaptiſts, becauſe of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of the now Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> But ſhould <hi>I</hi>
be ſo injurious to the Reader and my ſelf as to caſt
away precious time in again and again anſwering his
untrue Citations and expoſitions of words which are
before our eyes? and which neither his <hi>word</hi> or <hi>mine</hi>
can ſatisfie any Reader of, who muſt know the truth
by the Books themſelves! when he tells men of my
writing for Popery, Conformity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> can his <hi>yea</hi> or my
<hi>nay</hi> go for proof with any that is in doubt which of us
ſaith true? Muſt not the peruſal of the full words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
the Caſe? And ſo it muſt as to his Accuſations of
the ſeveral Churches and Parties in queſtions: And if
his Believers would be perſwaded that the <hi>Welſh</hi>
Tongue is the common Language of <hi>England,</hi> if he do
but vehemently affirm it, and revile ſuch as contradict
him, <hi>I</hi> could not help it, nor muſt <hi>I</hi> write books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, as long as he hath leiſure, Ink and Paper to
hold on. His Exclamations of the unſatisfactories of
theſe general anſwers, (or refuſals) ſhall not tempt
me to caſt away the little relicts of my time, in <hi>num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring</hi>
and <hi>diſproving</hi> all the <hi>Vntruths</hi> that he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and will write. By what Law am I condemned to
ſuch a Drudgery? The very firſt Paragraph of this
his third Reply hath more than one or two.</p>
            <p>But the chief ſubſtance of his Book is his reiterated
accuſation of my words in my firſt Book, that <hi>[many</hi>
then <hi>Baptized naked]</hi> for which, as a heynous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
I muſt Repent. Readers, my Conſcience
telleth me that Repentance is ſuch an excellent heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Duty, that I ſhall loath my ſelf ſo far as I find my
ſelf unwilling of it? But is it poſſible for a man to
Repent of all that the ſeveral contradicting Sects
(Papiſts, Quakers, Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> call him to
Repent of, when that is <hi>beſt</hi> with one ſide which is
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61144:30"/>
the <hi>worſt</hi> to divers others? We are openly agreed, 1.
That the Baptizing naked is not the uſual way of the
Anabaptiſts in <hi>England.</hi> 2. That it was not the way
of the moſt of them when I wrote that book. 3. That
we heard of none with us in <hi>England</hi> that for any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
time continued it. The Queſtions remaining
are 1. Whether when I wrote thoſe words, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fame or Report of the Countrey where I lived
took it not for as <hi>certain</hi> that divers then in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
did it, as the moſt Scriptural way, as that the
Quakers Quaked, and that the Ranters Swore? 2.
Whether ever any Anabaptiſt that then was acquainted
with me, yea or any one perſon denyed it to my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or knowledge? 3. Whether Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> denyed it
when I wrote it? All theſe I will no farther trouble
the Reader about, than to tell him that he neither
doth, or can diſprove me, and ſhould I <hi>recant</hi> what I
ſaid of theſe three queſtions, I muſt tell three down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
Lyes? And is that a ſafe way of Repenting?
4. But let the queſtion be whether I did <hi>well to believe
it?</hi> I anſwer, I believed it not as a <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
but as a <hi>Humane Report;</hi> which conſtrained a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
belief, which it was not in my <hi>power</hi> to deny?
5. But ſhould I not <hi>yet disbelieve it?</hi> Anſwer, I am
more willing to do it than not, but I am not able: I
do believe (according to the meaſure of the aforeſaid
evidence) that it is a Truth? I <hi>cannot</hi> believe the
contrary: I hear not a word to warrant me to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it: it is not in my power, and I muſt not lie, to
ſay that I believe it not. 6. But the next Queſtion is,
Did I not ſay <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>mean</hi> more at leaſt, than that it
was but [at that time] <hi>[the practiſe of many but not
of moſt, or their ordinary way]</hi> and <hi>that I knew it no
otherwiſe than by uncontradicted Fame?]</hi> Anſwer, Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>I</hi> did <hi>ſay or mean more,</hi> or <hi>I aid not.</hi> If <hi>I</hi> did, <hi>I</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61144:30"/>
renounce it, and declare that I wronged them. If
I did not, (as I know I did not) to ſay I did were to
lie; and is it worthy his writing a Book to tempt a
man to lie?</p>
            <p>If he will prove that I <hi>ſaid more,</hi> the <hi>words</hi> muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
it if; that I <hi>meant more,</hi> he is not to be believed
of my heart, as if he knew it better than I.</p>
            <p>But he proveth it (that <hi>I intended them all)</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to my moſt expreſs words. 1. He ſaith, it is <hi>my
ſcope and deſign?</hi> 2. From my Arguments, which take
in the whole Party? 3. From the Inſtance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
If I were to teach a man to underſtand my book,
before he wrote againſt it, I ſhould have ſome little
hope of true dealing in his Report, how weak ſoever
his Arguing were: But when I muſt deal with a man
that underſtandeth not plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> becauſe partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
will not ſuffer him, and will <hi>not learn</hi> to underſtand
what he doth not, and yet cannot forbear a publick
contradicting it, till he underſtand it, would it not be
a ſlavery to be tyed to write againſt ſuch a man as long
as he would write, ſhould I live ſo long? I joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as the mode of their Re-baptizing, their doing
it in <hi>cold water</hi> or <hi>Rivers, ſome naked,</hi> and the reſt (the
uſual way) <hi>next naked,</hi> that is, in a <hi>linnen Shift,</hi> or
Veſt, only to cover them. <hi>I</hi> took that which in the
hotter Countreys was ſafe, to be in our frigid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
a breach of the ſixth Commandment; and can
prove, that he that ſaid, <hi>[Go learn what that meaneth,
I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice]</hi> would not have
plunging over head in Cold Water, to be the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way with us. <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſed that as among the naked
<hi>Indians,</hi> uſe maketh nakedneſs a leſs provocation to
Luſt, than it would be here; ſo alſo in the hotter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,
of the world, their appearing <hi>publickly next to
naked, in one linnen Veſt or Shift,</hi> was leſs unſeemly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61144:31"/>
than it would be here: <hi>David</hi> might dance ſo before
Ark, though <hi>Michel</hi> thought it impudent; and they
might uſually were ſuch Garments as would not have
kept their <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> from <hi>being ſeen,</hi> if <hi>they had gone
by ſteps upon the Altar;</hi> and ſuch as if it were but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aſide would leave their nakedneſs as <hi>Noah's</hi> was to
ſpectators: Cuſtome is of great ſignification in ſuch
things. But <hi>I</hi> appeal to common Modeſty with us in
<hi>England,</hi> whether it would not be a breach of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Commandment to come to Church, or walk
the Streets, or appear in Aſſemblies in our <hi>Shirts</hi> and
<hi>Smocks?</hi> Now this man firſt feigneth me to <hi>ſay</hi> that
<hi>it is Adultery,</hi> becauſe <hi>I</hi> ſay it is <hi>a breach of the ſeventh
Commaadment,</hi> as if nothing but <hi>Adultery</hi> were there
forbidden?</p>
            <p>Next to prove that <hi>I</hi> mean it of them all, that <hi>[They
Baptize naked]</hi> he alledgeth that <hi>I</hi> ſaid, that <hi>all</hi> or
<hi>moſt did it, [naked or next naked]</hi> and, are theſe all
one? pray doth he not diſprove himſelf? Is it not
ſure that he that ſaith, <hi>[ſome Baptize naked, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
next naked]</hi> doth not ſay of <hi>all [that they Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
naked]</hi> What ſhould one ſay to ſuch a man as
this?</p>
            <p>But he ſaith, that <hi>[ſome naked and next naked are
much at one.]</hi> Anſwer, That's but another of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths,
from whom they flow ſo eaſily that <hi>I</hi> may not
number them. A <hi>groſſer</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> breach of the ſeventh
Commandment are <hi>not much at one with me. I</hi> never
ſaid or thought that they were. If <hi>I</hi> had, is that any
thing to the queſtion in hand? Can he prove that <hi>I</hi>
ſaid <hi>[All Baptized naked?]</hi> if <hi>I</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>I</hi> took
<hi>[next naked]</hi> to be as bad.</p>
            <p>2. But <hi>de facto,</hi> doth <hi>he deny</hi> the latter? it ſeems
here that he doth. I profeſs alſo that <hi>I</hi> go in this but
by <hi>Common Fame.</hi> If they Baptize not next naked in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61144:31"/>
one linnen Shift, <hi>I</hi> never heard it denyed till now? <hi>I</hi>
renounce the mention of it if it be untrue; but it is
not in my power to disbelieve it. But becauſe <hi>I</hi> never
ſaw it, if he will ſay that they Baptize them all in hats,
bands and cuffs, <hi>I</hi> will not peremptorily deny it.</p>
            <p>But he will prove that <hi>I</hi> meant not <hi>[Common Fame]</hi>
becauſe <hi>I</hi> add <hi>[Experience,</hi> &amp;c.] But ſure <hi>I</hi> never
alledged <hi>my own Experience.] I</hi> never ſaw any of them
Baptize: <hi>I</hi> never <hi>heard a Ranter Blaſpheme,</hi> (though
<hi>I</hi> have read Letters full of it;) nor <hi>I</hi> never ſaw a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
quake.</hi> If you ſay that they never did ſo, <hi>I</hi> will
not prove it. But how ſhall other <hi>mens Experiences</hi> be
known to me, but by Report or Fame? And <hi>I</hi> think
that the more common and uncontradicted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
is, it is the more probable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> have not leiſure to go on at this rate with ſuch a
Writer; <hi>I</hi> again profeſs that <hi>I</hi> had rather Retract
what <hi>I</hi> ſaid than not, if <hi>I</hi> could do it without lying,
but <hi>I</hi> cannot. But, Reader, what's all this to the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
Whether our Infants are in Covenant with
Chriſt, or Viſible Members of his Church? Is it not a

            <p>But the laſt Queſtion is, <hi>Have I not wronged their
Cauſe by wronging the Perſons, in believing Fame, that
ever any of them Baptized naked?</hi> Anſwer, 1. <hi>I</hi> have
not the books now to peruſe, (men of his Spirit,
though of another Opinion, have diſabled me at this
time from confuting him by books.) But <hi>I</hi> am paſt
doubt, that <hi>I</hi> have read of their Baptizing naked in
forreign Writers.</p>
            <p>2. But, Reader, Could one that had read this
Book of his againſt me, for this paſſage as injurious,
believe if he had not ſeen his other Books, that it is
this <hi>ſame man himſelf, who in his two former Books</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
it againſt us, that for many hundred years,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61144:32"/>
               <hi>Baptizing naked was the Churches Practiſe?</hi> Was this
no injury? Or ſhall the ſame man take me as injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
for believing the ſame of <hi>ſome of them</hi> for a very
little time? <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> have almoſt done with ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputers.</p>
            <p>As to what he ſaith of Mr. <hi>Lambes</hi> and Mr. <hi>Allens.
(who have left them,) exceedingly as he hears, blaming me
for broaching, much more for defending this ſlander.] I</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
1. His <hi>Hereſay's</hi> have quite loſt their credit with
me: <hi>I</hi> believe it never the more for his hearing it:
They never <hi>blamed me to my face:</hi> and <hi>I</hi> think that
they are men likely to do it in that friendly way, if
any way; and therefore at leaſt <hi>I</hi> may hear from them
hereafter; and if ſo, their reproof ſhall be willingly
conſidered. If it be true, <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe it is, becauſe they
have miſtaken me as he doth, as if <hi>I</hi> had ſpoken that
of their ordinary practice, which <hi>I</hi> mentioned only
as the practice of ſome only at that time; which was
as ſhort and confined as the Quakers quaking. 2. Is it
a ſlander of Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> his citing <hi>Voſſius,</hi> or of <hi>Voſſius</hi>
cited by him, to ſay that ſome Baptized naked in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
times? 3. Is it then no ſlander of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> to
ſay, and ſtiffly defend it, that the ancient Churches or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
did ſo? Doth he who ſo pleadeth for Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
becauſe it was the firſt way, now take it for well
done in the ancient Churches, and an intollerable
ſlander that it ſhould be ſaid to have been done of any
of late?</p>
            <p>He next cometh to defend his falſe Report of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
which <hi>I</hi> read to ſome people that <hi>I</hi> preached to:
The firſt hour that ever <hi>I</hi> ſpake to them, <hi>I</hi> openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that we met not there as ſeparating from the
publick Aſſemblies, but for the neceſſary inſtructing
of the people, who elſe had none, nor any publick
Worſhip of God: The Pariſh of <hi>Giles</hi> where <hi>I</hi> lived,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61144:32"/>
and the Pariſh of <hi>Martins</hi> where <hi>I</hi> preached are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to have 1000000. ſouls or neer: of theſe it is
ſuppoſed that not above 6000. can hear in the Pariſh
Churches at the moſt (and the incumbent of one had
not officiated at all for many years:) it grieved me
to think that while the King aintainerh a Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Revenew for propagating the Goſpel in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
and the Jeſuites are juſtly praiſed for doing ſo
much to propagate it in the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> we ſhould ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhly
ſuffer <hi>America</hi> and the <hi>Indies</hi> to come ſo neer
<hi>Whitehall,</hi> and ſo famous and Religious a City as this,
to be (to ſo great a number) without any publick
worſhip of God, while Mahometans are not quite
without. Therefore to my great coſt I preached neer
a year over the Market-houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s. And
when the Informers began with me, and accuſed me
to the Juſtices of meeting contrary to the Act againſt
Conventicles, <hi>I</hi> gave my Reaſons to ſome Juſtices,
and others, in word and writing, to prove that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I, nor ſuch others, might be judged breakers of
that Act, becauſe we did not meet to worſhip God
with any other manner of Worſhip than what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of
<hi>England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> For though we <hi>did not ſo much as they,</hi> we
<hi>did nothing but what they do:</hi> For we did but <hi>Read
the Scriptures, Pray freely in the Pulpit, and Preach the
Chriſtian Doctrine;</hi> and all this the Church of <hi>England</hi>
doth: And though <hi>I</hi> did not read my ſelf, but another
did it, it was becauſe <hi>I</hi> was not able, which if <hi>I</hi> were,
<hi>I</hi> would do it. And expecting quickly to have the
Cauſe come to a Tryal, <hi>I</hi> wrote the ſum of this in a
Paper, and read it openly, and then gave it the
Clerk, that none might miſreport me: And though
ſome able and pious Lawyers that peruſed my large
Reaſons, thought that they were very uſeful for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61144:33"/>
as well as me, yet the noiſe and murmuring of
ſome Women firſt, and ſuch as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> after,
ſent abroad my Reproaches for it through City and
Countrey, with ſo many falſe additions, and ſo much
diſpleaſure, as added ſomewhat to my former know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the difference between <hi>Sectarian</hi> and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Zeal.</hi> Surely theſe men do think themſelves very
grear haters of ſin, who would render that man odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
as a heynous ſinner, who doth but ſpeak thoſe
words to vindicate himſelf and others from the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
of Informers, which he verily believeth to be
true and uſeful: when a man hath for about fourteen
years, not only preached without pay, but at many
ſcore pounds a year charges; when he hath never taken
away one of their Communicants from any Parochial,
or Non-conformiſts Church, nor meddled with either
Sacrament, nor ever ſet up his own preaching againſt
theirs, but deſired to preach to a few of thoſe many
thouſands that have none at all, nor have any publick
worſhip of God, no not ſo much as the reading of the
Liturgy; and when for endeavouring this in languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and pains, by great charge and labour, his utter
ruine, if not death, ſhall be unreconcileably endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by <hi>one party,</hi> and for <hi>not hateing</hi> that which is
<hi>good</hi> in the Liturgy as much as they, or upon every
ſurmiſe of a diſeaſed brain, ſhall become the common
obloquy of another, (the Sectarians, and the Women
that are infected by their diſeaſe:) Reader, judge
whether the true belief of Gods acceptance, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the Hypocrites reward, be not neceſſary to
keep ſuch a one from imitating <hi>Jonas,</hi> and quietly lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men to their beloved ignorance and ſin? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
if we had not many ſoberer men between them,
that are for neither of the extreams, it would not be
harder preaching in <hi>England</hi> than in <hi>America?</hi> Yet
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61144:33"/>
with moſt hearty thanks to God, I muſt ſay, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the oppoſition of both theſe extreams,
God hath abundantly ſweetned his ſervice to me; by
the ready reception and profit of ſuch people, as men
ſo much labour to keep in darkneſs.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak all this with reference to Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> his
following words alſo of my preaching in the Pariſh
Churches.</p>
            <p>The foreſaid paper of mine he publiſhed in his laſt
Book, as matter of Accuſation; and did it, according
to his cuſtome, falſely: I briefly mentioned his falſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation:
He now Printeth that Copy as received from
his Bookſeller, in one Column, and on the other, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
called <hi>[The Copy obtained from the Original.]</hi> to
ſhew that there is but two words difference that is,
<hi>His Copy</hi> ſpake of my <hi>Reading</hi> the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and mine
ſpake of my <hi>own Reading what my Aſſiſtant read</hi> (the
<hi>Scripture.)</hi> But 1. If this be all one with him, are
we not ſo to judge of his other Expoſitions? I know
one whoſe overſight in writing uſually lyeth in leaving
out <hi>[not]</hi> and <hi>[un.]</hi> and what is one Syllable?
The Kings Printer, who as Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ſaith, was
Fined in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> for Printing <hi>[Thou ſhalt
commit Adultery.]</hi> left out but one poor ſyllable. But
he did not juſtifie it as Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> doth. 2. If it be his
excuſe to lay the Copy on his Bookſeller, may we not
take it alſo for his anſwer, that all the untruths that he
hath ſaid of the Novations, Donatiſts, Brittains, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
&amp;c. he had them from—ſome body of as
great authority as his Bookſeller; and then all's well.
3. But, Reader, doſt thou not expect that at leaſt he
ſhould <hi>now ſay true</hi> after ſo much warning, and that
this ſhould be a true Copy which he ſaith, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
is <hi>[obtained from the Original.]</hi> I aſſure thee
on the word of a Chriſtian, it is yet ſo far from being
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61144:34"/>
true, that divers lines, even a conſiderable part of the
writing is left out. Take heed therefore to thy belief
hereafter. Believe not every Spirit, nor every man that
raileth at others as leſs wiſe or ſpiritual than he; what
wonder if he untruly tell us of the opinion of whole
parties, Novatians, Donatiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and tell us of whole
Books that have not one word of what he affirmeth,
but ſomewhat for the contrary, when he will not only
falſifie my own writing, even a few lines, but defend
his ſo doing againſt my ſelf that have the Copy by me,
and that by a greater falſhood than the firſt. Are this
mans Citations to be credited?</p>
            <p>Yet he goeth on and averteth that <hi>[there is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Syllable different]</hi> And he will prove moreover,
that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>If I meet not on pretenſe of any Religious exerciſe in
other manner,</hi> &amp;c. I muſt accordingly read the <hi>Common-prayer
my ſelf.</hi> Anſwer, So ſaid the Informers, but were
I at the Seſſions upon my Appeal, I would be bold to
deny it, and to ſay that he that ſaith but the <hi>Lords
Prayer,</hi> doth not uſe another manner of Worſhip than
the Church? and that to do leſs, is not to do that
which is of another manner. But if I miſtake in ſo
thinking, it followeth not that I <hi>prevaricate,</hi> or <hi>mean
diſhoneſtly,</hi> as he inſinuateth.</p>
            <p>But if he want more matter of Reproach, or any
ſuch as he, I will voluntarily give him more, ſo careleſs
am I of ſuch Cenſures: I do therefore tell him that I
am no greater an Adverſary to the Liturgy than were
the old Non-conformiſts, Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth
men to come to the beginning of it; Mr. <hi>Knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtubs</hi>
that conſtantly read much of it; Mr. <hi>Ball,</hi> that
wrote the Tryal of Separation; Mr. <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Gifford,</hi> and ſuch others that did the like: And
that, as before the Wars, when I was accounted a
Non-conformiſt, I did (at <hi>Bridgnorth)</hi> uſually read
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:61144:34"/>
moſt of the Lords dayes part of the Liturgy, (and as in
1660. the Miniſters of <hi>London</hi> conſented ſo to do) to
would I do again, on the ſame terms: And that if my
Nonconformity did conſiſt only in the contrary, I
ſhould have little reaſon to blame the Conformiſts for
the ſharp Cenſures which they write againſt me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He keepeth conſtantly in his way, and addeth</hi>[—It
is confidently affirmed by ſome, that Mr <hi>B.</hi> hath lately in
<hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> or <hi>Buckinghamſhire,</hi> in order to obtain
the Pulpit (where he ſeveral times Preached in publick)
read the Common prayer, or at leaſt ſome part of it, out of
the Service book.]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Who is it that this man converſeth with
whoſe confident reports he publiſhed? Are his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters
infected with his Diſeaſe? 2. Why doth he
Print this confident Report if not to be believed? And
if ſo, alas, will he put <hi>no bounds</hi> to this ſin, while he
thinks that he cryeth down our ſin? I thank God for
my time, ſtrength and liberty, I did preach fourteen
times in ſeveral <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> of thoſe Counties, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thirteen years excluſion from the Pulpits of ſuch
Churches; and it is not in the power of this mans pen
to make me repent of it. But in all thoſe times, I never
read either one word of Common-prayer, nor one
Chapter or Pſalm, ſave once, when I Preached where
there was no one to Read, I read the Scripture as <hi>I</hi>
would have done at home. Will not the preſence of
thouſands of witneſſes ſecure a man from the forgery
of any unnamed Slanderer? No, it will not: As after
our <hi>Savoy</hi> Conference untruths were Printed againſt
me, contrary to the moſt notorious evidence of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Witneſſes; ſo ſometimes where I Preach in
<hi>London,</hi> it is not the multitude of Witneſſes that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
me from the groſs falſe reports of this kind of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,
(who have not ſo much kindneſs for their own
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61144:35"/>
ſouls as either to ſtay away, or forbear their untruths.)
No wonder then if witneſſes at 26 years, or 26 miles
diſtance, or neer, be no ſecurity againſt ſuch a one as
Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> or his <hi>confident</hi> Reporters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> [Though it is alſo ſaid that he hath obtained
that publick liberty by vertue of a Licenſe he hath from the
Arch Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury:</hi> But whether it be one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
granted by him, when the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> before
the Act of Conformity, (when by the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>
he was Silenced in thoſe parts) or ſince is worthy inquiry?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's like you have enquired, and found that
it was the former; if not, <hi>I</hi> tell you now: But to ſome
it is almoſt as hard to <hi>believe a Truth</hi> that is againſt
their Spleen, as to <hi>ſpeak</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He next ſaith, as the Expoſition of my Sufferings,</hi>
[viz. To fly from his place and Charge, if not to avoid the
Croſs of Christ, and to ſhun a ſuffering Witneſs when ſo
loudly call'd thereto]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Did you <hi>hear his caſe,</hi> or do you judge
before you hear it? 2. Theſe Paſſages are too conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the reſt. How prove you that it was <hi>a flight?</hi>
How prove you that it was from my <hi>Charge?</hi> (Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
it is fifteen years ſince <hi>I</hi> had <hi>any Charge,</hi> of any
one Congregation, more than over the reſt of the Land,
unleſs my dwelling made my Neighbours become my
Charge? I had no Charge of any but my Family there,
unleſs my great Charge in Preaching to them for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
and paying aſſiſtant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and building a place
in hope of more ſuch Labour, made them my Charge?
And if <hi>I</hi> give an hundred pounds to one man, when <hi>I</hi>
owed him no more than others, doth that make him
for the future become my Charge?) And how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
he that <hi>I</hi> was <hi>lowdly called to ſuffer?</hi> Or that it was
the Croſs of Chriſt that <hi>I avoided?</hi> This man is againſt
<hi>dictating! I</hi> would he were more againſt untruths!
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61144:35"/>
My Sufferings have been enough to ſhew what men
are that procured them, but to me ſo ſmall, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
my reſtraint from Preaching, <hi>I</hi> account them not
worthy of the name of the <hi>Croſs.</hi> But yet I will hope
that he will ſo far ſuſpend his Cuſtome, as not to ſay,
that any Sectarian Preacher in <hi>England,</hi> Anabaptiſt or
Separatiſt, (to go no farther) that loſt not his Life,
hath <hi>lost more of the World,</hi> by his <hi>meer Non-conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
than I have done?</p>
            <p>He ſends my Conſcience here to divers Scriptures,
2 <hi>Cor. 6. 4, 5, 6. Acts 20. 11, 12, 13. Mat. 10. 38, 39.
John 10. 12, 13. Mat.</hi> 23. 2, 3, 4. I am willinger to hear
theſe Texts than him. I ſuppoſe he meaneth not thoſe
that I before minded Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> of, of Chriſts
early flight into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> or his oft avoiding the <hi>Jews,</hi>
in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Galile,</hi> the Wilderneſs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor his, bidding us when <hi>Perſecuted in one City
flee to another;</hi> nor <hi>Pauls being let down the Wall
by a Basket;</hi> nor the ſcattering of the Diſciples,
by the Perſecution at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> nor <hi>Pauls</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing
<hi>Timothy,</hi> non his ſhaving his Head for
his Vow, nor his Appeal from the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor
his crying out that he was a Phariſee, nor his denying
that he had done any thing againſt the <hi>Temple</hi> or the
<hi>Law,</hi> nor any ſuch like. And if he condemn Chriſt
and <hi>Paul</hi> it will be no ſuffering to them.</p>
            <p>The firſt Text tells us that <hi>Paul</hi> in much <hi>Patience</hi>
bare <hi>Afflictions, Neceſſities, Diſtreſſes, Stripes, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Anſw.</hi> What thence? Is it <hi>Ergo R. B.</hi> did
ill to come out of the Goal when he was put in? Or
that he did ill not to put himſelf in again? Did <hi>Paul</hi>
ſin for not ſcourging and impriſoning himſelf?</p>
            <p>The next Text ſpeaketh of <hi>Pauls</hi> Preaching till mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night?
<hi>Ergo R. B.</hi> ſhould not Preach in the Summer
in the Country? I deny the Conſequence. It may be
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61144:36"/>
he meant <hi>Acts 21. 13. Paul was ready to be bound or die
at Jeruſalem!</hi> What thence? <hi>Ergo</hi> he ſinned in avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuffering oft before? Or, <hi>Ergo R. B.</hi> ſhould not
have gone into the Countrey either for Health or
Preaching; yea if it had been in caſe of danger to have
Preached to many inſtead of fewer that had often
heard him? I deny the Conſequence.</p>
            <p>The next Text tells us that we muſt take up our
Croſs and follow Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what thence? <hi>Ergo</hi>
we muſt <hi>make</hi> our own Croſs, and take up that inſtead
of Chriſts? Or, <hi>Ergo,</hi> Chriſt ſinned in avoiding the
Croſs ſo oft before? Or, <hi>Ergo, R. B.</hi> muſt go into a
Priſon that he may give over Preaching the Goſpel?
I deny all theſe. What kin are they to the Text?
Have all the Anabaptiſts and Separatiſts lived all this
while in ſin, that lived out of Priſon? or that have had
maintenance and quietneſs, while <hi>R. B.</hi> hath been laid
in the common Goal, and hunted by one ſort, and
reviled by the other? Why will not the perſecution
of your Pen or Tongue prove a comfortable ſuffering
for the Truth, as well as if I pleaſed your Spleen in
preferring a choſen Priſon before a Pulpit?</p>
            <p>The next Text tells us, that the <hi>Hireling deſerts the
Sheep by fleeing.</hi> Thus the Quakers alſo talk to me
when they call me <hi>Hireling.</hi> But, Sir, I am not ſo
<hi>much as a Hireling?</hi> much leſs the <hi>owner</hi> of the <hi>Sheep?</hi>
I would I knew which of theſe two you judge your
ſelves to be? for my part I am neither. Chriſt is the
Owner? I am not ſo much as the Paſtor of any Flock:
And (that I may not diſcourage your contempt, I
add) nor ever, that I remember, <hi>called</hi> to be ſuch theſe
13 or 14 years: Nor have I ſo long taken any <hi>Hire.</hi>
And did <hi>Paul</hi> flee like a <hi>Hireling</hi> when he went from
places of leſs liberty to other more commodious places
to Preach? Did not Pain, Weakneſs, and want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61144:36"/>
for ſo chargeable a work diſable me, my Conſcience would
command me (by the motive of Experience) to go about Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from place to place, though every d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

paſs, ſhould bark nothing but <hi>[Hireling, Hireling.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt Text is againſt Separation; <hi>The Scribes and Phariſees
ſit in Moſes his ſeat; all therefore whatſoever they bid you obſerve,
that obſerve and do, but do not ye after their works, for they ſay and
de not, for they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne,</hi> &amp;c.
And what from hence? <hi>Ergo</hi> I ſhould not Preach in the Pariſh
Churches? Or is it, <hi>Ergo</hi> I ſhould have bound <hi>heavy burdens</hi> for
my ſelf? Or is it, that I ſhould not <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

to the reſt aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is not this a ſtrange Paradoxe that he ſhould
ſuffer at the rate for a Non-conformiſt at <hi>London,</hi> and yet act the
part of a Conformiſt to ſo high a degree in the Countrey?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is very conformable to the reſt. To <hi>Preach in the
Pariſh Churches</hi> (for his ſtory of <hi>Reading</hi> the Common Prayer is
like his Books) <hi>is the high degree of Conformity.</hi> This is expoſitory.
I now perceive what it is in me to be <hi>[for Conformity and againſt
it, for Popery and againſt it, for Arminianiſm and againſt it,]</hi> as
he ſaith. The equivocation maketh all true. I am for the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
and the <hi>Popery,</hi> and the <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> of <hi>Preaching Chriſts
Goſpel</hi> in Pariſh Churches (which the Papiſts ſay they ſometime

in the Covenant of God, for their Baptiſm, and for the reading of
Gods Word, for the Creed, the Lords Prayer, and the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;
and for the Love of Brethren, and the Unity, Peace

O what a high degree of <hi>Conformity</hi> did the old Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
exerciſe in this mans ſenſe! I have lived long to little
purpoſe it ſuch a man by the bare names of <hi>Conformity, Popery,</hi> or
<hi>Arminianiſm</hi> can frighten me out of my <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> my <hi>Honeſty,</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Reader, by this you may ſee at what rates we
Miniſters muſt do our Maſters work. Woe to us if we Preach
not: And if we do, one ſort Impriſon us, and ſeek our Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine;
and the other Revile us, as if our greateſt Duty were our
greateſt ſin.</p>
            <p>2. You ſee what abundance of Enemies the Preaching of the
Goſpel hath, when Satan can ſtir up ſuch men of Zeal to take it
for a Crime. <hi>Paul</hi> might Preach even in the Jews Synagogue: I
muſt not in a Pariſh Church.</p>
            <p>3. You ſee how certain it is that the two Extreams are much
of the ſame Spirit, and that they that moſt cry out againſt Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are oft of a perſecuting mind, when ſuch men as this would
<hi>ſilence</hi> us, or have us <hi>give over Preaching</hi> to the multitude that moſt
need it, as well as others. And ſo would the Quakers.</p>
            <p>4. You ſee what they mean that cry down a <hi>Comprehenſion:</hi>
They would not have us Preach in the Pariſh Churches to the
needy multitude, unleſs they may have all firſt altered according
to their deſire. Thus <hi>W Pen</hi> called me <hi>cruel</hi> for <hi>deſirng a Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
as leaving the Quakers to the Dogs:</hi> ſo that they would
have us all ſilenced, even by thoſe Impoſitions which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
account ſinful, till they and all ſuch have their will.</p>
            <p>5 You ſee here what a <hi>Reproach</hi> theſe men would bring on
<hi>Non-conformity,</hi> and what <hi>ſtrong Invitations</hi> they give men to
<hi>Conform,</hi> by making <hi>Conformity</hi> to be <hi>Preaching in Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Or you ſee what need you have inſtead of diſputing longer
with ſuch men, to pray God to give them tenderer Cnnſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
that may fear to multiply Untruths, which thouſands of
Witneſſes, (of whom ſome were Anabaptiſts and of other Sects)
are ready to confute. Eſpecially to Pray that the Churches, and
the peoples ſouls may be delivered from ſuch as would not only
Unchurch all mankind till they come to age, but make it a ſinful
Conformity than to Preach the Goſpel in the Pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
