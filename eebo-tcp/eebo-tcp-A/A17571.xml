         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The supreme, or more absolute administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

Generally, by which authority the

            <p>By causes Ecclesiastical are meant, not onely
matrimoniall and testamentary causes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
abusively called Ecclesiasticall, but also
these, which are in a proper sence Ecclesiastical,
subject to Ecclesiastical cognition and jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

or amended.</hi> And for the better observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this act, it was further enacted, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ecclesiasticall person, officer, and minister,
all and every temporall judge, Iustice, Maior,
and other lay or temporal officer, and minister,
and every other person having her highnes fee,
or wages, within the Realm of England, or any
of her highnes dominions, shall make, take, &amp;
receive a corporall oath upon the Evangelist,
before such person, or persons, as shall please
her highnes, her heirs, or successors, under the
great seale of England, to assigne and name, to
accept and take the same, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
and effect hereafter following, <hi>I</hi> A. B. <hi>doe
utterly testifie and declare in my conscience, that the
Queens highnes is the onely supreme governour of
this Realme, and of all other her highnes dominions
and countries, as well in all spirituall or Ecclesiastical
things, or causes, as temporall, and that no forreigne
Prince, person, prelate, state, or Potentate, hath, or
ought to have any iurisdiction, power, superiority;
preeminence, or authoritie Ecclesiasticall or spirituall
within this Realme: and therefore I doe utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
&amp; forsake all forraigne iurisdictions, powers,
superiorities, and authorities, and doe promise, that
from henceforth I shall beare faith, and true allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the Queenes highnes, her heirs, and lawfull
successors, and to my power shall assist, and defend
all iurisdictions, privileges, preeminences, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,
granted or belonging to the Queenes highnes,
her heirs, and successors, or united and annexed to the
Imperiall crown of the Realme. So helpe me God,
and by the contents of this book.</hi> The title then
of <hi>Supreme Governour</hi> in the oath is explained
by the preceeding words of the statute, to
which, and for observation of the which, the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7812:4"/>
oath is subjoyned, viz. that the Prince hath all
manner of spirituall or Ecclesiastical jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and all manner of privileges and preeminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
any way touching or belonging to the
same, which was before, or may be lawfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
for visitation of the Ecclesiasticall state,
reformation, order, and correction of the same,
and of all manner of errors, heresies, schismes,
abuses, offences, contempts and enormities, and
that he may commit the exercise of the same
to any of his naturall born subjects, whom it
shall please his highness to constitute commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
in causes Ecclesiastical, to judge, discern,
and correct in matters of Idolatry, simonie, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
and heresie, and all other causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
whatsoever. This oath of supremacie is
different from the oath of fidelity or allegeance
devised of late. That requireth no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
acknowledge the king to be lawful &amp; righteous
king, and to sweare obedience and fidelitie to
him, notwithstanding he be excommunicated
by the Pope, &amp; to acknowledge, that the Pope,
notwithstanding of his excommunications,
cannot depose kings, and dispose of kingdomes
at his pleasure. The Papist is straitned with this
oath of allegeance, but not with the oath of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie
for feare of troubling his tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
The statute of the supremacie was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the same year of Qu. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne,
in an admonition added to the injunctions, as
followeth, <hi>That her Maiestie neither doth, nor ever
will, challenge any other authority then was challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and lately vsed by the noble kings of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
king Henry the 8. and king Edward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the</hi> 6.
<hi>which is, and was of ancient time due to the Imperial
crown of this Realme, that is, under God to have the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7812:4"/>
soveraignty, and rule over all manner of persons born
within these her realmes, dominions, and countries, of
what estate soever they be, either Ecclesiasticall or
temporall, so as no other forraigne power shall, or
ought to have superiority over them.</hi> In this admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
the subjects are made to understand, that
her Maiestie did not claime power to minister
divine offices in the Church, as to preach the
word, and minister the sacraments. They have
been too simple, who have construed the statute
in such a sense. For no wise man will thinke,
that kings and Queens will take upon them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the paines, or worldly discredit to preach
the word, minister the sacraments, intimate to
the congregation the sentence of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
The statute doth make no mention of
divine offices in the Church, but of jurisdiction
Ecclesiasticall, which is, and was in time of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie,
exercised at visitations, and in Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
courts. This explanation therefore of the
admonition annexed to the Injunctions, and
ratified by Parliament in the fift yeare of Qu.
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> derogateth nothing from the former
statute, but onely summeth it in more generall
tearmes. To challenge no more then was chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged,
and lately used by the noble kings of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
memory, K. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. and <hi>Edward</hi> 6. is
to challenge to be head of the Church, to have
all jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall flowing from the
possessour of the Crowne, as from the head and
fountaine. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Acts &amp; Monuments
relateth, that in the 34. of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. it was
enacted, <hi>That the king, his heirs, and successors,
kings of that Realme, shall bee taken, accepted, and
reputed the onely supreme head on earth of the
Church of England, and shall have and enjoy annexed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7812:5"/>
and united to the Imperiall crowne, as well the title
and stile thereof, as all honours, dignities, preeminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
iurisdictions, priviledges, authorities, immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
profits and commodities, to the sayd dignitie of
supreme head of the same Church belonging and
appertaining: and that they shall have full power &amp;
authority from time to time, to visit, represse, redresse,
reforme and amend all such errors, abuses, offences,
contempts, and enormities whatsoever they be, which
by any manner of spirituall authority, or iurisdiction
might, or may lawfully be reformed, repressed, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

prescribed by law, are the inventions of Sathan,
broched and dressed in his kitchin, sayth Beza.
For when the Patrone presenteth to a benefice,
and the Bishop giveth collation, the libertie
of the Church to choose, and seeke the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiest
and fittest man one of a thousand, as
<hi>Iob</hi> speaketh, is taken away, and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men thrust upon the Churches. When
there is any defect through neglect of time, this
liberty is not restored to the Church, but her
bondage still increaseth, till at last the power
of bestowing a benefice by gradation come to
the Prince. Now to conferre a benefice, is to
set a Pastor over a flocke: for howsoever the
person presented have received Ordours before,
yet he hath not a particular charge, but is a
minister, or as they call him, a Priest, at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
till he obtaine some benefice. The Prince
taketh up the rents of vacant Bishoprickes, as
Superiours of vassals, who hold their lands of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:7812:7"/>
their Liege Lord. The Bishops See being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,
the Diocesan Church as they call it, hath
not liberty to choose a Bishop, either in a full
convention, or by their commissioners, nor yet
the ministers of the Diocie, but onely the Dean
and Chapter, as was the manner in time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
Neither may the Deane and Chapter
proceed to the election, till first a licence bee
sent from the Prince, and with the licence is
sent a letter nominating the person whom they
shall choose, and then they proceed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
rather then free election of the person
nominated. Notwithstanding of this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and feigned processe of election, the kings
assent and ratification is required. Yea without
all this imaginary proceeding of Deane and
Chapter, the Prince may by vertue of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
above mentioned, proceed to the ful electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by himselfe, and will do it, when he thinketh
good. The clergy, nobility, gentry, communalty
of the Diocie are not regarded all this time.
They must accept whom Deane &amp; Chapter at
the Princes pleasure shall recommend to them.
Hence it is, that the Church receiveth Pastors &amp;
Bishops from the Princes palace, and he that
can give or promise the greatest gift to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Courtier, shall win the prise. So the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
courtier setteth these great commanders,
Pastors over many Churches. From Popes and
Princes courts, as out of the belly of the Trojan
horse, have been sent forth asses, swine, Beares &amp;
Bulls upon the Lords vineyard. At the last Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
1617. election by Deane and Chapter
was established, without the consent, yea against
the acts of our Kirk. And the first man that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
this way, I mean the Parliament way, that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7812:8"/>
is, by Deane &amp; Chapter, was the land of Corce,
who made it nice to take on a Bishopricke, till
he had a lawfull calling, and the free approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Kirk. My Lord elect must make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
to the Prince, and sweare not onely fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which every subject owe to their Prince,
but also as a vassall to doe homage to him as
his superiour, and performe that knight service,
which he is obliged to for his temporall lands.
Whereas before they held their lands in pure
almes, they were either compelled by Princes
to hold in knights service, or made filthie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
with them, to the end they might get in
many temporall lands, and for that cause ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
themselves as vassals, selling both their
owne liberties, and the liberty of Ecclesiastical
elections.</p>
            <p>Not in use, till after the Papall usurped
authoritie was utterly driven forth of the
bounds of the English Empire. These con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
1 appellations, 2 Canons and lawes,
3 Benefices. As for appellations interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
at the instance of any party, 1 The last
appellation is made to the Prince, and not
forth of the kingdome. 2 hee delegateth
judges by the Chancellour of England, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the great seale, who shall determine in
the cause.</p>
            <p>Appellations ascend by degrees from one to
one, not from one to many. No mediate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation
is heire from one to a Provinciall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node,
or Nationall, but from the Archdeacon,
or his officiall, to the Bishop: from the Bishop
or his Commissary, to the Archbishop: from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7812:8"/>
the Archbishops Archdeacon to the Court of
Arches, or the Court of Audience: from these
Courts to the Archbishop himselfe: from the
Archbishop to the Court of Chancery, or to
the Prince, who by the Chancellors seale ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth
judges, 24. Henr. 8. 25. Henr. 8. 1 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizab.
So in place of gradation from parish
Sessions and Consistories, to classicall meetings
of the Presbyteries, from Presbyteries to Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes
of Shires, from Synodes to Nationall
Assemblies, they must step up a Popish ladder,
by Archdeacons, Officials, Bishops, Deane of
Arches, Archbishops, saving that at the top of
the ladder they finde the Prince for the Pope,
to whom they must not appeale, nor yet to any
greater Councels of many reformed or unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches, or to an oecumenicall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
whatsoever they talke of Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.
Now the causes convoyed by these sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
appellations, are all Ecclesiasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
agitated in the Ecclesiasticall Courts. Of
which causes wee are to treat in the third
chapter.</p>
            <p>These which belong to Canons, or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
lawes, concerne either the making
of them, or the administration and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them, or the relaxation of them. As
for the making of them, 1. in that the Prince
may make new lawes anent ceremonies and
rites, with advice either of his Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
in causes Ecclesiasticall, or of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan.
2 Synod, provinciall or natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
may not be convocated without the
Princes writ direct to the Metropolitan.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7812:9"/>
3. Nothing may be treated or determined
in the Synode, till the Prince first be made
privie, and give assent. 4. Nothing shall
have the force of a law, till the Royal assent
of the Prince be given to those things which
the Synod shall think good to decree.</p>
            <p>Beza in his 8. Epistle to <hi>Grindal</hi> Bishop of
London, confesseth, that he trembleth and sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
at the first of these heads. And in very
deed it may turne upside down the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, and outward forme of
Gods worship, overthrow the one, and deface
the other. Did not the Bishops affirme at the
examination of <hi>Barow,</hi> that the Queen might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
what Church government it pleased
her Highnes? Because they dare not affirm that
Princes may change any thing that is unchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable
by divine law, therefore they make many
unchangeable things both in government and
externall ceremonies in Gods worship, to bee
changeable, that they make a change at their
pleasure, and may bring in all that ever was
hatched by the Antichrist, a Popish Church
government, significant rites, and symbolicall
toyes and ceremonies. For what may a corrupt
Prince, and a corrupt Metropolitan, or some
few corrupt commissioners not challenge for
changeable? Nay, even rites of order and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,
and lawes of things indifferent for a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
use, should be considered by the lawfull
and ordinary assemblies of the Church, how
they agree with the generall rules prescribed
in the word, how they will edifie the Church,
how God shall be glorified, Christian charitie
entertained, order and comelines preserved.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7812:9"/>
For we must not consider things indifferent
onely in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>heir generall kinde, but in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and circumstantiall use; which if we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Princes, they may abuse indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t things
to the great hurt of the Church. Synods ought
not to be convocate without the Princes privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or the warrant of the law in generall; but if
the Prince be wilful in denying his assent, and
the Church be in extreame danger, ready to be
overwhelmed or greatly disturbed with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
schismes, divisions, enormities, we may use
the benefit of the law: and if the law of man
be wanting, yet the Church should not cease
from doing her dutie, and exercising that power
which is granted her by Christ, who hath also
promised his presence, when but two or three
are convened in his name. <hi>Salus Ecclesiae suprema
lex esto.</hi> The power of Christian Princes in the
Church is <hi>cumulative,</hi> to aid her to execute
her power freely, not <hi>privative,</hi> to deprive and
spoile her of any power Christ hath granted to
her. And by the same reason, the Church may
entreate, determine, and strengthen her decrees
and constitutions with Ecclesiasticall censures
and punishments, notwithstanding the Prince
will not assent, approve, ratifie the Canons of
the Church, nor confirme them by his lawes,
and fortifie them with temporal punishments.
Prudence I confesse is required in the Church,
to weigh the case of necessity, when to put this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er power in practise.</p>
            <p>As for the administration and execution
of lawes, in that the Prince may 1. visit the
Ecclesiasticall state, and their persons, 2. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
redresse, and correct them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7812:10"/>
sort of heresies, schismes, errours, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses,
offences, contempts and enormities
of any whomsoever, 3. to assigne, nominate,
and authorize, when and as often as it is his
pleasure, such persons, being naturall borne
subjects, as he shall think meet, 1. to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
and execute all manner of jurisdictions,
privileges, and preeminences in any wise
touching or concerning any spirituall or
Ecclesiastical jurisdiction. 2 to visit. 3 to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
correct and amend, all such excesses,
or defects whatsoever, which by any maner
of Ecclesiasticall power, authority, or juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
might been have been reformed, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
corrected, amended, or restrained.</p>
            <p>The Princes power in visiting, reforming, and
correcting abuses, enormities, errours, heresies,
&amp;c. may be seen, as in a liuely picture, in the
high commission, to be not onely a temporall
power, but also a spirituall to inflict Ecclesias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall
censures &amp; punishments. For the Prince
could not communicate this power to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate
Commissioners, except he claimed it to
himselfe as Principall. For none can transferre
that to others, which he hath not himselfe. It
must follow therefore that the Princes power
is Ecclesiastical, not onely in respect of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and matter whereupon it worketh, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies,
errours, abuses, &amp;c. but also formally in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the manner, to wit, by inflicting Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
censures and punishments, unlesse we

               </gap>me that suspension, deposition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
are not Ecclesiastical, but civill
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7812:10"/>
punishments and censures, which were absurd.
We shall entreat of the power of the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
in the next chapter severally by it
selfe.</p>
            <p>As for the relaxation of the Canons or
lawes in that 1. first for ever, when as they
are altogether abrogated by the Prince. 2.
for a time onely, as when hee granteth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of any crime or transgression of the
Canons, for times by gone and to come,
when both infamie is abolished, and the
transgressor is restored to his former state.
4. When the grace of the Canon is granted
for time to come, to any certaine person up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
speciall occasion, the cause being tried,
which (grace) they call dispensation, which
is for the most part done, when the faculties
of this kinde granted by the Archbishop
of Canterbury upon whom this office doth
lye by statute, are confirmed with the great
seale of England; or when, if he without just
cause refuseth, the Chancellour of England,
granteth them primarily, according to the
statute made thereanent.</p>
            <p>If the Prince may abrogate the canons of the
Church without consent of the church, in vain
were the Canons of the Church made. Or that
the Church may not abrogate any canon, when
they finde it proveth inconvenient, is as great
an inconvenience. In vaine likewise are canons
strengthened, and guarded with censures, and
punishments, and the black markes of infamie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7812:11"/>
set upon heynous crimeswith the legall effects
thereof, if the Prince may abolish the crime, as
simoniacall paction, or any the like, or else in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie
arising upon the crime, and make petent
the ports of Ecclesiastical dignities to infamous
men, against the rule of the Law. <hi>Infamibus
portae ne pateant dignitatum.</hi> The Prince granteth
also dispensations, either primarily by his
Chancellour, if the Archbishop refuse, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarily
confirming the faculties and dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
granted by the Archbishop, and so by
dispensations may dissipate, and wound at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
the Canons of the Church. Now the Prince
may dispense by their lawes in all causes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pope of Rome was wont to dispense of
old.</p>
            <p>The third sort of rights restored as due
to the crowne, which were not in use, but
since the Popes authority was driven forth,
concerne Benefices Ecclesiasticall, and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses,
in that the Prince may 1. enjoyne the
Archbishop to confirme the election, as
also to consecrate the elected into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke.
2. to unite and consolidate, or
to divide lesser Benefices, or Bishopricks,
which were before united. 3. to grant a
vacant Bishopricke, or lesser Benefice, in
title of trust, which they call a Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.
4. to translate Bishops from one
Bishopricke to another. 5. of two, which
are nominated, to choose one to be a Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragane
Bishop. 6. to enlarge, or contract
the bounds and marches of any Diocie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:7812:11"/>
Election, confirmation, and consecration,
of Bishops were performed of old all at one
time, and that in a Synode of Bishops. If the
Prince may unite, and enlarge Diocies, and
Parishes without the consent of those, who
have interest, hee may make parishes Diocies,
and Diocies great Provinces. The competent
flockes for Pastors should bee measured by
the Church who calleth them, and knoweth
best what burthen is most proportionable to
their strength. Bishops should not be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at Popes, or Princes pleasures, as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
commeth to passe in our times. The old
Canons condemne this leaping from See to
See. Ambitious and covetous men cannot
content themselves, till they get either a fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or more glorious Bishopricke. Some are
not content of one Bishopricke, except they
also get the commendam and custody of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.
They must not have two Bishopricks
at once by the Canons, yet heir a tricke, one
they may have in title of a Bishopricke, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by way of trust and custody till it bee
planted. A man may not have two wives, yet
hee may have two women, one as a wife, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
as a Lemman. Some of them have kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
another Bishopricke in commendam six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
or twentie yeares, as the Bishop of
Glocester was commendatare of Bristow.
Yea they may keepe this Lemman all their
life time, if it please the Prince to bestow a
perpetuall commendam. For commendams
are not onely temporarie, but also perpetuall,
whereas of old they endured onely for sixe
moneths, or some like short space.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:7812:12"/>
They enrich themselves not onely with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendams
of other Bishoprickes, but also when
that cannot be had, with the commendams of
fat parsonages, and lesser benefices. The Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
Bishop hath a greater taske then hee can
commodiously expede, or else, because hee is a
loytering Lord, he must have a suffragane Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
to exercise some pontifical parts of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
in some part of the Diocie, and disburthen
him that farre. This Suffragane Bishop is to be
chosen by the Prince out of the Leits of the
two presented by the Diocesan Bishop, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the statute made 26. Henr. 8. cap. 14.
Translating of Bishops, erecting and changing
of Bishops Sees, union of Bishoprickes, enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Diocies, were in time of Poperie, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
cases, reserved for the Pope of Rome.</p>
            <p>We say then, that the Prince, as supreme head
and governour of the Church of England, is
supreme judge in matters of heresie, simonie,
idolatry, and all causes whatsoever, hath all
maner of spirituall jurisdiction united to the
crowne, may commit the exercise and executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the same to others also, so that they bee
naturall borne subjects, may conferre benefices,
and consequently give Pastors to flockes, may
choose Bishops without Dean and Chapter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
appellations, abbrogate canons, abolish
infamie, and restore the infamous to dignities,
grant dispensations in all causes where the Pope
was wont to dispense, give Bishoprickes and
lesser benefices in commendams, enlarge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
unite, divide Diocies. &amp;c. And this hee
may, whether he be a Christian or not, so that
he be righteous possessour of the Crowne: for
all the particulars above rehearsed, are sayd to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7812:12"/>
be due of right to the crowne, so that true or
false Christian, or infidell, male or female, man
or child, have all alike right. What is due to
the Christian Magistrate, is due indeed to him,
not because he is a Christian, but because he is
a Magistrate. A Christian Prince doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
better how to use his righteous power,
then the infidel, but hee can claime no further
authority then the infidell, and his power is
onely <hi>cumulative,</hi> as I have sayd, not <hi>privative.</hi>
Now, whether the particulars above rehearsed
belong to any Prince whatsoever, be he true or
false Christian, or infidell, I think him too sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that cannot judge.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 2. Of the High Commission.</head>
            <p>THE High Commission is called commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of jurisdiction in causes Ecclesiastical,
it is called the high commission by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of it, to strike a greater terrour in the
hearts of subjects.</p>
            <p>The commissioners are partly civil, partly Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
persons, as the Archbishops, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
other Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons,
Chancellours, some of the secret counsell, and
of the chief Iudges, Courtiers, Aldermen, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
the Lieutenant of the Tower, the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
and others making up a great number.
But it is not requisite that all these, whose
names are set down in the kings letters patents,
should be present at every Session, to make up
a full judicature, but power is given to any
three of the number, the Archbishop being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7812:13"/>
alwayes one. As with us are nominated and
appoynted by the Kings letters patents to the
number of fortie or fiftie persons, Bishops,
Counsellors, Noble men, Barons, Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Ministers, yet power is given to any five
of them to make up the full judicature, the
Archbishops of Saintandros, and Glasgow, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one of them being of the number of the five
alwayes. And as with us, so there also, graue
Counsellours, and Iudges, and other of hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
respect, may well be desired to be present
when an incestuous person, or some other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efactor
is brought before them, that their
countenance at one time or other may bring
credit to their great authority. But when a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
or any other godly professour is to bee
troubled for nonconformity, or writing against
crossing and kneeling, or having, or spreading
of bookes touching reformation of abuses, and
corruptions in the Church; then are they not
desired, lest being present, they should perceive
the mysteries of their iniquitie, by which they
uphold their pompe, and Lordly Domination.
If there be a courtier, or new upstart that favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
them, or dare not controll them, hee may
well be advertised to be present.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop hath power to associate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe any two nominated in the Kings
letters parents, whether they bee Ecclesiasticall
or civill persons, as for example, the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of the Tower, and the Postmaster: as with
us the Archbishop may assume any foure of
the number to be his assessours; as for example,
Mr. <hi>Thomas Henderson</hi> comissarie of Edinburgh,
M. <hi>Iohn Weemes</hi> commissarie of Saintandros,
M. <hi>Iames Hammilton</hi> commissarie of Glasgow,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7812:13"/>
and the Chauntour of Glasgow Mr. <hi>David
Sharpe,</hi> or any other foure Ecclesiasticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
or civill enrolled in the letters patents.</p>
            <p>These three, as for example, the Archbishop,
Postmaster, and Lieutenant of the Tower, have
power to inquire in all heresies, errours,
schismes, contempts and enormities whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
which were wont to be reformed by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
lawes, and jurisdiction, in all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
and contempts committed against the
forme of their service, and common prayers,
and other late statutes made anent Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
matters, as also seditious bookes, private
conventicles, adulteries, fornications, outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
misbehaviours, disorders in marriages,
and other offences particularly expressed in
the letters patents, and all other grievous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
punishable by the Ecclesiasticall lawes
of the Realme. So with us the five, as for
example, the five abovenamed, have power
to take triall of all offenders in life, and
doctrine, or religion, or scandalous in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of these, intercommoners and recepters of
Iesuites, Seminarie and Masse Priests, hearers
of Masse, and excommunicate Papists, <hi>(so
like)</hi> recusants, or not communicants, <hi>(so
like)</hi> incestuous or adulterous persous,
obstinate contemners of the discipline of
of the Kirke, and excommunicate for the
same: all ministers, preachers, Doctors, or
masters of Schooles, Colledges and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities,
all exhorting and lecturing Readers,
for preaching, or speaking in publicke, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the present established order of the
kirk, (<hi>truth</hi>) or estate, against any of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the bypast generall assemblies of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7812:14"/>
Kirk (<hi>truth</hi>) specially of the acts of generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
holden at Perth in the moneth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
1618, (<hi>truth</hi>) and all disobeyers of the sayd
acts (<hi>truth</hi>) likewise writers of Pamphlets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to any of the constitutions of the Kirke, or
Printers of the sayd bookes and pamphlets
(<hi>truth</hi>) or of any other bookes without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
            <p>These three commissioners may authorize
their drunken pursevant to breake open mens
studies, chambers, coffers, letternes, and search
if there be any bookes, or writs against their
Hierarchie, and the orders of their Kirke, and
to spoile at their pleasure.</p>
            <p>These three commissioners may convent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, any subject of whatsoever degree, or
calling, civill or Ecclesiasticall, in whatsoever
season of the yeare, earing time or harvest, from
whatsoever part of the kingdome, even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motest,
for whatsoever offence reputed Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall,
even the lightest, to the great detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and domage of the subjects. So with us,
may these or any other five in the number, the
Archbishop, or any one of them being alwayes
present, summon and call before them, at the
times and places they shall thinke most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
any person dwelling within the kingdom
of Scotland, and provinces of Saintandros, and
Glasgow.</p>
            <p>These three commissioners have power to
command the Shireffes, Iustices, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
and subjects to apprehend, or cause to
be apprehended, such persons as they shal think
good, and take such bonds for their appearance,
as they shall prescrive, or to commit them to
prison. So may the five with us direct their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7812:14"/>
to the Captaine and Lieutenant of the
Kings guard, the Provost and Bailies of the
Burgh, where they shall happen to sit, Shiriffes
and Bailies of Regalities, to search, take, and
apprehend, whom they please, and to present
them before them.</p>
            <p>The three commissioners have power to
force any person convented before them, whom
they suspect, to accuse himselfe upon his own
oath, to answer to their interrogatories, when
there is no accuser, nor article of accusation li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled
against him. He must sweare to answer
to that, which he doth not as yet understand,
not so much as in generall. And to grace this
oath, they call it the oath <hi>ex officio.</hi> If any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
refuse to take this oath, hee is forthwith
committed to prison. The manner of taking
the oath, is by laying their hand, or three fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
on the book, to sweare by God, and the
contents of the booke, that they shall answer
truely to such things as shall bee demanded of
them; and when the book is kissed, the oath is
accepted,<note place="margin">Pag. 249.</note> as <hi>Barow</hi> reporteth in his Discovery.
And although the penalties of the statutes bee
never so great, as <hi>Premunire, abjuration, forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of lands and goods,</hi> and some of the offences
are limited to bee tried onely in the Kings
Bench, yet the partie suspected shall be forced
by this commission, to accuse himselfe, upon
his owne oath, upon such captious interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
as the wit of man can devise, when there is
neither accuser, nor libell of accusation, sayth
<hi>Nicholas Fuller</hi> in his arguments and defence
of his Clients. This oath was set on foot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4. at the instant sute of the
Prelates, for detecting and suppressing of those,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7812:15"/>
whom that blind age called Lollards, that is,
for suppressing of the Gospell, which was pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
out of corners. The Commons repined
against that Statute <hi>ex officio,</hi> and the godly
wrote against it, as a bloodie Maximinian law:
They were first ordeined to accuse themselves,
and then to be burnt. See <hi>Fox</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> 4. The
same oath doe the Prelates, now make a meanes
to suppresse a due reformation of their Church,
Worthy <hi>Vdal,</hi> and many more have ended their
daies in the prison, for refusall of this unjust,
and superstitious oath.</p>
            <p>The three Commissioners have power to fine
at their discretions, to commit to prison for non
compearance, or for contumacie in refusing to
obey their decrees, or reputed desert of their
offence, and all the Iayles, Wards, and Prisons
in the land, are at their command to receive
the person committed, and sent by them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
So with us the Captaines and Constables
of the Kings Wardes, and Castles, jaylors &amp; kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of prisons, in burgh, or land, are charged
to receive, and deteyne all persons directed to
them, in such forme, as shall be prescribed in
the warrant subscribed by any five of them,
one of the Archbishops being alwayes of the
number. Neither may the imprisoned be set at
libertie, but at their pleasures. And with us also
the Lords of his Ma: privie Councell, <hi>are required
upon the sight of any certificate subscribed by any
5. of the sayd Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners, one of the sayd Archbishops
being alwayes one, either of fine, imposed upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or upon the refusing to compeir before the sayd
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners, to direct a summar charge of horn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ten dayes for payment of the fine that shall be
imposed upon them, and to direct others letters for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7812:15"/>
denouncing persons that shall refuse to compeir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the sayd Commissioners, of the which letters no
suspension or relaxation shall be granted, without a
testimony under one of the Archbishops hands, of
the parties obedience and satisfaction.</hi> Howbeit
with them they bee thus authorized by the
Kings letters patents, to fine, ward, and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
yet are they not so authorised by the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
whereupon the Commission is founded,
which I have set down in the beginning of the
first chapter. For it was ancient jurisdiction Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
which was restored to the
Crown in that act, and meant to be executed
by the Commissioners, as <hi>Nicholas Fuller</hi> avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the defence of his Clients. But to fine,
imprison, and force any person to accuse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
upon their own enforced othes, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no accuser known, nor accusation libelled,
he proved, was not ancient jurisdiction Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall,
but brought in, in the second yeere of

               </gap>. <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4. In the record of the worthy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the House of the Commons, at the
Parliam. holden 1610, we have this greivance.
<hi>Secondly, for that whereas by the intention and
words of the sayd statute, Ecclesiasticall jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is restored to the Crowne, and your highness<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
that statute inabled to give onely such power Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall
to the sayd Commissioners, yet under
colour of some words in that statute, whereby the
Commissioners are authorized to execute their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
according to the tenour and effect of your
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighnesse letters patents, and by letters patents
grounded therupon, the sayd Commissioners do fine
and imprison, and exercise other authority, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction restored
by that statute, which wee conceive to bee a great
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rong to the subjects.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7812:16"/>
Aud that these Commissioners might as well by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of these words, if they were so authorized by
your Highnesse letters patents, fine without stint,
and imprison without limitation of time, as also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to will and discretion, without any rules of
law, spirituall or temporall, adiudge and impose ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
confiscation of goods, forfeiture of lands, yea &amp;
the taking away of limme and of life it selfe, and
this for any matter whatsoever pertaining to spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
jurisdiction. Which never was, nor could bee
meant by the makers of that law.</hi> To fine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prison
at pleasure, are punishments belonging
to the temporall sword, which Christ hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
his Apostles, and all Pastors their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
to use. The weapons of their warfare
are not carnall, but spirituall. Christ commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto them keyes, not swords. In very
deed, there is no crueller beast, nor more tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
then a degenerate Churchman. Hee is
more insolent and outragious with the Dative
sword, then Princes are with the Native. Why
should they not be like their eldest brother,
that bloody beast of Rome. Degenerate Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimen
will either usurpe the power of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
sword, or take it when it is offered, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver abuse it.</p>
            <p>The three commissioners may inflict spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
censures and punishments, as suspension, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation,
deposition, excommunication. They
may call for a Priest, comand him to denounce
and declare in some Cathedrall Church, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick place, the offender to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
but they enquire, cognosce,
decerne, and pronouuce the sentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
in their Court; and the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
may be denounced long after: and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7812:16"/>
the Priest should pronounce the sentence
in judgement, yet he should bee onely like the
dempster, that pronounceth the doome, or like
the hangman, or poore slave directed by the
judge: hee neither inquireth, cognosceth, nor
decerneth. Yet, if ye think the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners may
excommunicate, because the Archbishop is
present, ye are deceived: for his power in the
high commission is not Episcopall, nor Archie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopall,
but delegate onely from the Prince,
which other assessours not Bishops, have as
well as he; and by this delegate power he with
his two associates, as I have sayd, may inflict this
censure upon any subject within England or
Ireland, which hee cannot doe as Bishop or
Archbishop, for their jurisdiction ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is limited within the bounds of their Diocie,
or Province. When <hi>Spottiswood,</hi> pretended
Archbishop of Saintandros, was but a rurall
minister in Calder; and Law of Glasgow, a rural
minister at Kirkliston, possessing onely the
rents of Bishoprickes, not authorized as yet
with the office of Bishops (for that pretended
Assembly of Glasgow was not yet convocated)
yet were they armed with power to decern ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
against any subject within our
Realm, &amp; to command the minister of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
to proceed against him: and if he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
to suspend, deprive, or ward him. They were
thus armed immediatly before that pretended
assembly, with power of warding, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ining, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
suspending, degrading, and decerning
excommunication, without the consent of the
Church, or approbation of the Estates, that
they might wring out of the hands of the Kirke
at that corrupt, and pretended Assembly, Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Episcopall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7812:17"/>
jurisdiction, which many times they
protested never to usurp, before and without
the free consent of the Church obtained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
O perfidious violence! What we have
said of excommunication, may be likewise said
of suspension, deprivation, and deposition:
The Archbishop doth not suspend or deprive,
as Archbishop, but as the Kings Delegate,
Iudge, and Commissioner, by which power he
may suspend or deprive Ministers out of the
bounds of his ordinarie jurisdiction, which no
Bishops or Archbishops may doe by their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
power. We had a late example in our
own Archbishops about two yeares since: for
<hi>when</hi> Mr. <hi>Spotiswood</hi> was at Court, Mr. <hi>Law</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Archbishop of Glasgow, suspended Mr.
<hi>Blyth,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Forrester</hi> from their ministerie,
which he could not doe as Archbishop, for they
were neither within his Diocie, nor his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
He did it then as head of the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
sitting for the time, that is, by a delegate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
from the King. To let passe, that at that
same vile Assembly, no mention was made of
Archbishops: and paction was onely made
with these men who had the benefices, for
which vulgarly they were called Bishops, that
excommunication, suspension, deprivation, and
deposition, should not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
not that they might suspend, deprive, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
by themselves, and at their pleasures
in the high Commission, or any where else, but
according to the damnable Canons made by
that wofull, but pretended and null Assembly.
Farther, the Prince may inable one or mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
lay men with this same commission, wihout
mixture of Ecclesiasticall persons. It is then an
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7812:17"/>
extraordinary power, wherewith they are ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the Prince to suspend, depose, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.
But the Prince hath not this
power himselfe, and therfore by no right of
Gods law may he communicate this power un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, and it is a proud usurpation over the
Church to them to receive it, or exercise it. In
the Parliament holden 1592. some acts, which
were made in that turbulent time of the 1584
yeare, were repealed as followeth. <hi>Item, our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
Lord, and Estates of Parliament foresayd,
abrogates, cassis, and annulls the act of the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
holden at Edinburgh the sayd yeare</hi> 1584.
<hi>granting commission to Bishops, and other iudges
constitute in Ecclesiasticall causes, to receive his
highnesse presentations to benefices, to give collation
thereupon: and to put order in all causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
which his Maiesty and estates foresayd, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
to be expired in the selfe, and to be null in time
comming, and of none availe, force, nor effect.</hi> Not
withstanding of this repealed commission, our
perfidious Prelats haue resumed the same again
without any law reviving it. But let us proceed,
and heare what is recorded in the worthy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Parliament above mentioned.
<hi>The Act is found to be inconvenient,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>and of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

offence, pertaining to spirituall jurisdiction, is by
the colour of the said words, and letters patents
grounded therupon, made snbject to excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and punishment, by that strange and exorhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
power, and commission, whereby the least offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
not committing any thing of any enormous

These three Commissioners being armed with
double vengeance, and power of both swords,
temporall and spirituall, may strike a man at
one strike, in one sentence, for one and the selfe
same fault, both with temporall and Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
censures, and punishments. They may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and imprison a minister at one time for
one offence: they may fine and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
at one time, &amp;c. Againe, they may punish
the same offence in one person with a fine, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
with imprisonment, in the third with
excommunication, in the fourth with depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For their owne pleasures and discretions,
and not the lawes, ar the rules of their censures
and punishments. Let us see what is recorded
in the grievances. <hi>Therein</hi> (to wit in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

with the execution therof, yet the execution of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
such Statutes (divers whereof were made since</hi>
1. Eliz.) <hi>are commended and committed to these
Commissioners Ecclesiasticall, who are either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
the punishments contained in the Statutes, being
Premunire, and other high nature; and so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
a man upon his owne oath, to accuse and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
himselfe to these punishments, or else to inflict
other temporall punishment at their pleasure. And

            <p>The three Commissioners may not onely
enquire, and try, but also judge in all causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,
in causes of heresie, simonie, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
&amp;c. It is, I grant, provided in the statute
1. Elizabeth, <hi>that they shall not in any wise have au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or power, to order, determine, or adiudge,
any matter or cause to he heresie, but onely such, as
heretofore have been determined, ordered, or adiuged
to be heresie, by the authoritie of the Canonicall
Scripture; or by the first 4. generall Councels, or any
of them; or by any other generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
wherein the same was declared heresie,
by the expresse and plaine words of the said Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Scriptures, or such as heereafter shall be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
iudged, or determined to be heresie by the high
Court of Parliament of this Realme, with
the assent of the Clergie in their Convocation.</hi>
This provision is no limitation, unlesse wee
will say, that without the limits of the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Scripture there are some heresies deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7812:19"/>
which are not determined within the
bounds of the Canonicall Scripture. Seeing
then they may determine in all he resies deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
in the Scripture, they may determine in
all herefies whatsoever, and may affirme that to
bee determined for heresie in the Scripture
which is orthodoxall. If the commissioners,
the Princes delegates, may be judges in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of herefie, farre more is the Prince himselfe
by their lawes, and that without the provision
foresayd, wherwith the delegate commissioners
are circumscribed.</p>
            <p>These three Commissioners have power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
appellations from other inferiour courts
Ecclesiasticall, like as the five with us have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
by the Kings letters patents, <hi>to receive,
and disusse, all appellations made to them from any
inferiour Ecclesiasticall Judges, and to inhibite the
said Ecclesiasticall judges to proceed iu any matter,
which they shall hold to be improper for them, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they shall perceiue the said Iudges to have behaved
themselves partially, advocating the said matters is
their own judgment.</hi> See the commission renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Anno 1618. So they may draw to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
any cause whatsoever, agitated in infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
courts, not onely at the appellation of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
notorious villaine pretending grievance, but
also by advocation, when they shall construe

of the proclamation it was pretended,
that this high commission is erected to stay ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of causes granted by the Lords of
Councell and Session. <hi>That forasmuch, as it
hath bene compleaened by the Archbishops, Bishops,
and other Ministers of that his Maiesties King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7812:19"/>
that advocations and suspensions, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
granted by the Lords of Councell and Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto such, as bee in processe before them,
and their Ecclesiasticall Courts, for offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,

                  </gap>ing the said, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
and suspensions, or meanes to delay their
tryall and punishment, Therfore &amp;c.</hi> Complaint
hath been made sometime by ministers, and
suit to stay advocations, that the ordinarie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures
Ecclesiasticall might proceed to their
censures without stop, but not to change ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations.
Are the Archbishops and Bishops
with their associates, honester and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientions
men, then the Lord of Councel and
Session? An ambitious and covetous Clergie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
is of all men the most vile and prophane.
Did the Bishops complaine? why do they then
advocate causes from inferiour Courts Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall,
seeing they have usurped the sway of
proceedings in Courts Ecclesiasticall to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Doe they accuse themselves of partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
proceeding in inferiour courts, or handling
improper causes, and will these same men bee
lesse partiall, and more conscientious in the

without their approbation, and appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should ascend from inferiour courts to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour

non debet.</hi> The ordinarie lawfull courts Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
farre more then should be aided, and
assisted by the secular power, and not molested
or stopped. The truth is, that this high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is erected to suppresse the libertie of
the Kirk, to maintain the usurped power, and
tyrannous domination of our perfidious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
over Synods generall &amp; Provinciall, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
&amp; sessions, &amp; to effectuate the intended
conformity, which they know they will never
get done in Synods and Presbyteries, unlesse the
terrour of this high commission were standing
above their heads. And therfore when they
urge conformity, they haue their recourse to
this weapon, or in Synods and Presbyteries
men are terrified with the feare of it. This is
their strong castell, out of which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and hold in slavery &amp; bondage the whole
citie. Here the Bonifacian Prelats stoutly draw
the two swords, fine, consine, suspend, deprive,
imprison, &amp;c. But the couragious souldier
fighting the Lords battell, will not bee borne
downe with any such outrages, and terrours.
Now as they receive appellations from inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
courts, no appellation can bee made from
these three, or our five, suppose their injustice
and tyranny cry never so loud. I wonder if the
heart of any faithfull Patriot, let be conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
professour, can digest this.</p>
            <p>These three Commissioners may appoynt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Commissioners, from whom also as sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delegates,
they may receive appellation.</p>
            <p>I will add out of the record of the grievances
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7812:20"/>
of the house of Commons these considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
First, out of the statute, that the said act
is found to be inconvenient, and of dangerous
extent in divers respects: <hi>for that it inableth the
making of such a commission, as well to any one
subiect borne, as to more.</hi> Item, <hi>for that by the
sayd Statute, the King and his successors may (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
your Maiestie hath beene pleased, out of your
gracious disposition otherwise to order) make and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
such commission, into all the Countries and Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,
yea, into every parish of England, and
therby all causes may be taken from ordinary juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of Bishops, Chancellers, and Arch-deacons,
and Lay-men solely be inabled to excommunicate, and
exercise all other spirituall censures: For that limit
touching causes subiect to this commission being
onely with these words,</hi> viz. (<hi>such as perteine to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,
or ecclesiasticall jurisdiction) it is very hard
to know, what matters or offences are included in
that number. And the rather because it is unknown
what ancient Canons, or lawes spirituall are in force,
and what not: from whence ariseth great uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
and occasion of contention.</hi> Out of the
commission grounded upon the statute. <hi>That
the commisson giveth authoritie to inforce men cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into question, to enter into recognisance, not
onely for appearance from time to time, but also for
performance of whatsoever shall be, by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners
ordered. And also that it giveth power to
enjoyn parties defendant, or accused to pay such fees to
ministers of the Court, as by the Commissioners shall
be thought fit.</hi> As for the execution of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
it is found grievous these wayes among
other. 1. <hi>For that lay men are by the commissioners
punished for speaking (otherwise then in iudiciall
places and courtes) of the simonie, and other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7812:21"/>
of spirituall men, though the thing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
be true, and the speech tending to the inducing
of some condigne punishment. 2. In that these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
usually appoynt and allot to women dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
at, and unwilling to live with their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
such portions &amp; allowances for present main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as to them shall seem fit: to the great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of wives to be disobedient, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
against their husbands.</hi> 3: <hi>In that their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sevants,
or other ministers imployed in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of suspected offenders in any things spirituall,
and in the searching for any supposed scandalous
bookes, use to breake open mens houses, closets and
deskes, rifling all corners, and secret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> custodies, as in
cases of high treason, or suspition therof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their commission is grounded upon a statute
and act of Parliament, howbeit it agreeth not
with the statute. Wee have not so much as a
shew of a statute for commission of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
in causes Ecclesiasticall, and yet
our usurping Prelates tyrannize over loyall
subjects, faithfull Patriots, conscientious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours,
deserted by these, who will be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fathers of the Common wealth, left open
and naked to their violent rage, without any
protection of the law, as if they were but the
vile off scourings of the land. Will not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
in Parliament redresse this proud usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Shall the house of Commons in their
Parliament bee grieved not onely at the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
power of this high commission, but also
at the statute it selfe, and shall our nobles, and
inferiour estates not be grieved at our usurped
commission? Or will they suffer the like sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
and make the countrey mourn and groane
for it the next day, as our neighbours have
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7812:21"/>
done? Can Princes or estates give power of
spirituall censures either to lay or spiritual men?
Or may they lawfully put the temporall sword
in the hand of Pastors? Or may spirituall men as
they call them, accept it: If neither can be done,
how can the estates erect, ratifie, or suffer such a
commission? What is this but the Spanish inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition?
Set me up this throne, Satan shall set up
Papistry, or any other religion whatsoever in
short processe of time. For they sit at the rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and may turn religion as it pleaseth them,
and when they see fit occasions, and themselves
to have able power.</p>

            <p>THis proud name of Archbishop is not to

               </gap>ed and mightie
Giants the Patriarches of Constantinople, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,
Alexandria, and Rome, who were moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
farre above Metropolitanes when the time
was neere that the Antichrist should be moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on horsebacke. But after that he was moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then Metropolitanes that they might keepe
some proportion with their head, were lifted
up to a degree of power above other Bishops,
&amp; invested into an office that the book of God,
&amp; the Apostolical Church never knew, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate
Bishops, to convocate Synods, to receive
appellations fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the courts of inferior Bishops,
to visit the Diocies of other Bishops within
the Privince. A Diocesan Bishop that is a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7812:22"/>
Bishop over many flockes, and Pastors of one
Diocie, was unknown to the Apostles, far more
a Bishop of Bishops, a provincial Bishop,
an Archbishop having iurisdiction and power
over the comprovinciall Bishops. The Church
being for the most part within the bounds of
the Roman Empire, the governours framed the
government according to the forme of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and made degrees in the Church like to
degrees in the common-wale. They intended
not to set up the Antichrist, but being led, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with carnall wisedome, partly with ambition
and vainglory, wittingly and willingly did that,
which brought in the Antichrist, and so the
mysterie of iniquity, which began to work in
the Apostles time, wrought on still, till Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
come to his full strength, and perfect age.
While they were framing degrees according to
the fashion of the Romane Empire, first Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
then Metropolitanes, then Primates, then
the foure great Patriarches, they were but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
the second beast according to the image
of the first beast, and the Bishop of Rome, one
of the foure Patriarches, became the head. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was the Bishop and Metropolitan so great
in power before the Antichrist come to his
perfect age, as they were after, and have been
ever since, even to this day. They hatched him,
and he hath rewarded them with greater au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and power. But giving and not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Diocesan Bishops to bee of divine or
Apostolicall institution, we will in this chapter
onely let you see the Archbishops unlawful su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
over them.</p>
            <p>Persons having lesser ample administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

having eyther iudiciall administration,
or administration not iudiciall, eyther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
by law, or introduced without law,
constitute by law, as the administration of
the ordinarie Iudges. They doe execute it
under the Prince, either in their owne name,
or the name of others. In their owne name
as Bishops, so called, either with addition, as
Archbishops, or simply Bishops. Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
(being in England two, Canterburie
and York) are considered, eyther in respect
of their peculiar Diocies in all respects, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Bishops: or in respect of the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
according to the place, which they
hold, eyther in the ecclesiasticall state, or the

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to both the Archbishops, or that which
is peculiar to Canterburie. According to
the place, which is common, they are to be
considered, eyther as in their ordination, or
as after their ordination.</p>
            <p>In the ordination it selfe, it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered,
that if they the Archbishops haue
not been heretofore Bishops, they must be
consecrated by some Bishops. If they haue
been Bishops, then their election onely is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by some Bishops.</p>
            <p>Metropolitanes were chosen, confirmed, and
consecrated of old, not by some, but by the
whole Synode of the comprovinciall Bishops.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7812:23"/>
But the English Bishop have no Provinciall
Synods to any such purpose. They have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Discipline prescribed in Gods word,
nor the Discipline of the old Bishops and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitanes,
but the Discipline and policie
which was in use in the time of greatest dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
under the Antichrist; Here also wee see a
<hi>signe,</hi> that they make the Bishop and their
Priest of a different order. For a Priest, when
he is made a Bishop, must receive a new conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration.
But a Bishop when hee is made an
Archibishop, is not consecrated of new, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
hee bee in degree of power and jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
above other Bishops.</p>
            <p>After ordination they are to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
either as Metropolitanes, or as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,

the titles, and discharge the functions of
Archbishops, and Primates also. Metopolitans
at the first were not called Archbishops, as I
have sayd, but the Patriarches greater and lesser
onely, to whom appellation was made from the
Metropolitane. But when Metropolitanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to receive appellations, then this proud stile
descended to them also, as we will see inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
that as Bishops, they received appellations.
They will extoll the wisedome of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
in framing degrees in the Church, and
yet they themselves confound these degrees,
and offices, and make one man to bee a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan,
an Archbishop, and a Patriarch.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7812:23"/>
Many degrees were made to the Pope, to
climm up to his throne: that beeing done,
then was there confusion againe. We have this

may not suffer a minister to ordaine or
say handes one a minister for him. How
can they then bee so shamelesse, as to say,
that Archbishops bee of divine institution;
if another may consecrate a bishop as well
as hee, whether it bee with his consent, or
without it? Abbots, who have been but
simple Priests, have of old ordained bishops
without either commission or consent of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
as <hi>Beda</hi> restifieth.<note place="margin">Hist. 1. 3. c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

This, that they call consecration of Bishops,
was not known to the purer Church. The
ministers chose one of their number to bee a
perpetuall moderator of the common actions,
and called him Bishop, as at Alexandria, where
he was first hatche<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and made at the first, but

according to the Kings rescript, 4. in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
Synods, and giving the last voyce.</p>
            <p>Their Provincial Synods are not like the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synods which wee wont to have. For
ours were but Synods of Shires, 4, 5, or 6 clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall
Presbyteries assembling together twice in
the yeare. But their Provinciall Synode is a
Synod of the Bishops of one Province. All the
Diocies of the Archbishop, and of his suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gane,
or comprovinciall Bishops which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him, make but one province. And seeing
they have onely two Archbishops, they can
have but onely two Provinciall Synods. The
Metropolitane convocateth the Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
upon the Princes letter, which happeneth
very rarely. If the Prince direct his letter to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Bishop, as sometime hee hath done, what
need is there of a Metropolitan. For they say,
we cannot have Synods, unlesse we have Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitanes
to convocate them; and this is a
chiefe part of his function. If so be, why doth
he not exerce his function without a particular
letter of the Prince, as well as the Bishop doth
in convocating his Diocesan Synod. If that be
a part of his ordinary power to him, as this to
the other why doth it depend on the Princes
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7812:24"/>
letter, and how dare a common Bishop take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him notwithstanding of the Princes letter,
that which of office apperteineth to the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan.
Ye may see that this part of his function
also, is not of divine institution, that is so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
and changeable at the pleasure of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as they confesse themselves; Neyther is it
requisite of necessity to haue a Metropolitane
to convocate Synodes, for Synodes at the first
assembled without Metropolitanes. And in our
age, both in our owne, and other reformed
Churches, Synods have assembled, where there
is no Metropolitane. Nay rather, Synods would
be more frequently convocated, if they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
removed: it is so farre from the truth,
that either we cannot have Synods, unlesse we
have Metropolitanes, or that God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his word that they should convocate Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes.
For we haue no Synods Metropoliticall,
but onely Diocesan, since Metropolitans have
beene set over our heads, nor yet national, but
seldome, and dressed before hand for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
If it be not of divine institution, that the
Metropolitane should convocate Provinciall
Synods, neither is it to moderate. And as for
necessity there is none, as experience of our
owne and other reformed Churches can beare
witnesse: yea in their owne last Synode, <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to appellations interposed, &amp; made
from his Suffragane Bishops. 2. In visiting
the whole Province according to the lawes
and custome.</p>
            <p>As the Bishops haue suffragane Bishops un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, so the Bishops themselves are Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraganes
to the Archbishop. They are not his
suffraganes, as he is Metropolitane, but as he is
Archbishop. So that as Archbishop he hath
greater authority then he hath as Metropolitan.
For as Metropolitan he must doe nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Synode in the Dioces of another Bishop,
neyther by receiving appellation, nor by way
of visitation. But as Archbishop he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
appellations, and visite the Dioces of his
Province without a Synode, as being not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
superiour in honour, and prioritie of order,
but also in power of jurisdiction. And for this
his greatnes, which he attained unto, he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the proud title of Archbishop. The old
Bishops knew no other but a Metropolitane, &amp;
the Provinciall Synode assembling twice in the
yeare, to the which appellations were made. It
is troublesome, say they, to call Synodes so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
Dioces are so large, and the Synode should
be wearied to stay till all the appellations of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Courts were decided. Here a notable
tricke. First they say, it is needfull to haue
Synodes, and therefore needfull to haue a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane.
This againe they crosse and say,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7812:25"/>
there is no need of Synods, it is difficile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious
to have two provinciall Synods
in the yeare, as of old. The Archbishop may
doe all that the Synode did, receive appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
visit and correct the excesses and defects
of other bishops, onely he may not make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Ecclesiastical lawes without a Synod.
Neither is there any need of new Canons, the
old are sufficient. But I would demand, why
Synods may not be so easily, and so often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated
as of old? Is it because they have their
Diocies extended over one, two, or three Shires,
and the province extended almost as farr as the
kingdome: as Canterburies province in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and Saintandros in Scotland. Their wings
should be clipped, their Diocies and provinces
contracted and multiplied, if that the Discipline
of the old Bishops were to bee preserved, that
Synods may assemble. But before they loose
any part of their extensive power, and large im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
they will rather reteine the corrupted dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
brought in under Antichrist. If they
will say on the other side, the Diocies were as
ample of old, then why doe they pretend to
their loytering in their owne, or the Kings pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces,
the distance of their Diocies. And if they
will not convocate Provinciall Synods twice
in the yeare, what is the reason that they will
not convocate once in the yeare, or as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in the Councell of Basile,<note place="margin">Can. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
               </note> once in three
yeare? Yee may see, that this corruption is so
grosse, that it was palpable in the time of most
palpable darknesse. Againe, Synods did not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
onely to make Canons, but also for to
put order to all causes Ecclesiasticall. Farther,
there is continuall occasion to make new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7812:26"/>
and also to reforme or repeale old corrupt
canons. Neither doe Synods need to stay long
upon appellations. if the Church should med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
onely with causes properly Ecclesiasticall,
and the ancient judicatories inferiour were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
of presbyteries, and consistories. But to

then a grave and godly Synode should be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

doth not, nor will not take the pains as by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to decide the appellations. Hee hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Archbishops, and what they may not doe as
Archbishops, yet they may doe as little Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches.
As little Patriarches they may receaue

not make a leap from the Archdeacon or his
Officiall to the Archbishop, and passe by the
Bishop. Yet he may leap over him to that same

many parishes to entertaine their beneficed and

temporall domination, forbad them the stiles,
which were attributed unto, or usurped by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Princes, and magistrates, to set forth their
pompe and power, and for example he alledgeth
that stile which was given to some of the kings
of Aegypt, by one stile meaning all other of the
like kinde. For as he forbad them not onely to
be like the Kings of Aegypt, but generally like
the kings of the nations, so the titles of all secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Princes and Rulers, that rule Nations and
kingdomes, are forbidden. Farther, there is
greater pompe in the stile of <hi>Grace,</hi> then of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor,
and lesse truth: for there are none so
gracelesse, unclement, and cruell scoutges in the
hands either of Popes or Princes to scourge the
Church of Christ. These base fellowes must
also haue place before the greatest Nobles in
the land, and the chiefe seat in publick conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and parliaments. Canterbury must have
place before the chiefest officers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
Yorke before all except the Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
like the ambitious sonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to sit the one at the right, the other at the
left hand of Christ in his kingdom, which they
dreamed should be a glorious worldly Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.
They have also traines of men to attend
upon them, greater then many Noble men, and
some to beare up their taile,<note place="margin">Abstract. 237.</note> which no Noble
man hath. Fie. The Doctours of the civill law
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7812:29"/>
attend in their Scarlet robes upon Canterbury
his grace, when he passeth through Pauls. And
as I heare, when any come to his Chamber of
presence, they must hold off their hats, howbeit
his grace be not present himselfe. We shall see
more of their pompe in the next chapter.</p>
            <p>By the grant of Princes, as Immunities,
liberties, &amp;c. in their owne large fieldes or
possessions.</p>
            <p>Their immunities, liberties, priviledges and
jurisdictions in their Baronies and large posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
are but temporall, nothing availing to
further and advance Christs kingdom. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
are best known to them, who haue seen
their charters.</p>
            <p>Peculiar to any one of them, to wit, either
to York, as to have the praecedence before all
the officers of the kingdom, except the Lord
Chancellour. Or to Canterburie, as 1. to
take the place before all the officers of the
kingdom: whence it is, that he is called the
first Peere of the Realme. 2. to inaugurate
the king at his coronation. 3. to receive the
rents of the lands, which hold of him in
homage, while the heire is minor, not past
21. years, howbeit the same heir hold other
lands in chiefe of the crowne. 4. to hunt
with his owne hounds in any parke within
his own province.</p>
            <p>Bishops are made Peeres of the Realme, and
Canterbury is the first Peere, therefore he must
have place before all the officers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
wherof we spake before. He must inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the king at the coronation, which is a duty
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7812:29"/>
not appertaining to him: for the rites of coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
are not parts of the pastoral charge. And
suppose they were, they belong no more to a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
then to a minister, or to one bishop more
then to another. For if there were no more, but
to make an exhortation, to conceive a prayer,
and blesse, a minister may do that as wel as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
or a bishop as well as an Archbishop. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
have vassals under them as noble men
have. <hi>William the first ordained Bishopricks &amp; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies,
which held Baronies in pure and perpetual almes,
and untill that time were free from all secular ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
to be under military or knights service, enrolling
every Bishoprick and Abbay at his will and pleasure,
and appointing how many souldiours he would have
every of them to finde for him, and his successours,
in the time of hostilitie and warr.</hi> As they became
vassals to kings &amp; Emperours, so they laboured
to have many vassals under themselves, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that noblemen became their vassals. The
Earles of Glocester had lands of the Bishop of
Canterburie on this condition, that they should
be his stewards at his installing. And howbeit
the king should have the custody and ward of
the lands of those who hold of him in chief for
knight service, till the perfect age of the heir, yet
the lands which hold of the Archb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ar excepted.
Pastors &amp; ministers should be content of their
stipends, not medling with superiority over vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals,
personall or reall wards. Their bishops have
parks &amp; ponds, besides their palaces, for hunting
&amp; fishing. Canterburies grace may hunt in any
park within his own province, that is through al
England except 4. diocies, a pastime co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned
by the ancient canons in clergy men. <hi>Hierome</hi>
saith, <hi>he never read of a hunter that was a holy man.</hi>

Publike Notaries appointed by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
serve, as I suppose; the Diocies of the

wholly on them, it is no wonder, that they have

as they are to fall in the weeke follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
and why are not politick judges appointed
to grant such licences? It is the old superstition
then, not new policie, which is respected. Doe
none obtain licences but the diseased, aged, &amp;c.
and obtain they licences without money? The
101. canon of their last constitutions, giveth
power to the commissarie for faculties, to grant
licence for marriage without 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proclamations

as if persons of mean estate or quality, could
not have as necessary a cause to seek relaxation
of 3 proclamations. But if ther be any quantitie
of money in the purse, the person is of sufficient
qualitie. By these licences, children are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
married without consent of their parents,
and sometime the heire is carried away, and

            <p>Irregularitie is an impediment of the Canon
law, which inableth a man to take on orders, or
to minister into them, and consequently to bee
admitted to benefices, or to enjoy them. All the
Popish irregularities, which are not expresselie
taken away, either by their late canons, or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of the Realme, stand still in force with
them and they may observe them, as they
please. To sit in judgement upon bloud, was ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularitie
of old, yet these Bishops, make no
scruple of it, or any other thing may serve to
advance their greatnes. That which was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
amongst irregularities, but was in very
deed a divine, and not a Canonicall impediment
brought in by man, they made least account of,

to be an honest way to get a Church living, no such
base and beggarly one as you speak of? But is not
this currying of favour meere beggery? Is it any
whit a lesse filthie thing to come to a rectorie</hi> (or
Personage) <hi>by favour then by money? If wee will
judge indifferently, it is all one fault to creep in, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be by bribing and simonie, or by fawning and
flatterie. The rest of the rout in the Countrey are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in attending the common sort of Patrones,
whose thresholds they lye watching at, whose wives
they brave and court, as if they were their mistresses,
whose children they cogg with, whose servants they
allure with faire words, and promises, to be their
spokesmen, and in every place and poynt they play the
parts of miserable beggars. Some there are that begg
more craftily, like to those that sit in the high wayes,
or in places where two wayes meet, and there they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
pilled rods to passengers, to get a peece of money<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

therewith as it were a pennieworth for a pennie. So
doe men make way for their suits, by large gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of money in hand, or else by compacting to give
some of their yerely tithes for a gratification. But
some man will say, all this is not the corruption
of the Lawes, but the corruptions of men. Nay
surely, as long as that manner of conferring Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
charges taketh place, which hath been in use
among us to this day, there can be no remedie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to cure or prevent this beggarliness. Doe wee
not sufficiently find it to be true in experience? In
the late Parliament, Lawes were enacted severely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. But what came of that? nothing truely,
but that it made men deale more closely and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to cosen the Law. We must not thinke to doe any
good with our lawes, where Christs lawes are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.
But to proceed, whence once the living is by
beggerie obteined from the Patron, what a deale of
begging worke is there to come, for those Sir</hi> Iohn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack
latines, <hi>that institution might be had from
the Bishops. Heere hee must supplicate, not onely to
the right reverend Bishops, but to Master Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to my Lords Groom of his Chamber, his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
the Yeoman of his Butterie, and Larder, yea,
the meanest, that belongeth unto him. Not that
want of Latine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and learning will keep him from
entrance into his benefice; but that he that hath need
of money for dispatch, or speech with my Lord, or
the like, must fee the servants the better, whose gaine
commeth trowling in this way. There is no Castle so
defenced which a Latinelesse asse laden with golden
mettell, may not scale and conquer. Neither is there
only almost so unfit, that hath the repulse, but by
what engines he prevaileth, let them looke to it. The
like is the condition of Praebendaries, Archdeacons,
and Deanes. Nay, are the Bishops themselves cleare
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7812:34"/>
of this base beggarie? What meaneth then, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
haunting of the court, and hanging upon the
Nobles? Why doe they not stay and wait, till they be
sent for? yea why are they not rather pulled away
from their studies against their wills? Nay rather, if
a man should appeale to their consciences, whether a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If the sonne claime kindnes, as we call it, to

            <p>Beneficed men are licenced to take up the

or else hee could not have had sufficient

            <p>Generally: whence it is, that the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
may dispense in all causes not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to the word, if heretofore they have
been used or accustomed to bee had at the
Sea of Rome, or if not accustomed to bee
obtained at the Sea of Rome, if the Prince
himselfe, or those who are of his secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
doe permit.</p>
            <p>We heard of some speciall dispensations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
now we heare that the Archbishop may
dispense in all causes dispensed heretofore by
the Pope of Rome, and more also. The Pope
was never duly qualified to be a lawfull dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
no more is the Archbishop. Where it is
sayd, if the matter it selfe be not repugnant to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7812:37"/>
the word of God, it is to no purpose: for the
Pope will not say, that hee dispenseth in any
thing repugnant to the word of God, howbeit
he doth it in effect, and so doth the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.
For simonie, non-residencie, pluralitie of
benefices, readmission after the irregularitie of
apostasie, observation of superstitious dayes
and times, not eating of flesh in Lent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
dayes, which are here expressed, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to the law of God. Therefore he may
take the like libereie in usurie, perjurie, incest,
mariage within degrees of the Leviticall law,
and the rest of the cases and causes which were
reserved to the Pope of old.</p>
            <p>It is not without reason then that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of the Admonition call this Court a
<hi>filthy quagmire, and poysoned plash of all abbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,</hi>

            <p>Beside the Prerogative Court, the Court

that <hi>communi Presbyterorum consilio Ecclesiae gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernaba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur,
the Churches were governed by the joynt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7812:38"/>
advice of Presbyters.</hi> Our Opposites say, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
was onely private in the inner court,
the court of Conscience, not publicke in the
externall court, or Consistorie. It was so in the
time of Poperie, when the Priests were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from the externall governement of the
Church, which Bishops did vendicate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and their Courts, the poore Priest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no further power, then to receive private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
auricular confession, ponder the weight of
secret faults, and accordingly to enjoyne pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
But Hierome speaketh not of a severall,
but of a common councell, and joynt care of
many assembled together. For this private go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in the inner Court of conscience,
was not onely then, but continueth to this day,
wherby every Pastor may deal with the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of any of his own flock. But Hierome
speaketh of a government, which was altered af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Apostles times, and different from the
Episcopall government which followed, When
the Churches were thus governed in common,
by joynt advice of Presbyters, they had not a
perpetuall President; or as we use to speake, a
constant Moderator, who had this preeminence
during life set over them, to moderate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Meetings, but they choosed their Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
and changed them, as they thought fit.
No Pastor could claime this prioritie of order,
and direction of the common Meetings, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to him of office. The Apostles did no
where institute this same small difference of
Pastors, that some during life should be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators
of the rest, let be that majoritie of rule,
and superiority in power, which Bishops doe
claime. The Pastors, who were at Alexandria,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:7812:39"/>
the first we read to have set up a constant Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator,
to whom also they did appropriate the
name of Bishop. This was the beginning of
that great mischiefe which followed: This was
the Cockatrice egge out of the which Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
himselfe was hatched: For this perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Presidencie and prioritie of order, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
in superiority of power, and majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of rule, and the Bishops growing to some
grandeur, they behoved to have an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
and at last a Pope. So that if a Bishop
had not beene, a Pope had not been, and if
there had not been a Pope, the great Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
had not been.<note place="margin">cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Boni-gratis,</hi> supposed to
be the author of the Treatise <hi>de aetatibus Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi>
wondereth that the Popes Monarchie
should arise from so small a beginning. But
the Apostle telleth us, that that iniquitie was
a Mysterie, and that this Mysterie was working
under ground even in his time. For even the
Apostolicall times wanted not a proud <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi>
loving preeminence. A little seed will
bring forth a great Tree. If the Discipline
had not beene corrupted, as well as doctrine,
the great Antichrist could not have risen. All
the errours and heresies in doctrine and matters
of faith, which have entered in the Church,
could not have brought him in, unlesse errour
and corruption in the government had entred
in also; for unlesse this had been he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
no claime at all to governe and rule.</p>
            <p>I come therefore to our English bishops.
Let a man travell through Italie where the
Pope is, or Spaine where the Spanish Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, he shall finde no difference betwixt
the power of an Italian, Spanish, or English
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7812:39"/>
bishop. The English bishop is the same now
for power and greatnesse that hee was an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years since in the time of poperie. There
are foure things chiefly to bee considered in
him: First, the derivation of his power: 2.
the sole exercise of his authority. 3. the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of this his authoritie. 4. his extensive
power. As for the first, they are not bishops,
as we have sayd, <hi>iure divino,</hi> by divine instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or right, nor cannot bee. Neither are they
Bishops by humane law, that is, the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the ancient Church, which imprudently
and unhappily set up the first bishops, erring
in taking up right the nature of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the qualities of the Antichrist,
who was to be revealed but in the full time.
For they are not of that kinde of Bishops,
which ruled together with the Presbyterie or
Ecclesiasticall Senate, but they are bishops by
the Municipall law of the land onely in the
judgement of the lawes. For all their iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
&amp; power is united and anexed to the crown,
from whence it is derived, as from a source,
unto them, and by law they are bound, to make
their proces and writings, in the kings name,
and not in their own names, and that their seals
should be graved with the Kings armes, as I
have already declared in the first chapter. It
is true, that they make processes in their owne
name, and use their own seals, but herein they
transgresse the formes prescribed by law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Their
manner of holding <hi>in Capite,</hi> in chiefe
of the king, their Episcopall power and juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
is not changed for all that want of
formalitie, as before I have cleared out of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
<hi>Farrars</hi> answer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:7812:40"/>
Sir <hi>Edward Cooke</hi> in the 5. booke of his Reports,
doth prove, That the Function, and Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Bishops and Archbishops in England, is
by and from the Kings of England; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that though the proceedings, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse
of the Ecclesiasticall Courts run in the
Bishops name, yet both their courts and lawes,
whereby they proceed, are the Kings, as M.
Sheerwood in his Reply to Downam doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.
So then all the acts of their Episcopall
jurisdiction are performed by authoritie deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the King. If ye will call that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
civill, then actions of a spirituall nature
are performed by a civill authoritie, which is
absurd. But seeing this is impossible, that civill
authoritie can be elevated to so high a nature,
it must follow, that it is truely spirituall power,
which is united to, and derived from the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessor
of the Crown, I meane, in the estimation
of men and judgement of the Law: howbeit
in it selfe, and by Gods Law, it cannot be done.
It followeth therefore that all the Iurisdiction
properly spirituall, which the English Prelates
doe exercise, as Prelates, is unlawfull, how so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have the warrant of mens Lawes.
It is but onely to save their own credite, that
they have set Downam. Bilson, and other their
friends on worke, to plead, that Bishops are
above Pastors <hi>jure divino,</hi> by divine Institution,
which they are not able to prove.</p>
            <p>Next is to be considered their sole authoritie,
which is censured by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> now
Chancellour of England, after this manner,
There be two circumstances in the administration of
Bishops, wherein I confesse I could never be satisfied.
The one, the sole exercise of their authoritie. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7812:40"/>
the deputation of their authoritie. For the first,
the Bishop giveth orders alone, excommunicateth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
judgeth alone. This seemeth to bee a thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
without exemple in government, and therefore
not unlikely to have crept in, in the degenerate and
corrupt times. We see that the greatest Kings and
Monarches have their councell. There is no temporal
Court in any land of the higher sort, where the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
doth rest in one person. The Kings bench,
common pleas, and the Exchequer, are benches of a
certain number of judges. The Chauncellour of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath the assistance of 12 masters of the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie.
The master of the Words hath 4 Councell of
the court: so hath the Chauncellour of the Dutchy.
In the Exchequer chamber the Lord Treasurer is
ioyned with the Chauncellour and the Barons. The
Masters of Requests are ever more then one. The
justices of Assize are two. The Lord President in
the Marches, and in the North, have Councell of
divers. The Starre Chamber is an Assembly of the
Kings privie Councell, aspersed with Lords spirituall
and temporall. So as, in all the Courts, the principal
person hath ever, either colleagues, or assessours. The
like is to be found in other well governed kingdomes
abroad, where the jurisdiction is yet more distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
as in the Courts of Parliament of France, and
in other places. No man will deny, but the acts, that
passe by the Bishops iurisdiction, are of as great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
as those that posse by the civill Courts. For
mens soules are more pretious then their bodies, and
so are their good names. Bishope have their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and have no exception from that generall male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
against all men living, <hi>Vae soli, nam si ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit,</hi>
&amp;c. Nay, we see, that the first warrant in
spirituall causes is directed to a number, <hi>Dic Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi>
which is not so in temporall matters. And wee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7812:41"/>
see that in generall causes of Church government,
there are as well assemblies of all the Clergie in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,
as of the Estates in Parliament, whence the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
should this sole exercise of jurisdiction come? Surely
I doe suppose, and I doe thinke upon good ground,
that <hi>ab initio non fuit ita,</hi> and that the Deanes and
Chapters were councells, about the Seas and Chaires
of Bishops at the first, and were unto them a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie,
or Consistorie, and medled not onely with the
disposing of their revenues, and endowments, but
much more in jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall. But that
is probable, that the Dean and Chapter stucke close
to the Bishop in matters of profit, and the worlds, and
would not loose their hold. But in matters of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
(which they accounted but trouble and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance)
they suffred the Bishops to encroch, and
usurpe, and so the one continueth, and the other is
lost. And we see, that the Bishop of Rome (<hi>fas est
ab hoste doceri</hi>) and no question in that Church
the first institutions were excellent) performeth all
Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as in Consistorie. And
whereof consisteth this his Consistorie, but of the
parish priests of Rome, which terme themselves Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
<hi>a Cardinibus mundi,</hi> because the Bishop
pretendeth to bee universall over the whole world.
And hereof againe we see divers shadowes yet remain,
in as much as the Deane and Chapter, <hi>pro forma,</hi>
chooseth the Bishop, which is the highest poynt of
iuris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iction. And that the Bishop when hee giveth
orders, if there be any ministers casually present, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
them to ioyne with him in imposition of hands,
and some other particulars. And therefore that see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to me a thing reasonable, and religious, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the first institution, that Bishops in the
greatest causes, and those which require a spirituall
discerning, namely the ordaining, suspending, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving

legitimations, in judging causes criminous, as Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,

sole and unassisted: which point as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
is a reformation that may be planted <hi>sine
strepitu,</hi> without any perturbation at all, and that
is a mater which will give strength to the Bishops,
countenance to the inferiour degrees of Prelates, or
Ministers, and the better issue or proceeding in
those causes, that shall passe. And as I wish thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Where it is sayd here, that Deane and
Chapters were at the first counsellers to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
it is to be understood at the first time of
erecting Deane or Chapter, not at the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up a Bishop; far lesse at the first forme of
Church-government planted by the Apostles.
For Presbyters were before Bishops, and when
Bishops were set up at the first, they were set
up by the Presbyterie, and that in the degree
of perpetuall Moderatorship and President<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
onely: neither was there a particular
choice made of some Presbyters to sit in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with this President, nor another besides
this President Bishop, to be Deane of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie;

with the Bispop, all other Presbyters being excluded.
By which meanes the dignitie of these Cardinals was
greatly encreased.</hi> Again, <hi>Now these Cardinall pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters

               <hi>but in
other Churches also, as Duarenus sheweth.</hi> So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7812:42"/>
of this difference was so farre from
being excellent, that it thrust lawfull pastors
from the government of their owne particular
charges, &amp; the joynt government of the church,
and increased the dignitie of Cardinalls. These
Cardinals were but parish priests and Deacons,
resident in their parishes and titles. So are not
our Chapitermen. But that assistance and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in proces of time went out of use also. So it is
ever dangerous to depart from the right partern
and shape formes of government to our selves.
Alwayes this polititian alledgeth very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
to the shame of our bishops, and their
sole government, that the Bishop of Rome
performeth all Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction as in
Consistorie, We heard how Archbishops were
made up with the spoyles of the Synodes. So
the Bishops were made up with the spoyles of
the Presbyteries. Would you not thinke it very
absurd, to see the Moderator sit by himselfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
all manner of Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction
without the Presbyterie. Of the Deane and
Chapter wee will have occasion to entreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe.</p>
            <p>The third thing to be considered in the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Bishop, is the deputation of his authoritie.
He hath griped greedily, and taken in his own
hands, all the power of the Church, and when
he hath done that, because he is neither able nor
willing to discharge this burthen which he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
on himselfe, hee transferreth his charge
unto other officers under him. He hath taken
from the Pastors the pastorall staffe of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which belongeth to every shepheard, that
is set to keepe Christs sheep, and left them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the pastorall pype, to preach and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7812:43"/>
the sacraments, and hath put that pastoral
staffe in the hands of strangers who are not the
true sheepherds, that is in the hands of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
Archdeacons, officialls, and Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missariet,
vicars generall, and the rest of that Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>able
of officers.</p>
            <p>The 4. is their extensiue power. For wheras
the presbyterie choosed, and set up a Bishop,
and no presbyter was excluded from common
consultation and judgement, and their meeting
behoved to be ordinarie, for exercise of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
jurisdiction in the Church, wher they gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the bounds of the Bishops jurisdiction
could be no larger nor the bounds of the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries
jurisdiction, that is wher all the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
might convene to exerce ordinarie juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
All the presbyters of a shire, or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
could not convene ordinarilie and weeklie
together to exerce ordinarie ecclesiasticall juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Neither is any where in the new Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

when the scripture speaketh of a Province or
Countrey, it speaketh in the plurall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Churches,</hi> not <hi>Church,</hi> in the singular.
Seing then there was no Diocesan Church, ther
was no Diocesan Presbyterie, nor Diocesan
Bishop. No Church is above another. The
Church of Corinth had no superioritie over
the Church of Cenchrea, which was next ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iacent.
And consequently the Presbyterie of
one Church hath not superioritie over another
Church, therefore the Bishop chosen by the
by the Presbyterie of one Church, hath not
power over the Presbyterie of another Church.
Neyther can he possibly exercise ordinarie iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
in divers Churches, and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
except yee will make him a Pluralist,
and have him gallop from one to another, to
keepe the ordinarie meetings, which gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was not kaowen in the Apostles times. But
Bishops have spred their wings over many
cities and townes, whole Countries, and
Shires, that they are not able, suppose they
were willing to execute the power, which they
claime, in their owne persons, but must of
necessity depute others. And whom depute
they, I pray you? Doctours of the civill
lawe, whom they make Chauncelours, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficials,
Commissaries and other officers of the
Canon law. Suppose they should depute
ecclesiasticall persons onely, yet this should
not free them of guiltynes. For it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
duety which the scripture requireth of
the officebearers of the Church.</p>
            <p>At the first Bishops were placed in little
townes, aswell as in great cities, and were not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7812:44"/>
so thin sowne, as since that avarice and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have made them to dispise obscure places,
and to strive who should have the largest Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
Nay even in England the Diocies of old
were not so large as now. The Bishoprick of
York hath devoured many smaller bishopricks
next adjacent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Camden</hi> reporteth in his <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia.</hi>
The Bishoprick of Lincolne hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
devovred many bishopricks, which were in
the time of the Saxons, and howbeit it hath
been greatly impaired, yet there are 1247. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
churches in that Diocie at this day, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
by <hi>Camden.</hi> These generalls being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
I will be the briefer in the particulars.</p>
            <p>Bishops considered simply as Bishops, of
which in England there are 24. whose e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
is to be considered, eit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or in the Church. In the
common-wealth, in that they have the title
of Lords in respect of their Baronie annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Bishoprick. 2. to have precedence
before other Barons in the convention of

               </gap>ee thre Estates, or in other meetings.</p>
            <p>They tell us that <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizeus, 1. King.</hi> 18.
2. <hi>King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 2 were called Lords, and if the prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s
were of old so stiled, why may not they also?
By this reason all prophets and pastors should
be so honoured. But the tuth is, that the name
of Lord was given by the wife to her husband,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 12. and to any man of honest account,
howbeit to mean men, as to <hi>Philip. Ioh.</hi> 12. 21.
to Gardiners, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 15. and was more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
among the orientalls, then <hi>Sir</hi> is with us.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7812:44"/>
               <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elizeus</hi> were not Barons, and for their
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ronies stiled Lords aboue the common sort.
But that stile is with us attributed onely to
Lords of dignitie, to Noblemen, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of State. As for Bishops, you may see,
that they are so stiled in respect that they are
Barons howbeit D. <hi>Downam</hi> doth aledge,<note place="margin">Defens. 1. 3. p. 150.</note> that
they are so stiled in regard of their spirituall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and jurisdiction. The first respect is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
<hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 25. as wee have sayd before.
The second respect is as unlawfull: for there
are no Lords in the Church but one Christ,
who is Lord and King. Their ambitious and
arrogant precedencie in taking place before
great Barons, is another part of their pompe.
Their statelinesse and pompe is set forth also in
their glorious palaces, &amp; sumptuous buildings.
<hi>Their chambers doe shine with guilt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Reply p. 97.</note> 
               <hi>their walles are
hanged with cloth of Auris, their cupboards are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with plate, their tables and diets are furnished
with multitude and diversitie of dishes, their dayly
dinners are feasts: They have 30. 40. 60. or moe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of them of men waiting on them, some before
some behind, whereof three parts of them (set a
part the carying of a dish unto the table) have no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
or profitable calling to accupie themselves in,
two houres in the day, to the filling of the Church
and common wealth also, with all kinde of disorders,</hi>
as Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> an eyewitnesse doth testifie.
Many Churches lye desolate for want of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
provisioes, whose impropriations are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propried
to bishops to maintaine their pompe
and statelines, and bestowed upon keeping great
horses, caroches, and trains of men. I need not
to insist in this poynt, it is so sensible to any
man, who hath but common sence.</p>
            <p>

In the Church by reason of their calling,
or of their function. In their externall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to the Bishopricke, some things respect
the Prince, some things respect other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops.
The Prince before election may 1.
nominate. 2. grant facultie to choose.
After the election finished, 1. yeeldeth his
Royall assent, 2. directeth his mandate to
the Arch-bishop to confirme him and
other two, to consecrate, 3. exacteth the
oath of homage from the new bishop,
4. Restoreth to him the possessions of
the Bishoprick. Such things as respect other
Bishops, respect either the Archbishop, or
him and others: the Archbishop, as him
who is to confirme the election. Him and
two others, as who are to consecrate him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the direction of the book of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>When the bishops Sea is destitute, the Deane
and Chapter make intimation to the King of
their want of a Bishop, and humble supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for licence to choose another. The King by
letters patents under his great seale, granteth
them licence: and with the letters patents sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a missive, commending the person, who is
to be chosen, some man who hath waited long
on the Court, and promised to some courtier
an annuitie out of his Bishopricke during life,
or some other gift. After this election, which is
made after the Papisticall manner by Deane
and Chapter, and a superficiall manner, or <hi>pro
forma,</hi> as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> now Lord Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7812:45"/>
sayd, the Deane and Chapter do intimate
their feigned processe of election to the King:
againe, praying the King to yeeld his Royall
assent to the Lord elected. The King dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
his letter patents for warant to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop,
or some other whom hee shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt,
to confirme and consecrate my Lord
elect. The consecration being finished, and the
bishop having done homage, and sworne feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the Kings writ is directed out of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie
to the Escheator, to restore to him
the temporalities of the Bishopricke. And
the Bishop may procure another writ out of
the Chauncerie, directed to his tenants,
commanding them to take him for their Lord.
This order of proceeding is thus described by
the authour of the Assertion for true Church
<note place="margin">P. 274. 275.</note> policie. Here are many imaginarie formes,
and mockage, rather then sound dealing. The
libertie of election of Pastors, if Diocesan bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
were true Pastors, is taken from the
Church, and the Church deluded with a
May-game.</p>
            <p>Now as for his consecration, howbeit the
Scripture doth not teach us two distinct forms
of ordination, one called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consecration proper to
a Lord Bishop, the other by the generall
name of ordination, peculiar to a minister,
yet wee will let you see the Rites of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
how all are taken out of the Popes
Pontificall, as may be gathered by conferring
the book of Orders with the said Pontificall.
A table is prepared for the Masse-book, and the
pontifical: so is here a table furnished with the
service book, and the book of orders. There two
bishops are present to assist the Consecrator,

coapes and surplices, having pastorall staves in their
hands. They retaine the surplice, seldome the coape,
but they never use their pastorall staves,</hi> sayth the
Author of the petition to the Queen And yet
they have a staffe to beat out a painfull mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
out of the Church, if he take not on a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice.
But in the abridgement of the ministers
of Lincolne, it is sayd, <hi>that in the former edition</hi>
(of the book of ordination) <hi>which seemes by the</hi>
36.<note place="margin">P. 102.</note> 
               <hi>article to be that, wee are required to subscribe
unto, and which; it may be, some of the Bishops doe
still use, there are other corruptions, as that the coape,

                  </gap>le, and pistorall staffe, are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be used in ordination and consecration.</hi> There
the elected is presented by two Bishops, to the
consecrator, who is sitting, and the elder of the
two Bishops sayth, Most reverend father in
God, &amp;c. So here he is presented by two bishops
to the Archbishop, or any other bishop having
commission, to whom one of them sayth <hi>Most
reverend father in God, we present unto you this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and learned man, that he may be consecrate bishop.</hi>
There none is consecrate till the commission be
shewed: here likewise the Archbishop is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to have the Kings mandate anent his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration,
to be produced and read. There the
elected taketh an oath upon his knees to the
Pope, and another of obedience to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop:
so here they must take one oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the supremacie, another of canonicall
obedience to the Archbish. There the Archbi.
demandeth some questions, so also here. There
is sayd, or song, <hi>Veni Creat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7812:46"/>
Archbishop together with the Bishops then
present, laying on their hands, say, Receive the
holy Ghost: so here also, as if the one could
give, and the other receive the holy spirit from
his finger ends. By the book of ordaining Prists
and Deacons, the Archbishop should lay the
Bible upon the bishops neck, that is to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and put a pastorall staffe in his hand, sayth
the authour of the petition to the Queenes Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
but they put the Bible in his hand,<note place="margin">P. 6.</note> and
observe not the former direction, or else fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a later booke of ordinations. After these
things being done, the consecrator and his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants
communicate with the new consecrated
bishop, so here also. The Gospels, the Collects,
the Epistles, the Letanie, which are here used for
the most part, are borrowed from the same Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificall,
and the Letanie interrupted here also
as there. There the consecrator sayth nothing
more ordes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, then is set down in the booke, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
when he prayeth, or demandeth, or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crateth;
so here. There the consecrator putteth
gloves on the hands of the consecrated. Here
the consecrated Bishop dealeth gloves, as I
heare, to his friends: for why, now he is maried,
and the mariage betwixt him and the Church,
which was begun by the election, is consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
they say, by consecration. Should not
then the bridegroome deale gloves among his
friends? That day that our Bishops were first
consecrated at London, their bride at home un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
nothing of the matter.</p>
            <p>In respect of his function, either in things
concerning Episcopall order, or concerning
iurisdiction. Concerning Episcopall order,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7812:47"/>
as 1. to ordaine Deacons and Ministers ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the prescript of the booke of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations,
2. to dedicate Churches and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
places, 3. to confirme children.</p>
            <p>The power of order as they call it, that is a
power and authority which is given to men
sanctified and set apart from others, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
such acts as belong to the service of God,
and the discharge of the pastorall function, it
acknowledged by D. <hi>Field,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Of the chur. 5. c. 27.</note>
as also by the soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
sort of the Romanists themselves, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
&amp; the same in all pastors, and that there
is not a greater power of order in the Bishops
then Presbyters. If the power of order, and
authoritie to intermedle in things pertaining
to Gods service, be equall and the same in all
Presbyters, who hath power to abridge this
their power, and limitate the exercise of it? To
reserve the exercise of it to the Bishop, as if he
alone may give orders, or if other ministers
joyne either casually or by Canon, with him,
that it is not for consecration, but for consent
and approbation onely, or that a whole Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie
cannot ordaine, that is, sanctifie, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
or set apart any person to the ministery,
unlesse there be a Bishop present to utter the
words of consecration, is not onely absurd,
because it imports that God hath bestowed on
them a facultie which they cannot put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
but also dangerous for the Church
of God, as experience of the last age hath
manifested. For then all the Ministers in
France, and other reformed Churches, who
received not imposition of hands by bishops,
should not be lawfull Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:7812:47"/>
Their shift of the case of necessitie, is no shift
at all. For if they have that power by divine
right as they pretend, the other may in no
case usurpe it. Further, seeing nature giveth
not faculties in vaine, wee must not thinke
that Christ gaue a power or facultie to be idle.
The gifts and faculties he gaue, hee gave them,
to be imployed, not onely in time of necessitie,
but at all convenient times and occasions offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Where do they finde in all scripture this
exception of the case of necessitie. Where the
law of God doth not distinguish ought man to
distinguish? The prayer out of the mouth of
a divine bishop, a minister appoynted by the
presbyterie to moderate the action, is it of lesse
efficacie then the prayer out of the mouth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of an human or Satanicall Bishop. As for
imposition of hands, it is a rite onely, which is
common to all, and not essentiall.</p>
            <p>Seeing then to ordaine ministers belongeth
to the power of order, as to preach the word,
and minister the sacraments doth, and that this
power is common to all pastors, the validity or
invaliditie of ordination, ought not to depend
upon a bishop, set up by mans appointment and
invention; and that it was but an invention of
man, is clear, in that this reservation &amp; restraint
came in but by corrupt canons. In the councell
of <hi>Ancyra</hi> a canon was made, to forbid the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters
of the Citie to ordaine presbyters and
Deacons without the bishops permission, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
appeareth, that before that Canon was
made, they had ordained some without the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
either presence or permission: and
yet their ordinations were not made voyd:
and that after the making of the Canon, they

concerning confirmation, <hi>Si prestyteri ex
visuae ordinationis haberent sufficientem potestatem
ordinis ad hoc sacramentum ministrandum, sine cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa
in universum prohiberentur illud conferre,</hi> may
be applied to that which I affirmed of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that God gave not faculties and powers to
be idle. I have as yet onely supposed this their
confirmation to be lawfull. But let us now see
what it is. The bishop, or such as he shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt,
apposeth the children in some questions
of a short catechisme; for hee taketh not the
paines to doe it alwayes by himselfe. Then are
they brought to the bishop, not by the minister,
but by a godfather and a godmother, for they
must have a godfather and godmother at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
as at baptisme. The Curate of the
parish needeth not to come, but may send the
childrens names in writing. In the first prayer
the bishop prayeth for the 7. gifts of the spirit,
which the Papists say, they receiue in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Then the bishop wil not lift up his hands
and blesse them in common, as the Priests in
the old law did, when they blessed a multitude,
or great number, but they must be brought to
him one by one, that he may lay his hand on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
childe severally. For there is some effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
say they, in that signe. For they say, that
imposition of hands is one of the externall
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7812:48"/>
meanes, by the which the holy Ghost is given?
And howbeit that prayer have the chief force, yet
imposition of hands hath some also. In
baptisme we receive forgivenesse of sinnes but
the principall grace we receiue in confirmation,
is say they, strength and defence against all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to sinne, and the assaults of the world.
The Papists and they make the like destinction
betwixt baptisme and confirmation. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
say, the comforter promised by Christ to
his Church, was bestowed in the sacrament of
confirmation. The same prayer for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter
use they. The grace which is begun in
baptisme, they say is per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected in confirmation,
as the Papist sayth: as if, when we were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
we were but halfe Christians. In the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
after the laying on of hands, it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, that
the laying on of the bishops hands, is a signe,
whereby the childe is certified of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and gracious goodnesse toward them, a
child of seven or eight yeares of age. If it bee a
certifying signe, is it not a seale of grace; as the
other sacraments are. All that I have sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may
be seen in <hi>Hooker, Hackwell,</hi> and their service
book. None must receive the communion till
he be thus bishoped, and yet divers bishops do
not use it. Then by order of law, these who are
bishoped, may refuse to take the communion.</p>
            <p>In hallowing of Churches the Papists use
crosses, taper light burning of lamps, oyle, ashes,
and many ridiculous ceremonies; but let it be
so, that their dedication is more simple, then
the Popish, yet it is superstitious. For to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
that is to dote and mortifie to such a use,
as to the congregation to covein in, it is already
done by the founders, who were owners of the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7812:49"/>
ground, and builders of the Churches, and the
use is onely civill to defend the people conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from winde and weather, or other incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
which might impede them in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God. A second dedication, that is, an
hallowing of it, after it is set apart before it can
be employed to divine service, as if divine ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
were prophaned, unlesse it were hallowed,
is meere superstition. Our Churches are not
like the Temple of Ierusalem, which had a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
kinde of holines, and was a type and figure
of Christ, but like the Iewish Synagogues.
There is no more holinesse in our Churches
which containe the congregation, then in the
glebe land, which is dedicate and set a
part to maintaine the minister, but that it
should be kept cleane and comely for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
which is to convene in it. When the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
is there at divine service, which is but
accidental, and may be performed on a hillock,
then God indeed is present in the middest of
them. Out of this hallowing of churches, hath
proceeded superstitious customes and canons of
immunitie of churches. I heare they may not
carry a vessell through one of their cathedrall
Churches, or a bagge under their arms without
reproofe, as if their great Domes were like the
Temple of Ierusalem, <hi>Mark.</hi> 11. 16. The like
may be sayd of Churchyards, or other burying
places: for all burial places are of a like nature,
whether they be neere the Church, or removed
fare from it.</p>
            <p>Their jurisdiction is either delegate of
ordinarie. Iurisdiction delegate sometime
to the Bishop, not as he is Bishop, but as he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7812:49"/>
is a citizen or subject, as 1. if he be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a justice of peace, 2. if he be upon the

to any forraine Prince, 4. if he have
any other civil office of countenance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

            <p>Besides that some of them are Iustices of

In time of Poperie, the Spirituall Lords might
not sit in Parliament, whensoever any statute
was to be made touching felonie, or treason, or
the losse of any member, or shedding of bloud.
If they might haue been spared then at such
times, may they not be as well spared in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of possessions and unheritances. Our Prelats
entred in parliament notwithstanding the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

which condition onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the generall assembly
after great opposition made to the Churches

to consent. To bee Lords in Parliament and
Councell to governe countries, to sit in the
Starre-chamber, to bee Iustices of peace and
Quorum, to goe in Embassage to forraine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and to exerce other civill functions in the
common-wealth, as is here sayd, is to exerce of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
incompatible with their spirituall calling,
to beare rule and dominion among the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to intangle themselves with the affaires of
this life, and to neglect that spirituall calling, to
which they were sanctified and set apart from
the rest of the citizens and subjects of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

obtaineth for her obedient children.</hi> The tearmes
being thus unfolded, we haue to consider in the
use of this censure, these special poynts; First,
the lawes made under the pain of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
<hi>ipso facto.</hi> For in time of Poperie, there
were two sorts of excommunication, one inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the law or Canon, when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the offence and fact inhibited by the
law; was made subject to excommunication,
without the ministerie and proceeding of a
judge, which was called also <hi>excommunicatio la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae
sententiae.</hi> The sentence was not left to the
judge to pronounce, but was esteemed pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the very law it selfe. The other excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
is inflicted by a judge after citation
and cononicall forewarning, wherin the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
condemnatorie is pronounced by the
judge. The former leaveth nothing to the
judge, but the sentence declaratorie, to declare,
that seeing he is gultie of such a crime, hee is
already excommunicated. The Bishop of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato,
howbeit their great friend otherwise,
condemneth this kinde of excommunication,
as absurd,<note place="margin">5. c. 9. nu. 2. 23. 24.</note> and perceiveth in it, <hi>magnum Papatus

For, sayth hee, <hi>Excommunicare etenim est

qui potest, aut debet ligari, sed qui reipsa ligatur.</hi>
How can a man as yet invisible, indemonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
unknowne to him that bindeth, be bound?
This bond cannot bind without a binder, and
the presence or knowledge of him that is
bound. When such a Canon was made, there
was a binder, and a bond, but none present,
or known to bee bound. When the offence is
committed, there is one to be bound; but where
is the binder? And yet in their latest Canons,
made in the first yeare of the Kings entry, they
have made exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication <hi>ipso facto</hi> to be the
sanction of many of their Canons: exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<hi>ipso facto</hi> all such as shall affirme the forme
of their Church service to be corrupt and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious,
the rites or ceremonies established by
law to bee wicked, Antichristian, or superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
the government of their Church by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops,
Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, &amp;c. to
be Antichristian, or repugnant to the word, or
that the forme and maner of making, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrating
their Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, is
not lawfull, &amp;c. So that at this day, the better
sort both of the ministerie and professours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, do stand excommunicate by this
Popish guise.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be considered, is the sole
authoritie of bishops excommunicating by
themselves alone, or their Deputies, Officials,
Chancellours, Archdeacons, the ministers and
professors in whatsoever Church of their large
Diocie. When Christ sayd, <hi>Tell the Church,
Math.</hi> 18. was this the meaning, Tell my Lord

from one to two, at last to many. The

they had not already excommunicated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestuous

            <p>They doe not excommunicate in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation

            <p>The curse Anathema, some doe not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
from the great excommunication, but
onely in some solemnities, because it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with some externall signes and ceremonies
to strike a greater terrour. Others do distinguish
it, and <hi>Mucket</hi> defineth it to be that censure,
whereby a pernicious heretick as Gods publick
enemie, reiected, cursed, execrate, is adjudged
and given over unto eternall judgement and
damnation. This is answerable to that <hi>anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi>
which the Apostle calleth <hi>Maranatha,</hi> or
the Talmudists <hi>schamatha.</hi> But such a censure
cannot be inflicted, unlesse it be revealed to the
church, that the offender hath sinned against
the Holy ghost. Besides the censures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to lay men and ecclesiasticall persons
already me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tioned, there are these two reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7812:54"/>
by Mucket, corporall pennance, and deniall
of buriall in sacred places. Corporall pennance
is inflicted upon the outward man. For to the
publick confession of the offence, there is some
bodily pennance adjoyned and enioyned the
offender. As for example to stand upon a Lords
day bareheaded, and barefooted, cloathed with
a white sheet, having a white wand in his hand
at the porch of the Kirck, and when he entreth
into the Kirck to prostrate himself, to kisse the
ground,<note place="margin">P. 328.</note> and then to come to the midst of the
church &amp; crave forgivenes. This manner is descri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved
by Mack. Lindwood in his Provincial rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koneth
for corporall pennances,<note place="margin">l 5. poenis. cap. euenit.</note> thrusting in a
Monasterie, imprisonment, striping, and the
imprinting of a mark upon the person. Many
moe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere the popish pennances, which turned
into satisfactions. For reme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of corporall pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
the offendour may obteine a redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for some peeee of money, and this is called
commutation of pennance, and so the sheete
pennance is turned into a purse pennance. If
the corporall pennance be ordeined to a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
end, as they say, to afflict the body or
outward man, for humbling of the soule, how
can it be excha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged in a pecuniarie mulct, which
hath no such operation with it, especially with
the greater sort? or did they ever read of the
like but in the dark dayes of poperie? Buriall
they deny to such, as are strangled for felonie,
usurers, and others excommunicated by their
offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ialls, and Chancellours.</p>
            <p>The censures and punishments peculiar to
ecclesiasticall persons, are not all of one nature.
For some arise upon their medling with causes
civill, howbeit abusiuely called ecclesiasticall; as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7812:55"/>
the sequestration of the fruits of a benefice, and
giving them for a time to the custodie of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for to defend some mans right, or to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
the cotumacie of the owner, which seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
if any man violate, he is to incurre the
greater excommunication by the old constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the English Church, sayth <hi>Muck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t.</hi>
But seeing the originall of it is but temporall, it
belongeth nothing to Ecclesiasticall Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
Deprivation is the removing of a benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
man from his benefice. A benefice is a mans
freehold, and therfore seing his livelihood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth
it he ought not to be removed from it at
the pleasure or judgement of one man. There is
no difference betwixt deposition and degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that deposition is verball, inflicted by
the sentence of the judge: degradation is real, as
when the Ecclesiastical person is denuded, or un<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clothed
of the garments &amp; ensigns of his order,
in presence of the civill Magistrate, to whom he
is relinquished to bee punished for heresie, or
some other great capitall crime. Vntill this be
done, they are exemed from the stroke of the
Magistrates sword, after the old papistical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
for to what use else serveth this degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
This censure of deposition, as the rest, is in
the hands of one man alone. D. <hi>Field</hi> affirmeth,

The fourth should not be at the Bishops car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
but it is no great matter what be modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to them, seeing they are for the most part
hirelings or blind guides. As for the fift, it is
agreeable to good ordour, that no Clergie man
passing from one Diocesse to another, should
be admitted to take on any cure without let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of commendation, and a Testimoniall of
their honest life and conversation, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
qualification: but that this should be in the
Bishops power is against reason, and therefore
no wonder if many abuses and inconveniences
arise upon their flight Passe-ports. Visitation
is needfull, and it were better for the Church,
if it were annuall: But that the Bishop, or any
other should be sole Visitor, is hurtfull. A

            <p>In this table we have an enumeration of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
belonging to Ecclesiasticall cognisance,
but it is unsufficient. For there are many moe,
then are here expressed: as Theft, Sacriledge,
Murther, Prophanation of the Sabboth. Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
disturbance of divine service, Polygamie,
Diffamation, &amp;c. as by opening of the 10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
may be drawn out to a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which ought to be censured by the Church.
This partition wall of crimes made in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law, to make some crimes temporall, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
spirituall, hath made the crimes reputed
Ecclesiasticall to bee neglected by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
and many crimes not reputed Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,
on the other side to be neglected by the
Church. As Adulterie, howbeit by Gods law it
be capitall, &amp; so ought to be also by the law of
man, is not made capitall by their lawes, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the Ecclesiasticall Courts, as proper to
them; many sins of witchcraft, and sorcerie
likewise: And on the other side a Theefe should
not passe uncensured by the Church, howbeit
he be overseen by the Magistrate. For the church
ought to deale with every scandalous sinner, to
bring the sinner to repentance, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Magistrate pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or neglect to punish.

for example, <hi>Mucket</hi> doth adde these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<hi>Delay of Baptisme at the point of death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of Episcopall confirmation, not bowing the
knee at the Letanie, and at the name of Iesus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
against the Liturgie, the government of the
Church, &amp;c. Profanation of the Chalice and the
plate: Profanation of the Church-yards with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
or Faires, with weapon shewing, with dancing,
&amp;c.</hi> In the Admonition to the Parliament it is
said, <hi>Now great sins, either not at all punished, as
blasphemie, usurie, drunkennesse, &amp;c. or else slieghtly
passed over, as with pricking in a blanket, or pinning
in a sheet, as Adulterie, Whoredome, &amp;c. Again such
as are no sins, as if a man conforme not himselfe to
Popish orders, and ceremonies; if he come not at the
whistle of him who hath no authoritie to call, wee
meane Chanscellours, Officials, and all that rable,
are grievously punished, not onely by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
Suspension, Deprivation, and other, as
they terme it, spirituall coertion, but also by ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,

howbeit the offences; which are abovementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Table; belong to Ecclesiasticall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie
in respect of the slander, they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the lawfull iudicatorie of the
Church, and transferred to the Bishop to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as he thinketh good. And therefore it is
but <hi>pro froma,</hi> that they are here set downe. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
is one of the number, and yet what Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
is committed, and how that may be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed

The Parishes which perhaps have just matter
of complaint against their dissolute Minister,
of Church wardens, are not warned to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at this Visitation. The Bishop being set on

as in a book of Articles given them are

and Arch-deacon, to assist him. At the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time the Church-wardens come, and
giue up their bills of presentments, the names
and dwelling places of the delinquents. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
are sent for, if they can round over
the matter with the bishop, or his chancellour,
or vicar, there is no more of the matter; but
if not, then is the delinquent enjoyned to take
an oath: suppose there be no evidence of the
crime<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but onely a slanderous report and bruit,
and if he free not himselfe by an oath, he shall

            <p>Such matrimoniall causes as are meere civill,

as it is a civill contract, may be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by civill lawes, seeing upon it dependeth
the right of inheritances providing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
bee done repugnant to these conditions,
which God in his word hath superadded to
that contract, as to determine within degrees
prohibited, or polygamie to bee lawfull. So
farre as it is divine, in that God conjoyneth and
interveneth as third person, and setts downe
conditions both of conjunction and dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in the word, the Church is to see, that
that order and these caveats bee observed,
which are contained in the word. For it may
fall out, that both in binding up of marriage
they may commit incest, and in dissolving with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a just cause may offend also. It is the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
duty to prevent and remove such offences.
But of other lawes civil and municipal, they are
not executors. These lawes which are divine, are
of a mixt nature. These which are civill, belong

Further, beside the Churches part, which is to
take heed to offences and breach of Gods law,
they have taken the Canon law for the rule of
their proceedings, both in spousalls, mariages,
and divorces. And thirdly, have taken in debts
and dowries, goods and chattels, which are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessorie

must be called Ecclesiasticall cognisance. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

a surmised precontract, pretensedly proved by
two suborned witnesses, by vertue of the Canon
law the husband was adiudged no husband, &amp;
the wife no wife. Another example he relateth
of one solemnly maried to a wife, and after by
reason of a precontract, solemnly divorced from
the same wife, and compelled by censures of the
Church to marry her for whom sentence of

by the same consistorie about ten or twelve

            <p>Causes testamentarie, and their appendicles,
are meere civill and temporall, and therefore do
not belong to spirituall Courts. It is by the
grant of Kings, not by Ecclesiasticall right, that
Church consistories have medled with such
causes. Because Bishops were supposed to bee
men of good conscience, and that they would
be carefull to see the later will of the deceased
performed, then others, therefore they were
reserved to Episcopal audience, and cognisance
of Ecclesiasticall Courts. But this respect was
not founded upon Gods word. For we must not
looke so much to conscience, as to a lawfull
calling: or else all civill causes pleaded before
a Iudge should be referred to Church-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their supposed good conscience. And
the truth is, it is but supposed indeed. For a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
or pastor that will medle in matters im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
to his calling, hath but a bad consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Such a man will never make conscience
of it, more then another religious Christian.
And what conscience they made of the matter,
may bee seene, in that they transferred that
which was committed to their trust, to a base
Officiall, who hath as bad a conscience as the
Bishop himselfe, and badder, if badder may be.
And as for skill in deciding such causes, no man
will deny, but the civill judges are more able to
cognosce and determine in them, then Church-men.
By the common law, sayth <hi>Lindwood,</hi>
these causes were not committed unto the
Church, but by the free grant of Princes:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:7812:64"/>

            <p>A procuration is the furnishing of necessarie
expenses for the Archbishop, Bishop, Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
or any other having power to visit in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of their visitations. For howbeit the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
have great temporalities and possessions
Ecclesiasticall, that doth not content them, but
they must be sustained besides in their travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
They say, they must have great riches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have a great burthen, and must not
discharge their charge still in one place, but
through the whole Diocie. And yet when they
have gotten more then may suffice reasonable
men, they will not travell without a new pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and their expenses borne. For no man is
bound, say they, to goe on warfare on his owne
cost. And so with a new trick they got procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
annexed to their visitations, as proper
stipends due to visitors. At the first, the visitor
and his retinue, had their sustentation in victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
for the day which he visited the particular
Church. Afterward the procuration was rated
to some value of money, answerable respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the dignity of an Archbishop, or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon:
for their retinue was prescribed in the
Canons and Constitutions. The Archdeacon
was appointed to have onely to have 4. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

think ye then shal be the retinue of the Bishop
or Archbishop, if this be moderate in the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon.
Farther, whereas they ought not to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7812:66"/>
have procurations, except they visit every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church. They will visit 30. or 40. chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in one day at one place, and yet receive the
diet in money of 30. or 40. churches or dayes.
They make commodity of their visitations o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
also, as ye have heard. Synodals are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
pension due to the Bishop by every
Church in the Diocie for convocating Synods.
And yet their Synods are not worthy the name
of Synods, for the Diocesan Bishop is onely
Lord and Iudge, the rest are to bee judged, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then to partake in common with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
A Mortuarie is the second beast, that the

Mortuaries, as yee see, which are demandable

free from compulsion, and superstition, not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
immediatly to God upon the Altar, as
sometimes they doe, nor exacted under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

right to these oblations, as well as the poorest
Priest. To compell men to offer by the censures
of their Courts, is against the nature of a free
offering. The fees demandable in their Courts,
as due to the Iudge, the Register, the Advocates,
the Proctors, are unreasonable. Large fees are

            <p>Wee have seene what civill causes, and after
what manner they are handled. Criminall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are brought in judgement, either by accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when there is one to accuse, or by denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
as when the Churchwardens make their
presentments into ther courts, twice in the year,
and at the visitations, or by inquisition, when
the judge of office doth inquire into offences.
What are the offences and crimes punishable in
Ecclesiasticall Courts, and what are these which
they chiefly search out and punish, we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in the table of Visitation.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 5. Of Archdeacons, Chancellors, Commissaries
Officials, and Vicars generall.</head>
            <p>NOW followeth the jurisdiction exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by the Bishops Deputies, and
Archdeacons, whereunto I will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the rest of Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> now
Lord Chauncellour his censure.</p>
            <p>For the second poynt, which is the deputation of
their authoritie, I see no perfect and sure ground for
that neither, being somwhat different from the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and rules of government. The Bishop exerciseth
his jurisdiction by his Chauncellor and Commissary,
Officialls, &amp;c. We see in all lawes of the world, offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
of skill and confidence cannot be put over or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7812:68"/>
by Deputie, except it bee specially contained
in the Originall granted, and in that case it is du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull.
There was never any Judge, in any court,
made a Deputie. The Bishop is a Iudge, and of
a high nature; Whence commeth it that he should
depute, considering that all trust and confidence,
(as was sayd) as personall, and inherent, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
and ought not to bee transposed? Surely in
this againe, <hi>Ab initio non fuit ita.</hi> But it is
probable, that Bishops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too much to the glory of the world, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Grandoes in kingdoms, and great Counsellors
to Princes, then did they delegate their proper iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,
as things of too inferiour nature for their
greatnesse, and then after the similitude of kings, and
Count Palatines, they would have their Chauncellors
and Iudges.</p>
            <p>But that example of Kings and Potentates
giveth no good defence. For the reasons why kings
administer by their Judges (altho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gh themselves
are the supreame Iudges) are two. The one, because
the offices of Kings are for the most part inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
and it is a rule in all lawes, that offices
of inheritance are rather matters, that sound is
interest, then in confidence, forasmuch as they
may fall upon women, upon infants, upon luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes,
and Idiots, persons not able to exercise Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature
in person, and therefore such offices by all
lawes, might ever bee administred by delegation,
The second reason is, because of the amplitude of
their iurisdiction, which is as great, as either
their birthright from their Aun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estours, or their

               </gap>kewise of an extraordinarie spirit, was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
not able to suffice, and hold out in person, to
iudge the people, but did by the advice of <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hro</hi>
his father in law, approved from God, substitute
Elders and Iudges, how much more other Kings and
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inces.</p>
            <p>There is a 3 reason likwise not much from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
purpose, and that is, that Kings either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the common-wealth, or of the greatnesse
of their own patrimonies, are usually parties in suits,
and then their Iudges stand indifferent betweene
them and the subiect. But in the case of Bishop,
none of these reasons hold. For first, the office is
E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ective and for life, and not patrimoniall, or he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditarie.
An office worthy of science, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and qualification. And for the second
reason it is true, their jurisdiction is ample and
spacious, and that their time is to bee divided between
their labours, as well in the word and doctrine, as
government, and iurisdiction. But I doe not see, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the Courts to be used uncorruptly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any indirect course held to multiply causes for
gaine of fees, but that the Bishop might very well for
causes of moment supply his iudiciall function in
his owne person. For wee see before our eyes, that
one Chauncellour of England dispatcheth the suits in
equitie of the whole kingdome, which is not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the excellencie of that rare honourable person,
who now holdeth that place, but it was ever so,
though more or lesse burthenous to the suiter, as the
Chauncellour was more or lesse able to give dispatch,
and if heed bee taken to that, which was sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the Bishops labour in the word must take
up a principall part of his time, so I may say againe,
that matter of state have ever taken up most of
the Chauncellours time, having been for the most
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7812:69"/>
part persons, upon whom the Kings of this Realme
have most relied for matters of Counsell. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is no doubt, but the Bishop whose circuit
is lesse ample, and the causes in nature not so multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
where the helpe of references, Certificates, to
and from fit persons, for the better ripening of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in their neere proceedings, and such ordinary helps
incident to jurisdiction, may very well suffice his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
Yet there is another helpe: for the causes that
come before him are those, tithes, legacies, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
and other testamentarie causes, causes
Matrimoniall, accusations against Ministers, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their suspension, deprivation or degrading.
Symonie, incontinencie, heresie, breach of Sabboth,
and other like causes of scandall. The first two of
these differ in mine opinion, from the rest, that is,
tithes and testaments, for those be matters of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
and in their nature temporall, though by favour
and connivencie of the temporall jurisdiction, they
have beene allowed and permitted to the Court Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.
The one, to the end the Clergie might sue
for that, that was their sustentation, before their own
Iudges, and the other, is a kinde of pietie and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
which was thought incident to the performance
of dead mens wills. And surely for these two, the
Bishop in mine opinion may with lesse danger, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
himselfe upon his ordinarie Judges. And I
thinke likewise, it will fall out that those suits are in
the greatest number. But for the rest which require
a spirituall science, and discretion in respect of their
nature, or of the scandall, it were reason in mine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that there were no audience given, but by the
Bishop himselfe, he being assisted, as was touched
before. But it were necessarie also, he were attended
by his Chauncellour, or some other his officers, being
learned in the civill lawes, for his better instructions
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7812:69"/>
in poynts of formalitie, or the courses of the Court,
which if it were done, then were there lesse use of the
officiall Court, whereof there is now so much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.
And causes of the nature aforesayd being
drawn to the audience of the Bishop, would represse
frivolous suits, and have a grave and incorrupt
proceeding to such causes, as shall bee fit for
the Court. There is a third forme also, not of juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
but of forme of proceeding, which may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
reformation, the rather because it is contrary to
the lawes and customes of this land, and state, which
though they doe not rule this proceeding, yet may
they be advised with for better directions, and that
is the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> wherein men are forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves; and that is more, are sworne unto
blankes, and not unto accusations, and charges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.
By the lawes of England, no man is bound to
accuse himselfe. In the highest causes of treason,
torture is used for discoverie, and not for evidence.
In capitall matters, no delinquents answer upon oath
is required, no not permitted. In criminall matters
not capitall, handled in the Starre-chamber, and in
causes of conscience, handled in the Chauncerie, for
the most part, grounded upon trust and secresie, the
oath of the partie is required. But how? where there
is an accusation, and an accuser, which we call bills of
complaint (from which the complaint cannot varie,
and out of compasse of the which the defendant may
not be examined) exhibited into the court, and by
processe certified unto the defendant. But to examine
a man upon oath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> out of the insinuation of fame,
and out of accusations secret or undeclared, though
it have some countenance from the civil law, yet it
is so opposite <hi>ex Diametro,</hi> to the sence of the
common law, as it may well receiue some limitation.</p>
            <p>This wise Polititian maketh this overture,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7812:70"/>
supposing that the Bishops ample and spatious
circuite will not be contracted, and that these
causes, which in their owne nature are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
wlll not be drawne from the ecclesiasticall
Courts. For such a reformation is not, nor may
not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

<hi>Officialis in the Canon law, is especially taken for
him, to whom any Bishop doth generally commit
the charge of his spirituall iurisdiction. And in this
sence one in every Diocie is</hi> Officialis principalis,
<hi>whom the statutes and lawes of this kingdome call

word Officiall in our statutes, and common law, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
him whom the Archdeacon substituteth in
the executing of his iurisdiction, as appeareth by the
statute above mentioned, and many others places.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
Commissarius <hi>is a title of Ecclesiasticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
at least so farre as his commission per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
him in places of the Diocie, so farre distant
from the chiefe citie, as the Chauncellour cannot
call the subiects to the Bishops principall Consistorie,
without their too great molestation. This Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
is of the Canonists termed</hi> Commissarius, <hi>or</hi>
Officialis foraneus, Lindw. de accusat. c. 1. in
glossa, <hi>and is ordained to this speciall end, that hee
suplieth the Bishops jurisdiction and office in the
out places of the Diocie, or else in such parishes as
be peculiars to the Bishop, and exempted from the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
of the Archdeacon. For where either by
prescription, or composition. there bee Archdeacons
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7812:71"/>
that have iurisdiction within their Archdeaconries, as
in most places they have, there this commissarie is
but superfluous, and most commonly doth rather
vexe and disturbe the countrey for his lucre, then of
conscience seeke to redresse the lives of offenders.
And therefore the Bishop taking praestation money
of his Archdeacons yearly,</hi> pro exteriori jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione,
<hi>as it is ordinarily called, doth by superonera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their circuit with a Commissarie, not onely
wrong the Archdeacon, but the poorer sort of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
much more, as common practise daily teacheth,
to their great woe.</hi> The Bishops Chauncellour
and Commissarie, and the Archdeacons official,
are all three termed officialls in the canon law,
the Chauncellour the principall officiall, the
Commissarie, <hi>Officialis foraneus,</hi> the third, the
Archdeacons officiall, or by the generall name
of officiall. In the lawes and statutes of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the first is called Chancellour, the second
Commissarie, the third by the generall name of
Officiall.<note place="margin">Lib. 5. p. 15.</note> 
               <hi>The name of Chauncellour in this sense, is
not so ancient as that of Officiall,</hi> sayth D. Field,
<hi>and that in a generall signification it is used for any
one that is employed for the giving of answer to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
for keeping of records, and notes of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and generally for the performance of some
principall duties pertaining to him, whose Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
he is sayd to be.</hi> The principall officiall, that
is, the Chauncellour, howbeit he be but onely
a Deputie, yet by fiction of the law, when hee
cognosceth any cause, hee is interpreted to bee
but one person with the Bishop, and to make
but one consistorie with him. So that howbeit
the Bishop be not present there, yet it is his
consistorie. Such fictions of law have been made
by, cosening and deceitfull Prelates, to deceive
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7812:72"/>
the world. And therefore say the Canonists,
there lieth no appellation from the principall
Officiall to the Bishop, but to the Archbishop:
yet from the Commissarie, who is <hi>Officialis fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneus,</hi>

over a whole shire, ministers and others
within the bounds of their Archdeaconrie, not
as Ministers, but as Archdeacons. When the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
should have visited his Diocie, and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into needfull reparations of the church, and
what other things were out of order, hee sent
his chiefe Deacons to visit for him. At the first
they were sent onely to visit and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,

               <hi>but not to sententiate in any mans cause,</hi>
sayth D. Field, <hi>or to meddle with the correcting
and reforming of any thing: but afterwards in
processe of time they were authorized to heare and
determine the smaller matters, and to reforme the
lighter and lesser offences. Hence in time it

                  </gap>me, that Archdeacons much used by Bishops,
as most attendant on them in the visitation of their
churches, and reforming small disorders, at length by
prescription claimed the correction of greater things,
at having of long time put themselves into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of such authoritie.</hi> So the Archdeacons
in the end became greater then the Deanes,
let bee common Ministers. The lazie Bishop
sent his Deacon to enquire into the life and
conversation of the Clergie and Ministers,
which was not his office, yet ye see from what a
small beginning he is risen to so great a height.
It is dangerous to depart from the right pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
shewed upon the mount. Againe, to
make a Preacher of the word a Deacon, is to
conioyne these two offices, which the Apostles
did separate.</p>

Archdeacons then almost through all England
by papall prescription have jurisdiction within
their bounds, and power to visite, to inquire
into offences, to receive presentments, &amp; to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

For these Courts being confused Courts wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
matrimoniall, testamentarie and other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of temporal matters are handled not belong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
to ecclesiasticall cognisance, no wonder the
Minister be ignorant in them. But on the other
part, it were a shame if a Civilian should know
better how to deale with an offender, and to
bring him to repentance. Againe what a grosse
absurditie and intolerable abuse is it in the
Church of God, that Chauncelours, Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
&amp; officialls being Civilians should med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the censures of the Church. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
hath vendicate to himself the whole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of excommunication, and then he transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
this his power by a generall commission to
another, which he may not lawfully doe, no
not to a minister, far lesse to a Doctor of the
Civill lawe, whom he appointeth to be his
Chauncelour, or the Archdeacon to him, whom
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7812:73"/>
hee appoynteth to bee his Officiall.</p>
            <p>They have found out a new trick, which will
not serve their turn. The Civilian, the Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour,
or officiall, when he is to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
he hath a minister to assist him, who
pronounceth the sentence. The defender of the
last petition telleth us,<note place="margin">P. 175.</note> that the minister assistant
to the Chauncellour, who is for the most part
of the meanest and simplest of the clergie, is
but a cyphar, he doth nothing but his masters
direction, excommunicateth and absolveth at
his pleasure. The Minister is not judge here, the
sentence is set downe in writ to him in Latine,
which he must rehearse. A memorable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Citie Bishops increasing, it was thought a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
that such a dignitie should bee obscured
with a meane place of residence.<note place="margin">Se Damasus, Decretal.</note> Therefore it
was decreed, that it should not bee lawfull to
ordaine any Bishop, either in villages, little

of a Bishop should waxe vile. Sathan
was advancing this way the great mysterie of

pompe which they were striving for, could
not be maintained. At the first, the countrey
or Rurall Bishop had the same power in his
circuit which the Citie Bishop had in the citie
and suburbs of it. <hi>Hierome</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">Ad Eva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

of an obscure citie hath as much autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
as hee of the most famous citie. The
Presbyters who were ordained by them, their
ordination was not made voyd and reversed,
untill they were throwne downe through the
pride and dispite of citie bishops, to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of priesthood, which is an argument suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
that they were in estimation and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church, bishops of that same
sort and kinde, that the citie bishops were.
Beeing spoyled of the greatest part of their
power, and name also, they there called <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipresbyteri,</hi>
at the last, Countrey or Rurall
Deanes, and were made subject not onely

sayth Bleynianus a Papist. This is
his conjecture, that the Archpresbyters were
thrust downe to a degree lower then Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
lest if they had been immediatly subiect
to Bishops, they might perhaps have claimed
the power of the old countrey Bishops, to
whom in place they succeeded. For justly Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbyters
may claim by their order, that which
Archdeac. cannot do. For howbeit they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to Archdeac. in Popish dignitie, yet they
are greater then Archdeacons in respect of their
order. Countrey Bishops at their first erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being equall to Citie Bishops, were not
their Deputies. In the later, and corrupt ages,
proud Prelates, and loytering Lords, addicting
themselves to the world, seeking ease, or intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
themselves with wordly affaires, as they
commited the Ecclesiasticall jurisdiction to
Chauncellours and Commissaries, so that
which is most proper to them, as they pretend,
as ordination of Priests and Deacons, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of children, and dedication of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
they committed to Suffraganes, that they
might give themselves to ease, and wait upon
Councells, Parliaments, and other civill
Courts: and reserved nothing belonging to
their owne charge, that might trouble their
ease, or draw them from attendance upon Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

            <p>There were two sorts of Acchpresbyters of

the cathedrall or citie Deane, &amp; the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie

was at the first but President, or modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Presbyterie of the citie and suburbs.
For we must not think that the country Bishop
ruled alone without his classicall Presbyterie,
more then the citie Bishop did. In processe of
time the citie Bishop grew to this great stately<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

Some did meet every three weekes, some every

doe meet in some place every weeke, in other

These chapiters were called <hi>capitula ruralia,</hi>
countrey or rural Chapiters, sayth <hi>Lindwood,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were assembled in the countrey
towns. In these Chapiters the Deans did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the decrees of Provinciall and Episcopall
Synods. For the Bishop himselfe did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himselfe so farre, as to be present: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
sent one to make intimation, or to the
Deane to doe it. <hi>Praesertim cum non deceat statum

sayth <hi>Lindwood.</hi> D. <hi>Field</hi> proveth that of old,
they had power to visit their circuit twice every
yeare, and to suspend laymen from the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and clergie men from the execution of
their offices. This was a remainder of the old
power of the Countrey Bishop. Now his office
is onely to intimate decrees of Synods, or the
Bishops will in any matter, without any iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
reserved either to him, or to the
ministers of the Deanrie assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in chapiter, or as wee speake in scripture
language, presbyterie. So that their Deanries
are a footstep of that which have beene, and a
shadow of that whereof we had the substance.
This alteration of government among us, will
in the end turne to the same desolation. There

to their ruine and desolation, the great stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
devouring the little steeples, the great
Quires overthrowing the finall pulpits. It was
done no doubt in a foolish and pretensed imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the temple of Ierusalem, to appoint
such idle serving and singing men to uphold in
the cathedrall Church daily chaunting and
singing, as was the custome in the temple of
Ierusalem. But all the people in the land had
communion of worship in the sayd temple, and
repaired to it thrice in the yeare to that effect
and purpose, beside that the daily worship was
for the use of all those who were upon severall
occasions to repaire unto the sayd temple, and
therefore the whole people of God is called
the church of the Iewes; because they had
communion of worship in one place. But there
is no such place in the Christian churches ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
either for countries, counties, or shires.
Every church even the meanest, hath as great
interest &amp; priviledge to all the points of Gods
worship, as the greatest cities, lett be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall
seats, which are not ever the greatest.
Then againe their curions singing and chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7812:81"/>
serveth not for edification of the soule, but
rather to hinder true devotion, and carie away
the mind from heavenly meditation with a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

that some should bee made cardinall to sit in

Farther, this same chapiter hath

the possessions of the Church, may not passe
without them, but for spiritual jurisdiction they
are content that the vicar generall, and officiall
principall part that betwixt them. To what use

            <head>CHAP. 7. The calling and function of English
Priests and Deacons.</head>
            <p>THE name of Priest to signifie a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of the Gospell, is usuall with
them, even in their latest Canons.
Howbeit it seemeth to bee derived
from the Greek word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> yet seeing it
hath been used to signifie a sacrificing Priest,
such as the Masse-priest was thought to be, and
is still retained in their latest translations of the
Bible, to signifie a sacrificing Priest, their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of the originall of the name, is frivolous,
for either they should translate the Leviticall
Priest sacrirficer, if they would retaine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
signification of the word priest, or else ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine
from, or alter the name of Priest, seing
they may have choyce of names.</p>
            <p>The Ecclesiasticall persons in the Parish
Church are, the minister, and Deacon. In
the minister are to bee considered, his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
calling, and his publicke function.
His externall calling is, either to the order
and degree, or to the benefice, and place of
the ministerie. The externall calling to
the order and degree is seene, either in
things preceeding the ordination, or in
the ordination it selfe. In things going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ordination, as 1. publick intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
made by the Bishop, in the most famous
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7812:83"/>
places of the Diocie of the day of ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
2. Letters testimoniall to the Bishop
ordainer, from men of good credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
as well of the conversation of him
who is to be ordained, as of his birth, that
that he is not a bastard, or bond-man. 3.
the examination of him who is to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
either of his education, whether hee
were brought up in a common Schoole, or
in an Academie, or of his progresse in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
literature, or theologie, in which is to
be considered, either the proficiencie it
selfe to be tried by the Bishop himselfe, or
the Archdeacon, or some other appoynted
for him: or else, the degree which hee hath
taken on in the Schooles. The ordination
it selfe consisteth in prayers for him, who
is to be ordained, 2. in exhortations to him,
and 3. in imposition of hands.</p>
            <p>You may see, that they make the calling to
the ministerie, and the calling to the place, two
divers actions distinguished in time, whereas
none ought to be admitted to the ministry, but
when and where there is a place voyd. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
ordained not ministers to rove abroad
through a whole province, but appointed them
towne by towne, Tit. 1. 5. Act. 14. 23. The
Councell of Chalcedon decreed, that no pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter

as many have done, set up bills at Pauls, or at the
Royall Exchange, and such like publike places, to see
if they can heare of some good masters to entertaine
them into service.</hi> In the late Canons foresayd,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7812:84"/>
the Bishop is ordained to maintaine him in all
things necessarie, who hath not one of these ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
till he preferre him to some Ecclesiasticall
living, which is but one of the rotten Canons
of the Canon law. If this were kept, 3. or 4.
Bishops in this realme would have kept such
houses, as never any did in this land, as is sayd
in the foresayd admonition. Their order in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Priests, is this. First they must be Deacons
before they be made Priests, for so they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the words of the Apostle, 1. <hi>Tim. 3. 13. they
that have ministred in the office of a Deacon wel pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>se
unto themselves a good degree,</hi> that is, say
they, a step to the ministerie. The Apostle sayth
not that they who doe the office of a Deacon
well shall get a good degree or standing, but that
in so doing, they get themselves a good degree,
that is, authoritie and estimation in the church,
and consequently great boldnesse in the faith.
For a man may have gifts sufficient for a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conship
and yet never have gifts sufficient for
the ministerie. But admitting the office of the
Deacon were a step to the ministerie, that hee
who is a Deacon may be a Minister, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not that there is not accesse to the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but by this step of the Deaconship. And

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Canons, that no Bishop should
make any person, of what qualities or gifts so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
a Deacon and a Minister both together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one day. <hi>Not that alwayes every Deacon should
be kept from the Ministerie a whole yeare, when the
Bishop shall finde good cause to the contrary: but
that there being now foure times appointed everie
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7812:84"/>
yeare for the ordination of Deacons and Ministers,
there may be ever some time of triall of their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in the office of a Deacon, before they be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the order of Priesthood.</hi> Yet they are
not so nice,<note place="margin">Pag. 309<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> but this order may be dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with, and that one may take on both the
orders upon one day, as Mucket doth record.
When the time of giving orders draweth neere,
the Bishops Bull is set up upon the Church
doore, to give warning, that if any be minded
to receive orders, let them repair to the Bishop
at such time and place. This is, sayth Mr. <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi>
like the sound of a trumpet to gather an
Armie. But the Bill which is set up upon the
Church doore, is in latine, so that the people
cannot understand the sound of the trumpet.
This Bill doth not desire the people to come, &amp;
object against the persons to be ordained. And
suppose that were the end, it wer but a deluding
of the people: for either they have a Priest or
Curat already, and then they have not need to
object, or else the place is voyd, but they know
not against whom to object, for amongst 40, 50,
or 100. perhaps they know not who is the man,
that is appoynted for them. The Bishop and
the patron out of the whole number wil choose
afterward when and whom they thinke meete.
And howbeit there were not one voyd Church
in all the Diocie, but incumbents in every one
of them, yet the Bishop will give orders. And
againe, if none of them have ever been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
in these vacant parts, how can they stand
up and object against them. The day of giving
orders being published, which is ordinarily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lords dayes, after the Ember weekes,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7812:85"/>
then there is repaire to the citie or village
where the Bishop is to give orders. He that
can purchase the letters commendatory of some
nobleman, or knight, shall come best speed.
Then is he to be tried by the Archdeacon, who
is but a Deacon onely in respect of his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconrie.
Howbeit sometimes the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
be also a Priest, beside that it is a confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of distinct offices, it is not by vertue of his
Priesthood, but of his Deaconship, that he trie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the persons who are to be ordained. They
are tried by some questioning, but as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
pleaseth. Their pastorall gifts of utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
doctrine, and exhortation are not tried ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the Archdeacon, or any particular
church: may these gifts are not needfull in an
English priest; for a bare reader is sufficient to
bee an English minister. The Archdeacon is
sometime in one part of the countrey, and the
bishop in another.<note place="margin">

is come, after an exhortation made, &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
celebrated, the Epistle and Gospel read,
and the hymne, <hi>Veni creator</hi> sung or sayd, the
Archdeacon presents to the Bishop all those
who are to take on the order of Priesthood that
day, with these words, <hi>Reverend father in Christ,
I present to you the persons here present, to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the order of Priesthood.</hi> Then after some
demands and answeres, of the Bishop, and the
other, who is to be admitted, he demandeth of
the people who are present there, where he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
orders, if they know any impediment
which may hinder any of these present to bee
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7812:85"/>
admitted to the order of priesthood, which is a
manifest mockage. For it may be, that none
there present ever heard or saw any of them, or
all of them, before that day. But these words
import that ordinations of old were performed
before the congregation, whereunto he was to
bee appoynted. Thereafter the oath of the
Kings supremacie is taken, then againe after an
exhortation, follow other demands an answers.
After that the people who are present, are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
secretly to commend the businesse to God,
for which cause they are all silent for a little
space. After that the Bishop readeth a prayer,
which being finished, they who are to be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
sitting on their knees at the Bishops feet,
the Bishop and the rest of the Priests who are
present, lay hands severally upon the heads of
every one of them, the Bishop uttering these
words, <hi>Receive the holy Ghost, whose sinnes thou
doest forgive, they are forgiven, and whose sinnes
thou doest retaine, they are retained: and be thou a
faithfull dispenser of the word of God, and of his
holy sacraments. In the name of the Father, and of
the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.</hi> Hee
commandeth the ordained to receive the holy
Ghost, as our Lord and master did when hee
breathed on his Disciples, bestowing in very
deed the gifts of the spirit when hee breathed
upon them. Ordinary pastors cannot con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erre
the gifts of the spirit, whether breathing as
Christ did, or by laying on of hands as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did. They may as well imitate Christs
breathing, as they may usurpe these words.
Whether the ordained receiveth the holy Ghost
or not, let the world judge. <hi>Calvin</hi> sayth of the
Popish Priests, <hi>ex equis fieri asinos, ex fatuis phre
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7812:86"/>

of their Curats after the pronouncing of these
words, either the holier, or more apt to teach,
and yet beside this blasphemie, they will the
ordained to dispense the word of God, who
cannot divide and cut it aright. Where it is sayd,
<hi>whose sinnes yee forgive shall be forgiven, &amp;c.</hi> a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer

from the preaching of the word, as in the

cannot preach, yet all have power to absolve
from sins. So may the blind English Curates.

men, which the Bishop opened so wide, or as somtime
falleth out, they cannot agree of their market, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to passe that he is made a minister, which either
cannot, or will not, not onely not fulfill, but not so
much as lay hand of that Ministerie whereunto hee
was appoynted,</hi> sayth Mr. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> When all
this is done, the companie convened sing the
Creed, and they goe to the communion, which
all they that receive orders take together, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:7812:86"/>
remaine in the same place, where the hands
were layd on them, untill such time as they
have received the communion. The celebration
of the supper went before in the beginning of
the action as is enioyned in the book of orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, but they
communicate not till the end of the action. The
first celebration then was nothing but a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration,
as they call it, of the bread and wine,
without the pertaking of the communicants, &amp;
all the rest of the action must intervene before
they partake: for to what end els is there made
twice mention of the communion. So the first
is like the offering of a sacrifice, the last is liker
to the supper. Is not this great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusion betwixt
the first and second part of that holy action, to
intermingle another action, yea as some say, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
sacrament, confounding two sacraments
together. Their Letanies and Collects, for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vities
sake, I passe by.</p>
            <p>The external calling to the benefice, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
place of the ministerie, is either to a
parsonage or a vicarage. In each of them is
to be considered, 1. nomination, either when
the right of presentation is in another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
nor his, who doth nominate, as somtime
it falleth out: or when the right both to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
&amp; present belongeth to him. 2. The
Bish. triall of his gifts &amp; qualification, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he be capable or not of such a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
3. Admission either to the title it
selfe, as when the Bishop doth institute at
the presentation of another, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Institution, or when the Bishop himselfe
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7812:87"/>
who doth institute hath the right of patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,
which is called Collation: or else ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
is to the possession it selfe by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting,
which is either done by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon
himselfe, or by his deputie.</p>
            <p>After they have thus received their order of
Priesthood, and are ordeined at large <hi>in nubibus,</hi>
they pay for their letters of Orders (for their
admission to their Ministerie must not be free
of fees) and runne abroad through the whole
Diocesse, where they please, preaching any
where, if they have gotten after their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
another licence to preach. For they must
not preach by vertue of their order of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
in the intendment of the Prelates, but
must have the Bishops warrant to that end.
They are put in remembrance at their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Bishops interrogatories, &amp; exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
in the Gospels and Epistles, and at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverie
of the Bible in their hand, of the dutie
of preaching and teaching. But that is onely
for a fashion, for they read of the booke these
Gospels, Epistles, Exhortations, which were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of old, and are reteined still in the booke
rather to be a monument of that which hath
been, then for their right use and end. For in
the Romane Church, when the Masse Priest is
to receive orders, by the Epistles and Gospels,
&amp;c. he is put in remembrance that he must
blesse, governe, preach, baptize, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> doctrine
should be spirituall medicine to the people of
God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Church of God is to be edified
both by preaching and good example. These
are peeces of the ancient order, which was in
the Church, lying still in their corrupt ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficals,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7812:87"/>
to be rehearsed in the forme of a service.
But when they come to the action it self, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the order of Priesthood is actually confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
at the laying on of hands, there are no such
speeches used. So in the English, much is said
of preaching and teaching before they come to
the laying on of hands, but then there is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
word used, <hi>Be thou a faithfull dispenser of
the word of God:</hi> not mening to dispens by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
for they know that many of them cannot
teach, but to dispense it, as it is divided &amp; set in
order to be read, &amp; sung in the service book. Or
else they mock God, his word, and his Church,
after the old Popish manner, not intending the
right dispensing of the word by preaching.
When he is to be set in a certain place, he see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Patrons favour, or maketh some simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
paction with him, as we have alreadie
heard out of <hi>Brightman,</hi> and a little before out
of M. <hi>Cartwright.</hi> The Patron presenteth the
man whom he thinketh fittest for his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and the Bishop doth try his gifts, and
qualification. Heere the liberty of election is
taken from the Congregation, and given to the
Patron and the Bishop. That the Patron should
be some way acknowledged for his liberalitie
toward the Church we doe not gainesay. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>jus utile,</hi> that is, if he be redacted to poore
estate, that he be relieved with the rents of the
Church, and <hi>jus honorisicum,</hi> right to a fear in
the Church, and <hi>jus onerosum,</hi> to have a care
that the rents be not dilapidate, as also to be
gardian and keeper of the rents of the Church
during vacancie, or what other thing else, not
savouring of superstition, or ostentation wee
grant unto them, but the right of presentation
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7812:88"/>
of Clerkes to the pastorall office we cannot
grant. The Church may not resigne this liberty
of election in the hands of another man, but
is ever bound to retaine in her own hands the
freedome to choose the fittest person to have
charge of their soules. This liberty of Election
was acknowledged to be so equitable, &amp; groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the principles of nature, that there
should be more Clerkes then one tryed when a
Church was vacant, where this order might
be had, that in the Councell of Trent, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also chosen by the Synode beside the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
were ordeined to examine and chose the
fittest of those who offered themselves, or were
offered to a tryall, and this is called <hi>examen per
concursum.</hi> But in our neighbour Church
they have no such constitution. The Bishop
himselfe tryeth or appointeth whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth,
none is depute by a Synode to joyne with
him. And where the Bishop himselfe is Patron
of a benefice, he maketh not, nor yet receiveth
any offer of a leite of many that the worthiest
may be chosen, but the Church is under the
same bondage, whether the Bishops or Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
be Patrons. Now what is this examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bishop, surely very superficiall, and
imaginarie. The request of any in authoritie
is able to obtain the Bishops institution, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he be unsufficient. And <hi>indeed there is no

of so many unworthy ministers chosen by al the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
throughout the world, which have been since
the Apostles times: as have swarmed these few yeares
out of the palaces, as out of the Trojan horse, of that
small number of Bishops, which are in England. Of
the other side, if a man will cast his eyes to France,
both in persecution and peace, and from thence looke
into the Churches of some parts of Savoy, and yet
stretch them out further to some certaine common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
in Germanie, and come home to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
the Scots, and compare generally the ministers
chosen of the Churches, with the most part of these,
which the Bishops make: (if he love not himself too
much, and be not a stubborne defender of that hee
hath undertaken) he shall be compelled to confesse, as
much difference betwixt the one and the other, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

The people which are fed, are to the people
which are unfed with preaching, like an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

may by another writ confirme, and really in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct

other possessions. So the Archdeacons pretie
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7812:89"/>
signet should give place to the kings great seal,
sayth the authour of the Assertion. For as the
order doth stand, there falleth out many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and suits in law, sometime betweene
the Patron and the Bishop,<note place="margin">Assertion, p. 258. 259.</note> sometime between
two Clerkes presented by two Patrons: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
between the Clerke presented, and the
Bishop, the Clerke calling the Bishop by a

judges of the court of audience, for not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

instituted, and the Archdeacon not executing
the Bishops inductorie mandate, because the
Church is not vacant, and betwixt him who
pretendeth the title, and the reall incumbent,
whereupon doe fall out many foule riots, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of the kings peace, and unlawfull assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
upon entries. and keeping of possessions.
What a great hinderance the patrones power to
present, is to the planting of churches with a
learned and faithfull ministerie, not onely the
Church of God in former ages, but also our
owne since the reformation in a part, can beare
witnesse. This is the difference betwixt us and
them in this poynt, that they defend this right
of the Patrone, which taketh away libertie of
Election, wee craved a reformation of it, and
were more carefull to try and sift the person
presented, yet this is the inconvenience, that
seldome it fell out that the worthiest were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated,
where patrons had a right to present.
You see then, what wayes a man commeth to
the ministerie, and a benefice. First,<note place="margin">Assertion, p. 259.</note> hee must
receive orders, and pay well for them. <hi>For it can
not be denied, but the Bishops Secretarie, Gentleman
Vsher, groome of his chamber, Butler, Pantler, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7812:90"/>
and other the Bishops menials (besides his own

doe usually (all, or most of them) challenge

            <p>The publicke furction of the minister, is
either in preaching, or in the rest of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration.
In Preaching, either with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence

            <p>We see then that the giving of orders is not
a giving of power to preach, for then every one
who receiveth orders may preach without any

They make curtesie when Iesus is named, either
in Sermon, lesson, or otherwise, uncovering
their heads, and making a leg, with such scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
on the ground, that the Minister or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

cannot be heard for a space thereafter. And
yet saith the Author of the Petition to the Qu.

               <hi>unlesse it be at reading of the Gospell, as if the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
were more holy then the rest of the Scripture:
especially they forget it, when lustily and bravely they
sweare by the name of Iesus.</hi> The name of Iesus
is more reverenced, then the name of Saviour,
which is of the same signification; or other ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Christ, as when he is named Messias,
Christ, Mediator, the Son of God, &amp;c. or when
God is named: as if the Apostle had meant
Philip. 2. that every knee should bow at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Iesus, when as he onely saith, <hi>At the
name of Iesus:</hi> that is, every creature shall bee
made to acknowledge his power, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which is his name, as the word is often
taken in the scripture. It is not the sound of
syllables, but his divine power that is meant.
Then again for answers, the people are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at divers prayers to rehearse word for word
after the minister, whereby an opinion is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in their minds, that other prayers do not
so much pertaine to them, as those which they
utter with their own mouthes. As the minister
is the mouth of God from God to the people:
so should he be the mouth of the people from
the people to God. Sometime the minister saith
one part, and the people another. And in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
parts of the Letanie, the people make the
prayer, and the minister onely directs them
what to pray for. At the communion one of
the people is allowed to make the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
in the name of the whole congregation.
At some prayers they are enjoyned to kneele
devoutly, and not at others.</p>

of Lincolne Ministers. Divine service in
the Apostolicall Church was not spent in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prayers, Psalmes, Epistles, Gospels, &amp;c. but
for the most part in doctrine and exhortation.
When the Congregation assembled, their Pastor
was with them, and he spent not the time in
reading lessons, prayers, collects, &amp;c. but utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
some word of exhortation, and doctrine,
upon the parcell of Scripture which was read;
as was the custome also in the Sinagogues.

dayes of the Apostles, nor in many ages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,

that as long as Pastors were able to teach and
exhort, that they posted over a number of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and lessons, &amp;c. and no farther? No The
bels of Aaron should give a sound, as often as
the Lords Priest entreth into the Sanctuarie. Or
doe they thinke, that their Pastor was abroad at
his pleasures, when the flock was at their pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
as devine service, and some other read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
minister serving them. The Apostolicke
Church, and purer Antiquitie, knew no such
minister. Out of the lessons, or Psalmes,
which were read, the minister took the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ground of his sermon, beginning after
this, or the like manner: <hi>Ye have heard brethren
the booke of, &amp;c. read. The booke is read, wherein
it is prophecied. We heare brethren, when the
Gospell was read, the Lord saying that &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The directories are contained, either in the
Kalender, or the Rubricks. In the Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to direct the minister in such things, as
belong either to the minister himselfe, or to
the whole Parish. To the minister him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
either in reading some Psalmes each
day of every month, or of the rest of the
Bible, partly out of the Canonicall Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
partly out of the Apocrypha bookes,
and that within the yeare.</p>
            <p>The reading of Psalmes, and other parts of
Scripture, is not preaching, but the word read
is like a loafe unbroken, or not divided in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and morsels. And therefore it is not a right
set forme of service to prescribe all the Psalmes
to bee read within the space of a month,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7812:93"/>
or so many lessons of the Scripture within a
year to take up the time, which should be spent
in preaching. Lesse Scripture read, and withall
explained, and opened up to the use of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
is more profitable. And if the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
this, howbeit the matter be good, for it is
the good word of God, so much as is canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
yet the forme is naught, and in this case
unlawfull. Then as for the reading of
the Psalmes, they make daily prayers of
them, when as they bee not all prayers, or
else the matter of these which are pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

not agree to the present time and state of the
Church, but are read hand over head. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrypha
bookes should not receive that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
as to be read publickly in the Church, as
canonicall Scripture is. Because they containe
sundry false and frivolous things; and suppose
not, yet they are not the trompets which are
set apart and sanctified by God, to bee blowne
by his priests in his temple. The church
of the Iewes read no other scripture but Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
<hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, and the Psalmes:
and the Christian Church in the purer times,
onley the monuments of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.
The Councell of Laodicea decreed the
same also. The reading of them in the Church
hath made the people beleeve, that they are

doth confesse that it is recent, that it was
not observed at Rome in the dayes of Pope
Alexander the third. It was celebrated in some
particular Provinces, but not received into
Rome, till the time of Pope Iohn the 22. It
was thought needlesse, seeing the Trinitie was
remembred, either one way or other in the
daily service, but especially upon the Lords
day: for the Preface of the Trinitie day was of
old sung upon the Lords day; and the Creed
wherein the Trinitie is remembred, was not
omitted. If there should be a holy day for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great mysterie of our religion, then must we
have many more holy daies, then we have yet
had. If a particular day for the Trinitie entred
but of late in the Church, for the respects fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
then what mysterie of Religion is remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
frequently on the Lords day, in hymne,
prayer, confession, creed, or sermon needeth not
a speciall day, and a set service with bodily rest
for that mysterie. You see then, that the feast
which was rejected a long time by the Popes
themselves, the English doe retaine. As for the
feastgoelonging to the life &amp; death of Christ the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enoumed, &amp; most ancient, is Easter, and
yet it was not observed by the Apostles. The
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:7812:94"/>
hote contentions about it, whether it should be
observed upon the day of the full Moone, or
the Sabboth after, declareth that they did not
institute it: for they could have easily decided
that question, whether shall we be conforme to
the Iewes in observing the same day with them
or not: yea, the Apostle, 1. Cor. 5. 8. speaking
of the celebration of our Easter, tyeth us not to
a certaine number of dayes, as the Iewes were,
who after the eating of the Lambe; might not
have any levened bread in their house for seven
daies, but sayth, ours is all the yeare long to be
observed, ye through our whole life, &amp; with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kind of unleavned bread, both by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Churches, &amp; persons. No where doth he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
us to anniversary Easter. The Christian Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecost
was not observed by the Apostles, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
sometime some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went up to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem
at the Iewish Pentecost, to confirme or

If the Apostles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, upon whom the gifts
of the H. Spirit were powred that day, did not
observ it themselves, who were the receivers of
the benefit, what warrant haue we to observe it.
If neither Easter nor Pentecost were Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
institutions far lesse the Ascension day, and
the Nativitie. The feast of Circumcision <hi>Bellar.</hi>
saith is very recent, &amp; it is to be observed that
they have a service day, or holy time for Christs
circumcis. but not for his Baptism for upon the

to Christs severall acts are all humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions,
some later, some more ancient, &amp; Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
formes, wherwith that people was brought
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7812:95"/>
up under the pedagogie of the law, a rudimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
kind of instruction, not beseeming the
Christian Church, nor answerable to the cleare
light of the Gospell. The Iewes anniversarie
dayes were abolished not onely for their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
service, or signification of things to come,
but altogether, howbeit memorials of by-past
benefits. Christ and his Apostles did institure
no day for remembrance of a particular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
no not the weekly sabboth, let be an anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary
day. For the weekly Lords day was
not appointed for remembrance of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
benefit of Christs resurrection, but for the
whole worship of God. If the Lords day were
referred directly and expressely to the comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
of the resurrection, then should it be
the proper and peculiar service of the Sabboth,
then should we not have at all a day determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
in the new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>estament, and institute to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
God for himselfe, and all his workes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.
There was then no memoriall dayes
appoynted in the new testament, but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
day for the worship of God. The sacrament
as often as it is celebrate, it is a memoriall of
his passion. When the word is preached, Christ
is crucified before our eyes. But dayes of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
commemorations of some speciall actions
with solemnitie and cessation from worke, we
have none, nor was it the intention of Christ, or
his Apostles. If there be no warrant to dedicate
anniversarie dayes to Christ, farre lesse to the
virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the rest of the Saints, and of
Angels. Their holy dayes of Saints are called
the Saints dayes as well as Christs dayes are
called his. And they have their collects, gospels,
epistles, as well as Christ hath his: and what
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7812:95"/>
reason have they to have some anniversarie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
of so many Saints of the new tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,
and never one for any of the old? Can

Rationalls. What holynesse they place in
their holy dayes may be seene in that they
haue a stricter rest enjoyned upon them, not
they urge for the sabbath, whereas the Lord
required a stricter rest upon the Sabbath,
then upon other dayes appointed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
Then againe their principall feasts
haue Eaves and devout fastes going before.
Thirdly they say they will not change them, to
let us see that they may be changed; but retaine
the same dayes which the papists observe, and
which, they say, were consecrate and made
more holie then other dayies, be the actions,
which were wrought on these dayes, as the man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger
and crosse of tree was with the truth of
Christs body. Even howbeit this reteyning
without change, doeth nourish in the people
both a superstitious and popish conceit of the
holynes of the day and the erroneous conceits,
that Christ was borne on such a day, Iohn Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptist

etc. To let passe other popish opinions of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

fridaies, Ember weeks, and lent fast. And if
they say that abstinence from flesh onely is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
for some politicall respects, I would
demand wherefore is the minister or Curate
enjoyned after sermon, homilie, or exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to declare unto the people, whether there
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7812:96"/>
be any holy dayes, or fasting daies the week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Are not the people commanbed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to repaire to the Church to pray,
and to heare divine service. Their lent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth
as the popish doeth upon Ashwednes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
with a terrible co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mination, where are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
many bitter curses and the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
&amp; ratifie every one of them with their own
mouth saying, Amen. The priest before he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the curses, after the lettanie is sayd, goeth to
the pulpit, to imitate the levites who pronunced
curses upon mount Ebal, and never but once, &amp;
he saith, <hi>Brethren, in the primitive Church there was
a godly discipline, that at the beginning of lent, such
persons as were notorious sinners, were put to open pen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance,
and punished in this world, that their soules
might be saved in the day of the Lord: and that others
admonished by their exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple might be the more afraid
to offend. In stead wherof untill the same discipline,
may be restored again, which thing is much to be wish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed
etc. it is thought good that at this time should be
read the generall sentences of Gods cursings against
impenitent sinners.</hi> Yee see that corporall and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictiue
penance is commended for good discipl.
for the disci. of the prim. church, for the discipl.
of lent, and espetially on ashweonesday, &amp; that
it is wished to be restored again. I beleeve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
It is displing, ashes, shriving, and such other gear
that they would haue. In the last collect upon
the first day of lent, or ashwednesday, the priest,
or Curate sayth, <hi>Be favourable to thy people, which
turne unto the in weeping, fasting, and prayer.</hi> Is
this to fast for ciuil respects onely, for the main
tenance of sea faring men, and preservation of
cattell. The Priests and Clerks kneeling say
the Psalme, <hi>miserere mei Deus.</hi> The prayers,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:7812:97"/>
and special exhortations tend to begin their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
that day. The week before Easter hath
a prescript service, epistles, and gospells for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day, which no other week in the yeare hath,

but good Friday, the Friday before Easter. May
we not see then, that the end of their Lent fast
is the same with the Popish, to wit, that they
may be prepared to receive the communion at
Easter, as if that communion needed a greater
preparation then at other times, or had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
vertue: <hi>Item,</hi> to be prepared against the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration

fast, a fast of another kind, for it was

used againe either by himselfe or his Apostles,

say, for praying, and fasting, because the Bishop
is to give orders upon the Sundayes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
following, as it is sayd in their latest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
They tie the giving of orders to set sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of the yeare, when as ministers should be
thrust out into the Lords harvest, whensoever
there is need. Then againe such are enioyned
to fast, as have no need of a pastor, for all the
parishes of the Diocie are not destitute. Where
there is no feele of a want, the prayers will bee
cold. It is expedient indeed that the particular
congregation which hath need, humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Thirdly, this their fast is but abstinence
from flesh, but not from fish, or any other
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7812:97"/>
delicacies which they can get, as if flesh were
an uncleane creature, and polluted. So their fast
in all the orders and rites of it, is the Popish
fast. Lastly, they joyne not fasting and giving of
orders together, as they should doe, if they
followed aright that example which is set
downe, Act. 13. 1. 2. but they observe their ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonious
fast, or rather superstitious absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from flesh on the week before, and not
upon the Lords day following, when they give
orders. For upon the Lords day they thinke it
unlawfull to fast. And yet they will rather se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their ceremoniall fast from the action, then
that it should not be performed upon the Lords
day: for why? that was the day on which the
fierie tongues came downe upon the Apostles:
and they observe the third houre of the day
commonly, that is about nine a clocke, because
it was about that time that the gifts of the holy
Ghost were powred on them. For the Bishop
must say to the Priest, <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost.</hi>
And so one superstition is at jarre with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and great confusion there is, and disorder
in their rites and ceremonies, and no wonder,
for they are Babylonish. Yet for all their apish
imitations, the cloven tongues come never
downe upon any of their silly Curates. The
Friday fast is like the rest, and dependeth upon
their mother good Friday, which hath bred
them. These are their set and superstitious fasts.
Extraordinary and occasionall fasts for urgent
calamities, and the miseries either of their owne
Church, or other Churches abroad, they have
none, or very rare.</p>

They pray to be delivered from thundering, &amp;

The third part of their prayers concern
the commodities or incommodities of this life.
They crave to be delivered from all adversitie,
as if the petition in the Lords prayer, deliver us
from that evill one, or wicked one, to witt, the
Divill should be translated, from all evill. In S.

The forme of their prayers is set downe as a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the minister to read. So that the gift &amp;
exercise of the spirit is stinted, &amp; circumscribed
with their prescript prayers. For howbeit hee

discretion of one man which tendeth to the
edification of many. The accustomed place is

that after morning prayer, for saying another num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

honor after the Hebrew phrase is largely taken.
To give honor as to the weaker vessell, and to
worship her with the body is farr different, as
the word worship foundeth in our Language.
The Apostle 1 Cor. 12. 23. saith, <hi>And those mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

The Priest is appointed to say to God
in his prayer, that the ring is a token &amp; pledg of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:7812:101"/>
covenant made betwixt them. If the ring had
beene used onely at the contract, as a civill rite,
it might have been comported with, but to
bring it into the Church, I meane to divine
service, is either to prophane the same with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
ceremonies, or pollute it with Popish and
superstitious rites rather, as these are. For they
were counted in time of poperie holy and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
rites of a holy Sacrament. The married
persons must communicate also, as was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
in time of blindnesse, where every holy
action behoved to have a Masse: and so that
action, which should be common to the whole
Congregation, who are members of one body,
is made private and particular to a few, howbeit
in a publique place. Then againe they have
their forbidden times to marie in; yea, moe
then the Papists have, at least, so many as have
embraced the decrees of the Councel of Trent,
from Advent to the Epiphanie, from Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesima
sunday to the octaves of Easter, from
the Rogation weeke to the octaves of Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost,
amounting in all to the third part of the
yeare: as if marriage which is called honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
did prophane these holy times. The coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of Trent hath dispensed with the Pentecost
and the second they beginne at Ashwednesday.
Now notwithstanding of these forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> times,
they may get a dispensation for some money,
and then it shall be lawfull enough, and these
holy times shall receive no pollution; for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

the dayes of their purification were ended,
were appointed to bring their offering to the
dore of the Tabernacle, Levit. 12. 6. unto the
Priest, who shall make attonement for them.
Then the Priest readeth over her the 121. Psal.
and assureth her, that the Sun shall not burn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

this a very pertinent Psalme for the purpose?
The Lords prayer being sayd, and some versi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
and answeres, and then another prayer, she
doth offer her accustomed offrings: and if there
be a communion she receiveth the communion.
Call this churching a thankes-giving, yet what

when as yet he hath not spoken a

him to liberalitie. Then shall the sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

            <p>The Rubricks serving to direct to the
maner of administration of the Sacraments,
are for the administration of Baptisme, or
the holy Supper, &amp; that either in the church,
or in a private house.</p>
            <p>In the administration of the Sacraments
there are two things generally to be observed:
First, that power is given to an ignorant Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
or reading Minister, who cannot preach,
to administer the Sacraments of Baptisme and
the Lords Supper: Next, it is said in their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme,
that there be onely two Sacraments,
as generally necessarie to salvation, that is to
say, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper: imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there are other Sacraments peculiar,
not generall, as matrimonie, and orders: and
others generall, but not necessarie to salvation,
as Confirmation. In the Preface before Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
are set downe these words: <hi>And that no

                  </gap> that it is certain by Gods word, that
children being baptised, have all things necessarie
for their salvation, and be undoubtedly saved.</hi> These
words imply three things, first, that all children
baptised be undoubtedly saved; secondly, that
children unbaptised be not undoubtedly saved;
thirdly, that confirmation is not absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie
to salvation. Estius a papist, saith the
like of Confirmation. <hi>That the custome of the

               <hi>otherwise the

to see this Sacrament ministred at the point of

            </p>
            <p>1 Of Baptisme.</p>
            <p>In the preface to baptisme they commend
the ancient custome of baptizing onely at
Whitsuntide and Easter, except in the case of
necessity, which was a superstitious and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
custome. They say in this Preface, they
will follow this custome, as neere as they can,
therefore doe ordeine, that Baptisme be mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
onely upon Sundaies, and holy daies. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any ordinarie preaching day then, they must
not baptise, except it be coincident with an holy
day: as if baptisme were not as holy a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ministred upon an other day, as upon an
holy day. The child must be baptised at the font
and therefore the Priest must come to that part
of the Kirck, where the font is, over against the
church dore, for that wanteth not a significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
to signifie the entry of the child into the
church. He must not be baptised, where the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
stood in time of divine service, or with
water out of a bason. The godfathers and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothers
standing at the font, the Priest doth
aske, if the child be baptised or no. In the first
prayer the priest saith, that God by the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of his Son, <hi>did sanctifie the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and all other waters to the mysticall washing away of
some;</hi> as though vertue vvere in the water to
wash away sinne, or as though Christs bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
at one time, and not Christs institution,
which serveth for all times, did sanctifie
the element. In the second prayer he saith,
<hi>that they comming to thy holy baptisme may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

remission of their sinnes by spirituall
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7812:105"/>
regeneration,</hi> when as the rem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion of our sins
doth standin notimputation of them, and not in
regeneration. The questions which were wont
to be demanded of converts from paganisme,
who were able to answer to the questions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded:
absurdly &amp; foolishly now they demand
of the infants, or their godfathers in their name.
The interrogatories are these, <hi>doest thou forsoke
the Divill and all his works</hi> &amp;c. Doest thou <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Wilt thou be baptised in this faith?</hi> The
child hath not understanding, nor faith, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of baptisme. And how be it the child had
faith, can the Godfather tell absolutely, and in
particular, that this child whom he presenteth,
doth beleeve, desire baptisme, or forsake the
Devill. It is a foolish thing therefore, and great
mockerie of Gods service to demand that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
which was at the first demanded of such,
as were come to yeares of discretion, and were
converted from gentilisme. The children of
faithful parents are within the covenant of
grace, whereupon it is that they are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the seale of the covenant. The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
being made with the parents in their faith,
&amp; not the faith of the child, the parents should
give confession of their owne faith, and not of
the faith of the child, which is not, because
their owne faith is the condition of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
upon their part, wherupon God promiseth
to be their God, and the God of their seed,
Wherupon also it followeth, that the father of
the child should present the child, and give
confession and not another, because the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is made with him, and his seed, and the
child is his seed, not the seed of another, whom

baptisme, but that the father should, or can
resigne this duetie to another, I deny. Before
the Priest dip the child in the water he sayth
in his prayer, <hi>grant that all thy servants, which
should be baptised in this water, may receive the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of grace.</hi> This prayer was read in 2 E. once
every moneth at the changing of the water in
the font, as is sayd in the Survey. Howbeit it
be now placed in the baptisme it self, it seemeth
to be directed to the same end, to the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the water, which is then in the font. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that the child is dipped, and baptised in the
name of the Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost.
the Priest maketh a crosse upon the childs
forehead, saying, <hi>We receive this child into the
congregation of Christs flocke, and doe signe him
with the signe of the crosse, in token that hereafter
he shall not be ashamed to confesse the faith of Christ
cru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

against sinne, the world, and the devill, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Christs faithfull souldier, and servant unto his
lives end.</hi> He sayth not we have received, but we
doe receive, as if the child were not received by
baptisme, but by crossing, or as if the child were
againe received by crossing which was before
received by baptisme. This signing with the
crosse is no decent gesture: It is rather like a
Iugglers gesture, then a gesture of decencie,
and comelinesse. It must then be used, as a sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall,
and significant rite. But we have no
such signe set downe in the word, as to make
two crosse lines in the aire with our fingers, to
represent the crosse of tree, or to signifie unto
us that we should not be ashamed to confesse
the crosse of Christ, &amp;c. <hi>Thou shalt make unto
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:7812:106"/>
thy selfe no image,</hi> that is, any representation
forged in thy owne braines to be set up in the
worship of God. Admit once the aereall cross
in baptisme, yee cannot refuse to set up the
the materiall crosse, and the Rood in the Kirck,
nor the woodden or stone crosses in the high
wayes. For all may signifie the same thing, that
the crosse on the forchea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. And by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
every one may weare a Giver crosse upon
his forehead also. Further not onely other sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant
crosses materiall may be brought in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ground, but also all the rest of the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
ceremonies of baptisme, to deface &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the puritie, plainnes, and siniplicitie of
Christs institution. As to put salt in the mouth
of the child, to annoynt with oile the breast &amp;
shoulders, and the top of the head with holy
chrisme and to put a burning taper in his hand,
&amp;c. for these toyes had their owne glorious sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications
as well as the Crosse. Lastly what
doth in signify, but that which is already signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in baptisme. The same valour and courage
&amp; constant prosession &amp; fightiug under Christs
banner, is a part of that grace, which is sealed
by baptisme. But beside that it is a significant
toye,<note place="margin">Can. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that by it, the infant is dedicated to the service
of him that dyed on the crosse. Who did san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
this signe for such an use? Are men able to
doe it? It was made also a consecrator of water,
bread, and wine, and all other holy things in

a mean to secure from confusion everlasting,
then is it in some sort effective of grace. In a
word, suppose there were no sinfull use of it for
the present, the horrible abuse of it in times by-past,
and the danger and perill of these same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
are sufficient to remove it out of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sacrament, where it is set up in such honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
state beside the Lords owne altar. After
the signing with the crosse, the Priest sayth,
<hi>Seeing now dearly beloved brethren, that these chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
bee regenerated, and grafted into the body of
Christs congregation,</hi> and not before the crossing.
Privat baptisme is administred in privat hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
sometime by a privat person, sometime by a
publick. Howbeit it be not enjoyned by law, not
prescribed by their service booke, that lay men
or women shall baptise in time of necessitie, yet
it is permitted and allowed in their practise, and
hath been defended by <hi>Whitgift</hi> and <hi>Hooker</hi> in
print. When it is administred, they call upon
God, and say the Lords prayer, if the time will
suffer. Then if the time wil not suffer they omit
prayer. So that not onely they omit preaching,
&amp; the doctrine of the sacrament, but also pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
if there bee haste. If the child live, it is
brought to the Church, and the maner of the
privat administration is tried. The minister de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth,
by whom was the child baptised: and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:7812:107"/>
               <hi>because some things essentiall to this sacrament may
happen to be omitted through feare or hast in such
time of extremitie,</hi> he demandeth of those who
bring the child, with what water and words
was the child baptised, and whether they think
the child to be lawfully and perfectly baptised.
If a lawfull minister did baptise the child, these
demands were needlesse. We may perceive also
to what indignitie and prophanation the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is exposed, in that it must bee ministred
with such haste, and feare, that the ministration
of a sacrament being intended, yet it may prove
to be no true sacrament, because it is marred
with haste and feare. The Lord doth not allow
his sacraments to be so prophaned, but to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred
with gravitie, with due time and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
without feare, that may make the minister
miscarry in the action. If after triall he finde all
right, he receiveth the child as one of the fleck
with certain words which he pronounceth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Gospel is read, the minister together
with the godfathers, and godmothers, say the
Lords prayer. Then he asketh of them, the
questions whereof we made mention before in
publike baptisme. If these, who bring the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
<hi>doe make uncertaine answers to the Priests de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
as that it cannot appeare that the childe was
baptized with water in the name of the Father, and
of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost,</hi> the Priest bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth
the child. Then howbeit that it appeare
not, that a lawfull minister did baptize, that shal
not move the priest to baptize the child: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may see, that baptisme by lay men, and
women is not made null by their service book,
but standeth for good and sufficient. When af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
uncertain answers the priest baptizeth, he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:7812:107"/>
useth this forme of words: <hi>If thou be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
baptised, I baptise thee in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.</hi> But
what if the child be already baptised, is it not
now re-baptised in publique. Again, in private
baptisme the Congregation is neglected. The
Church hath interest in the baptisme of the
child, as well as the Minister, for the child is
received into the Congregation to be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
thereof. And therefore the confession of
the parents should be given publiquely, before
that the childe receive the seale of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
Wee see then, what are the fruits of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
baptisme; baptisme by private persons,
lay-men and women, unworthy handling of
such a Mysterie for feare and hast, baptisme by
supposition, and rebaptization, &amp;c. Adde, that
it doth foster an opinion of the necessitie of
baptisme, or rather is grounded upon it. It is
said in the Preface before Confirmation, <hi>It is
certaine by Gods word, that children being baptized
have all things necessarie for their salvation, and be
undoubtedly saved.</hi> Yee see, they affirme that all
baptised children be undoubtedly saved, and
againe, doe imply in these words, that for all
such as are not baptised, we have no sure war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
hat any of them shall be safe. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Canterburie in the Conference at

baptised, there is evident assurance, that it is saved,
wheras the state of an infant dying unbaptised is
uncertaine.</hi> Is not this sound Divinitie? The
Surveyer of the booke of common-prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth,
that by occasion of private baptisme,
many children be baptised by Masse-priests af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Popish manner, and many bastards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:7812:108"/>
Many pretend infirmitie, when they

in publique is often omitted.</p>

            <p>The Sacrament of the Supper, as also of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
may be ministred amongst them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Sermon made, or doctrine upon the
Sacrament which is to be ministred; yea, it is
ministred by such as cannot teach. In their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

to have their children baptised by a minister that is
no preacher, and to receive the holy Communion of
his hands in the same respect, as though the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of these Sacraments did depend upon his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to teech.</hi> And therefore it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that canon, that they shall first be suspended,
persisting in their wilfulnesse, and then after
a monthes obstinacie excommunicated. A
Minister it is true is no part of the essence of
the Sacrament, as a Sacrament is defined to
consist of outward signes, and invisible graces,
yet is a Minister necessarie to the right and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ministration of the Sacrament, and is of
the essence of it, that is, he is of the essence of
the Sacrament, as it is defined to be an holy,
and sacred action, for he is appointed by
Christ to be the minister of the action. Now
we acknowledge none to be a lawfull Minister,
but him who is able to teach. Christ joyned
preaching and baptizing in his commission,
Matth, 28. To whom he committed the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:7812:108"/>
of the charter, and the word of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
to those also he committed the
dispensation of the Seales, and to those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Tryall and particular examination of the
communicants they have none, to try their
knowledge in the mysteries of religion, and
growth in Christianity. It is enough that they
were once bishoped, when they were little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
as in time of poperie. The communion
table is not onely covered at the time of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
with a faire linnen cloath, but also in
the 82 canon it is ordeined, <hi>that the same tables
shall from time to time be kept and repaired in fuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> maner &amp; covered in time of divine
service, with a carpet of silk, or other decent stuffe
thought meet by the Ordinarie of the place:</hi> as if the
communion table were to be regarded more the
other common tables after the action is ended,
wheras the very elements themselves <hi>extra usu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
out of the use of the Sacrament, are but comon.
This is done in imitation of the popish rich al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
cloths. The table being covered with a fair
linnen cloth, &amp; placed in the Church or chancel
where morning &amp; evening prayer are appointed
to be said, the Priest must stand at the northside
of the table, he must not stand at the head, or the
southside. He beginneth with the Lords prayer
&amp; a collect, then he rehearseth distinctly all the
to comand. &amp; the people kneeling, after every
command. ask forgivenes. The people of Israel
kneeled not when God himself pronounced the
Law from mount Sinai, howbeit they saw the
mountain smoking, and lightnings, &amp;c. Gods
word uttered by man then should not bee
received with kneeling. VVheras the last praier
is sufficient to conclude with: the repetition of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:7812:109"/>
it at every commandement is superfluous bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie.
Then the Priest saith the collect of the
day, and another for the King, standing up. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the collects, he readeth the Epistle and the
Gospell. The epistle and the gospell being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
he saith the Creed, after the Creed, if
there be not a Sermon, he readeth some Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
alreadie set forth, or that shall hereafter be
set forth. After Sermon or homilie, the people
is fore-warned of the Holy-daies, or fasting
daies of the next weeke following, and are ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
exhorted to remember the poore. Then
the Church-wardens, or some other by them
appointed gather the devotion of the people,
for so is the almes called, and upon the offering
dayes appointed, every man and woman pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the Curate the due, and accustomed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings:
then the Priest prayeth that God would
accept of their almes, &amp; for some other things.
Then he readeth a short exhortation: then a
generall confession is made in the name of all
those that are minded to receive the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
And this is allowed to be made, either by
one of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m who are to communicate, or one
of the Ministers, or the Priest himselfe: So a
Lay man is allowed to pray in the Church in
name of the rest. This confession is made knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.
Then he standeth up againe, and turneth
him to the people, and prayeth some few words
again. So they have prayer following immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after prayer, without any new actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
standing at the one, kneel. at the other
so comely is their disorder. The after some ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
and answers, and proper prefaces for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-daies,
the Priest kneeleth down againe,
sayth a prayer in name of all them who are to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:7812:109"/>
receive the communion. As soone as that is
ended, without any other action intervening
he standeth up againe and sayth another pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
In this prayer he rehearseth the words of
the institution to God, as the preist doth when
he consecrateth the bread and wine in the
Masse. For he doth not first end this prayer, and
then turne him to the people to informe them
of the institution, by rehearsall of the words,
but uttereth them in a continuall tenour with
this prayer speaking to God. O horrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of the Scripture, and superstitious
consecration! Then without any farther he
and they communicate kneeling, after the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
manner, that is, with a gesture of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
when they are beholding the signes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
eating, drinking, and inwardly in their
minds, should be meditating on the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the fruit and benefite which they reap
by Christ crucified, and consequently cannot
without distraction of mind from this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the soule and meditation, pray a set,
and continued prayer to God, or cannot me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
and be employed in the present action
without distraction of minde from the prayer,
and therefore either they pray unreverently,
which they will not grant, or doe communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
this gesture of adoration to the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
of the soule, and of the outward
senses, and members of the body, about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
presented, which they must grant, and so
nill they will they, must be forced to confesse,
that they commit idolatrie. Kneeling is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
gesture for a table: for commoditie, they
say, maketh decencie, but this gesture is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
not to be commodious, as sitting is. It is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7812:110"/>
then enjoyned for another reason, to wit, fot
reverence: but to kneele for reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
respects is ever adoration in the highest
degree. To kneele for reverence, that is to adore,
is not enjoyned here for prayet, neither may
prayer lawfully be enjoyned in time of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
action and part of Gods worship to bee
performed by the same person. And suppose it
were enjoyned for the short prayer uttered by
their priest, yet are not the outward senses, and
inward faculties, employed principally on that
prayer; but upon another action, principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and directly intended in the Institution,
whereas the other is onely superadded by man.
Let them frame their canons and acts as they
please, and suppresse, that they kneele for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of the Sacrament, common sense may
teach us, that it is done for that respect, either
totally or principally. But let it be in the least
part, yet that least part is idolatry. Beside the
idolatry of this gesture, it cannot stand with the
right manner of celebration and rites of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
For when they kneele for adoration,
they cannot carie the cup from hand to hand,
nor divide the elements amongst themselves, as
Christ hath commanded. In many places the
people are raised from their kneeling, to come
about the table there to receive kneeling, and
then are directed to their places again, saith the
Authour of the Survey.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 72.</note> The Priest giveth the
bread and the wine to every one severally out
of his own hands. When the cup is to be caried
from one to another, the communicant is too
prophane to reach it, the priests holy hand must
take it from one, and give it to the other. But
Christ willed his Disciples to divide it among
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:7812:110"/>
themselves, &amp; it was carried from hand to hand
indeed, after the manner of the last paschal cup,
which was changed in this communion cup.
When Christ therfore gave the bread and the
wine, he sayd in the plural number, <hi>Take yee, eat
yee, &amp;c.</hi> The English priest speaketh in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
number, when he giveth the elements, he
annexeth not Christs words containing a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
promise, and uttered in an enunciative
form, but other words invented by man, and in
form of a prayer, converting one part of Gods
worship in another, or else confounding them.
Then the Prisayth the L. prayer, &amp; the people
repeat every petition after him. Is not the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
the mouth of the people in prayer to God?
And now they wil with their own mouths pray
again. When the minister prayed, did they not in
hart pray with him? if they did, wherfore repeat
they every petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And when they repeat, doth
the minister pray againe the same words in his
hart, which before he uttered with his tongue?
Or is the toung in this exercise both of minister
&amp; people divided from the heart, exercing their
functions severally, &amp; at distinct times? this is the
second <hi>pater noster.</hi> So I must speak, seeing they
use the L. prayer as the Popish priest doth his
<hi>pater.</hi> After the L. prayer they have another
prayer.<note place="margin">P. 81.</note> At westminster the communion is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred

And if gravitie were respected in them,
they should be worn ordinarily, and out of the
true ministration. For he must not cast off his
gravitie, when he hath ended divine service. It
is then for mysterie or signification, that they
weare them. The white colour of the Surplice
signifieth angelicall puritie, for the Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
in white. So are they painted with wings
to signifie their readinesse to do their office. But
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:7812:111"/>
significant garments belong to the priests of the
Leviticall tibe, and not to the ministers of the
new testament. It is beside a lying signe of that
purenesse which is not nor cannot be in sinfull
men. In the angels it might have represented as
well their glory as their purenesse from sin. The
Surplice was esteemed so holy in time of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parie,
that no priest might say service, nor doe
so much as make holy water, without it. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, the Surplice is <hi>well known to
be esteemed by many people in all the parts of the
land so holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>And this was it which brought that custome into

            <p>In the Deacon is likewise to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his externall calling and function. His
externall calling is either to the order and
degree, and that in every respect, as in the
minister, except in some things: or to the
benefice, altogether as in the minister. His
function is, 1. to have an over-sight of the
poore, 2. to assist the minister in celebration
of the supper, 3 to blesse them who are to be
maried, 4. to burie the dead, 5. to baptise,
and preach, if he be called thereunto.</p>
            <p>In the book of ordering Priests and Deacons,
the Deacons office is sayd to consist chiefly in
assisting the Priest in divine service, specially in
celebration of the Supper, and distribution of
the sacrament, in reading Scripture and Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
in instructing children in the articles of the
faith, in baptising of infants, in the preaching of
the word, if the Bishop thinke him fit, and in
inquiring into the state of the poore, and the
sick, and intimating the same to the minister.
After imposition of hands, the Bishop delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
him in his hand the new testament, saying,
<hi>Take thou authoritie to read the Gospell in the
Church of God, and to preach the same, if thou bee
thereto ordinarily commanded.</hi> Hee needeth not a
new calling to the ministerie, and therby be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled,
but remaining still a Deacon, he may by
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:7812:112"/>
the Bishops warrrant and licence be authorised
to preach. The Apostles instituted Deacons to
an other end then to preach, and severed them
from preaching, because one person could not
conveniently be a minister of the word, and a
minister of Tables, yet they will confound
them. For so they found them confounded in
time of popery, and it pleaseth them to retaine
them so, and not to distinguish the functions,
as the Apostles did. Why are they permitted to
baptize more then to celebrate the supper? Is
the one sacrament of greater excellencie then
the other. May the one bee ministred by any
Church officer, who may not minister the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
When the Apostle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. descriveth the
office of a Deacon, requireth he either abilitie
to teach, or power to baptize? What in effect
may their Deacon not do, that the priest doth,
except the ministration of the communion?
What can be the reason of this exception, but
that in this ministration there was somewhat
esteemed in time of poperie, proper to a priest,
to wit, the offering of a sacrifice. The Deacon
then is not halfe a minister, but almost a whole,
and he may preach with licence, or at command
of his ordinarie, as well as the Priest. What need
I to insist upon such grosse absurdities?</p>
