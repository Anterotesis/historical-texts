            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The dayes of <hi>Returne</hi> heere, are the vsuall <hi>Returnes,</hi> as in the ordinary <hi>Almanack,</hi> Or else a <hi>Sub poena</hi> may bee returnable at a certaine day, after any the sayd vsuall <hi>Returnes,</hi> or the great Feast dayes, from whence the <hi>Returnes</hi> take their denomination, So that you must adde (<hi>Prox.</hi>) in place where cause shall require.</p>

               <p>Howsoeuer I take it, there is not much alteration had in them; it may bee there is some Addition: But for the <hi>Roller</hi> side (as vnto the making of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> and granting of <hi>Iniunctions</hi>) which was heretofore exercised alike there, as in Court, or on the Lord <hi>Keepers</hi> side (which I conceiue grew by the connexing of the Lord <hi>Keepers</hi> Office, and Master of the <hi>Roles</hi> in the same person) I cannot say how the case stands at this present, hauing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne my selfe now these seauen yeares past, from any practice in the Lawes in any kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And because the Confirmation of Ordinances and by-Lawes, made for the better gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Societies Incorporate, do for the most part passe through the hands of the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> or Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> for the time being, according to the Statute of the nineteenth of K. <hi>Henry 7.</hi> Therefore, and for that it is onely the path of a very few trauelliug in the Lawes; I thinke good to write according to mine owne Practice therein (as followeth.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF a Corporation bee newly erected, and is to haue also Ordinances <hi>de nouo,</hi> made for the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:29345:36"/>
better gouernment of their Company, or Body: They must first make a perfect draught of them by aduice of Counsaile in a Paper-booke.</p>
               <p>Your Counsaile would be both learned in the Lawes of the Land, the Prerogatiue of the King, the Subiects right; and the Priuiledges, Powers and Customes of the great body of the City, or Towne corporate, wherein you are sub incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated as Brethren of a Trade, Mystery, or Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation.</p>
               <p>For any Ordinances made eyther against the Lawes of the Land, or the Prerogatiue, are not onely voyd in themselues, but farther punishable in those who execute them, notwithstanding any confirmation whatsoeuer. And therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in all Patents and Charters of Incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is a speciall clause of <hi>prouiso</hi> in this point and to this purpose.</p>
               <p>And I doe heerein indigite at two manner of Ordinances, vnder which the Commonalties of corporation do much grone and complaine their pressures.</p>
               <p>The one is a presumption and intrusion vppon the Birth-right of a Free-borne Subiect (<hi>viz</hi>) the Imprisonment of their bodies, for breach of an Ordinance of their company (a thing most vnlawfull, and vnreasonable, and yet too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practized by too many of them.) For colour whereof, I haue seene a Warrant <hi>Dormant</hi> lying in the Halls of some companies;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:29345:36"/>
vnder which they subscribe the names of whom they list to commit; and then deliuer him to an Officer, who attends them at their Court for the purpose; and so it is not pretended to bee their owne act, but the will and commandement of a greater Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Or an Intrusion vpon the Subiects Birth-right, by denying him to seeke Law and Iustice before the King the Fountaine of Iustice, in his Court at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or to set vp and vse his Trade, after hee hath arriued at his Freedome by honest seruice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Lawes of the Land, and the ancient custome of the place.</p>
               <p>Or to take a House for his best convenience, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage and accommodation of his Trade:</p>
               <p>Or the like.</p>
               <p>The other Agreeuance which I poynt at, is a Consumption and effusion of the purse and estate of the Subiect, by grieuous Fines, Amercya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Impositions, and by laying of Offices vpon them, which draw great expence, in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting and profusenesse; of which I shall take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion in a more fitting place, to speake and write at more liberty.</p>
               <p>I proceed with my Direction in the passing of any such Ordinances.</p>
               <p>The Paper booke beeing perfected by such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Counsaile, you are to draw your Petition in the names of the Maister and Wardens, in name,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29345:37"/>
and in the behalfe of the whole Company, to bee directed and deliuered with the sayd Booke to the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> or Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> desiring; Where as ith ath pleased his Maiesty so to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate you, and to giue you power to make Orders and Constitutions for your better gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which Orders are by the Statue of the nineteenth of King <hi>Henry</hi> 7. to bee perused, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and allowed, by the Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> Lord <hi>Treasurer,</hi> and the two Lord Chiefe Iustices of either Benche, or three of them at least, which prouision you are ready to obserue and performe on your parts.</p>
               <p>It may therefore please his Lordship to giue order to the two Lords chiefe Iustices, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use, examine, and make the same fit and worthy the confirmation and allowance of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and themselues, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Heerevppon, his Lordship giue order vnder your Petition: That the two Lords chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices do accordingly peruse, examine and make them fit, as is desired.</p>
               <p>They the sayd Lord cheife Iustices doe by vertue of that Order and Warrant peruse the same; and after they haue so altered, added, or sustracted, as they shall thinke fit.</p>
               <p>Then their Lordships giue order to one of their owne Clerks, to write them ouer fayre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into a Paper booke coppy-wise. VVhich when they haue exactly examined with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29345:37"/>
so by them reformed, They subscribe the same, and send them seal ed vp backe againe to the Lord <hi>Keeper:</hi> who vpon the opening there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and sight of the approbation of the Lords chiefe Iustices, doth likewise giue order in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, at the Foote of the sayd Booke subscribed with his hand, That the same be forthwith faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ingrossed in Parchment (and in the <hi>Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hand) by such an one as it shall please the two Lords chiefe Iustices to appoynt therevnto. And that they giue him testimony of the due perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, by the confirmation of the same vnder their seuerall hands and Seales, and soe the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> seales the Booke vp againe, and returnes it to the Lords chiefe Iustices, who giue direction for the engrossement, according to the order aforesayd.</p>
               <p>And when the same is so engrossed, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with the Paper booke, they set their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall hands and Seales thereunto, and deliuer it to your selues, to carry to my Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> Vppon sight whereof, he vseth also to Seale and subscribe the same.</p>
               <p>But I pitty the case very much, that there is no Inrolement, Record, or Register of any such Ordinances kept in any place, the rather for soe many thousands of people are gouerned by them, beeing Law to which they can haue noe recourse, nor can consquenyly take the true measure, by which they should fashion their
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29345:38"/>
manners, to sit smoothly to the body of their Ordinance.</p>
               <p>It is not the reading of them once in a yeare in parcels and cursorily, can take impression in the most learned of them (if there be any such) much lesse in the generall sort.</p>
               <p>I hope that succeeding times will looke into this euill, euen in the greatest bodies incorporate, and giue it a fitting redresse.</p>
               <p>And so much shall suffice for such Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>

               <head>The way how to sue forth a Writ of <hi>Supplicauit,</hi> whereby the party sued shall not be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed till the partie grieued please.</head>
               <p>FIrst you must take your corporall Oath before a Master of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> that you doe not desire it for any Malice, Hatred, or Enuey to the party: but for your owne quietnesse, and safety; VVhereupon you shall haue a warrant to leade your sayd <hi>Supplicauit,</hi> and thereuppon consequently the writ it selfe, so soone as the same may bee written and sealed.</p>
               <p>After you haue the same granted, you may sue out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> a VVrit of <hi>Certiorare,</hi> which you should vse in this manner, (<hi>viz</hi>) VVhen you haue deliuered your <hi>Supplicauit</hi> to haue a Warrant thereuppon for the arresting of the person sued, and haue got him likewise arrested, you must keepe your <hi>Certiorare</hi> very secret and vnknowne vnto him, till he haue put in Bond or Recognizance thereupon, with Sureties (as the case requires.)</p>
               <p>For if hee take notice of it, Then he will lye in Prison vntill hee haue procured a <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:29345:40"/>
vnto your <hi>Supplicauit;</hi> which if he doe, your <hi>Certiorare</hi> is of no force or vse. Wherefore it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes you to haue care herein:</p>
               <p>And when the partie is Arrested, and hath put in Sureties, to the Sheriffe or Iustice, who granted the Warrant vpon the Writ; And the party hath giuen Bond with Sureties; Then doe you deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your said <hi>Certiorare</hi> vnto them that tooke the Bond, And thereuppon they are tyed to certifie the same vp accordingly.</p>
               <p>So consequently shall he stand bounden in such manner, vntill you please of your owne accord to release him.</p>
               <p>This hath beene a practice very frequent hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, And yet it appeareth by an especiall order made of purpose to obuiate this course, which Order I haue before recited in these collections, There was both care and prouision taken, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse and reformation, in this perticular case.</p>

vntill hee bee arrested for the most part; whether it bee out of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> or the <hi>Kings Bench:</hi> wherefore to auoide that euill of beeing bound, Hee may sue foorth and haue his <hi>Supersedeas</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in readinesse about him, if hee suspect any such practice bee intended against him (as afore said.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Supersedeas</hi> must be sued forth thus, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You shall rather in the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> then on the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> side, enter into Bond with Sureties <hi>gratis,</hi> with condition that you shall keepe the Kings peace, or bee of the good behauiour, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring such time as for which you shall so binde your selfe, and as the occasion shall require: For if you suspect that your Aduersarie will haue the Writ onely to binde you to the Peace, then a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas</hi> will serue onely for the Peace; if for the good behauiour, then your <hi>Supersedeas</hi> must bee for the good behauiour; if both, for both.</p>
               <p>When you haue so bound your selfe with Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; or Sureties in your absence haue so vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (as your <hi>Manucaptors</hi>) for you before a Master of the <hi>Chancery;</hi> You may haue Warrant, And v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Warrant, your Writ of <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> so soone as the same may be written and sealed.</p>

               <p>I doe aduise you to sue forth your <hi>Supersedeas,</hi> rather out of the <hi>Chancery</hi> then the <hi>Kings bench,</hi> for these reasons, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The condition of your Bond in <hi>Chancery</hi> doeth not tye you to make any appearance at the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of your time limited for Peace or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, But in the <hi>Kings bench</hi> it doth:</p>
               <p>And if you doe not appeare there accordingly, your Bond is duely estreated; &amp; now more strictly prosecuted then euer heretofore:</p>
               <p>Besides, if you doe appeare according to the condition of your Bond, there is then a great charge which falls vppon you of course, for the withdrawing of your Bond, which dyes in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie;</hi> or at least, it requires no retraction there:</p>
               <p>Besides, the <hi>Supersedeas</hi> is in some case more potent, beeing taken out of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> then out of the <hi>Kings Bench:</hi> For notwithstanding the Writ to binde, bee taken out of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie,</hi> and beare <hi>Test</hi> before, yet the <hi>Supersedeas</hi> out of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> is sufficient against it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer: But I make question whether the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedeas</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> will ouer-rule the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicauit</hi> of the <hi>Chancerie</hi> bearing date before it, or no?

            <p>If the Sheriffe do returne the Defendant suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: then soone after the sayd Returne, when the Originall is filed, the Plaintiffes Attourney must go to the Office of the <hi>Philozer</hi> of the said County, and there search and bee satisfied whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Attourney hath appeared for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant or no?</p>

            <p>In like manner are you to proceed in an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of debt vppon an Indenture, or debt due by Testament, or Letters of Administration, you must vppon the declaration and demaund made, shew the Indenture, the Testament, or Letters of Administration as the case is, that they may be conferred together.</p>

Which if the Plaiutiffe do not accordingly, Then the Defendants Attourney may discontinue the Action of the Plaintiffe, and make him to begin anew.</p>

            <p>If the Tenant or Defendant doe not appeare vpon the <hi>Grand Cape,</hi> then a <hi>Petit Cape</hi> is to goe forth, and a day likewise to bee farther giuen, and vppon default of appearance, then the Lands in question are recouered, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon the <hi>Cape</hi> is directed to the Sheriffe to seize the Lands into the Kings hands, vntill farther Proces, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Therefore the Demandants Attourney in this case must especially inuigilate the Office of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soynes,</hi> and in <hi>Reall</hi> actions to get his VVrit fylled, and to enter a <hi>Recipitur,</hi> as in a VVrit of <hi>Dower.</hi>

               <p>Then hee must sue out his pardon of Course, and vppon that, Hee may haue a <hi>Scire facias</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Sheriffe of the County where the Originall was laid, to giue warning to the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife to bee ready in Court to prosecute his action against the Defendant, if hee haue any thing to charge him withall.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, if the plaintiffe doe not declare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him the Defendant within a certaine space giuen to him by the Court, Then the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant shall bee quit of that action; and the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe is to beginne his suite againe if hee will.</p>

to the Sheriffe; VVhereuppon the Sheriffe is to deliuer to him his goods or Cattell againe without Bond.</p>

               <p>Also in an Action of waste you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede in like sort, if you certefie the Iudges how the Defendant hath made the place waste, and you doe it before Iudgment is by them giuen.</p>
               <p>But the Iury needeth not to haue such great care of the dammages in waste committed, as in other cases of enquirie in that kind: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the Iurie giues in dammages therein, the Court will, according to the Statute in that case especially prouided, double the same dammages.</p>

               <p>IN a <hi>Recouery</hi> in a Writ of <hi>Entry</hi> in the <hi>Post,</hi> the Attourney who sueth it forth, must take good aduice in the drawing of his VVrit of <hi>Entry,</hi> he is to carry it to the <hi>Chancery</hi> man to make it.</p>
               <p>And the Attourney must take with him, either his Clyent, or some other person who knoweth the Land, and get him sworne before one of the Masters of the <hi>Chancery</hi> for the true value of the Land, and what it is worth by the yeare.</p>
               <p>Thenmust the value be set down on the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the VVrit, and the name of the Master of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> who tooke the Oath thereunto.</p>
               <p>Next, this Attourney must carry it to the Kings Attourneys Clerke, who is appoynted for the same purpose to get his Masters hand vnto it.</p>
               <p>But before you haue your VVrit againe from hence, your Clyent, or some other for him, must enter into a Recognizance to the King in such manner, as Master Attourney Generall his Clerke shall draw vp and make for you, And the said Clerke is to carry your Clyant, or other partie, who is so to enter into Recognizance to the Court of <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> to acknowledge the same before the Iudges there.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:29345:68"/>The effect and condition of the said Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance is, that those Lands specified in the VVrit, are not holden io <hi>Capite,</hi> and that the Recouery is not hurtfull to his Maiesty, nor his successors.</p>
               <p>And if the Lands bee holden in <hi>Capite,</hi> you must take course before you sue out your VVrit of <hi>Entry</hi> for, license in that behalfe; otherwise you shall runne into a great inconuenience, and be forced afterwards to sue out your Pardon in this behalfe.</p>
               <p>After your writ of <hi>Entry</hi> is passed through the Kings Attournies hand, then if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Land will appeare in proper person, Your VVrit of <hi>Enrty</hi> with the Returne thereof, must be taken out into one of the <hi>Prothonotaries</hi> Remembrances, where you will haue your Recouery entred.</p>
               <p>And then in the Margent of the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance make the appearance of him who is vouched.</p>
               <p>And this being done, deliuer your writ to one Sergeant, and the Remembrance to another, when the Court is at good and fitting leasure.</p>
               <p>Note withall, that if this bee done with a <hi>single Vowcher,</hi> you are to retaine three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants; and if it bee to bee done with a <hi>Double Vowcher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> you are to retayne fiue Sergeants.</p>

Office that shall enter it, and he will therevpon enter your Recouerie, and make you an Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification, &amp; a Writ of <hi>Seisin</hi> in the same terme.</p>
               <p>But if the Tenants do not appeare in proper person at the Barre but by Attourney, then you shall not get your VVrit of Recouery to be fully finished the first Terme; but you must haue a <hi>Summ.</hi> entred against the Tenants, and a Writ of <hi>Seisin</hi> awarded.</p>
               <p>And it behooueth the attourney for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant to bee circumspect, both for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the VVrit of <hi>Entry</hi> and <hi>Seisin,</hi> and for the filling of them, as also for the Warrants of attourney on both sides, For otherwise by default or omission in any of them, the Recouery may bee ouerthrowne againe.</p>
               <p>And for farther and more assurance in this kinde, it hath beene therefore vsed, that they haue exemplified both the writ of <hi>Entry</hi> and <hi>Seisin,</hi> with the Returnes thereof; and the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of attourney, for feare least afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them should be mis-filed or mis-carryed.</p>

               <p>And if the Defendant deposeth that hee doth not owe or deteine from him the Plaintiffe the same, nor any part or parcell thereof, and the Plaintiffe will stand to his action, then is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant quit thereof for euer, and the Plaintiffe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his action.</p>
               <p>But if the Plaintiffe will not abide his Oath, intending to charge him otherwise afterwards: The Plaintiffe may bee <hi>Non suit,</hi> pay the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant his Costs, and bee at libertie to begin a new againe at another time, and to lay his action so (in some cases) that no VVager of Law shall lye therein.</p>

            <head>THE KINGS BENCH.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Kings Bench</hi> consistes of the <hi>Prothonotary</hi> side, and the Crowne Office side, &amp;c. On the <hi>Prothonotaries</hi> side are (as I deliuered in my <hi>Search</hi> of Record:)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Onely Personall Actions, and some mixt Actions? besides such matters as the King is partie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR their proceeding in personall and mixt Actions, It is generally the like as that of the <hi>Common-pleas,</hi> and therefore shall not require a second recitall. So are their Fees
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:29345:90"/>
generally alike: For he that is a sufficient <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pleas</hi> man, is able to the practice of any other Court of Common Law whatsoeuer.</p>
            <p>And therefore I shall onely shew you in what poynts of proceeding they doe differ, and how easily those differences are, or may bee reconciled withall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings Bench</hi> vseth onely a <hi>Latitat</hi> for their leading processe.</p>
            <p>To this, the first Leading <hi>Capias</hi> of the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> does answere.</p>
            <p>For as the <hi>Capias</hi> hath an Originall Writ to goe before it? So the <hi>Latitat</hi> supposeth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth a Bill of <hi>Middlesex</hi> to lead it also, For that is granted in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> because it is intended that the Defendant vpon returne of a Bill of <hi>Middlesex</hi> precedent doth <hi>Latitare in ualliua tua, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Onely the <hi>Latitat</hi> is like to Doctor <hi>Giffords</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which serues for all diseases, and so it holds one forme in all cases and Actions whatsoeuer, and charges the defendant onely <hi>De pl. Trans,</hi> bee it for debt or other cause, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the Originall must containe the true cause of action, and be so exactly set downe and drawn, that all the following Processe and proceeding, may be tyed to agree with it <hi>punctuatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Kings Bench</hi> man payes fiue to the King, in debt and the like actions aboue—40. l.</p>
            <p>So doth the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> man too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:29345:90"/>But the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> man, he payes but halle so much as the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> man doth; and the <hi>Common pleas</hi> man is the better pay-maister too: For hee payes at the first entrance into suite, and vppon the Originall, whereas the other payeth not till hee declareth, which in many cases neuer is done at all.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the Plaintiffe hath longer time to declare then is allowed in the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas.</hi> And where the defendant appeareth vppon ordinary Bayle, whosoeuer will, may come in and declare against him, which is not vsed in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pleas</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> you shall not neede to put in special baile, vnlesse it be for debt vpon Speciality</p>
            <p>So is it likewise in the <hi>Common-pleas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> enioynes speciall Bayle for 10. l. And the other not vnder 20. l.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the Attourney for the defendant may mend or alter his Plea, after it is deliuered ouer.</p>
            <p>So may the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> man too.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Common-pleas</hi> man must doe it within the same Terme: whereas the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> man hath a longer time, For that hee is not tyed to enter by parcell, and so soone as the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas</hi> man is; but to doe it altogether, and at much more leisure.</p>
            <p>For the charge of remouing the body of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prisoner, by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> in the one, or by
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:29345:91"/>
               <hi>Ostensum est</hi> in the other, though there bee some difference in the first rise, and here and there after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the proceeding of the Remooue, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Bayle, and filing of it, yet if wee conferre their Bills of Costs together: in the conclusion we shall finde a very little difference in the whole.</p>
            <p>Both pay dammage cleere, that is, poundage vpon euery twenty shillings in a Iudgment: But the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> payes onely twelue pence in the pound, and the other payeth two shillings.</p>
            <p>There bee some other few differences in the formalitie, but none in the substance of their my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries. And thus I leaue the <hi>Prothonotary</hi> side.</p>
            <p>For the Crowne Office side: It pleased some to make an especiall suite to exclude my pen from meddling in their mysterie in my former Worke. And therefore (as I then sayd) so I must now resolue, that I doe aduisedly pretermit it, and giue it backe to their owne care, who are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to performe this generall good at their pleasure, when it shall please them to intend the publique. And now I bend my iourney home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to my natiue Birth-bed: London.</p>

            <p>THey doe all deale in Actions personall for the most part, vnlesse on the Lord Mayors side sometimes a Reall Action falls in by chance, for matter or demand of something lying within the Citie.</p>
            <p>Their proceeding generally is <hi>ad exemplum</hi> of the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> onely differing in such cases, as where their Customes carry their predomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Defendant, if he bee a Free-man, hath foure defaults, (that is) foure the next Court dayes of the place where the action lyeth, to put
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:29345:92"/>
in Bayle to the cause: But the Forteyner hath no such priuiledge.</p>
            <p>The Plaintiffe hath a day ouer to declare, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it bee so that the Defendant is a Prisoner ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Durance vppon the same suite; For in such case the Plaintiffe must declare vppon the very next Court day following the Arrest.</p>
            <p>And the Defendant is brought by Writ out of the prison to the Barre, to pleade vnto the said Declaration.</p>
            <p>There is one mayne difference betweene the Proceeding here, and that aboue at <hi>VVestminster,</hi> which is in the most familiar and ordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Citie, (<hi>viz.</hi>) their <hi>Indebitatus assumpsit,</hi> And that is, that they deny wager of Law here, vppon it: which (howsoeuer it bee countenanced, and glossed by the Custome) I am sure it takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Inheritance of a free-borne Subiect by the Law.</p>
            <p>The like opinion I haue of an Attachment made of goods in <hi>proprijs minibus</hi> of the owner.</p>

               <head>The forme of proceeding <hi>Ore tenus</hi> in the <hi>Starre-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> followeth.</head>
               <p>IF the Delinquent hath done or spoken any thing worthy the Hearing and Censure of this honourable Court, And be questioned for the same, And therevpon doth confesse the fact or words, and subscribeth his hand to the same Confession made in writing before the Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> or Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> or any the Lords, Iudges, or the Kings Counsaile; And doth, when he is called to this Barre to answere it, likewise confesse the same to be true, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth his hand subscribed to the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion made (as aforesaid:) Then, and in such case the Court vseth to proceede to Sentence and Censure in the matter.</p>
               <p>It hath not bin seene formerly, That any but the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> or Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> the Iudges, or the Kings Counsaile haue taken any such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations or Confessions so subscribed vnder the Delinquents hand (as aforesaid.)</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, if any other who hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in this behalfe, shall take any such Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; subscription, And the partie so examined and subscribing, shall at the Barre confesse the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:29345:102"/>
matter, and acknowledge the hand; The Court may proceede to Sentence and Censure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon:</p>
               <p>For the life of his Examination is the Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and acknowledgement thereof at the Barre, when the Court doth examine him (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is) whether that which is confessed in writing be true, or not.</p>
               <p>And if the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> or Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> the Iudges, the Kings Counsaile, or any other shall take any such Examination and Confession; Yet, if the partie at the Barre shall either deny his hand thereunto subscribed, or the matter therein contained, to be true; Then the Court doth not vse to proceede to sentence or censure him.</p>
               <p>So consequently the strength of the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation seemeth not to stand in the partie who taketh it, if hee be of authoritie, but in the parties Re-examining the same at the Barre, and the Recognization thereof.</p>
               <p>And so I conclude the practice of the Court of <hi>Starre-Chamber.</hi>

            <head>THE EXCHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QVER.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Exchequer</hi> hath three seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of proceeding, according to the three differing maner of busines belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto it on the pleading side: (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <list>
               <item>The <hi>Chequer</hi> Barre,</item>
               <item>The <hi>Chequer</hi> Chamber,</item>
               <item>The Court of <hi>Pleas.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Chamber, It is the English Court or place where the proceedings are held by English Bill and Answere; And the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof is very much like to that of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> (as is said before) and therefore I meane not to insist any further vpon it.</p>
            <p>For the Court of <hi>Pleas,</hi> It is the very Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue of the Courts of Common Law in the Hall, and therefore I would bee loth to boyle the same meate twice ouer to your Trencher:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:29345:103"/>
but reserue my selfe for the <hi>Chequer</hi> Barre espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, and the Receipt side.</p>
            <p>The Processe and Proceedings of the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> Barre are distributed betweene the two <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers</hi> of this Court; (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Kings <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancer</hi> and the Lord <hi>Treasurers Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what doth properly appertaine to the one, and what to the other, I haue at large set downe in my <hi>Direction</hi> for <hi>Search of Record,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the finall Doome and Order of Sir <hi>Richard Lyster</hi> Lord chiefe Baron in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth:</p>
            <p>And by the view of the particular matters and businesses therein appropriated so respectiuely, you may the better iudge of the proceeding to be held vpon them; the rather, for that euen here at the Barre side, they doe in most things follow the practice of the common Law also.</p>
            <p>Therefore I shall bend my selfe to set foorth the practice of those things which are not presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented in the other Common Lawe Courts at all, beeing matters onely proper to this, &amp;c. with that small difference which is betweene this Court and those of the Common Lawe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Staires, in point of Appearance at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a Suite, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>This Bayle must bee alwayes taken before a Baron in the Court, and not in his Chamber, as is vsed in other Courts:</p>
               <p>The Processe is a <hi>Sub poena;</hi> And if the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant doe appeare therevpon by his Attourney, his Sureties must be bound by Recognizance (as aforesaid) with Condition that hee shall render, &amp;c. If the Defendant be condemned.</p>
               <p>If the Plaintiffe be pleased, The hand of the Defendant may be sufficient in this case, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he appeareth personally or no:</p>

            <head>THE COVRT OF PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>I should say somewhat touching that great Court of Record, The Parliament. But the obiect is so farre remoued from my sight, that I cannot presume a certaine representation, with these weake <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of eying those mysteries: I make bold by way of Explanation, Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Deduction of Sir <hi>Thomas Smithes</hi> Common-wealth, to deliuer this onely.</p>
            <p>YOu shall vnderstand thet all the Law of this Land which is Positiue, doth consist ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in———</p>

            <p>For the Acts of Parliament, publique or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate:
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:29345:117"/>
They bee all kept and remaine in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stodie of the Clerkes of the Parliament; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer (as I shewed you in the Search of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) that they are, or at least should bee, in the Chappell of the Rolles likewise, and most of them are brought ouer thither by <hi>Certiorare, vt ibidem, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>These Acts (as you may reade) are made and established by the King, the Peeres and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Land, so stably and sanctedly, that they be taken for Law.</p>
            <p>And that you may the better conceiue, what are the businesses, what the practice, and what consequently the Records of this Court, I will briefely receite the very words of Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> to that point onely:</p>
            <p>(<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
            <p>The Parliament Abrogateth old Lawes; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth new; Giueth order for things past, and for things hereafter to bee followed; Changeth right and possessions of priuate men; Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Bastards; Establisheth formes of Religion; Altereth weights and measures; Giueth forme of Succession to the Crowne; Decideth of doubtfull Rights and Titles, whereof there is no Law already made; Appointeth Subsidies, Tailes, Taxes, and Impositions; Giueth most free Pardons and Absolutions; Restoreth in Bloud, and Name; Naturalizeth Aliens borne out of the Kings Allegeance, and to bee short,

            <p>It is euident, that this is the highest Court of this Realme, because the Authoritie of it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, and bindeth all manner of persons, For that they are all parties and priuies therevnto, by way of Representation, &amp;c.</p>
