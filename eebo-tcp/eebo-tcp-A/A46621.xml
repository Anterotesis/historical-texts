            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I Knowing your Loyalty, and the Loyalty of the Aldermen your Brethren, and moreover I am not ignorant of the Loyalty of thoſe Worthy Men that aſſiſted you in the worſt of Times; for I was an Eye-witneſs, and a Labourer with you, and I know the great Pains and Care you all took; and as for Sir <hi>John Moore,</hi> I ſhall never forget him, but I ſhall always Admire him, becauſe I ſaw how he was harraſſed about and teez'd on every ſide; the Threats, and Scandalous Letters, and Affronts that he took, but with what Patience, Mildneſs, and Sweetneſs did he overcome all, without running them into Priſons, or Revenging of Injuries, is not unknown to me; but I queſtion whether the ſtrongeſt Man in the Nation could have carried off ſuch a great Confuſion with ſo much Peace, but how little he is Regarded for it, I think it is not unknown; but if all the World be Ungrateful, I will not, for I will always acknowledge all your Loyalties, and will endeavour to Reward it, according to my weak Ability, and for this Reaſon I will Live with you, and Die for you, becauſe you have been Loyal to your King and True to the Heir, tho I know you have been blam'd by many, and been Laughed at, and ſaid. What hath your Loyalty gain'd you, for if you had joyned with us, you would never have loſt your Charter; but ſuch diſcontented Souls ſhall know that Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth not go unrewarded, for you ſhall have a better Charter, and be more Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Happy than ever you have been, if you be but Wiſe, to continue Fervent to the end, and be as True to your God, as you have been Loyal to your King, for you have Acted like brave Loyal Men, when <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholicks</hi> dare not appear above-board, and therefore they ſhall not have the honour of your Victory; for if there was any <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> that Acted, they were Diſguiſed, and therefore it ſhall go for nothing; for the King is ours, and none can claim him ſo rightly as we can, for we own him for our Supream Head and Governour, which no others do; no, not the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and why then ſhould they rob us of our Crown Jewel, the Breath of our Noiſtrils, land ſuch a Soul, that <hi>Rome</hi> cannot afford the like. O! he is a Gracious Prince, that excels all the Princes in the World, and do they think to bereave us? No, I'll fight a Thouſand Battles, and by the help of God, I will regain him again: For I know you are all ſo Good, that you value the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and eternal Happineſs more than your own Lives and Fortunes, and when God is pleaſed to do this, it will make all forſake the Evil of their Ways, and cleave to him, ſo this Kingdom that abounds in Wickedneſs, may be changed into a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Righteouſneſs, and the King will be eternally Glorious for being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of ſuch a happy Change; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt not think that ſhe can do it, for ſhe is built upon the Sands, and ſhe will never endure to the end: For to Serve God is perfect Freedom, but to ſerve Popery is perfect Thraldom, which the Lord deliver his Anointed and every good Soul from; and for this Cauſe, that the Enemies ſhould not prevail over you; nor make a prey of you, I would have you incline your ſelves to all manner of Goodneſs, and not to hugg up your Money as if it were a God, for that cannot preſerve nor ſave you in the day of his Anger; but conſider the deadneſs of Trade, and the hardneſs of Times, and while we are Relieving the Poor of another Countrey, do not let us Starve our own, but do good to all both in Body and Soul, in puniſhing of Vice and rewardiug of Vertue: This is that which will make your Souls Live when your Bodies Die, that you may not only be great in this World, but eternally Happy, through the Merits of Chriſt, in the World to come, is the Prayer of</p>
