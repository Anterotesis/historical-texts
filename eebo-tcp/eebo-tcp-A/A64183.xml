            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Mercurius Nonsencicus.</head>
            <p>THis age wherein no man knowes whether he lives or not lives, whether he wakes, or dreames; when he can hardly trust his eares with what he heares, believe his owne eyes, wherewith he sees, or give credit to his owne heart; with which he payes it with thinking, Round, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, as rotten as a rag, with a W for Jack-adandy.</p>
            <p>A Plot, a Plot, a most horrible, terrible, execrable, dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, abhominable, and damnable Plot; discovered strangely upon <hi>Newmarket Heath,</hi> where (time out of minde) there hath been a Vault with a secret unknowne Trap-doore; which doore being left open (by negligence) an old blind Woman stumbled, and tumbled into the Vault, where she saw 40000. Horse, all Man'd, or back'd with brave, bold, desperate, valiant, violent, coragious <hi>Don Quixots,</hi> Lord <hi>Whachums,</hi> Knights of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and of the Illustrious order of the burning Pestle, with many Reformadoes, and Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montadoes, and others: it is a strange discovery that a blind Woman was the first that saw it, and she presently told it to a deafe Woman, the deafe Woman related it to a lame Woman, the lame Woman told it to a dumb Woman, and she came post upon a lame Horse, and discovered the whole busines to me as I have related to you, what it will come to I can tell you, nothing: old time hath made more Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphosis lately then ever Ovid did, or could doe; time hath transformed the signe of St. <hi>Martin</hi> into a <hi>Goat,</hi> and old Charing Crosse into Knive hafts, and Salt-sellers, meane Men are Men of meanes, and Men of meanes are meane Men, without meanes, money, Cloathes or cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51403:3"/>
               <hi>Bulls</hi> were wont to beget <hi>Calves,</hi> but now it is an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary thing for <hi>Calves</hi> to speake <hi>Bulls,</hi> and create them by word of mouth; (as for example) <hi>Goe you three both together, and I will run before you and overtake you presently; or as a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low lately (well filled with drinke) said that he could drinke noe more then an Apple is like an Oyster;</hi> but <hi>he could sleepe like an arrow out of a Bow:</hi> and therefore (Sirra) have a care how you behave your selfe when you come to present an Apple to my Lords Ape, or my Ladyes Monkey, <hi>Kisse your legge and make a hand finely;</hi> and (for all our fooling) there are many that did begin a monstrous bigge huge Quarrell, that would be glad to doe their best to be quiet, and end a brabling bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse: twit, twat, tush, puffe, mew, all are but words to fill up a sheet in print; there is more adoe with Iack-an-Apes then with all the Beares.</p>
            <p>This is easie stuffe to be read; but it will trouble a deepe understanding to pick out the meaning; <hi>Homicide, Fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, Matricide, Paricide, Regicide</hi> (in the dayes of King <hi>Edmund Ironside</hi>) was on the Bank side, and in Cheapside accounted as bad as killing of folkes, blesse us from a mad dogg, and the fall of a Wind-Mill: all Scots be not Knaves, nor are all English men over burthened with honesty; for though a soft Mault makes a sweet fire, yet all is not Gold that glisters, and there is now as much difference between Egges and Onions as ever there was.</p>
            <p>When a mans Corps and Capacity are both grosse, it is signe that his Body and his understanding are Twinns; for though it be a cruel torment for a wise man to be bound in a Chaire whilst a foole talkes him to death, yet I conclude him to be none of the wisest that is overmuch taken in love with any thing that is written in this Pamphlet, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he any other then a Tiffany patience that is very angry at the writer that cares not for it; truth doth seldome goe without a scratcht face; and though <hi>Mellancholicus</hi> and <hi>Pragmaticus</hi> doe play <hi>O Man in desperation,</hi> and write od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, madly, yet I am so tame a foole that I doe dare neither to write Knavishly, or speake wisely; though (perhaps) I
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51403:3"/>
doe now and then shew my valour in thinking truly.</p>
            <p>The pestilent penns of pestiferous Pragmaticall, Aquati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call poetasters hath sweat out whole Reames to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; they have transformed, and metamorphosed <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> into more shapes then ever <hi>Proteus</hi> had: most curiously curious <hi>Mercurius</hi> hath beene sublimated like a Neapolitan Unguent or Unction with a pretence to cure the Kingdome of the <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> Arbitrary tyranny; but all those nimble feather braind, froath witted <hi>Mercuriallists</hi> have done no better then playd the Iuggling Alchymists; or like an Imposture Quacksalver hath turned all our money into Quick-silver, with hei presto 'tis gone: (to the Devill I thinke) my selfe, with some hundreds of the Kings Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are in the happy condition of Poets, poore and pennylesse, our Purses being turn'd Brownists, not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a crosse to come neer'em; but the most of us are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in the Carthusian order, abstinence or fasting (<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens volens</hi>) so that whereas in the dayes of Yore, <hi>Diebus il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> Halcion times, some grosse witted sonns of ignorance would call us his Majesties Biefe-eaters, or the Kings Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morants, and other pritty foolish Apellations, and Epe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thites; so that if any of us ever were Cormorants, I am sure that most of us are transformed into Camelions, Aire, Smoake, Vapours, words and winde, being our delicate dainty first and second courses; yet (by supernall favour and providence) wee hold up our heads, stand on our feet, looke chearfully, and talke as heartily as some that fare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously: we have seene some high floods, and low ebbs, and that part or spoake in Times wheele that is lowest may be raised; in the meane space we will feede upon hope till we can get better Victualls.</p>
            <p>Greedy Gatherers of too much <hi>Mammon,</hi> will (one day) finde it like the gathering of so much <hi>Manna,</hi> it will turne to wormes, and gnaw the Consciences of the avaricious possessors; great faults are commonly Gentlemen-ushers to great punishmens, one drawes the other after, and as the Thread followes the Needle, even so proditorious, perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51403:4"/>
and presumptuous actions are dog'd by self guiltines, and doom'd by divine vengance to unavoyded destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>There is a new trade lately practis'd in England, which is to cut throats, and kill men for 3. or 4.s. a weeke, they say the Devill himselfe is Master of the Company: the most part, or greatest numbers of this society are so far from the way of Peace, that they hate the peace of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: they have banished the Peace of Conscience, the Kings peace (I am sure) they have broken, and the peace of God, they (through want of understanding) have no stomack to.</p>
            <p>In the Introduction to Grammer (Vulgarly called the Accidence) there is the Common of 2, and the Common of 3; but right and true bred English men have beene Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians in more Commons then 2 or 3: we had a House of Commons Renouned, Religious, Venerable, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and should be in that reverend regard, that detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (or distraction) should not so much as snarle, or grumble against: we see now that honorable House day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abus'd, traduc'd, and expos'd to the most and worst of what transcendent defamatory tongues, or pennes can (out of griefe of heart) inveterate mallice, spleenative envy, or the gall of Bitternesse, speake, write, invent or publish.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Wealth</hi> is not common, but private, and so private that a few have got all, many have lost all, and the greatest number have ne're a whit; insomuch that the Common wealth is not the wealth that is common, the want of which hath made me and many thousands to be much troubled with the Kings Evill.</p>
            <p>The Common prayer was esteemed a good Director (or Direction) but now it is contradicted by another Antidire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, much better then the old one, as some wise men say.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Common Purse</hi> is empty, the <hi>Common Treasure</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible; the <hi>Common Counsell</hi> are Grave, and wise, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51403:4"/>
would have all well: there are some good men wanting who should hasten the effecting of the <hi>Common</hi> safety; but there is here, there (but not every where) a <hi>Common Whore</hi> that lyes like damnable stumbling blocks, that the Common wayes are filthy, uneven, unmended, and irreparable, whilst our <hi>Common misery</hi> is continually encreased, repaired, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, extended, and amplified.</p>
            <p>There are also halfe a dozen of <hi>Cases</hi> as <hi>ablative, genitive, vocative, accusative, nominative;</hi> Reader I request, will, and require you to beare with my misplacing of the cases, I pray you consider that all things are out of order, great men and small men, low men and tall men, be it knowne unto all men that there is a <hi>bad Case,</hi> a <hi>good Case,</hi> a <hi>base Case,</hi> a <hi>meane Case,</hi> a <hi>Trebble Case,</hi> a <hi>desperate Case,</hi> a <hi>mad Case,</hi> a <hi>sad Case,</hi> a <hi>woefull Case,</hi> a <hi>wretched Case,</hi> a <hi>fine Case,</hi> and a <hi>poore Case,</hi> hey all six and six.</p>
            <p>But hold, hold, wit whither wilt thou, take heed (old <hi>Jack Taylor</hi>) keep thy first principles, stand to thy promise, beware of writing a wise word, it, and, of, for, by, from, to, at, wherefore, it's no matter when, or why, make an end to no end, and as thy Title was intrincicall, so let thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilogue, and Catastrophe be nonsencicall in heroick, dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cicall, and naturall, artificiall Verses, beyond the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all the Colledges, or Universities of either Kent or Christendome, Christian or Shropshire man, and let the world know, that by the rules of <hi>Gallen, Hippocrates, Avicen, Paracelsus, or Esculapius</hi> himselfe, the running gout will never make a good footman.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Like to th' embrodered Meadowes of the Moone,</l>
               <l>Or like the houres' twixt six and seven at Noone,</l>
               <l>Or like a Cock that wants Stones, Spurs, and Combe,</l>
               <l>Or like a Traveller that's ne're from home,</l>
               <l>Or like Tobacco that wants stink or smoake,</l>
               <l>Or like the Devill in Religious Cloake;</l>
               <l>Such is this Pamphlet, writ with such advisement,</l>
               <l>As troubles not the State, or what the Wise meant.</l>
