            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>I Have heard that in some fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Prophetick Pictures</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to represent the <hi>Fate</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> the chief thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servable (in several of them) was a <hi>Mole</hi>; a creature blind and
<pb facs="tcp:59802:3"/>
busie, smooth and deceitful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually working under Ground, but now and then to be discerned by the disturbance it makes in the Surface of the earth: which is so natural a description of a rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less party among us that we need no <hi>Iudge</hi> of <hi>Controversies</hi> to interpret the meaning of it. Our <hi>Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> had sufficient <hi>Testimony</hi> of their <hi>working under Ground</hi>; but in our <hi>Age</hi> they act more visibly, and with that indefatigable industry, that they threaten (without great care to prevent them) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining of our <hi>Church,</hi> and the Ruine of our established <hi>Religion.</hi> Which since they cannot hope so easily to compass alone, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to draw in to their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, all such discontented parties, who are so weak, (if any can be so) to be prevailed on to be instruments to serve
<pb facs="tcp:59802:3"/>
them, in pulling down a <hi>Church,</hi> which can never fall, but they must be <hi>stifled</hi> in its <hi>Ruins.</hi> One would think, it were hardly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, for any to run into a snare, which lies so open to their view; or to flatter themselves with the vain hopes of escaping better than the <hi>Church</hi> they design to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy. But such is the admirable <hi>Wisdom</hi> of <hi>Divine Providence</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things so above all <hi>humane Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion,</hi> that when the <hi>Sins</hi> of a <hi>Nation</hi> have provoked <hi>God</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it, he suffers those to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr in the most pernicious <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> for <hi>enslaving Conscience,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the greatest <hi>zeal</hi> for the <hi>Liberty</hi> of it. So that our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in its present conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seems to stand as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> did of old, between two unquiet and boisterous Seas; and there are some very busie in
<pb facs="tcp:59802:4"/>
cutting through the <hi>Isthmus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, to let in both at once upon it, supposing that no strength will be able to withstand the force of so terrible an inundation. It is a consideration that might dishearten those who are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the <hi>Defence</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> against the common <hi>Adversaries,</hi> to see that they promise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as much from the <hi>folly</hi> of some of their most <hi>seeming Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> as from the <hi>interest</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of their <hi>Friends</hi>:<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.5.</note> thus like S. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Macedonia, we are troubled on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry side, without are fightings, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are fears.</hi> If men did but once understand <hi>the things which belong to our Peace,</hi> we might yet hope to weather out the <hi>storms</hi> that threaten us, and to live, as the <hi>Church</hi> hath frequently done, in a <hi>tossing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> with waves beating on every side. But if through <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59802:4"/>
or <hi>Wilfulness, those things should be hid from our eyes,</hi> the prospect of our future condition is much more dreadful and amazing than the present can be.</p>
                  <p>If it were reasonable to hope, that all men would lay aside pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and passion, and have greater regard to the <hi>Common Good,</hi> than to the <hi>interests</hi> of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>parties,</hi> they could not but see where our main <hi>strength</hi> lies, by what our enemies are most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to destroy; And that no men of common understanding would make use of <hi>disunited Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> to destroy one <hi>Great Body,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they were sure to master them, when they had done with them; And therefore the best way for their own security were to unite themselves with the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> That were a <hi>Blessing</hi> too great for such a <hi>People</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
<pb facs="tcp:59802:5"/>
whose sins have made our <hi>Breaches</hi> so wide, that we have too great reason to fear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy may enter through them; if there be not some way found out to <hi>repair those Breaches,</hi> and to build up the places which are broken down.</p>
                  <p>For my own part, I cannot see, how those who could have joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Communion</hi> with the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> in the time of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> can justly refuse to do it in ours. For that is the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> which our <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> since the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> comes the nearest to; <hi>Idolatry</hi> being then suppressed by the <hi>Imperial Edicts,</hi> the <hi>Churches</hi> settled by <hi>Law</hi> under the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Bishops, Publick Liturgies</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>Antiquity</hi> Reverenced, <hi>Schism</hi> discountenanced, <hi>Learning</hi> encouraged, and some few <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:59802:5"/>
used, but without any of those corrupt mixtures which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards prevailed in the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> And whatever men of ill minds may suggest to the dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of those times, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an <hi>Honour</hi> to our <hi>Church,</hi> to suffer together with that <hi>Age,</hi> when the <hi>Christian Church</hi> began to be firmly settled by the <hi>Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> of the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> and did enjoy its Primitive <hi>Purity</hi> without the <hi>Poverty</hi> and <hi>Hardships</hi> it endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before. And the <hi>Bishops</hi> of that time were men of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary <hi>Piety,</hi> of those great <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> of that excellent <hi>Conduct</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> as set them above the contempt or reproach of any but <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Apostates.</hi> For then lived the <hi>Gregories,</hi> the <hi>Basils,</hi> the <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> in the <hi>Eastern Church</hi>; the <hi>Ambroses,</hi> and <hi>Augustins</hi> in the <hi>Western</hi>; and they who can suspect
<pb facs="tcp:59802:6"/>
these to have been <hi>Enemies</hi> to the <hi>Power of Godliness,</hi> did never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what it meant.</p>
                  <p>It were, no doubt, the most desirable thing in our State and Condition to see the <hi>Piety,</hi> the <hi>Zeal,</hi> the <hi>Courage,</hi> the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of those <hi>holy Bishops</hi> revived among us in such an <hi>Age</hi> which needs the conjunction of all these together. For such is the insolency and number of the open contemners of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> such is the activity of those who oppose it, and the subtilty of those who undermine it, as requires all the <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi> of those great <hi>Persons</hi> to defend it. And I hope that <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> which inflamed and acted them hath not forsaken that <hi>Sacred Order</hi> among us: but that it will daily raise up more who shall be able to convince <hi>Dissenters,</hi> that there may be true
<pb facs="tcp:59802:6"/>
and hearty <hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> among our <hi>Prelates</hi>; and those of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Good Works</hi> are most agreeable to the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Reformation.</hi> Nay, even in this Age, as bad as it is, there may be as great <hi>Instances</hi> produced of <hi>real Charity,</hi> and of <hi>Works</hi> of <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>pious uses,</hi> as when men thought to get <hi>Souls</hi> out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> or <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> into <hi>Heaven</hi> by what they did. And if it were possible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to compare all <hi>Acts</hi> of this <hi>nature</hi> which have been done ever since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> with what there was done of the same kind for a much longer time immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before it, if the <hi>Protestant Charity</hi> should seem to fall short in outward <hi>Pomp</hi> and <hi>Magnificence,</hi> it would be found much more to exceed it, in <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>usefulness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which makes me so much the more wonder to hear and see, the
<pb facs="tcp:59802:7"/>
ill effects of the <hi>Reformation</hi> in this kind, so much insisted on of late, to disprove the <hi>Goodness</hi> of it. If <hi>some Great men had sinister ends in it,</hi> when was there any great <hi>Action</hi> of that <hi>nature,</hi> wherein some <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> did not aim at their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by it? Who can excuse all the <hi>Courtiers</hi> in the time of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> or all the <hi>Actions</hi> of that <hi>Great Emperour</hi> himself? Must <hi>Christianity</hi> therefore be thought the worse, because it did prevail in his time, and very much by his means? And there were some partial <hi>Historians</hi> in those dayes, that impute the demolishing of <hi>Heathen Temples</hi> and the suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of <hi>Idolatry</hi> to the <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Sacriledge</hi> of the Times. For even those <hi>Heathen Temples</hi> were <hi>richly endowed</hi>; and it is not to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that when such a <hi>Tree</hi> was shaking, there would be
<pb facs="tcp:59802:7"/>
no <hi>scrambling</hi> for the <hi>Fruit</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>However, we are not concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to justifie the <hi>Actions</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs</hi> of any particular <hi>Persons</hi> how <hi>Great soever</hi>: but that which we plead for, is, that the <hi>Reformation</hi> it self was a <hi>just, pious, prudent,</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> thing; and had both suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient <hi>Authority</hi> to warrant it, and sufficient <hi>Reason</hi> to justifie it.</p>
                  <p>We read in the <hi>Spanish History</hi> a remarkable <hi>Precedent,</hi> which vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates the proceeding of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> The <hi>Got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thick Nation</hi> had been infected with <hi>Arianism</hi> two hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years, when by the means of <hi>Leander Bishop</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> the <hi>King Reccaredus</hi> being duly informed in the <hi>Orthodox Faith,</hi> called a <hi>Council</hi> at <hi>Toledo,</hi>

                  <p>IT hath been long expected that I should have published an <hi>Answer</hi> to <hi>T. G.</hi> as the most considerable <hi>Adversary</hi> that appeared against me; but it is very well known, that before his <hi>Book</hi> came out, I had undertaken the <hi>Answer</hi> of <hi>several others;</hi> which when I had set forth, a <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> who had been pleased to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend me against one of my keenest Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists, was assaulted by him; whom I was in the first place obliged in <hi>grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> to ease of any farther trouble. Since
<pb facs="tcp:59802:12"/>
that time I have applyed my self to the consideration of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s Book, as much as <hi>health,</hi> and <hi>other business</hi> would permit.</p>
                  <p>And finding such confusion in most <hi>Discourses</hi> about <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and that till the <hi>Nature</hi> of it were fully and clearly <hi>Stated,</hi> men would still dispute in the <hi>dark</hi> about these matters, in my last <hi>Summers</hi> retirement, I set my self to the strict examination of it, by searching with my utmost diligence into the <hi>Idolatries</hi> practised in all <hi>parts</hi> of the world, by the help of the best <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> I could meet with, either <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> or <hi>modern;</hi> when I had done this, I compared those <hi>observations</hi> I had made with the <hi>Sense</hi> of the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> and of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the several <hi>Ages</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> who had managed the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> against <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> or <hi>Hereticks.</hi> From hence I framed the <hi>First Part</hi> of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:59802:12"/>
                     <hi>Book,</hi> wherein I have not only examined and confuted <hi>T. G.'s</hi> false <hi>notion</hi> of it, but endeavoured to settle the <hi>True</hi> one in its place.</p>
                  <p>Which being dispatched, and the main <hi>principles</hi> of his whole <hi>Book</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>weakned</hi> and <hi>overthrown;</hi> I betook my self to the particular <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of the <hi>Charge</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> practised in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images;</hi> and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended nothing of greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in this <hi>Debate,</hi> than to give a true <hi>Account</hi> of the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi> between us; which <hi>T.

After which, I have given a distinct <hi>Answer</hi> to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing <hi>material</hi> or <hi>plausible</hi> in that <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>Book.</hi> Which swelling this <hi>Discourse</hi> beyond my expectation, I must respite the other <hi>part</hi> to a farther opportunity; which I may the better do, because the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>I begin with the consideration of the</hi> Nature <hi>of</hi> Idolatry, <hi>not only because my
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59802:16"/>

                        <note place="margin">T. G. <hi>p.</hi> 203.</note> Here the Ax is laid to the root, and if ever the <hi>Dr.</hi> will speak home to the purpose, it must be upon this point. He must speak to the Nature of the thing, <hi>&amp;c. But because the weight of the whole matter in debate depends upon it, and whosoever reads through</hi> T.

                        <hi>The</hi> notion <hi>of</hi> Idolatry <hi>which</hi> T. G. <hi>lays down may be gathered from these asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his,</hi>

of God; and the reason of the Law was to keep the people in their duty of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sovereign worship to God alone,<note place="margin">

Which custom of speaking, <hi>saith he,</hi> is likewise found in Scripture, where either the holy Angels, or Men, and Iudges are called Gods; I have said Ye are Gods, and many other places. Franciscus Ferrariensis <hi>in his</hi> Commentaries <hi>on that place saith, that</hi> Aquinas his meaning was, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture only agreed with the Heathens as to the name, but that they called their Gods properly so, whereas the Scripture speaks of them only by way of participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>And did</hi> Aquinas, <hi>mean any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the Heathens, when he saith,</hi> that all their inferiour Gods derived their very being from the Supreme? <hi>The same</hi> Aquinas, <hi>in his</hi> Book <hi>purposely written against the</hi> Gentiles,<note place="margin">Id. l. 3. c. 120.</note> 
                        <hi>gives this account of their Principles of Religion;</hi> that some of them held one God the first and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal principle of all things; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59802:21"/>
all they gave Divine Worship <hi>(Latriam)</hi> next to the Supreme God to intellectual substances of a heavenly nature, which they call Gods, whether they were substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces separated from bodies, or the Souls of the heavenly Orbs and Stars: in the next place to intellectual substances united to aerial bodies, which they called <hi>Daemons,</hi> whom they made Gods in respect of men, and thought they deserved divine worship from men as being Mediatours between the Gods and them; and in the last place to the Souls of good men, as being raised to a higher state than that of this present life. Others of them suppossing God <hi>to be</hi> the Soul of the World, did believe, that divine worship was to be given to the whole world, and the several parts of it, not for the sake of the Body but the Soul, which they said was God: as a wise man hath honour given him not for the sake of his Body, but of his mind. <hi>Others again</hi> asserted, that things below men as Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, might have divine worship given to them, in as much as they did participate of a Superiour nature, either from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of heavenly bodies, or the presence of some Spirits, which Images they called Gods, and from thence they were called Idolaters. <hi>And so he proves,</hi> that they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59802:22"/>
were, who acknowledging one first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did give divine worship to any other being: because it weakens the notion and esteem we ought to have of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being to give divine worship to any other besides him; as it would lessen the honour of a King, for any other Person to have the same kind of respect shewed to him, which we express to the King: and because this divine worship is due to God on the account of Creation, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per only to him, and because he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Lord over us and none else besides him: and he is our great and last end; <hi>which are all of them great and weighty reasons, why divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship should be appropriated to God alone.</hi> But, <hi>saith he,</hi> although this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which makes God a separate Being and the first Cause of all intellectual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, be true: yet that which makes God the Soul of the World, though it be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from truth, gives a better account of giving divine worship to created Beings. For then they give that divine worship to God himself: for according to this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the several parts of the world in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of God, are but as the several mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a mans body in respect of his Soul. But the most unreasonable opinion,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59802:22"/>
                        <hi>he saith,</hi> is that of animated Images, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those cannot deserve more worship, than either the Spirits that animate them, or the makers of them, which ought not to have divine worship given them; besides, that by lying Oracles and wicked Counsels, these appear to have been Evil Spirits, and therefore deserve no worship of us. From hence, <hi>he saith,</hi> it appears, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause divine worship is proper only to God, as the first principle; and none but an ill disposed rational Being can excite men to the doing such unlawful things, as giving the worship proper to God to any other Being, that men were drawn to Idolatry by the instigation of evil Spirits, which coveted divine honours to themselves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture saith, they worshipped Devils and not God. <hi>From which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Testimony we may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of these things.</hi> 1. <hi>That he confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth many of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>whom he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with</hi> Idolatry; <hi>did believe and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the</hi> Supreme God <hi>as</hi> Creator and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the world. 2. <hi>That</hi> divine worship <hi>is so proper to the true God, that whosoever gives it to any created being, though in it self of real excellency, and considered as deriving that excellency from God, is yet guilty of</hi> Idolatry.

the causes of Idolatry, and so they were Devils causally though not essentially. 2.

                        <hi>I con foresee but 2. Objections against this evidence for the</hi> worship <hi>of the</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God <hi>among the</hi> Romans. 1. That <hi>Jupiter</hi> was not worshipped alone in the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59802:34"/>
Capitol, but <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Minerva</hi> too. 2. That this <hi>Jupiter</hi> was not the Supreme God, but <hi>Jupiter</hi> of <hi>Crete. To these I answer.</hi> 1. <hi>I confess that</hi> Iuno <hi>and</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva <hi>had their</hi> Images <hi>in the</hi> Capitol; <hi>but we are to consider that it was a rule in their Pontifical Law, that</hi> a Temple could be consecrated only to one God; <hi>and therefore</hi> M.

                        <hi>told him,</hi> unum Templum, duobus numinibus non rectÃ¨ dedicari. <hi>But there might be</hi> Images <hi>or little</hi> cells, <hi>of other</hi> Gods <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; as</hi> T.

Virgin, <hi>there may be</hi> Chappels <hi>to</hi> Saints, <hi>which do not hinder the main design of the worship being to</hi> God: <hi>and so it was in this (and many other things among the old</hi> Romans;) <hi>as</hi> Diana <hi>and the</hi> Muses <hi>were in the</hi> Temple <hi>of</hi> Apollo; <hi>and the</hi> Graces <hi>of</hi> Phidias <hi>in the</hi> Temple <hi>of</hi> Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Olympius; <hi>but</hi> Livy <hi>particularly saith, as to this</hi> Temple <hi>of the</hi> Capitol, that they cleared the ground as much as they could of all worships besides,<note place="margin">Liv. l. 1. c. 55.</note>

the</hi> Fathers <hi>charge the practice of their</hi> Religion <hi>with; but as they were not to be excused in other things, so we ought not to charge them with more than they were guilty of; I mean when all the</hi> Poetical Fables <hi>of</hi> Iupiter <hi>are applyed to</hi> Iupiter O.

And if the artificer shews his skill in the vessels he makes, the honour is given to him and not to the vessels; so it is here, the honour and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59802:45"/>
glory is not to be given to the matter, but to the wise contriver, who is God himself: therefore if we look upon any of the several parts of matter as Gods, we shall thereby discover how little sense we have of the true God, by making things corruptible equal to him that is eternal. <hi>But wherein could they make them equal? not believing them to be equal in Power and Wisdom, for he supposed before, that one</hi> Supreme God <hi>was allowed on both sides; it could be therefore no otherwise than by giving</hi> divine honour <hi>to the</hi> creature <hi>as well as to the</hi> Creator: <hi>and that not for their own sakes, for he still supposeth them to be thought</hi> the Works of God; <hi>but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were designed to give honour to the</hi> Supreme Architect <hi>by falling down before any parts of matter, he thought it as senseless and unreasonable a thing, as for a man to honour an</hi> artificer <hi>by falling down before his</hi> Work. <hi>It was not then we see the supposing</hi> evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to dwell in Images, <hi>which made the</hi> Christians <hi>so peremptorily deny</hi> divine worship <hi>to them; but because in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should make the</hi> creature equal to the Creator.

As when any of your Subjects make their addresses to you, would it be well taken for them to pass you by, and turn themselves to your Palaces? but men are not so foolish as to do so, but they admire the beauty and excellency of them in passing by, and pay their whole respect and service to your selves. If we look upon the World as a Musical instrument, well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and harmoniously struck, we ought not therefore to worship the instrument, but him that makes the Musick: and those who are the Iudges at the Musick exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises, do not crown the Vial, but him that plaid upon it. <hi>If it be said, that all this proceeds upon the supposition,</hi> that the Supreme God is passed by and hath no peculiar honour given to him. <hi>I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi> 1. <hi>The contrary appears, by what I have already said; for they did give particular honour to the</hi> Supreme Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>as such.</hi> 2. <hi>It is unreasonable to suppose that those who believe one Supreme God to be the Maker of all things, should in their</hi> inward intention <hi>wholly pass him by in the worship they give to his creatures.</hi>

only had been, that they wholly</hi> passed by the Creator, <hi>this would have been no reason against the</hi> Christians, <hi>who might have worshipped the</hi> Creator <hi>and the creatures together, and consequently have freed themselves from the force of the</hi> Laws, <hi>which required no more but giving</hi> divine worship <hi>to the</hi> Deities <hi>publickly worshipped, without any decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their minds concerning them.

If it were lawful then for Christians to give a</hi> relative La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria <hi>to any creatures with an intention to honour God thereby, I cannot see how the</hi> Christians <hi>were excusable in their sufferings; for all that was required from them was only, to obey their</hi> Laws <hi>and offer incense to their Gods.

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59802:50"/>
be allowed to creatures, the Primitive Christians were not so wise, as they might have been; and the Modern doctrines of worship in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, would have saved the lives of thousands of the</hi> Primitive Martyrs, <hi>and not only of the common sort but of the best, and wisest of them; Who sacrificed their lives on this principle, that,</hi> Divine worship (and not <hi>meerly</hi> Sovereign worship) is to be given to none, but to the Supreme God. <hi>But if that pass for good Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that they who believe one Supreme God, cannot possibly give the honour due to him to any creature: <hi>I do not see why the Christians needed to have been so afraid of giving</hi> divine worship <hi>to any thing besides God, for upon this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they were afraid of impossibilities: For as long as they preserved in their minds a just esteem of the incomparable excellency of God above his creatures, they were uncapable of any real</hi> Idolatry. <hi>But I think it is hard to pitch upon a principle more repugnant to the sense of the</hi> Primitive Church <hi>than this is; as I hope to make it clear before I have done with this argument.</hi>

of the highest excellency, and as near to God as we can suppose any creature to be? <hi>And that this, and this only is the</hi> state <hi>of the</hi> Controversie, <hi>I appeal to his own words, which I shall set down in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he writ them, that I be not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with</hi> artificial turning them to my own sense: Hoc est, ut apertius dicam, utrum etiam sibi an tantum Deo suo, qui etiam noster est, placeat eis ut sacra fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciamus, &amp; sacrificemus; vel aliqua no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra seu nos ipsos Religionis ritibus conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremus? i. e.

And this, <hi>saith he,</hi> is that worship which is due to the Deity, which because we cannot find one conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent word in Latin to express it by, I would call Latria, as that service which is due to men is called by another name, <hi>viz. <gap reason="foreign">

                        <note place="margin">Bernier Memoires, Tom. 3. p. 171.</note> about the adoration of their Idols, <hi>and reproaching them with it, as a thing very unreasonable; they gave him this remarkable answer,</hi> We have indeed in our Temples store of divers Statues, as those of <hi>Brahma, Mahadeu, Genich</hi> and <hi>Gavani,</hi> who are some of the chief and most perfect <hi>Deutas;</hi> and we have also many others of less perfection, to whom we pay great honour, prostrating our selves before them and presenting them Flowers, Rice, Oyles, Saffron and such things with much ceremony; but we do not believe these Statues to be <hi>Brahma</hi> or <hi>Bechen,</hi> &amp;c. themselves, but only their Images and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59802:77"/>
and we do not give them that honour but upon the account of what they represent. They are in our Temples, because it is necessary for praying well, to have something before our eyes that may fix the mind; and when we pray, it is not the Statue we pray to, but he that is represented by it. For the rest we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that 'tis God that is absolute, and the only omnipotent Lord and Master. This, <hi>saith he,</hi> was his answer without adding or substracting any thing. <hi>And I desire to be resolved by</hi> T. G. <hi>whether upon these principles they were guilty of</hi> Idolatry, <hi>or no? I am sure their Church accounts them so; and yet they neither believe their</hi> Images <hi>to be</hi> Gods, <hi>nor</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate <hi>their</hi> worship <hi>upon them; and if they be guilty upon these principles,</hi> T.G. <hi>can never clear the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Rome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But besides, they have another way of defending themselves, which the same Author gives this account of,</hi> viz. that God or that Soveraign being whom they call <hi>Achar</hi> (immutable) hath produced or drawn out of his own substance, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly souls,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 178.</note> but also whatever is material and corporeal in the Universe, so that all the things in the world are but one and the same thing which is God himself; as
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59802:77"/>

In his discourse about the best means of converting the</hi> Iaponese, <hi>printed by</hi> Possevine, <hi>he tells us of a</hi> Sect <hi>among them,</hi> who hold but one principle, <hi>which they call</hi> the first reason, <hi>and the</hi> true opinion, <hi>and the</hi> divine truth, <hi>and</hi> that this principle is all things, and all
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59802:78"/>
things are nothing but it extended now and do return into it again upon their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, that the soul of man is the same with it, that men by inward contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may now attain to a knowledge of and union with this first principle; <hi>and as one of the</hi> Iaponese <hi>converts said,</hi> after a man hath spent thirty years in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, he is then fit to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and to be worshipped among their <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi's</hi> and <hi>Fotoques.</hi> This first principle they grant to be one, absolutely Perfect and Wise, but not thoughtful, but living in perfect ease and happiness. <hi>This, saith</hi> Bernier, is the great Cabala of the <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and <hi>Persians; and if</hi> Valignanus <hi>may be credited,</hi> is so of the Iaponeses too: <hi>and it seems to be the very same which</hi> Orpheus <hi>had from the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it the most plausible</hi> Reason <hi>of giving</hi> divine worship <hi>to any thing, which is proposed for adoration.</hi> Valignanus <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a great many arguments against this opinion, but I dare say not one of them stronger or plainer than those which are daily brought against</hi> transubstantiation: <hi>and yet</hi> T.

Valignanus <hi>confesses did acknowledge a</hi> Supreme Being <hi>whom they called</hi> Tento, and believed him to be the Governour of the World, and to him in their great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses they made supplications, believing that all things are well known by him; but under him they suppose many <hi>Cami's</hi> and <hi>Fotoques</hi> to be, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to have had a beginning, such as <hi>Xaca,</hi> and <hi>Amida,</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> and <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranga</hi> and many others, to whom they make their daily addresses in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. <hi>And the</hi> Reasons <hi>which</hi> Valignanus <hi>gives against this way of worship among them deserve our consideration.</hi> 1.

Christians; <hi>and upon full enquiry, they found they gave them great liberty, as to the</hi> five Precepts of the Church, <hi>as they call them,</hi> viz. hearing Mass, annual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, receiving the Sacrament at <hi>Easter,</hi> Fasting at the solemn times, and Tenths and First-fruits: <hi>besides, they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear their</hi> Ceremonies <hi>of</hi> baptism, their oyl <hi>and</hi> spittle <hi>in the</hi> ears, <hi>and</hi> salt <hi>in the</hi> mouth, <hi>when they</hi> baptized Women, <hi>and giving</hi> extreme Unction <hi>to them, because the</hi> jealousie <hi>of their</hi> Husbands <hi>would not permit them to use them; but that which is most to our purpose is the liberty they gave the</hi> Mandarins <hi>in two things.</hi> 1.

solemnities there, that the rest did: <hi>and the same as to</hi> the Temples of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors which are erected to their honour according to the precepts of <hi>Confucius; because the</hi> Chineses <hi>declared that they intended only to give the same reverence to the</hi> memory <hi>of their</hi> Ancestors, <hi>which they would do to</hi> themselves <hi>if they were still living; and what they offer to them is nothing but what they would give them, if they were alive, without any intention to beg any thing from them, when they know them to be dead: and the same al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance they gave, as to the</hi> Images <hi>of their</hi> Ancestors, <hi>about which many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were used by them.

                        <hi>if it would not have swelled this discourse into too great a Bulk; in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral we take this remarkable</hi> Testimony <hi>of</hi> Iosephus Acosta,<note place="margin">Ioseph.

                        <hi>a learned</hi> Spanish Iesuit, <hi>who lived seventeen years in those parts.</hi> They, <hi>(saith he, speaking of the</hi> Indians) do commonly acknowledge a Supreme Lord and Author of all things, which they of <hi>Peru</hi> call <hi>Viracocha,</hi> and gave him names of great excellence, as <hi>Pachacamac,</hi> or <hi>Pachaiackachic,</hi> which is the Creator of Heaven and Earth, and <hi>Usapu</hi> which is admirable, and such like. Him they did worship as the chiefest of all, whom they did honour in beholding the Heaven. The like we see amongst them of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and all other Infidels. Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth well with what is said by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Acts of the Apostles, where he did see the inscription of an Altar <hi>Ignota Deo, To the unknown God</hi>: whereupon the Apostle took occasion to preach unto them, saying, Him whom you worship without knowing him, do I preach unto you. In like sort those which at this day do preach the Gospel to the Indians, find no great difficulty to perswade them that there is a high God and Lord over all, and that this is the Christians God, and the true God. As it is therefore a truth conformable to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59802:87"/>
reason, that there is a Soveraign Lord and King of Heaven, whom the Gentiles with all their Infidelities and Idolatries have not denied, as we see in the Philosophy of <hi>Timaeus</hi> in <hi>Plat.</hi> in the Metaphysicks of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and in the <hi>Asclepius</hi> of <hi>Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist,</hi> as also in the <hi>Poesies</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi>: So the Preachers of the Gospel have no great difficulty to plant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade this truth of a Supreme God, be the Nations to whom they preach never so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous, and bruitish. But it is hard to root out of their minds that there is no other God, nor any other Deity than one: and that all other things of themselves have no power, being, nor working pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to themselves, but what this great and only Lord doth give and impart to them. To conclude, It is necessary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them by all means, in reproving their errours, as well in that wherein they generally fail, in worshipping more than one God, as in particular, which is much more to hold for Gods, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand favours and help of those things which are not Gods, nor have any power, but what the true God their Lord and Creator hath given.<note place="margin">De procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, l. 5. c. 10.</note>

Thunder and Lightning they called, the Executioners of the Iustice of the Sun; and did not look on them as Deities, as the Spaniards imagined. <hi>But the main thing he discovers as to their</hi> Religion <hi>is,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">c. 2.</note> that they had only two Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the one visible, the Sun; the other invisible, the Creator of the World, whom they called <hi>Pachacamac,</hi> from <hi>Pacha</hi> which signifies the World, <hi>and Camac</hi> from the verb <hi>Camar</hi> to enliven, <hi>and</hi> that from <hi>Cama</hi> the Soul; so that <hi>Pachacamac</hi> is as much as, the Soul of the World: which word they had in so great veneration that they durst not pronounce it but with a great deal of ceremonie, and with the most humble posture of adoration: which was the external soveraign worship which they gave to the Supreme Deity, and above what they gave to the Sun, whose name
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59802:88"/>
they did usually pronounce: <hi>from whence he infers,</hi> that although the external wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Sacrifices was performed to the Sun, yet they had in their Soul a greater ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to <hi>Pachacamac,</hi> as an invisible Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that gave being and life to the World. <hi>He saith,</hi> that without all question the <hi>Yncas</hi> and their <hi>Amautas</hi> or Philosophers, did intend no other by this word, but the true Soveraign Creator of the World; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought some Devil was understood by it: but, <hi>saith he,</hi> the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans when they meant the Devil they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him <hi>Cupay;</hi> and at the naming him did spit on the ground in token of execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when they mentioned <hi>Pachaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac,</hi> they did it with all the Reverence and Devotion imaginable. <hi>And withall he adds,</hi> that whatever <hi>Acosta</hi> and others say, this is the proper name for God in the Peruvian Language; and they do not know how to express him otherwise; and that all other names given by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, as <hi>Tici Viracocha, Pachaia Chacher, Pacharurac,</hi> do not set forth the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible Majesty of God in their Tongue, as <hi>Pachacamac</hi> doth. <hi>He tells us,</hi> that it was an inviolable Law of the <hi>Yncas,</hi> throughout their Empire,<note place="margin">c. 3. p. 146.</note> that Divine Worship should be given only to <hi>Pachacamac</hi>
                        <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59802:89"/>
as the Soveraign Deity, and to the Sun for the great benefit the world received by him: and that it was held a very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful thing among them to attribute the Name, Honour, Authority, Power of God or any other Divine perfections to any sublunary things: but they had an inferiour reverence for the Moon as Wife and Sister of the Sun, and for the Stars, which they called her Daughters and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of her House; and so they had for their <hi>Yncas</hi> too, <hi>whose bodies were set up in the</hi> Temple <hi>of the</hi> Sun <hi>in</hi> Cozco, <hi>on either side his</hi> Golden Image;<note place="margin">l. 3. c. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>and in the</hi> Chappel <hi>of the</hi> Moon <hi>were the bodies of the</hi> Empresses <hi>after the same manner: in which he observes,</hi> that the <hi>Yncas</hi> were wont to make their vows to the Moon,<note place="margin">c. 21.</note> and recommend themselves to her as their Mother; but they offered no sacrifices to her, as they did to the Sun. <hi>They have likewise great respect for the</hi> Stars, <hi>and especially for the</hi> Planet Venus, <hi>which they call</hi> the Page of the Sun; <hi>as they have for the</hi> Thunder, <hi>and</hi> Lightning, <hi>and</hi> Thunderbolt, <hi>which he saith again,</hi> they did not hold to be Gods, but to be his domestick Servants; <hi>which the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>because they represented them as</hi> three in one, <hi>mistook for the</hi> Trinity <hi>worshipped
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59802:89"/>
among them, which</hi> Eusebius Nierember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius <hi>from</hi> Acosta <hi>calls</hi> Tangatanga: Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilasso <hi>knew nothing of it, but saith, that they called them</hi> Yllapa. <hi>They have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a great veneration for the</hi> Rainbow <hi>as the production of the</hi> Sun; <hi>and for the</hi> City <hi>of</hi> Cozco; <hi>but as to all these, they give only an</hi> inferiour <hi>and</hi> honorary worship <hi>to them; but they reserve</hi> the Soveraign internal worship <hi>for</hi> Pachacamac, <hi>and</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>by</hi> sacrifice <hi>for the</hi> Sun. <hi>This</hi> Pachacamac, <hi>although he had no</hi> Temple <hi>erected by the</hi> Yncas, <hi>yet the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells us,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">l. 6. c. 30.</note> that under the power of Cuysmancu, <hi>King of the</hi> Yuncas, <hi>there was a Valley, called</hi> the Valley of <hi>Pachacamac,</hi> where was a Temple erected to his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; <hi>and when the</hi> Ynca <hi>of</hi> Peru <hi>demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed subjection to him, and to joyn in the worship of the</hi> Sun; <hi>he said, Pachaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac</hi> was Creator and preserver of all,<note place="margin">c. 3.</note> and therefore greater than the Sun, whom they worshipped, with the utmost expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of adoration; the King himself not daring to enter the Temple with his face towards his Image: and besides Him they only worshipped the Oracle of <hi>Rimac,</hi> and <hi>Mamacohca</hi> i. e. the Sea; But for the Sun, they found too great inconvenience by his heat for them to worship him.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59802:90"/>
                        <hi>The</hi> Ynca <hi>replyed,</hi> that they did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worship the Sun, but <hi>Pachacamac</hi> too; but because he was an invisible and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible Deity, they offered him no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, nor built him any Temple: but they had the greatest inward veneration towards him, which they expressed by all possible demonstrations as oft as they men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his name. <hi>At last the difference was composed on these terms, the</hi> Yuncas <hi>were to retain the</hi> Temple <hi>of</hi> Pachacamac, <hi>but to forbear any</hi> Image <hi>of him, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of him, and humane</hi> sacrifices, <hi>and to receive the worship of the</hi> Sun; <hi>and the</hi> Yncas <hi>to admit the</hi> Oracle <hi>of</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mac. Huayna Capac, <hi>one of the</hi> Yncas, <hi>made use of this argument to the</hi> High-Priest <hi>his</hi> Uncle, <hi>that the</hi> Sun <hi>could not be the</hi> Supreme God:<note place="margin">l. 9. c. 9.</note> who dares, <hi>said he,</hi> command me to go a long journey and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rest?

that they offer no bloody sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but all their oblations are of the fruits of the earth: and that they free themselves from the charge of Idolatry, because they acknowledge and worship one God, who is Lord over all; and that their Images are intended to preserve the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of their Saints, that by the sight of them the people might be excited to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their vertues.

                        <hi>the first</hi> Question <hi>proposed is,</hi> who was the Supreme, and the most ancient of the Gods? <hi>To which the</hi> Answer <hi>is,</hi> that the most-ancient of the Gods is called <hi>Alfader,</hi> the Father of all: and he had twelve names <hi>which are there enumerated: and after it is said of him,</hi> that This God lives for ever, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all things,<note place="margin">Mytholog. 304.</note> that he made the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Earth, and Air, and all things in them; <hi>and which is the greatest of all,</hi> he made Man and gave him a Soul that should live for ever, although the body be destroyed; and that those who were good should be with him in a place called <hi>Gimle</hi> or <hi>Wingulf,</hi> but those that were bad to <hi>Hela,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Niflheim.</hi> Which <hi>Niflheim, they add,</hi> was made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages before the Earth; <hi>and then they proceed to</hi> the creation of things, <hi>which is there reported after a fabulous manner. It is true, this Tradition came to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted among them, when the attributes and worship belonging to this</hi> God <hi>were given to that</hi> Prince <hi>who conducted the</hi> Goths <hi>from their former Seat about the</hi> Palus Maeotis <hi>into the</hi> Northern Regions, <hi>who was called</hi> Odin, <hi>or</hi> Woden; <hi>and so
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59802:94"/>
there came in such a confusion in their</hi> Idolatry <hi>as was among the</hi> Greeks <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween</hi> Iupiter Olympius, <hi>and</hi> him <hi>of</hi> Creet. <hi>But since they do mention this</hi> Odin <hi>as chief of the</hi> Asae, <hi>and tell the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his leading the people first to one place, then to another, they cannot mean by him, the</hi> same God <hi>whom they assert to have been from eternity, and to have created all things: but all this confusion did arise among them and other Nations, when vain and ambitious men did take upon them the names of the</hi> Deity <hi>on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that they might have worship given to them; and such a one this</hi> Odin <hi>is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to have been by all the</hi> Northern Historians; <hi>and from hence likewise the names of</hi> Deified men, <hi>have been given to him whom they worshipped for the</hi> Supreme God. <hi>Thus also</hi> Thor <hi>was the</hi> Son <hi>of</hi> Odin; <hi>yet in some of the</hi> Northern parts, <hi>they worshipped the</hi> Supreme Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>under his name, attributing the power over all things, even the</hi> inferiour Deities <hi>to him.

attributed to none but to <hi>God</hi> himself; I prove, 1. From the <hi>nature and design of Religious worship.</hi> 2.

                     <p n="1">1. From <hi>the nature and design of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship,</hi> which is to put a difference between the <hi>worship</hi> we give to <hi>God</hi> and to his <hi>Creatures.</hi> For since <hi>God</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Government</hi> among men, it is plain that his intention was, that some kind of worship should be given from some of his creatures to others, although of the same nature with themselves; for where there is a power to punish and to reward, there is the foundation of <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in those who are under that power: which <hi>worship</hi> lies in expressing a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that <hi>power,</hi> by a care not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it, and an endeavour to obtain the favour of it; which being among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind living in <hi>Society</hi> with each other, is therefore called <hi>civil worship.</hi> Which denomination it doth not lose although we give that <hi>worship</hi> to <hi>Superiours</hi> upon a <hi>Religious account, i. e.</hi> though I give worship to my Soveraign with a respect <hi>to God,</hi> because he hath commanded it,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59802:111"/>
and I intend to honour him by it; yet the worship doth not take its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from my intention, but from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Act,</hi> which being <hi>civil,</hi> the worship continues to bear that name. By which we see that the <hi>external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> which do accompany mens acts, are those which do so circumscribe and limit them, that from thence they become either <hi>civil</hi> or <hi>Religious.</hi> I cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but extremely wonder to see men of understanding so much to seek in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>because the same external acts are common to divine and civil worship</hi>; but what then? doth it therefore follow that there is no certain way to discriminate these one from the other? I grant the same <hi>external act</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> may be used to men which is used to <hi>God</hi>; as <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Heth</hi> in token of <hi>civil respect,</hi> as well as when he worshipped <hi>God</hi>; but could not any one that considered the <hi>circumstances</hi> make a plain difference between these two sorts of <hi>adoration?</hi> When the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> would have <hi>divine honours</hi> given to them, were any of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> so senseless to say they knew no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and the <hi>worship</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them before, because they might use
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59802:111"/>
the same <hi>external acts of adoration</hi> in both cases? Suppose the <hi>Pope</hi> one day to sit on, a throne as a temporal <hi>Prince,</hi> and on that account summoning his subjects to give <hi>homage</hi> to him, and another day to be placed upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> as he is after his election by the Orders of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi>

the different signification of these acts is to be gathered from the <hi>circumstances</hi> of them.</p>

It is not the supposition of <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> in them will ever justifie this: For let their <hi>excellency</hi> be never so great, it is still but a <hi>created excellency:</hi> And their <hi>excellency</hi> can never make them so much <hi>above us,</hi> as their being <hi>created</hi> makes them <hi>inferiour</hi> to <hi>God:</hi> and in acts of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> we ought not so much to consider our distance from them, as their distance from <hi>God.</hi> Let them be never so much

                        <hi>above us,</hi> they are <hi>creatures</hi> still, and that sets them at an <hi>infinite distance</hi> from him, whereas all their <hi>excellencies</hi> can make them but <hi>finitely distant</hi> from us. Let them be never so <hi>excellent,</hi> they still wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the same <hi>God</hi> that we do, and with the most profound <hi>adoration</hi> of Him; and if their <hi>excellency</hi> be consistent with their worship of a Being <hi>infinitely</hi> above them, it is not sufficient to make them an object of <hi>adoration</hi> to us. We are willing to give them the utmost, their <hi>excellency</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires from us (provided, we be well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of it) and that is, a mighty esteem of them, and a readiness to express our honour in celebrating their praises, and commending them as Heroick patterns of goodness, and (supposing them actually present with us) the expressing our esteem in the highest tokens of respect that are used among men: Thus far we go; and if those beings are such, as we suppose them, they would not have us to go farther; but (as the <hi>Angel</hi> said to St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) they would bid us, <hi>Worship God.</hi> But we dare not use the same solemn <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> in <hi>places</hi> and at <hi>times</hi> set apart for the service of the <hi>Great God,</hi> to any of his <hi>Creatures</hi> how excellent soever they be: for this is an encroachment upon the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

very well! but is it not a greater fault to give <hi>divine worship</hi> to <hi>mans crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> than to <hi>Gods?</hi> for a <hi>picture</hi> at the best is but <hi>the work of mens hands.</hi> But he cannot deny, <hi>that in such a case</hi> the <hi>Latria</hi> passes <hi>to God, through such an Image as a man or a Prince is; but because of the danger men are in of giving divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to creatures, they ought to abstain from it.</hi> Very good! but is there not as much danger of mens worshipping <hi>Stocks,</hi> and <hi>Stones,</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> as there is in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>mankind</hi>? And if a <hi>relative Latria</hi> will not justifie the one, much less certainly can it do the other. But of this hereafter. The thing I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve now is, how careful even the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> have been, notwithstanding they heard of the same pleas that are used in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to preserve the <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> of <hi>external adoration peculiar</hi> to their <hi>Gods.</hi>

of one of these two things.</hi> 1. <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he did use the acts of worship proper to the Idol, therefore the Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin were to enquire not only whom men worshipped, but in what manner.

as well as to <hi>God,</hi> and therefore cannot be such an <hi>appropriate sign of divine worship.</hi> To this I have already answered, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the <hi>Act,</hi> and the <hi>signification</hi> of it; the <hi>external act</hi> I grant may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon several grounds; As 1. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil subjection,</hi> as by <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> 1 Kings 1.23.2. <hi>Civil respect,</hi> as by <hi>Abraham</hi> to the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Heth,</hi> Gen. 23.7.3. <hi>Religious respect,</hi> or as some call it, <hi>Moral Reverence,</hi> i. e. out of an opinion of <hi>great sanctity,</hi> without <hi>superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority,</hi> as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 2.46. And so <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed to the <hi>Angels,</hi> Gen. 18.2. if he knew them to be what they were; but if not, as appears more probable both of <hi>him</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> by <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. then it was only an expression of <hi>civil respect</hi> to them. 4. Out of a <hi>sudden transport,</hi> as St. <hi>Iohn</hi> did to the <hi>Angel</hi> twice, which he would not have done a second time, if he had considered his being checked for the first, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10.22.8, 9. Now if these things may by their <hi>circumstances</hi> and <hi>occasions</hi> be appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently differenced from each other, and from that <hi>Religious adoration</hi> which God doth require to be given to himself, then there can be no reason from thence to make the <hi>signification</hi> of <hi>external adoration</hi> to be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59802:131"/>
                        <hi>equivocal.</hi> There is the same nature in these <hi>acts</hi> that there is in <hi>words</hi> of <hi>different significations</hi>; which being taken in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> are of an <hi>equivocal sense,</hi> but being considered with all their particular <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> they have their sense so <hi>restrained</hi> and <hi>limited,</hi> that it is easie to discern the one from the other. That we call there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Religious adoration,</hi> which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the <hi>circumstances</hi> of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> as to <hi>time, place, occasion,</hi> and such like; as if men used <hi>prostration</hi> to any thing within the <hi>Courts</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> (wherein some of the <hi>Iews</hi> thought that <hi>posture</hi> only <hi>lawful;)</hi> if it were done in the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> or <hi>devotion</hi>; if the <hi>occasion</hi> were such as required no <hi>respect</hi> of any other kind, as when the <hi>Devil</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>fall down and worship him;</hi> in these and such like <hi>circumstances</hi> we say <hi>adoration</hi> hath the determin'd <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> and is an <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate sign</hi> of it, by <hi>Gods</hi> own institution.

of <hi>Incense</hi> before the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi>; for he would in all probability have done his endeavour to have preserved it; and if <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had pleaded the <hi>Law</hi> that <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated incense to the worship of God,</hi> 
                        <q>he would have desired him <hi>to clear his eyes a little better</hi>; for then he might discern that <hi>burning incense</hi> was <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ceremony,</hi> and may be applied either to <hi>God</hi> or the <hi>creature</hi>; and that the difference of these depends on <hi>the intention of the persons</hi> who do them; now how could any man tell by the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act</hi> what the <hi>intention</hi> of these <hi>persons</hi> was? For all that appeared, they intended only <hi>to honour God</hi> by it in <hi>memory of the great miracles he had wrought by means of it;</hi> and then it was so far from being <hi>evil,</hi> that it was an act of <hi>Latria</hi> to God.

Why then should the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> be profaned by that, which <hi>sanctifies</hi> other things?
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59802:139"/>
Therefore only advise them to <hi>direct their intention aright,</hi> and there can be no harm in the use of such an <hi>indifferent ceremony</hi>; and let the <hi>Brazen Serpent</hi> stand, to excite the devotion of the people towards God in remembrance of what he did to the people of old by the means of it.</q> But it seems <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had not looked over <hi>Aristotle's threshold</hi> so far as to know, <hi>that acts go whither they are intended</hi>; and therefore he took the <hi>giving</hi> of that part of <hi>worship</hi> which <hi>God</hi> had appropriated to himself, to the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> to be sufficient ground for the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molishing</hi> of it, without particular enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into the <hi>intentions</hi> of the persons.

                     <p>To make this matter the more clear, I shall here take away this <hi>cavil</hi> of <hi>T.

G.</hi> rejects <hi>as utterly false, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause humane acts go whither they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that the prohibition of God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes the act unlawful, and doth not hinder its going to its object.</hi> To take off this, I undertook to shew, that where <hi>God</hi> hath prohibited any <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59802:148"/>
                        <hi>worship</hi> so given cannot be said <hi>to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated upon him:</hi> because <hi>worship</hi> being as here understood, <hi>an outward significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of honour and respect,</hi> God making a <hi>rule</hi> for his own <hi>worship,</hi> whatever hath <hi>disobedience</hi> in it, must <hi>dishonour God</hi>; and that were a contradiction <hi>to honour God by dishonouring him</hi>; and therefore God giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the <hi>denomination of Idolatry, mens intentions</hi> could not excuse them from the <hi>guilt</hi> of it. For I said, whither soever men directed their <hi>intention,</hi> it is plain from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>God doth interpret this kind of worship</hi> to be <hi>terminated</hi> on the <hi>Image</hi>; and therefore the <hi>Israelites</hi> are said <hi>to worship the molten Image,</hi> although they directed their <hi>intention</hi> to <hi>God</hi> by it.

                        <pb n="267" facs="tcp:59802:148"/>In all <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> there are three things to be explained. 1. The <hi>inward intention</hi> of the <hi>mind.</hi> 2. The <hi>outward act</hi> of <hi>worship.</hi> 3. The <hi>passing</hi> of that <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act</hi> according to the <hi>inward intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; or the <hi>terminating</hi> of it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>inward intention</hi> of the mind, is either (1.) <hi>Actual cogitation</hi> of the <hi>object intended,</hi> or (2.) <hi>Directing</hi> the <hi>outward act</hi> to some <hi>particular end.</hi> As when I see a <hi>picture</hi> that puts me in mind of a Friend, the <hi>inward intention</hi> of the mind in the act of seeing is carried to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject represented, which is no more than <hi>simple cogitation,</hi> or <hi>apprehension</hi> of the Person by an <hi>Idea</hi> of him in my mind; but when I <hi>kiss</hi> that <hi>picture</hi> out of the <hi>esteem</hi> I have for him, the <hi>intention of the mind</hi> is by that outward act to shew the <hi>respect</hi> I have for <hi>his</hi> Person.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>outward act</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> may be considered two wayes. 1. <hi>Physically,</hi> and <hi>abstractly</hi> from any <hi>Law,</hi> and so it depends upon the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>intention.</hi> 2. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> as <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> and so it receives its <hi>denomination</hi> from the <hi>Law,</hi> and not from the bare <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>Person;</hi> as if a man steals with an <hi>intention</hi> of charity, the <hi>goodness</hi> of his <hi>intention</hi> doth not hinder the <hi>act</hi> from falling under the <hi>denomination</hi> of theft.</p>

                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:59802:149"/>3. The <hi>passing</hi> of the <hi>outward act</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>inward intention,</hi> or the <hi>terminating</hi> of it, signifies no more out of these terms, than that it was the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the person who did it to <hi>honour God</hi> by doing it; but whether this be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> an act of <hi>honour</hi> to <hi>God</hi> or no, is not to be judged by the <hi>simple intention</hi> of the <hi>Doer,</hi> but by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath given. And how can <hi>God</hi> be <hi>honoured</hi> by a palpable act of <hi>disobedience?</hi> and how can that <hi>worship</hi> be <hi>terminated</hi> as <hi>worship</hi> upon him, who hath utterly <hi>refused</hi> it? And supposing that <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>appropriated</hi> that <hi>outward act</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> to himself, which is given to an <hi>Image,</hi> this is giving the <hi>worship</hi> to a <hi>creature,</hi> which is proper to <hi>God</hi>; which <hi>T.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>He</hi> saith, <hi>this is changing the State of the Question</hi>; how so? <hi>Why,</hi> forsooth, <hi>my charge was of real Idolatry, and my proof is only of Metaphorical Idolatry, and by extrinsecal denomination.</hi> What need is there that men have a care of their <hi>words</hi> that have to do with such <hi>Sophisters!</hi> All
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59802:149"/>
that I said of <hi>denomination,</hi> was no more than this, <hi>The Divine Law being the rule of worship all prohibited wayes of worship must receive that denomination which God himself gives them:</hi> what is this to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical Idolatry?</hi> If I say that unjust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ones neighbour, or taking away his Goods, or lying with his wife, must receive that <hi>denomination</hi> which the <hi>Law</hi> gives them, doth this imply that it is only <hi>Metaphorical Theft and Adultery, and false Witness?</hi> I do assure him, I meant very <hi>real Idolatry,</hi> under that <hi>denomination</hi>; and that upon this reason, which I have now more largely insisted upon, <hi>viz.</hi> that it belongs to <hi>God</hi> to <hi>appropriate acts of worship</hi> to himself, that <hi>God</hi> having appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated them, they become <hi>due</hi> only to him; and therefore they who do these <hi>acts</hi> to any besides himself, do give to the <hi>creature</hi> the worship <hi>due to God alone,</hi> which is the very definition of <hi>real Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try T.

But the <hi>real Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry I meant,</hi> he saith, <hi>was that which was so antecedently to any prohibition, as appears by my contending that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth require the giving the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the honour due only to God.</hi> What strange arguing is this, for so a subtile a Sophister! Would not any one that <hi>had
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59802:150"/>
looked over</hi> Aristotles <hi>threshold</hi> (to use his own phrase) discern, that if <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth consist <hi>in giving the creature the worship due only to God,</hi> as many wayes as worship may become <hi>due, Idolatry</hi> may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Cannot God make any of the former <hi>appropriate acts of worship</hi> to become <hi>due</hi> only to himself? cannot he tye us to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them to him? and then they become <hi>due</hi> to him: and cannot he restrain us from doing them to any other? and then they become <hi>due only</hi> to him: and is not then the doing of any of these <hi>prohibited acts</hi> to a <hi>creature,</hi> the giving to them <hi>the worship due only to God?</hi> Is the <hi>outward act</hi> of <hi>sacrifice due only to God</hi> antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a <hi>prohibition</hi> or no? If it be <hi>due</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>God antecedently to his will,</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and necessarily <hi>due</hi> to him, and <hi>to him alone</hi>: and let <hi>T. G.</hi> at his leisure prove, that <hi>antecedently to any Law of God, it was necessary to worship God by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and unlawful so to worship any else besides him.</hi> If it depends on the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> then either it is no <hi>Idolatry</hi> to offer <hi>sacrifice</hi> to a <hi>creature;</hi> and then the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of the <hi>Mass</hi> may be offered to <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Images:</hi> or if it be, then <hi>real Idolatry</hi> may be consequent to a <hi>prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But he thinks he hath a greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59802:150"/>

                        <hi>that men do bow down before it, doth thereby become an Idol, and on that account is forbidden in the second Commandment.</hi> This is downright tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling; for if I should say, that taking away a mans goods against his consent is <hi>Theft,</hi> and <hi>on that account</hi> is forbidden in the <hi>eighth Commandment,</hi> would any man imagine, that I must speak of Theft ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to the Command? for it implyes no more, than that it is contrary to the Command. But as it is in the case of Theft, that is alwayes a sin, although the particular species of it, and the <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of particular <hi>acts</hi> doth suppose <hi>positive Laws</hi> about <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Property;</hi> so it is in the case of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> the general <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of it is alwayes the same, viz. <hi>the giving the worship to a creature, which is due only to God,</hi> although the <hi>denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of particular <hi>acts</hi> may depend upon positive <hi>Laws,</hi> because God may <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate</hi> peculiar acts of <hi>worship</hi> to himself, which being done by him, those <hi>acts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given to a creature, receive the <hi>deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which, without those <hi>Laws</hi> they would not have done. So that still the general <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> is ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59802:151"/>
to positive <hi>Laws,</hi> but yet the <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi> of particular <hi>acts,</hi> whether they are <hi>Idolatry</hi> or no, do depend on the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Laws</hi> which God hath given about his <hi>worship.</hi> And if <hi>T.

Suppose it be murder, adultery, or disobedience to Parents; although I grant these things to have a general <hi>notion</hi> antecedently to any <hi>Laws;</hi> yet when we come to enquire into particular <hi>acts,</hi> whether they do receive those <hi>denominations</hi> or no, we must then judge by particular <hi>Laws,</hi> which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what <hi>acts</hi> are to be accounted <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Disobedience</hi>; as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>execution</hi> of <hi>malefactors</hi> be <hi>prohibited Murder,</hi> whether <hi>marrying</hi> many <hi>Wives</hi> be <hi>Adultery,</hi> whether not complying with the <hi>Religion</hi> of ones <hi>Parents</hi> be <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> These things I mention, to make <hi>T. G.</hi> understand a little better, the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Moral Acts,</hi> and that a general <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi> being <hi>antecedent</hi> to a <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is very consistent with the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59802:151"/>
any particular acts, (as the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> to be <hi>Idolatry,)</hi> to be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to that <hi>prohibition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I perceive a particular pleasure these men take, to make me seem <hi>to contradict my self</hi>; and here <hi>T.

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59802:152"/>
that this worship cannot be terminated on God antecedently to the Prohibition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause on that account the worship of an Image is forbidden in the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; or if it cannot be terminated on the account of the Prohibition, then it is not on that account forbidden.</hi> What a needless invention was that of <hi>Gunpowder! T. G.</hi> can <hi>blow</hi> a man up with a <hi>train</hi> of consequences from his own words, let him but have the <hi>laying</hi> of it. Could I ever have thought, that such innocent words, as <hi>on that account,</hi> should have had so much <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> in them? For let any man read over those words, and see if he can find any thing antecedent to the <hi>prohibition</hi> in them. For having in that place shewed that the words <hi>Idolum, scul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptile, imago</hi> are <hi>promiscuously used in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> I presently add, <hi>By which it appears, that any Image being made so far the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of divine worship that men do bow down before it, doth thereby become an Idol, and on that account is forbidden in this Commandment. By which it appears</hi> (mark that) this <hi>T.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59802:152"/>
men do perform that act of worship to an <hi>Image</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath forbidden the doing towards it; what then? then say I, <hi>it becomes an Idol,</hi> for whatever hath divine worship given to it, is so; <hi>and on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, i. e.</hi> of its having that <hi>act of divine worship</hi> done to it <hi>by bowing before it, it is forbidden in this Commandment, i. e.</hi> it comes within the reach of that <hi>prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; the meaning of all which is no more than to shew, that <hi>adoration</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is <hi>Idolatry</hi> by vertue of that <hi>Commandment.</hi> But, thus are we put to construe and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase our own words, to free our selves either from the ignorance, or malice of our Adversaries. But with this fetch <hi>T.G.</hi> stands and laughs through his fingers, at the trick he hath plaid me; and bids me, with a secret pleasure at his notable inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>to extricate my self out of this Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi> But doth not <hi>T.

which is proper to God, and another called</hi> Dulia <hi>or inferiour worship that may be given to creatures on the account of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies communicated to them from God.</hi> 2. <hi>That the worship they give to any ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate creatures, that have no proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of their own is not absolute, but a relative</hi> Latria, <hi>they intending thereby only to worship God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the examining of these two, I shall clear the <hi>last part</hi> of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> viz. 3. <hi>How the applying the acts of Religious worship to a creature doth make that worship Idolatry?</hi>

Beings, but nothing at all to the point in debate between us; if I mean that honour of which a creature is capable for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sake, and that relation which it set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, he will,</hi> he saith, <hi>shew it to be false, that the Fathers deny any such honour to be given to the Holy Angels or Saints: and if I prove that this worship ought not to be called Religious,</hi> he tells me from S. <hi>Austin,</hi> that <hi>it is but a meer wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling about words, because Religion may be used in other senses besides that of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship due to God.</hi> And by the help of this <hi>distinction</hi> between the <hi>Religious worship due to God,</hi> and that of which <hi>a creature is capable for Religions sake,</hi> he saith <hi>he can clearly dispell the mist I have raised from the Testimony of the Fathers, and let the Reader see that I have perverted their meaning, and yet said nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi> Thus he answers the testimonies of <hi>Iustin Martyr, Theophilus, Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> (or the <hi>Writer under his name) Theodoret,</hi> S. <hi>Austin</hi>; and if they had been a hundred more, it had been all one; they had been all sent packing with the same answer; let them say what they would, they must be all understood of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship proper to God,</hi> and not of the <hi>inferiour worship which creatures are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable

                     <p>To proceed with all possible <hi>clearness</hi> in this debate, which <hi>T. G.</hi> hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to <hi>perplex,</hi> I shall 1.

I will
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59802:158"/>
therefore freely tell, him how far I yield in this matter, that he may better understand where the difficulty lyes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. I yield, that the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven do deserve <hi>real honour</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> from us; and I do agree with Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> whose words he cites, therein, <hi>that to dispute whether we are bound to honour the Saints, were to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute whether we are to be Christians, or whether we believe them to be Saints in Heaven.</hi> For on supposition that we believe, that the greatest <hi>excellencies</hi> of mens minds come from the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to men through <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> and we are assured that such <hi>persons</hi> now in Heaven were possessed of those <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,</hi> it is impossible we should do otherwise than <hi>esteem</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> them. For <hi>honour</hi> in this sense, is nothing else, but the <hi>due apprehension</hi> of anothers <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency;</hi> and therefore it must be greater, or lesser according to the nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of those <hi>excellencies.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we believe the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven are possessed of them in a higher degree than they were on earth, our esteem of them must increase according to the measure of their <hi>perfections.</hi>

is upon the account of those we may call <hi>Religious excellencies,</hi> as they are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from meer <hi>natural endowments</hi> and <hi>civil accomplishments.</hi> On which account I will grant, that is not properly <hi>civil honour,</hi> because the <hi>motive</hi> or <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> is really different from the <hi>other.</hi> And although the whole <hi>Church</hi> of Christ in Heaven and Earth make up one <hi>Body,</hi> yet the nature of that <hi>Society</hi> is so different from a <hi>Civil Society,</hi> that a different <hi>title</hi> and <hi>denomination</hi> ought to be given to the <hi>honour</hi> which belongs to either of them; and the <hi>honour</hi> of those of the triumphant Church may the better be called <hi>Religious,</hi> because it is an <hi>honour</hi> which particularly descends from the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of <hi>Religion, viz. God</hi> himself as the <hi>fountain</hi> of it; as <hi>civil honour</hi> doth from the <hi>Head</hi> of a <hi>Civil Society.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. That this <hi>honour</hi> may be expressed in such <hi>outward acts,</hi> as are most agreeable to the <hi>nature</hi> of it. And herein lyes a considerable difference, between the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of men for <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>acquired ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,</hi> and <hi>divine graces,</hi> that those having more of <hi>humane nature</hi> in them, the <hi>honour</hi> doth more directly redound to the <hi>possessor</hi> of them; but in <hi>Divine Graces</hi> which are more immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59802:159"/>
into the souls of men, through a <hi>supernatural assistance,</hi> the <hi>Honour</hi> doth properly belong to the <hi>Giver</hi> of them. Therefore the most agreeable expression of the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> is solemn <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God</hi> for them: for thereby we acknowledge the true <hi>fountain</hi> of all the <hi>good</hi> they did or received. However, for the incouragement of men to follow their examples, and to perpetuate their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the primitive <hi>Christians</hi> thought it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fitting to meet at the <hi>places</hi> of their <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> there to <hi>praise God</hi> for them, and to perform other <hi>offices</hi> of <hi>Religious worship to God,</hi> and to observe the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary</hi> of their <hi>sufferings,</hi> and to have <hi>Panegyricks</hi> made to set forth their <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> to excite others the more to their <hi>imitation.</hi> Thus far I freely yield to <hi>T. G.</hi> to let him see what pittiful cavils those are, <hi>that if men deserve honour for natural or supernatural endowments, sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Saints in Heaven much more do so:</hi> Who denyes it? We give the <hi>Saints</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> the <hi>utmost honour</hi> we dare give, without robbing <hi>God</hi> of that which belongs only to him.</p>
                     <p>Which is that of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> and consists in the <hi>acknowledgements</hi> we make of <hi>Gods supream excellency</hi> together with
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59802:160"/>
his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over us: and so <hi>Religious worship</hi> consists in two things. 1. Such external <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> which <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>appropriated</hi> to himself. 2. Such an <hi>inward submission</hi> of our <hi>souls,</hi> as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes his <hi>Superiority</hi> over them: and that lyes, as to <hi>worship,</hi> 1. In <hi>prayer</hi> to him for what we want. 2. In <hi>dependence</hi> upon him for <hi>help</hi> and <hi>assistance.</hi> 3. In <hi>Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> to him for what we receive.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>signification of want, and the expression of our desire of obtaining that which we need:</hi> and whosoever <hi>beggs</hi> any thing of <hi>another,</hi> doth in so doing, not only acknowledge his own <hi>indigency,</hi> but the others <hi>power</hi> to <hi>supply</hi> him: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Suarez</hi> truly observes from <hi>Aquinas,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now if we consider <hi>Prayer,</hi> as a part of <hi>Religious worship,</hi> we are to enquire on
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59802:160"/>
what account it comes to <hi>be so</hi>; not, as though thereby we did <hi>discover</hi> any thing to God which he did not know before, nor as though we hoped to <hi>change his will</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>prayer;</hi> but that thereby we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess our <hi>subjection</hi> to him, and our <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> on him for the <hi>supply</hi> of our <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.</hi> For although <hi>prayer</hi> be looked on by us as the <hi>means</hi> to obtain our <hi>requests,</hi> yet the <hi>consideration</hi> upon which that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>means,</hi> is, that thereby we <hi>express</hi> our most <hi>humble dependence</hi> upon <hi>God.</hi> It being the <hi>difference</hi> observed by <hi>Gul.

<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59802:161"/>
true State of the Question is this, <hi>whether by the manner of Invocation of Saints which is allowed and practised in the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, they do not give that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to Saints, which is only peculiar to God?</hi> Now we are farther to consider, wherein that <hi>act</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> doth lye; which is not in an <hi>act</hi> of the <hi>mind</hi> whereby we apprehend <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>first and independent cause of all good</hi>; but in an act of <hi>dependence</hi> upon him for the <hi>obtaining</hi> that good we stand in need of. For a man may <hi>apprehend God</hi> to be the <hi>first Author of all good,</hi> and yet make no <hi>prayer</hi> to him, nor use the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>Religious worship</hi>; because he may suppose that <hi>God</hi> may have committed the care of humane affairs to <hi>inferiour Deities,</hi> and therefore all our <hi>addresses</hi> and <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> are to be performed to them: on this account the <hi>worship</hi> proper to <hi>God</hi> must lye in <hi>dependence</hi> upon him as the <hi>Sole Author</hi> of all <hi>Good</hi> to us; and this to be expressed by our <hi>Solemn Invocation</hi> of him. For although the <hi>internal desire</hi> be sufficiently known to <hi>God</hi>; yet the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi> of <hi>external Religious worship,</hi> and owning this <hi>dependence</hi> upon <hi>God</hi> to the world, doth require the expression of it, by <hi>outward duties</hi> and <hi>offices of Religion,</hi>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:59802:161"/>
in such a manner, that our sole <hi>dependence</hi> upon <hi>God</hi> be understood thereby.</p>
                     <p>Now the Question between <hi>T.

                        <hi>and to have recourse to their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, aid, and assistance, whereby to obtain benefits of God, by his Son our Lord Iesus Christ who is our only Redeemer and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi> Where we take notice of the phrase <hi>suppliciter invocare,</hi> to <hi>invocate</hi> them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of <hi>suppliants,</hi> and that not only <hi>voce,</hi> but <hi>mente,</hi> with <hi>words,</hi> but <hi>mental prayers</hi> as the <hi>Council</hi> adds, which words seem to be put on purpose to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish it from that office of <hi>Kindness</hi> in one <hi>man</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> when he desires him to <hi>pray for him</hi>; for this is as much as they would use concerning the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven <hi>praying to God,</hi> that they do <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter invocare;</hi> this <hi>phrase</hi> then doth not limit the <hi>signification</hi> of this <hi>invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
                        <pb n="294" facs="tcp:59802:162"/>
to be no more than <hi>praying to the Saints to pray for us.</hi> For a man doth, I suppose, answer the <hi>signification</hi> of that <hi>phrase</hi> by <hi>praying to them to give,</hi> rather than by <hi>praying to them to pray</hi>; for the <hi>one</hi> imports more the <hi>humility of a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant,</hi> than the <hi>other</hi> doth. And if there had been apprehended any danger of <hi>praying to them as the givers of blessings,</hi> is is not to be imagined, but so <hi>wary</hi> a <hi>Council</hi> would have expressed it, as it was most easie to have done; and most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to avoid that danger, if they had any regard to the good of mens souls. And that man must have an understanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of a very common size, that can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the <hi>praying to Saints as the Givers of Blessings,</hi> which was known to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in their <hi>Church,</hi> when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the <hi>humble invocation of Saints</hi> without the least censure of that <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>praying to them.</hi> Nay farther, which puts the matter out of dispute, with all who do not wilfully blind themselves, the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> commends <hi>the making recourse,</hi> not only <hi>to the prayers of the Saints,</hi> but <hi>to their aid and assistance:</hi> what doth this <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assistance</hi> signifie, as distinct from <hi>prayers,</hi> and expressing
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59802:162"/>
somewhat beyond them? (or else those words were very weakly inserted in such a place, where they are so lyable to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>construction) unless it be that which they <hi>pray</hi> for to them, <hi>viz. that they would help, comfort, strengthen, and protect them.</hi> Of which sort of <hi>prayers</hi> I produced several instances in their most <hi>Authentick Offices.</hi> And what saith <hi>T.

and of all that love thee, I do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and assign my self unto thee, as to my dear Patroness, to be thy proper and loving Child.

<q>O my Lady, Holy <hi>Mary,</hi> I recommend my self into thy blessed trust, and singular custody, and into the bosome of thy mercy, this night and evermore, and in the hour of my death, as also my Soul and my Body; and I yield unto thee all my hope and consolation, all my distress and miseries, my life and the end thereof; that by thy most holy

                     <p>Here we have <hi>intercession</hi> again, but that is not all, nor the main thing; for <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody</hi> is more than <hi>intercession</hi>; and that is first <hi>begged,</hi> and then <hi>intercession.</hi> So that if ever any <hi>prayers</hi> were made to <hi>creatures</hi> for those <hi>things,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> alone can <hi>give,</hi> these were; and so as to imply our <hi>dependence</hi> on them for the <hi>obtaining</hi> of them.

                     </p>
                     <p>And now I beseech <hi>T.

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59802:165"/>
without overthrowing the plainest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>reason</hi>; and which by the customary <hi>modes</hi> of <hi>speaking</hi> among all Nations, attributing the thing signified to the sign, and by other places of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> we prove ought to be no otherwise understood? But here is a <hi>strange figure</hi> invented against the plain and natural <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>words,</hi> for by <hi>praying to bestow must be understood only praying to pray:</hi> and that when those <hi>titles</hi> are at the same time given, which suppose it <hi>in their power to give</hi>; and when there is no imaginable <hi>necessity</hi> from any <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> to put this <hi>sense</hi> upon those words. For what <hi>article</hi> of their <hi>Creed,</hi> what <hi>decree</hi> of their <hi>Church,</hi> what <hi>doctrine</hi> of their <hi>Divines</hi> doth it <hi>contradict,</hi> for any man <hi>to pray directly to the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>for the destruction of heresies, support under troubles, Grace to withstand temptations, and reception to Glory?</hi> And what can we beg for, more from <hi>God</hi> himself? Yet I challenge <hi>T. G.</hi> to shew, which of all these, such <hi>prayers</hi> are <hi>repugnant</hi> to? and if to none of them, why should not the <hi>words</hi> be understood as they properly signifie? nay, it were easie to shew, that such prayers are very agreeable not only to the <hi>doctrine</hi> of the

But this were to go beyond the bounds of this <hi>general Discourse</hi>; which is designed only to <hi>state</hi> the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and them. Yet I cannot but take notice of the <hi>way T. G.</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 407.</note> 
                        <hi>the people are instructed by, to make this to be the sense of praying to give,</hi> i. e. <hi>praying to pray.</hi> 1. He saith, the <hi>common doctrine of Christianity, by which they are taught that God alone is the giver of all good things:</hi> and doth not the same common doctrine of <hi>Christianity,</hi> teach men <hi>to pray to him</hi> alone, for what <hi>he only can give?</hi> and not to use such <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>absurd fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures</hi> in <hi>prayer,</hi> whose plain sense is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this <hi>common doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi> But I wonder that <hi>T. G.</hi> should think this an <hi>effectual way</hi> to make them understand the <hi>prayers</hi> in this sense, when himself hath shewed them the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile this <hi>common doctrine</hi> to their <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>; and the <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>words.</hi> For may not <hi>giving</hi> be <hi>distinguished</hi> as well as <hi>worship?</hi> It is true, <hi>God</hi> alone is the <hi>Original Giver of all good things,</hi> and this is <hi>a Soveraign way of giving peculiar to God</hi>; but there is <hi>an inferiour and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate way of giving by a power derived from
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59802:166"/>
God, and this is all,</hi> say they, <hi>we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Saints</hi>; and how now doth the <hi>common doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi> teach people more effectually, that <hi>God alone is the Giver of all things,</hi> than that <hi>God alone is to be worshipped?</hi> I am sure the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> saith one as often, and in as plain terms, as it can do the other. <hi>But,</hi> 2. He saith, <hi>their Sermons, Catechisms and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications both by word and writing do it</hi>; suppose some persons do it, I ask, <hi>by what Authority?</hi> their <hi>Church</hi> having never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared against <hi>an inferiour way of giving in the Saints,</hi> and having expresly owned the <hi>making recourse to them for their help and assistance,</hi> as well <hi>as their prayers.</hi> I desire <hi>T. G.</hi> in good earnest to tell me, what makes him so concerned, to have all the <hi>prayers</hi> understood in that sense, <hi>of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Saints to pray for them,</hi> against the <hi>express sense</hi> of the words? Is there any <hi>harm</hi> in the other <hi>sense</hi> or not? if there be no <hi>harm,</hi> why may they not be so <hi>understood,</hi> without so much force and violence offered to them? if there be any <hi>harm,</hi> what is it? <hi>Idolatry</hi> or not? if only <hi>scandal,</hi> why were they not put in other words? if <hi>Idolatry,</hi> then <hi>T. G.</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self charges them with <hi>Idolatry</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their <hi>prayers</hi> by <hi>Lilly's Grammar,</hi>

unless he thinks it much better for them, not <hi>to understand them</hi> at all. But I shall beg the <hi>Favour</hi> of one of their <hi>Church-Dictionaries</hi> to interpret this late <hi>Ode</hi> of <hi>Rapin</hi> to the <hi>Lady</hi> of <hi>Loretto,</hi> so as to make me construe it to be only <hi>praying to her to pray for them.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the former <hi>Discourse</hi> I produced the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Iustin Martyr, Theophilus Antiochenus,</hi> and mentioned many others to the same purpose, <hi>viz. that all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship was due only to God</hi>; and with this double caution to prevent cavils, 1. That it was without making any <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions</hi> of <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>relative worship,</hi> which they must have been driven to, in case they had given <hi>Religious worship</hi> to any besides. 2. That when the <hi>Christians</hi> refused to give <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> it could not be understood of the <hi>adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> proper to the <hi>Supream God,</hi> for none can be so sensless to imagine they required that, but such kind of <hi>Religious worship</hi> as they gave to the <hi>Images</hi> of their <hi>Gods.</hi> To all this <hi>T. G.</hi> replyes,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 340.</note> (I.) <hi>That these Testimonies are impertinent, because they are to be understood only of that divine worship which is due to God alone; and not of the Inferiour worship which belongs to Saints or Angels.</hi> Might he not as well have said, that they prove that <hi>no man</hi> might be worshipped, but <hi>a woman</hi> might? For the force of the <hi>Testimonies</hi> did not lye meerly in this, that they attributed <hi>divine worship</hi> only to God, but that they
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59802:172"/>
made use of the most <hi>general terms</hi> which signified <hi>worship</hi> without any <hi>distinction</hi> of the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of that <hi>worship,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to be on a <hi>Religious account.</hi> For no men of common sense would have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they did, if they had believed that some sort of <hi>Religious worship</hi> were lawful to be given, and another not. Doth <hi>T. G.</hi> think that he should ever escape censure in his <hi>Church,</hi> if he should say pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily <hi>that it is unlawful to give any kind of Religious worship to a creature,</hi> when the very <hi>Indices</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape the <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> for <hi>blabbing</hi> so great a Truth? No; we should have <hi>T. G.</hi> presently out with his <hi>distinctions; worship</hi> is of <hi>two sorts, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream</hi> called <hi>Latria, inferiour</hi> called <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia: Religious</hi> may be taken in <hi>two senses.</hi> 1. <hi>That which proceeds from the vertue of Religion, and that is proper to God.</hi> 2. <hi>That which tends to the honour of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that may be given to creatures.</hi> And thus would the <hi>Fathers</hi> have written, if they had ever <hi>looked over Aristotles threshold,</hi> and been of <hi>T. G</hi>'s mind; and therefore my argument which proceeded upon the <hi>general terms</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> without intimating any such <hi>distinction,</hi> doth hold good, that either they did not
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59802:172"/>
write like <hi>understanding men,</hi> or they knew no such <hi>distinctions</hi> as these. 2. <hi>That although</hi> Justin Martyr <hi>and</hi> Theophilus <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny divine worship to be given to Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, yet they both imply,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>that lawful worship and honour is to be given to them; and therefore he cannot but wonder, what I meant by alledging those Testimonies, unless I intend not any worship at all to be due to any besides God; or that I think it not possible to worship a good man. And afterwards</hi> he saith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 347.</note> 
                        <hi>he would willingly understand yet farther, whether I allow any honour at all to be due to Princes as Gods Vicegerents; for he doth not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hitherto any passage in my Book, from whence he could gather that I hold it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give any worship either to Princes Statues or to themselves.</hi> Which words have such a venemous insinuation in them, that I could hardly believe they could come from a man of the least common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity. <hi>Because I deny Religious worship to be given to any besides God himself;</hi> must I therefore be represented as a man that denyes <hi>Civil worship to be given to Princes?</hi> I cannot tell, whether the <hi>folly</hi> or <hi>malice</hi> of such an <hi>insinuation</hi> be the greater. I pray <hi>God</hi> help his <hi>understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and forgive his <hi>ill will.</hi> I hope <hi>all
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59802:173"/>
acts do not go whither they are intended;</hi> but that which he designs for my <hi>dishonour,</hi> may <hi>notwithstanding his intention,</hi> termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in his own. I do assure him, I am so much for the <hi>utmost civil worship</hi> to be given to <hi>Princes</hi> as <hi>Gods Vicegerents,</hi> as not to think it <hi>in the power of any Bishop in the World to depose them,</hi> or <hi>absolve their subjects from obedience to them</hi>; and I hope <hi>T. G.</hi> thinks so too, although he may not think it so fit to declare his mind. But what is all this to our present business? The force of my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay in this, <hi>the Christians denyed giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religious worship to Princes, although it were an inferiour kind of Religious worship,</hi> therefore they did not think an <hi>inferiour kind of Religious worship lawful.</hi> Was this argument too hot for his fingers, so that assoon as he touched it, he runs away, and frets and fumes, and vents his spight against me <hi>for</hi> it? However, I will urge it again and again, till I receive a better answer. <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>the Fathers speak only of the Soveraign worship that is due only to God; and that is the worship they think unlawful to give to any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> I say it is impossible that should be their sense, for they deny it to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to give <hi>Religious worship to Princes,</hi>
                        <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59802:173"/>
when they were required to do it; but no men ever took <hi>Princes</hi> for the <hi>Supream God. T. G.</hi> tells me, <hi>that</hi> Tertullian <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains</hi> Theophilus <hi>and</hi> Justin, <hi>saying, that the King is then to be honoured when he keeps himself within his own Sphere, and abstains from divine honours.</hi> Very well! this is that I aim at: and he need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>what I brought these testimonies for</hi>; for it was for this very thing which <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> saith, <hi>that the Christians did refuse to give divine honours to Princes:</hi> and therefore they thought <hi>divine worship</hi> comprehended under it all sorts of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worship.</hi> But saith <hi>T. G. it is a thing notoriously known, that many of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Emperours exacted to be worshipped as Gods, that is with divine worship.</hi> I grant all this, and say that it still proves what I intend. For did they mean by <hi>worshipping</hi> them as <hi>Gods,</hi> that they would have the people believe them to be the <hi>Supream God?</hi> that is <hi>madness</hi> and <hi>folly</hi> to suppose, for the utmost they required, was to be <hi>worshipped</hi> with the same <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> that <hi>Deified men</hi> were; or to have the same <hi>worship</hi> living, which the <hi>Senate</hi> was wont to decree to them when they were dead. And can <hi>T. G.</hi> possibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>that this was to suppose them to be
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59802:174"/>
the sole Authors of all good to mankind?</hi> which is that kind of <hi>divine worship,</hi> he saith, the <hi>Fathers</hi> only condemned. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>T. G.</hi> to think again of this matter, and I dare say he will see more cause to <hi>wonder at his own answer,</hi> than <hi>at my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> which so evidently overthrows all that he brings to evade the <hi>Testimonies</hi> of the <hi>Fathers. But</hi> saith <hi>T. G. if Kings may be honoured as Gods Vicegerents, why may not Saints as the adopted Children of God?</hi> Who denyes this, for Gods sake? but I deny, that either <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Saints</hi> are to have <hi>divine worship</hi> given to them. And since <hi>T. G.</hi> is in the humour of ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me <hi>Questions,</hi> let me propose one to him; if Kings may be honoured as <hi>Gods Vicegerents,</hi> why not with <hi>divine honour</hi> upon his principles; <hi>i. e.</hi> with a <hi>relative Latria,</hi> though not <hi>absolute?</hi> And if that be <hi>lawful,</hi> what he thinks of the <hi>primitive Christians,</hi> who chose to dye, rather than to give <hi>divine worship</hi> to them upon any account? By this time I hope <hi>T. G.</hi> is ashamed of what he adds, <hi>that on the same principles that I deny any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be due to Saints, a Quaker would prove, that it must be denyed to Princes.</hi> The <hi>worship</hi> I deny to <hi>Saints,</hi> is that which <hi>God</hi> hath denyed to them, <hi>viz. Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi>;
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59802:174"/>
the <hi>worship</hi> I say is <hi>due</hi> to <hi>Princes,</hi> is that which <hi>God</hi> hath required to be given them, <hi>viz. civil worship.</hi> And they that cannot find out a difference between these two, are a fit match for the <hi>Quakers.</hi> I know not what a <hi>Quaker</hi> might do in this matter; I am sure <hi>T. G.</hi> doth nothing but <hi>trifle</hi> in it. Was there ever a meaner ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument came out of the mouth of a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> that what he urges against me, <hi>viz. that in such a Book printed in such a place, and just in such a page,</hi>

G.</hi> did not so well
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59802:175"/>
consider the force of his argument, to have pressed it home upon me, for he now sees how much more advantage might have been made by it: but it is an easie thing to add to <hi>rare inventions.</hi> But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>T. G.</hi> (to use his own words) <hi>must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Readers to be all stark blind,</hi> who cannot distinguish <hi>titles of respect</hi> from <hi>Religious worship. But is there not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to Persons for their Piety, as well as for their Age and Dignity?</hi> who doubts it? but that <hi>Reverence</hi> lyes in the <hi>due</hi> expressions of <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>esteem</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, which I hope may be done without encroaching upon the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Religious worship</hi>; and I think I have told him plainly enough, what I mean by them, in the foregoing Discourse. But <hi>T.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59802:175"/>
given on a Religious account, because God commands us to give honour to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is due;</hi> the place urged by <hi>T. G.,<note place="margin">
                              <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 348.</note> Rom.</hi> 13.7. To this a very easie answer will serve. <hi>Worship</hi> may be said to be <hi>Religious</hi> two wayes. 1. As it is required by the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> and so the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship given to <hi>Magistrates</hi> is <hi>Religious.</hi> 2. In its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>circumstances</hi>; as it consists of those <hi>acts</hi> which God hath <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated</hi> to his worship; or is attended with those <hi>circumstances</hi> which make it a <hi>Religious performance,</hi> and then it is not to be given to <hi>Princes,</hi> or any <hi>Creatures,</hi> but only to <hi>God</hi> himself. This will be made plain by a remarkable instance among the antient Christians; While <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honours</hi> were challenged by the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours</hi> to themselves, <hi>i. e.</hi> the honours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>consecrated men</hi> (for they meant no other) the Christians refused giving to them those <hi>external acts of Reverence</hi> which might be supposed to have any <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worship</hi> in them; although they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the greatest readiness at the same time to obey their <hi>Laws,</hi> that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing against <hi>Christianity</hi>; and to pray for their <hi>safety</hi> and <hi>prosperity.</hi> This being known to be the general pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Christians, Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59802:176"/>
                        <hi>Trajan</hi> mentions this as one of the wayes of trying <hi>Christians, viz.</hi> whether they would <hi>Imagini Caesaris thure &amp; vino sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicare,</hi> give <hi>Religious worship to</hi> Caesars <hi>Image, by burning incense, and pouring out wine before it</hi>; which were the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honours required.</hi> This, <hi>Pliny</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>all that were true Christians refused to do; and those who did it presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Christ.</hi> Thus, this matter stood as long as the <hi>Emperours</hi> continued <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> who were presumed to affect <hi>Divine honours;</hi> but when <hi>Constantine</hi> had owned <hi>Christianity,</hi> and thereby declared, <hi>that no Religious worship was to be given to him,</hi> the <hi>Christians</hi> not only erected publick <hi>Statues</hi> to <hi>Emperours,</hi> but were ready to express before them the highest degrees of <hi>Civil worship</hi> and <hi>respect.</hi> This <hi>Iulian</hi> thought to make his advantage of,<note place="margin">

What means this <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here? let us have all or nothing: <hi>with which holy men in this life are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, whose heart is prepared to suffer as much for the truth of the Gospel:</hi> he <hi>that hath but an eye open,</hi> saith <hi>T.

                        <hi>if I speak of that part of the Mass, which was antiently called the Mass of the</hi> Catechumeni, <hi>the Priest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed before he ascends to the Altar desires the Blessed Virgin, and the rest of the Saints,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to pray for him: but in the</hi> Missa Fidelium <hi>there is no Invocation of them.</hi> If there had been none any where else, there had been a far greater confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time: we plainly prove, there was no <hi>Invocation</hi> at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> let <hi>T.

                        <q>That S. <hi>Paul</hi> dealing with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> did prove the unreasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their worshipping <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Images, because he was the God that made the world,</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Acts 17.24, 25, 29.</note> 
                           <hi>and is Lord of heaven and earth, and that we are his offspring, therefore we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver, or stone graven by art or mans device</hi>; where I observed, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> doth not speak meerly against their other objects of worship besides the true <hi>God,</hi> nor their supposing their <hi>Gods</hi> to be present in their <hi>Images,</hi> nor taking their <hi>Images</hi> for <hi>Gods,</hi> but against

their supposition, that there was any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance between <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Images,</hi> or that he was capable of receiving any honour by them. The same argument, I added, S. <hi>Paul</hi> useth to the <hi>Romans,</hi>

                           <note place="margin">v. 18, 21.</note> and <hi>that they

Tyrius, Iulian</hi> and <hi>Eusebius,</hi> from whence I desired to know whether these men, who worshipped <hi>Images</hi> on those grounds, did amiss or no in it? I do not ask, <hi>as my words are expresly,</hi> whether they were mistaken as to the <hi>objects of their worship</hi>; but on supposition they were not, whether they were to blame in the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of <hi>serving God</hi> by <hi>Images,</hi> in such a way as they describe? if not, wherefore doth S. <hi>Paul</hi> pitch upon that, to condemn them for, which they were at not all to blame in? He ought, I said, to have done, as the <hi>Iesuits</hi> in <hi>China</hi> did, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver condemned the people for <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Images,</hi>

G.</hi> doth answer to it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To the places of S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.24. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19. he saith, <hi>that no one ever denyed the unsuitableness of the worship of such Images to the Divine Nature,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 96.</note> 
                        <hi>as are conceived to be proper likenesses, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of the Divinity, of which S.</hi> Paul <hi>speaks in the first place; or of the Images of the false Gods of the Heathens, of which he speaks in the latter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In reply to this, I begin with the <hi>first place,</hi> Acts 17.24. <hi>where,</hi> he saith, <hi>it is plain from S.</hi> Pauls <hi>words, that they thought the Divinity to be like to the Images they made of gold and silver: and this was a mighty argument from the mouth of S.</hi> Paul <hi>to drive that erroneous conceit out of the minds of the</hi> Athenians, <hi>who believed the Divinity to be like the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:59802:193"/>
Images they made; but none at all from my pen against Catholicks, who detest the thoughts of having or making any such Image.</hi> This then is the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, whether S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s discourse against the <hi>Athenians</hi> did proceed only on the supposition of the <hi>Divinity being like to their Images,</hi> or whether the <hi>dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> between them be not made use of by the <hi>Apostle</hi> as an argument to shew that <hi>Images</hi> are not a proper suitable means whereby to worship <hi>God?</hi> For which we are to consider the <hi>Apostles scope</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi>; which certainly was to convince them of their <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For it is said, ver. 16. <hi>that his Spirit was stirred within him, when he saw the City wholly given to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> and in the beginning of his speech he takes notice of their <hi>Bigoterie</hi> in the <hi>Heathen worship,</hi> ver. 22. &amp; 23. <hi>that among</hi> their <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>

Idols,</hi> saith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> he had espied an <hi>Altar with this Inscription, To the unknown God:</hi> and upon this he takes an occasion more fully <hi>to discover him whom they ignorantly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,</hi> and withal to shew the <hi>unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness</hi> of their <hi>worshipping God</hi> at all by <hi>Images.</hi> If the <hi>Apostles</hi> design had been, as <hi>T. G.</hi> imagines, <hi>to drive that erroneous conceit out of the minds of the</hi> Athenians,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59802:194"/>
                        <hi>that the Divinity was like to their Images</hi>; his <hi>Spirit should not have been moved,</hi> at the <hi>sight</hi> of their <hi>Images,</hi> but at their <hi>discourses</hi> about them when he heard them own the <hi>Divinity to be like them.</hi> For, in case they only looked on their <hi>Images</hi> as <hi>helps</hi> to their <hi>devotion</hi>; or as <hi>Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal representations</hi> of some <hi>divine perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi> although they did worship <hi>God</hi> by them, <hi>T. G.</hi> must think then S. <hi>Paul</hi> a little too hasty to be so soon <hi>angry</hi> at the <hi>sight</hi> of them; for upon this ground his <hi>Spirit might be stirred within him,</hi> at the sight of the <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>devotions</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> as well as <hi>Athens.</hi> But S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not wait for any <hi>decree</hi> of the <hi>Areopagus</hi> in this matter; he saw enough to inflame his <hi>zeal,</hi> in their <hi>practices,</hi> and <hi>publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> without looking after any <hi>distinctions</hi> of their <hi>Sophisters</hi> and <hi>School-Divines;</hi> although there were many upon the place ready to justifie every rite of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and that would not let go one tittle of their grossest <hi>superstitions</hi> for all the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> in the world. They could find out as many <hi>Analogies</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical significations</hi> as other men; and thought it as little disparagement to the <hi>Deity</hi> to worship him under the several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of <hi>Minerva, Ceres</hi> or <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi>
                        <pb n="357" facs="tcp:59802:194"/>
when by these they understood the several effects of <hi>Gods Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in giving the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>earth,</hi> as others can in representing him as an <hi>Old man</hi> with a <hi>Popes Crown</hi> on his head; or with one <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>three Faces,</hi> as some that are no <hi>Athenians</hi> have done. For Gods sake, which of the two are more apt to beget in mens minds such appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of <hi>God, that he is like to men</hi>; those who make and expose such <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>God</hi> they worship, or such who made an <hi>Inscription</hi> upon an <hi>Altar</hi> to the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God?</hi> And if he were <hi>Unknown,</hi> how came they to <hi>know</hi> him to be so <hi>like themselves?</hi> What need S. <hi>Paul</hi> take such pains to drive a <hi>conceit</hi> out of their heads, which for all that we see, never entered into them? If indeed S. <hi>Paul</hi> had seen over that <hi>Altar</hi> a grave <hi>Image</hi> of a man in <hi>Pontifical Robes,</hi> with an <hi>hoary head,</hi> a <hi>long beard,</hi> and a <hi>Triple Crown</hi>; he would probably have asked them, how the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> that were witty men, could be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of such an absurdity, to call that an <hi>Altar</hi> to the <hi>Unknown God,</hi> when they were so familiarly acquainted with him as to know the very <hi>cut</hi> of his <hi>beard,</hi> and <hi>fashion</hi> of his <hi>Crown?</hi> But, as <hi>Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> as the <hi>Athenians</hi> were, they were not
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59802:195"/>
so <hi>ridiculous</hi>; but yet because they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed this <hi>God</hi> might be pleased with the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Idols,</hi> that were not only in the <hi>Temples,</hi> but in the <hi>Streets</hi> and <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> (where <hi>Thucydides</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Thucydid. l.</hi> 6.</note> there were <hi>twelve Altars</hi>) therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> discourseth of this <hi>God</hi> after such a <hi>manner,</hi> as to shew how unsuitable such a way of <hi>worship</hi> was to his <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Perfections,</hi>

                        <hi>although before the Incarnation of Christ, the worship which people gave to the Images of Gold, was incongruous to the Divine Nature, and a Disparagement to the Deity; yet to those to whom the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of God made man is revealed, it is no disparagement to him to be represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the likeness of man, and to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by such an Image.</hi> Very well; say the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and so say we too. To worship <hi>God</hi> by any <hi>Image,</hi> as <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting</hi> his <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>invisible Nature</hi> is folly and madness; but to make <hi>Images</hi> of him according to his several <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi> for the <hi>good</hi> of <hi>mankind</hi> in the <hi>likeness</hi> of men, is no <hi>disparagement</hi> to the <hi>Deity</hi>; nor to be worshipped by such an <hi>Image.</hi> Let <hi>T.G.</hi> therefore either say, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> argues inconsequently, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the force of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth hold against the worship of any <hi>representations</hi> of God. For it is plain to any man that hath any use of his senses, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not argue against any meer <hi>erroneous conceit of the Athenians,</hi> but against their <hi>Idolatrous worship,</hi> which
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59802:202"/>
he first shews to be <hi>unreasonable</hi> by many arguments, and then tells them, <hi>God</hi> now commanded them to <hi>repent,</hi> and adds the most forcible motive to perswade them to it, from the proceedings of the future judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                        <hi>and those who were like them. Origen</hi> saith, <hi>he speaks of some of the Wise men of</hi> Greece.

to be wise, they became Fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an Image made like to corruptible man, and to Birds and fourfooted Beasts, and creeping things.</hi> And for the sense of this charge I am content to appeal to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the most allowed Interpreters on both sides, that hat have not been parties in the quarrel. <hi>They thought themselves wise,</hi> saith S. <hi>Hierom</hi> or the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Commentaries</hi> under his name, <hi>as those that had found out,</hi> quomodo invisibilis Deus, per simulachrum visibile coleretur; <hi>how an invisible God might be worshipped by a visible representation:</hi> which is the sense of <hi>simulachrum</hi> there; for he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the worship to be directed to the <hi>invisible God</hi> through the Image, and therefore the Image could not be taken either for <hi>God,</hi> or a representation of a <hi>false God; so that nothing can be more clear</hi> (to use <hi>T. G</hi>'s words) according to S. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erom,</hi> than that <hi>T. G. professing to be wise,</hi> doth thereby discover his folly, when he saith, <hi>that S.</hi> Paul <hi>speaks of those who took the Images themselves for Gods; or worshipped the Images of false Gods.</hi> And the <hi>Philosophers professing to be Wise, did become Fools,</hi> because saith S. <hi>Hierom, they did not understand that what is mortal
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59802:206"/>
and corruptible, could have no resemblance to what is immortal and eternal.</hi> The <hi>Greek Scholiast</hi> saith, <hi>they became vain in their imaginations, when they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present him in a Figure that had none, and comprehend him in corporeal Images, that was wholly spiritual;</hi> not as though they were such <hi>Fools</hi> to think to shut up <hi>Infinity</hi> within the bounds of an Image; but to <hi>comprehend,</hi> there is taken with relation to that <hi>representation</hi> which conveys a thing to the mind; and so he useth it a little after, <hi>they thought themselves wise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they thought they could comprehend every thing:</hi> and so the <hi>Image</hi> was sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be <hi>such</hi> a <hi>species</hi> as did convey an intellectual Being to the mind. The same words are used by <hi>Theophylact</hi>; which they both borrowed from S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who condemns the <hi>Greeks</hi> for their <hi>folly,</hi> not for <hi>comprehending,</hi> but for <hi>seeking a spiritual and incorporeal Being, in corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Images. And what can be more foolish,</hi> saith the <hi>Scholiast</hi> and <hi>Theophylact, than to fall down before Stocks and Stones?</hi> And <hi>Origen</hi> doth express the meaning of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this place as fully as I can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, when he applyes all these expressions to those that had a right notion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of God in their minds, but gave

Such as had no <hi>artificial shape</hi> or <hi>figure.</hi> 2. Such as had an <hi>artificial shape,</hi> but it was <hi>of no real being.</hi> 3. Such as had the <hi>shape</hi> either of <hi>men</hi> or <hi>beasts.</hi> Of the two first, and those of <hi>Beasts,</hi> I suppose, no man <hi>professing himself to be wise,</hi> will shew himself such a <hi>Fool</hi> to say, that the <hi>Heathens thought their Gods to be like them.</hi> My business therefore as to them, is to shew that there were such among them to which they did give <hi>divine worship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1.

which is intended to represent another thing to us, which doth not depend on the nature of things, but the arbitrary insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of men; as may be seen by the <hi>notes</hi> and <hi>characters</hi> of <hi>Tyro</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi>; of which no account can be given, why they represent one thing rather than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Maker</hi> of them.

Nay, one would think, that at the same time he had forbidden the one, he had commanded the other; when we see how scrupulous these <hi>Fathers</hi> were in the former, and how much the practice of <hi>devotion</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church,</hi> where it is openly and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly allowed, consists in the other. Surely a man is not more apt to think <hi>God</hi> to be like a <hi>Tree,</hi> or a <hi>Stone,</hi> than to the <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>man</hi>; and if this argument of <hi>similitude</hi> signifies any thing, it tends to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie these practises, condemned by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

allowed in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> they were not to blame in what they did, supposing that to be their meaning, which their own Writers allow; as appears by the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse. But <hi>T. G.</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>however they were to blame in two things.</hi> 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Images being instituted by publick Authority for the worship of false Gods, they concurred as I acknowledge with the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar in all the external practises of their Idolatry.</hi> 2. <hi>Because though in the Schools they denyed them to be Gods, yet as</hi> Origen <hi>charges</hi> Celsus, <hi>they worshipped them as Gods, and the people are confirmed in their opinion.</hi> But all the question is, how this <hi>external worship</hi> comes to be <hi>Idolatry,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing they acknowledged <hi>one Supreme God,</hi> and gave only a <hi>relative</hi> or <hi>inferiour worship to other Beings created by him,</hi> or to the <hi>Images</hi> of them.

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59802:243"/>
is it at last confessed to be <hi>Idolatry</hi> to give <hi>divine worship</hi> to these? <hi>But they concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with the people in their worship</hi>; and why not upon their grounds? what <hi>scandal</hi> did this give among them? <hi>but it was the external profession of Idolatry</hi>; of what <hi>Idolatry?</hi> of the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>false Gods.</hi> What! still in a round? I grant they were <hi>false Gods,</hi> as they had <hi>divine worship</hi> given to them; and so whatever <hi>creature</hi> it be, that is so worshipped, though never so <hi>real</hi> or <hi>excellent a Being,</hi> becomes a <hi>false God;</hi> and so doth the <hi>Image</hi> of that <hi>Being</hi> so worshipped. <hi>But the people had other notions of these false Gods than the Philosophers had, and yet they complyed with the people in external acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> This is just the case of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> their <hi>Learned men</hi> have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the people worship the <hi>Images</hi> for <hi>Gods</hi> among them; but doth <hi>T.

                        <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Superstition,</hi> and say <hi>the Church is free because it hath taken care to instruct them better.</hi> Might not the <hi>Philosophers</hi> have said the very same thing? <q>We are not bound to answer for the madness of the rabble; we instruct them better, and our Schools are open for them to learn: but since the nature of such actions depends upon the <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the <hi>Doers;</hi> we declare our <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> to be to <hi>honour</hi> the <hi>Supreme God</hi> in the <hi>first place</hi>; then the <hi>Coelestial Deities,</hi> with a <hi>worship inferiour</hi> to his, but above all other <hi>Beings</hi>; next to them we worship the <hi>Heavens</hi> on the account of the <hi>Intelligences</hi> that animate and move them; then the <hi>aereal Daemons</hi> or <hi>Lower Angels</hi> which have the nearest entercourse with men; and last of all the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Deified men,</hi> whom some extraordinary <hi>excellency</hi> hath advanced above the condition of other souls: and according to the <hi>worship</hi> we give to the <hi>Beings represented,</hi> we give worship to the <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>representations.</hi> And if you allow the <hi>distinctions</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> into <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>subordinate,</hi> into <hi>absolute</hi> and <hi>relative,</hi> what harm is there in all that we do? Indeed, if it be <hi>unlawful</hi> to worship <hi>God</hi> by any

                           <hi>Image</hi>; if it be <hi>unlawful</hi> to give any <hi>divine worship</hi> to any <hi>Creature</hi>; we are then to blame, and are <hi>justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</hi> otherwise we think we stand upon equal terms, with those who make use of the same <hi>distinctions,</hi> and only change the names of some, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of others.</q> Thus <hi>T.

                     <p>
                        <q>Very well; then I have them right; they were <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Centaures, Tritons, Sphinxes, Chimera</hi>'s; but he doth not speak against such <hi>Images,</hi> but the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations of living and real Beings, <hi>as men, or beasts,</hi> &amp;c. which are no <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi>'s.

                     <p>I had thought I had said enough in my former <hi>Discourse,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Â§. 15.</note> to make it appear, <hi>That the Wiser Heathens did not look on their Images as Gods, but as Symbols and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations of that Being to which they did give Divine Worship:</hi> For I shewed that <hi>Celsus</hi> said, <hi>none but Fools think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of them:</hi> that <hi>Porphyrie and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in</hi> Athanasius <hi>said they were only Books for the Ignorant: that in</hi> Arnobius <hi>thy denied that they ever thought their Images to be Gods, or to have any Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them, but what only comes from their consecration to such an Use; and in S.</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustin, <hi>that they worshipped not the Images themselves, but through them they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Deity; that</hi> Maximus Tyrius <hi>at large proves, that Images were but signs of Divine honour, and helps to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: that</hi> Julian saith, <hi>they do not

think their Images to be Gods, but that through them they may worship the Deity; and that</hi> Eusebius <hi>in general testifies of the Heathens, that they did not look on their Images as Gods.</hi> All this put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether I thought had signified something to the proving that the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> did not lie <hi>in taking their Images to be Gods:</hi> and so it seems it did. For <hi>T. G.</hi> runs quite off from the business,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 100.</note> saying, <hi>That all these quotations do only prove</hi> (what I brought them for) <hi>that they did not look on their Images as Gods; but</hi> he saith, <hi>it appears from some of them that they looked on them nevertheless as Images or Symbols of false Gods.</hi> And did not I say, that I would prove by them, that they looked on them as <hi>Symbols or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations</hi> of <hi>that Being to which they gave Divine worship?</hi> I never said or thought, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> looked on all their <hi>Images</hi> as <hi>representations of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God;</hi> For I very well considered that they worshipped <hi>inferiour Gods</hi> by <hi>Images</hi> made for them. And therefore after the producing these <hi>Testimonies</hi> I state the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion thus, <hi>I desire to know whether these men, who worshipped Images upon those grounds did amiss or no in it?

<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59802:250"/>
of their Worship, but on supposition they were not, whether they were to blame in the manner of serving God by Images in such a way as they describe?</hi> And to this <hi>T.

                        <hi>and then bids the Reader learn what credit he is to give hereafter to my citing of Authors; and at the same time receive a farther Testimony of his kindness to me in taking the rest upon my word.</hi> Very artificially done, I confess, to pass those by to which no answer was to be returned, and to spend some Pages in most disingenuous cavils about the two <hi>Testimonies</hi> he insists upon. I desire only the Reader to consider, what I was proving, <hi>viz. That the Heathens did not take their Images themselves for Gods,</hi> which he yet asserts several times in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> after I had produced these <hi>Testimonies</hi> expresly to the <hi>contrary.</hi> Had it not become him either to have answered these <hi>Testimonies,</hi> or not to have asserted
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59802:250"/>
that, which these Testimonies most fully and clearly denied? <hi>But he is content to take them upon my word</hi>; I thank him for his kindness in it. But doth he take them as <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false?</hi> If as <hi>true,</hi> then the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> did not worship their <hi>Images as Gods,</hi> which he yet saith, <hi>they did</hi>: if he took them as <hi>false</hi> when I quoted them as <hi>true,</hi> the <hi>kindness</hi> was very extraordinary, and ought to be acknowledged. If he had produced the Testimonies of <hi>Bellarmin, Vasquez, Suarez, Valentia,</hi> and others, to shew <hi>that the Papists do not take their Images for Gods,</hi> and I should say, I <hi>took the Testimonies upon his word,</hi> and yet asserted the direct contrary to them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out so much as the least answering to what they said, would not any indifferent Reader account me either impudent or ridiculous?</p>
                     <p>Yet this is exactly the case of <hi>T. G.</hi> for he saith several times in this <hi>Chapter, that the Heathens did worship their Images as Gods,</hi> whereas those Testimonies say as plainly as words can express it, <hi>that they did not</hi>; and yet <hi>these Testimonies he takes upon my word,</hi> i. e. in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction he believes them <hi>to be true,</hi> and yet the matter contained in them <hi>to be false</hi>: which is an admirable piece of <hi>T. G.</hi>'s <hi>art</hi> and <hi>ingenuity.</hi> But to add
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:59802:251"/>
yet more to his <hi>kindness,</hi> at the same time <hi>he takes these Testimonies on my word,</hi> he will let the Reader see, <hi>what credit he is to give to my citing of Authors.</hi> But why then will he take <hi>any upon my word,</hi> if I have so little <hi>credit</hi> with him? Herein<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> he shews himself either very <hi>weak,</hi> if he will take <hi>my word,</hi> when he thinks I deserve no credit; or very <hi>malicious,</hi> if he knows I <hi>deserve credit,</hi> and yet goes about to <hi>blast it,</hi> as much as in him lyes.</p>
                     <p>But wherein is it, I have exposed my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation so much in the <hi>two Testimonies,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Â§. 16.</note> he hath fastned his <hi>Talons</hi> upon?

To that of translating <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in the <hi>singular number, T. G.</hi> may if he please take it <hi>upon my word</hi> (or if not, let him search the place once more) that I translated these very words of <hi>Arnobius, Nihil Numinis in esse simulachris, that the Images have no Divinity in them,</hi> and if these words be not in that very place, and but two lines before those quoted by him. <hi>Erras &amp; laberis,</hi> &amp;c. I will venture <hi>my credit</hi> in <hi>citing Authors</hi> upon <hi>T.

My design was not to represent by this means that the <hi>Heathens</hi> only intended to <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>true God</hi> by <hi>Images,</hi> but that the worship of <hi>Images</hi> was <hi>unlawful,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men did not take the <hi>Images</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59802:252"/>
                        <hi>for Gods:</hi> so I said in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of those quotations, <hi>that I would prove that the Heathens did look on their Images as Symbols or representations of that Being to which they gave divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> Do I say of the <hi>True God?</hi> Are not the words so general on purpose to imply that, <hi>whatever Being they worshipped,</hi> they looked on the <hi>Images</hi> as <hi>symbols</hi> or <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations</hi> of it? And after, to prevent all such cavils, I purposely added, <hi>I do not ask whether they were mistaken as to the objects of their worship?</hi> But what can a man do to prevent the cavils of a disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Sophister? 3. As to what he saith, <hi>that what they plead in</hi> Arnobius <hi>is only that their Images were not Gods</hi> per se <hi>of themselves, but by virtue of the Spirits dwelling in them,</hi> I answer, <hi>that</hi> T. G. <hi>charges the Heathen Idolaters with worshipping the Images themselves</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 106.</note> and saith, <hi>that I deal very disingenuously in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Wiser Heathens did not worship the Images themselves.</hi> Now what could be more pertinent to my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, than to produce those very words of <hi>Arnobius, You erre and are mistaken</hi> O T. G. <hi>in what you affirm, for we do not think the matter of Brass, Silver and Gold to be Gods or adorable Deities</hi> per se <hi>of themselves.</hi> Whereby we see <hi>T. G</hi>'s own
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:59802:252"/>
words as he renders them out of <hi>Arnobius</hi> do sufficiently vindicate me and contradict him. He saith, <hi>they did worship the Images themselves,</hi> and they say <hi>they did not.</hi> What doth he mean else, when he saith in other places,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T. G. p.</hi> 99.106.</note> that <hi>the Heathens worshipped their Images as Gods;</hi> what is this but to take the <hi>Images themselves for Gods?</hi> For he never once supposes it <hi>unlawful</hi> to worship <hi>Images</hi> on the account of a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit</hi> being <hi>present</hi> in the <hi>Images,</hi> supposing that <hi>spirit</hi> of it self to deserve <hi>adoration:</hi> as suppose upon consecration of an Image of the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> she should manifest <hi>her self</hi> in and by that <hi>Image,</hi> in <hi>speaking,</hi> or <hi>moving,</hi> or <hi>working miracles,</hi> doth <hi>T. G.</hi> think it the more <hi>unlawful</hi> to <hi>worship</hi> such an <hi>Image?</hi> no certainly, but that men ought to shew more <hi>devotion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it. Therefore <hi>T. G.</hi> could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>Heathens</hi> for the worshipping the <hi>Images,</hi> supposing <hi>good Spirits did dwell in them.</hi> Setting aside then, the dispute about the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Spirits,</hi> all that he could imagine the <hi>Fathers</hi> had to condemn in those that worshipped <hi>Images,</hi> was, that they worshipped the <hi>Images themselves for Gods;</hi> which the <hi>Heathens</hi> in <hi>Arnobius</hi> deny, and which was the thing I produced that <hi>Testimony</hi> to prove. <hi>Bellarmin,</hi> whom
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:59802:253"/>
my Adversary follows, saith, <hi>that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did take the Images themselves for Gods,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Bell. de Imag. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 13.</note> for which he gives some very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Reasons. 1. <hi>Because their Priests told them so.</hi> 2. <hi>Because almost all the world believed it.</hi> This one would think were enough to justifie the belief of it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>Authority</hi> of their <hi>Teachers,</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> of <hi>Nations</hi> for it. 3. <hi>The motion, speech, and oracles that came from them.</hi> 4. <hi>The humane shape it self,</hi> which he saith, <hi>is a very</hi> notable argument <hi>to make men think that Images live, because men do; especially,</hi> he saith, <hi>if it be said so by Wise men.</hi> But whatever the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons be, he saith, <hi>he would prove that the Heathens believed</hi> ipsa idola esse Deos, <hi>the very Images themselves to be Gods.</hi> Now what could be more contradictory to this assertion, than those words of the <hi>Heathens</hi> in <hi>Arnobius</hi> are? So that the <hi>Per se</hi> which <hi>T. G.</hi> charges me with leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, adds rather more <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis</hi> to the Testimony. 4. After all this, I say, that <hi>Arnobius</hi> doth reject the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> on such grounds as do hold against the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>true God</hi> by an <hi>Image.</hi> For he brings that as the objection of the <hi>Heathens</hi> against the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that supposing they had never so
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:59802:253"/>
right apprehensions of the nature of those Beings which the Heathens worshipped for Gods, yet they were to blame for not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping their Images,</hi> Nec eorum effigies adoramus, saith <hi>Arnobius</hi> of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,<note place="margin">

Nay, <hi>Arnobius</hi> goes yet farther, <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>what greater honour can we attribute to them, than that we place them there, where the Head and Lord, and King of all is to whom they owe the same acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we do?

                        <hi>that they worshipped the Images them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but they add, that through them they worship the Deity.</hi> After this <hi>T. G.</hi> sets down those words of S. <hi>Austin, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentur sibi purgatiores esse Religionis,</hi> &amp;c. And because in the following expressions, mention is made of the <hi>Corporeal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> or the <hi>Spirits that rule over them as worshipped by their Images,</hi> therefore he charges me with great <hi>disingenuity</hi> in saying, <hi>that the Heathens in S.</hi> Austin <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that through their Images they did worship the Deity:</hi> and yet as it falls out, these are the very words I translated in S. <hi>Austin, Non hoc visibile colo, sed Numen quod illic invisibiliter habitat;</hi> and I now appeal to men of any common ingenuity, what usage I have met with from this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, who passes by the very words I translated, as near to the signification as possible; and produces other passages; and then <hi>Hectors,</hi> and <hi>Triumphs,</hi> and cryes out of my <hi>disingenuity;</hi> when scarce ever any man discovered <hi>greater</hi> than in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and I fear against his own conscience. The true state of the case in S. <hi>Austin</hi>
                        <pb n="480" facs="tcp:59802:256"/>
about the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is this, 1. He exposes the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> in general as a <hi>silly</hi> and <hi>ridiculous thing;</hi> being of things much <hi>inferiour</hi> to the <hi>meanest Brutes;</hi> and if men are ashamed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>Beasts,</hi> that hear and see, and live and move, they ought to be much more ashamed to worship a <hi>dumb, stupid, sensless Image</hi>; and they might with greater reason wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the <hi>Mice</hi> and <hi>Serpents</hi> which are not afraid of their <hi>Images,</hi> but shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within them. Now it is plain this discourse of S. <hi>Austin</hi> doth reach to all sorts of Images for whomsoever they are intended. For an Image made for the true God hath no more <hi>sense,</hi> or <hi>life,</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> in it, than one of <hi>T. G</hi>'s <hi>Idols,</hi> or an <hi>Image</hi> made for a <hi>Chimera.</hi> But because the Christian Church knew nothing at that time of the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> therefore he directs his discourse against the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to consider the pleas and excuses they made for it. 2. He reckons up their several <hi>pleas</hi> for their <hi>Images</hi>; 1. Some said that there was a <hi>secret Deity which lay hid in the Image, and which they worshipped through it.</hi> 2. Others, <hi>that thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of a more refined Religion,</hi> said, <hi>they neither worshipped Images, nor Daemons, but only beheld in the corporeal Image, the
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:59802:256"/>
Symbol of that which they ought to worship.</hi> Which is the place cited by <hi>T. G.</hi> Now I appeal to the Reader, whether this very place doth not prove what I intended, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Heathens</hi> did look on their <hi>Images</hi> as <hi>Symbols</hi> or representations of that <hi>Being</hi> to which they gave <hi>divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi> Whereby I see <hi>T.

from the <hi>Images of Christ</hi> because I did not in the account of the thing; (for I designed no verbal <hi>translation,</hi> as <hi>T.

interpreted to another sense, he would have made <hi>little or no conscience</hi> of saying, those were the words I translated thus and thus. But instead of debating the matter of fact as to the Primitive Church, he saith, <hi>he will give me the answer of</hi> Mr. <hi>Thorndike, that at that time there might be jealousie of Offence in having Images in Churches, before Idolatry was quite rooted out, of which afterwards there might be no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; and therefore they were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards admitted all over, for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, the Church is tyed no farther, than there can appear danger of Idolatry.</hi> This, he calls Mr. <hi>Thorndikes</hi> answer, but it is truly the answer of <hi>Petavius,</hi> from whose words it seems to be translated; <hi>dum periculum erat,</hi> saith <hi>Petavius, ne of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensionis aliquid traheret externa quorun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam rituum species, cum iis que ab Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicis celebrabantur, similitudine ipsa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruens, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore I shall consider it as the answer of <hi>Petavius,</hi> and here exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether this were the ground on which the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did forbear the <hi>use</hi> and <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images?</hi> I shall prove that it was not from these two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. 1. Because the <hi>Reasons</hi> given by them against the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> will equally hold against the worship of <hi>Images</hi>
                        <pb n="490" facs="tcp:59802:261"/>
among <hi>Christians.</hi> 2. Because the <hi>notion</hi> of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which they charged the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> with, may be common to <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> with them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. This supposes the <hi>Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> to look on the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> as in it self indifferent, and to be made good or evil according to the <hi>nature</hi> of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject represented by them: which is a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position as remote from the sense of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> as any thing we can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily imagine. For then all the arguments used by them against the worship of <hi>Images</hi> must have been deduced only from the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> represented, or the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> given to them; whereas they frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argue from the unsuitableness of <hi>Images</hi> as a <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> and the <hi>prohibition</hi> of the <hi>Divine Law.</hi> Would any man of common sense that had thought the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> in it self <hi>indifferent,</hi> have said as <hi>Origen</hi> doth;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that the Christians as well as the Iews abstain from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Images for the sake of the Law of God, which requires rather that we should dye than defile our selves with such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties? Yes,</hi> it may be said, <hi>this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the Law of God did forbid the worship of the Heathen Images</hi>; but they who make this answer never looked

into <hi>Origen,</hi> or have forgotten what they read there; for <hi>Origen</hi> doth not there give an account why the <hi>Christians</hi> did not comply with the <hi>Heathen Idolatry;</hi> but why the <hi>Christians</hi> had no <hi>Images</hi> in their own <hi>worship.</hi> For <hi>Celsus</hi> charges this upon <hi>the Christians, that they thought it such a mighty matter, that they had no Images, whereas herein,</hi> saith he, <hi>they were but like the barbarous Scythians, Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and Seres, and other Nations that had neither Religion, nor civility.</hi> To this <hi>Origen</hi> answers, <hi>that we are not only to look at the bare action, but at the reason and ground of it, for those that agree in the same thing, may yet have very different principles; and they that do it on a good principle do well, and not otherwise; as for instance, the Stoicks forbear adultery, and so may the Epicureans; but the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer do it, because it is a thing repugnant to Nature, and civil Society; the latter, because allowing themselves this single pleasure may debar them of many more: so,</hi> saith he, <hi>in this matter those barbarous Nations forbear Images on other accounts than Iews and Christians do, who dare not make use of this way of worshipping God.</hi> Observe, that he doth not say this of the way of worshipping <hi>false Gods,</hi> or <hi>Images

                        <hi>the Deity.</hi> And he gives three principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons wherein they differed from those Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. Because this way of worship did disparage the <hi>Deity</hi>; (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
                        </gap> again) by drawing it down to matter so fashioned. 2. Because <hi>the evil spirits</hi> were apt to harbour in those <hi>Images,</hi> and to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in the sacrifices there offered: which reason as far as it respects the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> doth relate to the <hi>Heathen Images,</hi> standing over the <hi>Altars</hi> at which the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> were offered. But then <hi>Celsus</hi> might say, <hi>what is all this to the purpose? my question is, why you have no Images in your own way of worship</hi>; therefore he adds his third reason, which made it utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for <hi>Christians</hi> as well as <hi>Iews</hi> to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them, which is <hi>the Law of God</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before: now I say, if <hi>Origen</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered pertinently, he must give this as the <hi>Reason</hi> why <hi>Christians</hi> used no <hi>Images</hi> in their own <hi>way</hi> of <hi>worship</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was so far from thinking the <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> indifferent, that he thought <hi>Christians</hi> ought rather to suffer <hi>Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> than to worship them. But to put this beyond possibility of contradiction; <hi>Origen</hi> mentions a saying of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> objected by <hi>Celsus, that it is a foolish thing
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:59802:262"/>
to pray to Images, unless a man know the Gods and Heroes worshipped by them</hi>; which saying <hi>Celsus</hi> approves, and saith, <hi>the Christians were Fools, because they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly contemned Images,</hi> (<hi>in totum,</hi> the Latin interpreter renders it) To which <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> thus answers, <hi>we acknowledge that God may be known, and his only Son, and those whom he hath honoured with the Title of Gods, who partake of his Divinity, and are different from the Heathen Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Scripture calls Devils</hi> (i.e. <hi>causally</hi> if not <hi>essentially,</hi> as <hi>Cajetan</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth) <hi>but,</hi> saith he, <hi>it is impossible for him that knows God to worship Images.</hi> Mark that, he doth not say, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him that knows the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathens</hi> to worship them; or the <hi>evil spirits</hi> that lurk in their Images: but for him, <hi>that knows the true God,</hi> and <hi>his Son Christ Iesus,</hi> and the <hi>holy Angels</hi> to do it. Is it possible after this, to believe that <hi>Origen</hi> supposed the worship of <hi>Images</hi> to be indifferent in it <hi>self,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> might be lawfully wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by them? Was all this only <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculum offensionis, jealousie of offence,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> was rooted out? Which supposition makes the <hi>primitive Christians</hi> in plain terms <hi>jugglers</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors,</hi>
                        <pb n="494" facs="tcp:59802:263"/>
to pretend that to be <hi>utterly unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> even for <hi>themselves</hi> to do; and to mean no more by it, but this; <hi>yes, it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do it, while there is any danger of Heathenism, but when once that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, then we may worship Images as well as the best of them.</hi> For my part, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the <hi>primitive Christians</hi> to have been men of so much <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>integrity,</hi> that they would never have talked at this rate against the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> (as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Origen,</hi> but the rest of them, the best, and wisest among them did, as I have shewed in the foregoing Chapter) if they had this secret reserve in their minds, that when <hi>Heathenism</hi> was sunk past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, then they might do the same things, which they utterly condemned now. Which would be just like some that we have heard of, who while there was any likelyhood of the <hi>Royal Authority</hi> of this Nation recovering itself, then they cry'd out upon <hi>Kingly Government</hi> as <hi>ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, Tyrannical</hi> and <hi>Antichristian</hi>; but when the <hi>King</hi> was <hi>murdered,</hi> and the power came into their own hands, then it was lawful for the <hi>Saints</hi> to exercise that power, which was not fit to be enjoyed by the <hi>Wicked</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> So these men make the most excellent Christians to be
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59802:263"/>
like a pack of <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> every where asked them, as may be seen in <hi>Lactantius, Arnobius, Minucius</hi> and others, as well as <hi>Origen; what is the matter with you Christians, that you have no Images in your Churches? what if you dare not joyn with us in our worship, why do not you make use of them in your own? Is it only humour, singularity, and affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Novelty in You? If it be, you shew what manner of men you are.</hi> No truly; say they, gravely and seriously, we do it not, because <hi>we dare not do it;</hi> for we are afraid of <hi>displeasing</hi> and <hi>dishonouring God</hi> by it, and we will on that account rather choose to <hi>dye</hi> than do it. Upon such an answer, the Heathens might think them honest and simple men, that did not know what to do with their lives, who were so willing to part with them on such easie terms. But if they had heard, the bottom of all this was, only a <hi>cunning</hi> and <hi>sly trick</hi> to undermine <hi>Paganism,</hi> and that they meant no such thing, as though it were <hi>unlawful in it self,</hi> but only <hi>unlawful</hi> till they had gotten the better of them; what would they have thought of such men? no otherwise, than that they were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of base <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> that pretended one thing and meant another; and that the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:59802:264"/>
                        <hi>Wicked</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> might not <hi>worship Images,</hi> but the <hi>Saints</hi> might, when they had the <hi>Power</hi> in their hands, although before they declaimed against it, as the most <hi>vile, mean,</hi> and <hi>unworthy way</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> that ever came into the heads of men; that there could be <hi>no Religion, where it obtained</hi>; that it was worse than the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Beasts;</hi> that it was more reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to worship the <hi>artificers</hi> themselves than the <hi>Images</hi> made by them; that <hi>rats</hi> and <hi>mice</hi> had less folly than mankind, for they had no fears of what men fell down before, with trembling and great shews of devotion. These, and many such things as these, the <hi>Fathers</hi> speak freely, openly, frequently, on all occasions, in all places against the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images;</hi> and after all this, was no more meant by it but only this, <hi>Thou O Heathen must not worship Images, but I may?</hi> And why not as well (might the <hi>Heathen</hi> reply) <hi>Thou must not commit adultery, but I may? Does the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the commands you boast so much of alter with mens persons? Is that indeed lawful for you that is not for us? Where doth the Law of</hi> Moses <hi>say,</hi> Thou shalt not worship the <hi>Images</hi> that <hi>we worship,</hi> but thou maist worship the <hi>Images</hi> that <hi>Christians</hi> worship? <hi>And if the Law
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:59802:264"/>
makes no difference, either leave off your foolish babbling against our Images, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn your own. For to our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yours are as much against the Law as ours are.</hi>

                     <p>And so the <hi>primitive Christians</hi> thought, who very <hi>honestly</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> declared as much in their words and actions;<note place="margin">Â§. 2.</note> witness not only the opinions of all the <hi>Writers</hi> in behalf of <hi>Christianity,</hi> (not one excepted) that ever had occasion to mention this matter; but the <hi>Decree</hi> of as good a <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> as was to be had at that time; I mean the <hi>Eliberitan,</hi> in the famous <hi>Canon</hi> to that purpose, Can. 36. <hi>It pleaseth us to have no pictures in Churches, lest that which is worshipped be painted upon walls.</hi> It is a pleasant thing to see what work our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries</hi> make with this innocent <hi>Canon</hi>; sometimes, <hi>it is a meer forgery of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> (I wonder such men do not say the same of the second Commandment) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the <hi>Bishops that met there were not so wise as they should have been</hi>; (no nor <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> nor <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>primitive Christians</hi> in this matter) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>that they spake only against pictures upon walls</hi> (because the <hi>Salt-Peter</hi> of the <hi>walls</hi> would be apt to deface them; or

                        <hi>because in case of persecution,</hi> they could not do as <hi>Rachel did,</hi> carry their <hi>Teraphim</hi> along with them); but that which <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> sticks to,<note place="margin">

You say, <hi>you will have no Images in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: why so I beseech you?</hi> Lest that, say they, which is worshipped be painted upon walls: <hi>worshipped by whom? do you mean by Heathens?</hi> no, we speak of the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Christians. But why may not that which is worshipped be painted?</hi> We think that reason enough to any man, that considers <hi>the Being worshipped, and that which is painted,</hi> and the mighty disparagement to an infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Being to be drawn in lines and colours with a design to <hi>honour</hi> him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:59802:265"/>
This to me seems a <hi>reason</hi> that holds equally at all times. For was the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worshipped</hi> more unfit to be <hi>drawn</hi> so soon after <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> than he would be afterwards? methinks it had been much better done then, while the skilful <hi>Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> were living. <hi>But those were Heathen Idolaters;</hi> suppose they were, you must make <hi>use</hi> of them, or none, if that which <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others say, hold true, <hi>that it is forbidden to Christians to make Images</hi>; which surely they would never have said, if they had thought the time would come, when the <hi>Heathen Idolatry</hi> should be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and then the <hi>Christians</hi> might wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship Images. <hi>Well; but all this is only against Pictures upon walls, but for all that,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmin,</hi>

                        <hi>they might have Images in Frames, or upon Veils.</hi> It seems then that which is <hi>adored, might be painted well enough, provided it be not upon a wall</hi>; but methinks, it is more repugnant to an <hi>infinite Being</hi> to be <hi>confined</hi> within a <hi>Frame,</hi> than to be <hi>drawn upon a wall:</hi> and the <hi>Decree</hi> is, <hi>to have no pictures in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>; but if they were in <hi>Frames,</hi> or upon <hi>Veils,</hi> would they not be in <hi>Churches</hi> still?

But S. <hi>Paul</hi> supposes that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians continuing so might be <hi>Idolaters,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:59802:269"/>
Neither be ye Idolaters as were some of them.</hi>

                        <hi>and did all eat the same spiritual meat, and drink the same spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al drink (for they drank of that rock that followed them, and that Rock was Christ.</hi>) Which <hi>water</hi> they drank of, both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> their <hi>Idolatry</hi> (and since the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> followed them,) at the very <hi>time</hi> of <hi>committing</hi> it; so that those persons are said to be <hi>partakers of Christ,</hi> who were charged with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> is far from supposing that <hi>Idolatry</hi> and the profession of <hi>Christianity</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with each other. But it is said <hi>that there can be no Idolatry to the Images of Christ, because the true object of worship is honoured by them; nor to the Images of Saints, so long as men take them for Saints, that is, Gods Creatures; and give only an inferiour worship to them.</hi> If this be true, there appears to be little danger of <hi>Idolatry</hi> among those who do not renounce Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. But against this plea I put in these exceptions.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That upon the same grounds all the Wiser <hi>Heathens</hi> must be cleared from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> For, 1. They owned the true <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Divine worship,</hi> viz. <hi>One Supreme God,</hi> as I
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:59802:269"/>
have at large proved in the former Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: both, those that went on the <hi>Platonick hypothesis</hi> of one <hi>Supreme Deity,</hi> and <hi>others inferiour</hi>; and those who believed <hi>one God to be worshipped under different representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The former was the principle which <hi>Iulian</hi> went upon, and the latter <hi>Platonists,</hi> who opposed Christianity to the utmost: the other was the principle of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and others; and particularly owned by <hi>Maximus Madaurensis,</hi> who saith,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that the Heathens did worship one God under several names, thereby to express his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral powers diffused through the World.</hi> Now upon this supposition, that where there is a <hi>true object</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> represented, there can be no <hi>Idolatry</hi> in <hi>worshipping</hi> the <hi>representation,</hi> I challenge any man to shew how the <hi>Heathens</hi> that went on these principles were <hi>chargeable</hi> with <hi>Idolatry.</hi> For is <hi>Christ</hi> any otherwise a <hi>right object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> than as he is believed to be the <hi>True God?</hi> if then there can be no <hi>Idolatry</hi> towards an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> neither can there be towards any <hi>representation</hi> of the <hi>True God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Heathens</hi> did assert the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Creatures,</hi> as I have already proved, that they looked on their <hi>inferiour Deities,</hi> as <hi>dependent</hi> on

Plato,</hi> he tells us, <hi>made it the office of good Daemons to carry mens Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to the Gods, and to bring from them Oracles, and other Divine Gifts: and so their worship must be suitable to their imployment, which is inferiour to that of the Coelestial Deities, whose station and

                        <hi>and he may be painted, therefore the Image of God may be too; for that which is the Image of the Image is likewise the Image of the Exemplar, those which agree in a third agreeing among themselves.</hi> To this some answer'd that man was not the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as to his <hi>body,</hi> but as to his <hi>soul</hi> which <hi>could not be painted</hi>; but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> takes off this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, by saying, <hi>that then a man could not not be painted, for he is not a man in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his outward lineaments; but in regard of his substance, and especially his Soul; but notwithstanding the soul cannot
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:59802:299"/>
be painted, yet a man may truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be painted, because the Figure and colours of an Image do repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the whole man; otherwise,</hi> saith he, <hi>a thing painted could never seem to be the true Thing, as</hi> Zeuxis <hi>his grapes did which deceived the birds.</hi> Therefore according to <hi>Bellarmines</hi> reasoning, that which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents a Being according to <hi>outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,</hi> although it have an <hi>invisible Nature</hi>; yet is a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and represents it <hi>as it is in it self</hi>; and as far as it is possible for an <hi>Image</hi> to <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> any thing. Wherein then lyes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between making the <hi>Picture</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> and the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi>? If it be said, <hi>that the Image of God is very short, imperfect, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure</hi>; is not the same thing to be said of the <hi>Picture</hi> of a <hi>man,</hi> which can only represent his outward Features without any descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his inward <hi>substance</hi> or <hi>soul</hi>? If it be farther said, <hi>that there is a real resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance between a Picture of a man, and his outward lineaments, but there is none, between God and the Image of a man</hi>; then I ask, what <hi>Bellarmins</hi> argument doth signifie towards the proving the <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of making an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> For if <hi>God</hi> may be <hi>painted</hi> because man may, who is the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; (for the <hi>Image</hi>
                        <pb n="568" facs="tcp:59802:300"/>
of the <hi>Image</hi> is the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar;)</hi> then it follows that <hi>Man</hi> is the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as <hi>he may be painted,</hi> and so <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> must <hi>agree</hi> in that common thing which is a <hi>capacity of being represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> which cannot be supposed without as <hi>real</hi> a <hi>resemblance</hi> between <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Image,</hi> as between a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Picture.</hi>

                     <p>If it be said, as it is by <hi>Ysambertus,</hi>

                        <hi>that these are not properly Images of God, but of his appearance in a visible form</hi>; I answer, (1.) This doth not mend the matter, for we are speaking of an <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Father</hi> as a <hi>Person</hi> in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> and whatever represents him as such must represent him as <hi>he is in himself,</hi> and not barely in regard of a temporary <hi>appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi>; and as to such an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father, T. G</hi>'s distinction will by no means reach. (2.) It is the common
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:59802:302"/>
opinion of the <hi>Divines</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> that all the <hi>appearances</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>old Testament</hi> were not of <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but of <hi>Angels</hi> in his stead. And <hi>Clichtovaeus</hi> gives that as a <hi>Reason</hi> why all <hi>representations</hi> of <hi>God</hi> were unlawful in the old Testament;<note place="margin">

                        <hi>because all appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were by Angels,</hi> and those <hi>Angels were no more united to the Forms they assumed, than a mans body is to his Garments:</hi> from whence it must follow that all representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>God</hi> by such <hi>appearances</hi> is still unlawful. (3.) Suppose this be a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> only of some <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and so not of what <hi>God is,</hi> but of <hi>what he did,</hi> I ask then on what account such an effect of <hi>divine power</hi> is made the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Divine adoration?</hi> For we have seen already by the confession of their most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Divines,</hi> that the <hi>Images</hi> of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> are proposed among them <hi>as objects of adoration;</hi> now say I, how comes a meer <hi>creature,</hi> such as that <hi>apparition</hi> was, to become the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Divine worship? Durandus</hi> well saw the consequence of this assertion; for when he had said, <hi>that those corporeal Forms which are painted are no representations of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which never assumed them,</hi> but only <hi>of those very Forms themselves in which
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:59802:303"/>
he appeared; therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>no more reverence is due to them than is due to the Forms themselves.</hi> When <hi>God</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the <hi>burning bush,</hi> that <hi>Fire</hi> was then an effect of <hi>Divine Power,</hi> and deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>it self</hi>; how then can the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>burning bush,</hi> be an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>Divine worship?</hi> If <hi>God</hi> did appear to <hi>Daniel</hi> as the <hi>Ancient of dayes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 7.9.</note> it must be either by the <hi>impression</hi> of such an <hi>Idea</hi> upon his <hi>Imagination,</hi> or by <hi>assuming</hi> the <hi>Form</hi> of an <hi>old man</hi>; but either way this was but a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> and had no such personal <hi>Union</hi> to the <hi>Godhead</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>adoration</hi>; how much less then doth the <hi>Image</hi> of this <hi>Appearance</hi> deserve it? So that I cannot see how upon their own <hi>principles</hi> they can be excused from <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> who give proper <hi>Divine worship</hi> to such <hi>Images</hi> as these. <hi>He commits Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,</hi> saith <hi>Sanders,</hi>

<pb n="575" facs="tcp:59802:303"/>
and distinctions, we find that as to this matter of the <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is not only gone off from <hi>Scripture, Reason,</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but from the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the second <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> too.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I now come to the <hi>additions</hi> that have been made to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as to the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> given to <hi>Images.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Â§. 9.</note> For which I must consider,</p>

                     <p n="2">2. What <hi>additions</hi> have been made to it since that time?</p>
                     <p n="1">1. What that <hi>worship</hi> was which the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> did give to <hi>Images?</hi> which will appear by these two things. 1. That it defined <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real worship</hi> to be given to <hi>Images.</hi> 2. That it was an <hi>inferiour worship,</hi> and not <hi>Latria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it defined <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real worship</hi> to be given to <hi>Images; i. e.</hi> that <hi>Images</hi> were not only to be <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>helps</hi> to <hi>memory,</hi> to call to mind or represent to us the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship</hi>; but that the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> were to be performed to the <hi>Images</hi> themselves. The former <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> doth suppose them to be only of
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:59802:304"/>
the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Books,</hi> which represent things to our minds without any act of <hi>adoration</hi> performed to that which is only an <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>intellection</hi>; although the thing represented to the mind be a <hi>proper object</hi> of <hi>adoration.</hi> As, if by reading a <hi>Book</hi> an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is represented to my mind whom I ought to worship, yet no man can imagine that from hence I should fall down upon my knees out of <hi>honour</hi> to the <hi>Book,</hi> or with a <hi>design</hi> to worship it. When a man reads his <hi>prayers</hi> out of a <hi>Book,</hi> and makes use of that only as a <hi>means</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument</hi> to help his understanding, and direct his expressions; no man can have any colour of <hi>Reason</hi> to say that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships the <hi>Book,</hi> which he uses for a quite different purpose. It is the same case as to <hi>Images,</hi> when they are used for no other end but barely to represent to the mind an object of worship; as a <hi>Crucifix</hi> may do our <hi>Saviour;</hi> then it is no more than an external <hi>Note</hi> or <hi>Character,</hi> and hath the same use that <hi>words</hi> have. But those who go no farther than thus, stand condemned and Anathematized by the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi>

                        <hi>Those who say that Images are to be had only for memory and not for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or salutation, are half-wicked, and partly true and partly false, they are so far right as they are for Images, but they are in the wrong as they are against the worship of them. O the folly of these men!</hi> saith <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> But this is not all, for as it was not sufficient to have <hi>Images</hi> for helps to <hi>memory,</hi> so neither was it to give them some kind of <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>reverence</hi>; nothing but <hi>worship</hi> would satisfie them. So the <hi>Patriarch Tarasius,</hi> saith in plain terms, <hi>they who pretend to honour Images,</hi>

                        <hi>and not to worship them, are guilty of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, and self-contradiction. For wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> saith he, <hi>is a Symbol and signification of Honour, therefore they who deny to worship them, do dishonour them.</hi> This was the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal</hi> way of arguing in this famous
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:59802:305"/>
Council. And this he proves from the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Anastasius Bishop</hi> of <hi>Theopolis, Let no man be offended with the name of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or worship, for we worship men and Angels, but do not serve them, and worship is an expression of Honour.</hi> And it would do one good at heart, to see how all the <hi>Reverend Fathers</hi> clap their hands for joy at the subtle <hi>Criticism</hi> which it seems that <hi>Bishop</hi> had discovered, viz. <hi>that when our saviour said, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him Only shalt thou serve, that Only was not applyed to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship but to Service. Mark that,</hi> cryes the <hi>Council, Only belongs to Service, and not to worship, therefore although we may not serve Images, yet we may Worship them.</hi> If the <hi>Devil</hi> had been so subtle, might not he have said to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mark that, you are forbidden <hi>Only to Serve any else but God,</hi> but you may <hi>Worship me,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that command? The <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch Tarasius</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Irene</hi> expresses this <hi>worship</hi> by the very same <hi>word</hi> which is used to <hi>God</hi>; for, <hi>when God saith, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,</hi>

                     <p>It will contribute much to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the <hi>State</hi> of this <hi>Controversie,</hi> to shew a little more particularly, what the opinion of these men was, and how it is condemned by the rest as <hi>savouring of Heresie,</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church. Durandus</hi> goes upon these grounds, 1. That worship properly belongs to him in whom the <hi>cause</hi> of that <hi>worship</hi> is, and by <hi>accident</hi> may be given to that which hath only a <hi>relation</hi> to that which is the <hi>cause.</hi> 2. In him to whom proper wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is given we are to consider both the <hi>Person</hi> to whom it is given, and the <hi>Cause</hi> for which; worship is only properly given to the <hi>Person,</hi> and not to any <hi>part</hi> of him; the <hi>Cause</hi> is that from whence the <hi>excellency</hi> of the Person arises. 3. That <hi>Supreme worship</hi> or <hi>Latria</hi> is due only to <hi>God</hi> for it self, by reason of his <hi>Deity,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>cause</hi> of this honour is only in God; but by <hi>accident</hi> the honour of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi> may belong to other things; Now, saith he, a thing may have relation to <hi>God</hi>
                        <pb n="584" facs="tcp:59802:308"/>
two waies, 1. When it goes to make up the <hi>same Person,</hi> as the <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>Christ.</hi> 2. When it hath only an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal relation</hi> to Him, as <hi>Christs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or His <hi>Image.</hi> 4. That the <hi>humane nature</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> hath only by <hi>accident</hi> the <hi>honour</hi> of <hi>Latria</hi> given to it, as being <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>Person</hi> who is worshipped, who is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; but the <hi>Humanity</hi> it self is not properly that which is <hi>worshipped,</hi> nor is the <hi>Cause</hi> or <hi>reason</hi> of that worship, but only of an inferiour. 5. Of those things which have only an <hi>extrinsecal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> this is to be held in general; that either they deserve <hi>no worship at all of themselves,</hi> as the <hi>Cross,</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> or other inanimate things: or if they do, as the <hi>B. Virgin,</hi> it is an <hi>inferiour worship;</hi> of the first he determines that no <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> doth belong to <hi>them,</hi> no not to the <hi>Cross</hi> it self, upon the account of any <hi>excellency,</hi>

<pb n="585" facs="tcp:59802:308"/>

That although the conception of the mind be of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented upon <hi>sight</hi> of an <hi>Image</hi>; there is still a <hi>real difference</hi> in the thing, and in the conception, between the <hi>Image</hi> and the <hi>thing represented</hi>; and therefore properly speaking the <hi>same worship</hi> is never due to the <hi>Image</hi> that is to the <hi>object</hi> represented by it. <hi>But,</hi> saith he, <hi>because we must speak as the most do, the Image may be said to be worshipped with the same wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the thing represented, because at the presence of the Image we worship the object represented by it as if he were actually present.</hi>

<pb n="586" facs="tcp:59802:309"/>
it is a contradiction to say, that Latria is due only to God, and yet that it is due to the Image of Christ, and to Christ. 2. Then the same worship would be due to Christ and to a Stone, or to Christ and to a creature. 3. He that gives to any thing the worship of Latria, confesseth that to be God; therefore a man may as lawfully say the Image is God, as that it may be worshipped with Latria; and consequently that something which is not God is God.

But,</hi> he adds, <hi>if Images were only to be worshipped abusively and improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the worship of them was rather sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:59802:310"/>
to be denied than affirmed; for an improper and abusive worship is no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship at all; and they were not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for Hereticks, who allow the use of Images for memory, and only deny their worship.</hi> To which he subjoyns this Reason, <hi>either the Image truly and in it self, is at least the material object of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, total, or partial, or it is not; if it be, the thing is granted; if not, then in plain terms, the Image is not worshipped. For it is neither the formal nor the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial object of worship; but only the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or sign exciting men to worship the thing represented. And according to this opinion, the Hereticks would speak more properly than the Catholicks. For he that at the sight of a beautiful creature is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to praise or love the Creator, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to praise or love the creature, although the presence of the Creature did raise that devotion. Therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council did condemn this opinion, when it condemned those who said that Images did only serve for memory, which in truth is all the use that opinion allows them; and when the</hi> Nicene <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil declares the worship given to Images not to be Latria; for if no more worship be allowed, but only worshipping the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:59802:310"/>
in presence of the Image, then the most perfect Latria may be given to Christ before the Image; and consequently the worship in that abusive and improper sense may be Latria, which the Council denies: and farther the same Council saith, that not only the exemplar may be worshipped in the Image, but that the Image is to be worshipped for the sake of the exemplar, by which it determines the Image to be the object of worship, although the Reason of it be the thing represented.</hi> (3.) <hi>Suarez.</hi> saith, <hi>That not only the external acts of adoration are to be performed towards Images, but the very intention of worship to be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towards them: For even</hi> Durandus <hi>himself did allow the external acts to be done towards them, and because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward intention he said was directed to the exemplar, therefore he said the Images were only said abusively to be worshipped.</hi> For which <hi>assertion Suarez</hi> gives these reasons, (1.) <hi>The external act without the intention of the mind is no proper worship, but only counterfeit. And</hi> Leon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, <hi>quoted in the Council of</hi> Nice, <hi>saith, In all worship the inward intention is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi> (2.) <hi>From many passages in that Council, implying that the intention
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:59802:311"/>
of worship ought to be about the Images, because they are said to deserve worship, and from the sayings of</hi> Epiphanius, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silius, Adrianus, Tarasius <hi>there extant, and</hi> Elias Cretensis, <hi>who saith he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly worship them, which could not be without the inward intention. And from the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>which calls it due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worship; but it cannot be any true honour without the inward intention.</hi> (3.) <hi>To perform the external acts of worship before an Image, is either to worship it, or not: if it be, then the inward intention is granted; but since there may be a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between the intention of worship, and the intention of performing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of worship; in order to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it is not only necessary to perform the material acts, but to do them with the intention of giving worship by them. Neither is it enough to say,</hi> that there is an inward intention, but the outward acts are towards the Image, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward intention to the exemplar, <hi>For,</hi> saith <hi>Suarez, as true worship doth essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially require the intention of worship, so the worship of this or that particular thing doth require a proportionable intention to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that thing: and the worship of one thing cannot be said to be the worship of
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:59802:311"/>
another thing distinct from it, unless it be some way participated by it; but the Image is a distinct thing from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, therefore the worship of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar cannot be said to be the worship of the Image, unless the Image do partake of the worship, and consequently there must be an intention of giving worship to the Image. This,</hi> saith he, <hi>may be illustrated by an example; If a man kiss the ground out of a meer intention of giving worship to God thereby, he cannot truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to worship the ground about which the material action is conversant, but only God to whom he directed his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. And all this he confirms by more passages out of the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council, which,</hi> he saith, <hi>was not so regardless about the manner and names of worship as</hi> Vasquez <hi>imagined, but took great care to express it self so that true and proper worship be given to Images; which it defines under an Anathema; and although it useth other words, of salutation, honour,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yet it makes these aequivalent to that real wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which it doth expresly require.

to the Image, as to the thing which terminates it; and to the exemplar as the reason of it</hi>; for which, besides the reasons given by others, he gives this, <hi>viz. when there are two things good and lawful, and there is no positive Precept to do them together, then it is lawful to do one without the other: but in the act of worshipping the Image with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, there are two good acts,</hi> viz. <hi>the worship of the Image, and of the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar, and there is no precept of the Church to joyn those together, therefore it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do one without the other.

                        <hi>that the opinion of</hi> Durandus <hi>seems manifestly condemned by all those definitions of Councils which require true worship to be given to Images:</hi> and he produces several passages of the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Synod</hi> to that purpose. <hi>And it signifies nothing to their excuse, that they perform the outward signs of worship to Images; for,</hi> saith he, <hi>since they allow no proper worship to them, the Images do only serve to excite the memory</hi>; which he thus farther confirms. <hi>It is not credible that any hereticks (supposing the object repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to deserve worship) should imagine it lawful to worship that object without an Image, and unlawful to do it when the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of that object is excited upon the view of an Image, upon supposition that no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is intended to be given to the Image thereby. And it is not credible, that if this had been all the Councils had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that they should never think of such an easie way of satisfying dissenters, as the declaring this to have been their sense would have been. But the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie lay in another point,</hi> viz. <hi>that Images
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:59802:315"/>
did not deserve any immediate worship, so as to have any honour done to them, although considered only as the material objects. For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if all the dispute had been only about a condition exciting men to adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it could not have come into mens heads to have said, that because Images were dead and inanimate things, they could not be a meer Physical condition of adoration; which is all that</hi> Durandus <hi>allows them. Is any man so sensless to say, that because words are inanimate things, therefore they ought not to be excited to the worship of God at the hearing of them? and the case is the same of the representation made by the eye or by the ear. But when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the lawfulness of the worship of them, they spake of true and real worship which is immediately carried to the Images themselves, and for this they made use of an argument which hath an appearance of Truth,</hi> viz. <hi>that Images being dead things have no excellency to deserve any real wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship from us. From whence it follows, that when the Fathers condemned these he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks; they did not determine that they might be used as a condition of worship; but that true and real worship was to be given to them.</hi>

                        <pb n="601" facs="tcp:59802:316"/>
yet such things may have a <hi>relation</hi> to matters of so high a nature as to deserve a different <hi>usage</hi> and <hi>regard</hi> from other things; as the <hi>Vessels</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Chalices</hi> are not to be used for common <hi>drinking</hi>; which <hi>peculiarity</hi> of the <hi>use</hi> of such things is that <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>honour</hi> which belongs to them on the account of their being dedicated to sacred purposes. So S. <hi>Augustin</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug. in Ps.</hi> 113. <hi>conc.</hi> 2.</note> of the <hi>sacred Vessels, that they are consecrated and do become holy by their Use, being separated from common service and devoted to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of holy things</hi>; but he doth plainly distinguish <hi>the respect</hi> shewn to them from the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi>; for a little before he speaks <hi>of such who did worship or pray looking upon an Image, and that those who did so did behave themselves as if they expected to be heard by the Image; but do we pray to the sacred Utensils because we make use of them in our prayers to God?</hi> Little did S. <hi>Austin</hi> think, that <hi>praying looking upon Images</hi> and the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence shewed to sacred Vessels on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their use,</hi> should have been ranked together. <hi>He that prays looking upon an Image,</hi> doth either direct his <hi>adoration</hi> to the <hi>Image,</hi> or to the <hi>Person represented by the Image</hi> as if he were <hi>actually present,</hi>
                        <pb n="602" facs="tcp:59802:317"/>
and this is the true <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi>; but no man can pretend this as to the <hi>Reverence</hi> of <hi>Holy things,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all their <hi>holiness</hi> consists in a bare <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal denomination,</hi> which affords no <hi>reason</hi> for any more than such an <hi>esteem</hi> as belongs to <hi>sacred Things,</hi> and not for any <hi>act</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> to be done to them. They who make the <hi>Images themselves</hi> to be the <hi>material object</hi> or <hi>term</hi> of <hi>adoration,</hi> do yet say that the <hi>formal reason</hi> of that <hi>worship</hi> is to be taken from the <hi>object re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented:</hi> others say, that the <hi>thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,</hi> and <hi>the Image are worshipped with the same act of adoration</hi>; but both sorts do make the <hi>representation</hi> in an <hi>Image</hi> to be the <hi>ground</hi> and <hi>reason</hi> of the <hi>worship</hi> given to it. Why then should those things, which do not <hi>represent</hi> be <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> as those that do? Are not <hi>Images</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the <hi>Definition</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Council to be set up in Churches, and in High wayes,</hi> on purpose for worship? Are they not <hi>formed,</hi> and <hi>set forth</hi> with all advantages to allure men to the <hi>worship</hi> of them? And after all this, is no more meant by their <hi>worship</hi> than by the <hi>Reverence</hi> of <hi>Holy things</hi>; which are designed for a <hi>peculiar use,</hi> and serve for other <hi>ends</hi> than to be <hi>worshipped</hi> by us? If <hi>Images</hi>
                        <pb n="603" facs="tcp:59802:317"/>
were set up in <hi>Churches</hi> only for <hi>memory</hi> and <hi>instruction,</hi> and were as much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by <hi>God</hi> to inform us of his <hi>Will,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are; there were some <hi>colour</hi> of shewing a like <hi>regard</hi> to them as to the <hi>Holy Bible</hi>; but it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they were never appointed for that purpose, they are uncapable of doing it, and are set up for <hi>adoration</hi>; and yet can the same men who commanded their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, have any pretence for making the <hi>Reverence</hi> to the <hi>Bible</hi> and the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> to be alike? Besides all this, is there no difference between a <hi>Religious respect</hi> (if I may so call it) to <hi>sacred places</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> and all the most solemn <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> which were ever given to <hi>Images</hi> by the greatest <hi>Idolaters?</hi> such as <hi>kneelings</hi> before them, <hi>prostrations, praying with their eyes fixed upon them,</hi> as though they were speaking to them; <hi>burning incense and lights before them:</hi> which are as great <hi>Testimonies</hi> of <hi>Worship</hi> as were ever used by the grossest and most sottish <hi>Idolaters.</hi> I may rather say, there is no great difference between them and their <hi>Images,</hi> that can see no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween such <hi>worship</hi> and the <hi>Reverence</hi> of <hi>Holy things.</hi>

                        <hi>that the act of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship towards the Image of Christ, is truly and properly terminated on the Image; not in regard either of its matter or Form, but as it performs the Office of an Image.

                           <hi>Cathaer. de cultu Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. p.</hi> 137.</note> 
                        <hi>that none of the Ancients did ever allow Images to be worshipped with Latria; and if this proposition be true, that an Image as an Image is to be worshipped with Latria, that likewise is true, that an Image is to be worshipped with Latria, for all wise men understand an Image as an Image; but this is so far from being in any ancient Writer that the contrary is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly there, and especially in the Decree of the Council of</hi> Nice; <hi>and therefore, he hath no way to excuse the doctrine of</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, <hi>but by saying he had never seen that Decree.</hi> But it is plain <hi>Thomas Aq.</hi> had more regard to the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> than to the <hi>Definition</hi> of that <hi>Synod,</hi> which he thought could not otherwise be defended. The main argument of <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> against this opinion, is, <hi>Latria is due to none but God; but an Image how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever considered as an Image is not God.
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:59802:326"/>
And whatever the Imagination of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son passeth to upon the sight of an Image, that can never make that to be God which is not God. If a man takes the Image for God, that is an abominable errour: if he saith, it is not God and yet worships it with Latria; this is plainly giving Latria to something else besides God. If it be said, that it is the same act of the mind which passeth from the Image to the Prototype, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the same adoration of both; this,</hi> he saith, <hi>will not hold, for if the Image be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, that must be the object of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the worship of the Image must be terminated on the Image, otherwise it is not the worship of the Image, but of the thing represented; neither can it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood how there should be two objects and but one adoration. Some answer that the Image and Prototype make one total object of adoration, and so it is but one Act and that of Latria; but this,</hi> saith he, <hi>makes strange confusion that the act of worship should be equally terminated on both. If they say it begins at the Image, and is terminated on the Prototype, that is not,</hi> saith he, <hi>proper worship of an Image which is not terminated on it; and how can that be a partial object of adoration, if the worship be no wayes terminated on it?
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:59802:327"/>
Others say, there is a twofold Latria</hi> per se &amp; per accidens, <hi>the former is only due to God, the latter may be given to an Image: this,</hi> saith he, <hi>contradicts the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, for then the same act of worship would be both</hi> per se <hi>and</hi> per accidens, <hi>which is ridiculous; and that which is</hi> per accidens <hi>ought not to be looked on as worship, for any thing may be said to be worshipped with Latria</hi> per accidens. <hi>Others say, that the worship of the Image is not terminated on the Image, but on the thing represented, and yet say it is the worship of the Image as an Image, which as such is distinct from the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, which,</hi> saith he, <hi>is not intelligible. To say the Image is worshipped improperly, is a saying not fit for Philosophers or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, but for Poets and Orators. For it is no more properly said the Image is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with Latria, than that the Image is the thing represented; which no man in his senses would say properly. To</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jetans <hi>saying, that an Image as performing the office of an Image is under that notion, the same with the thing represented,</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>that such a Metamorphosis is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible by any act of the Image, or of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: but to defend,</hi> saith he, <hi>that the Image as an Image, or as representing is
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:59802:327"/>
the same with the thing represented, and so as that the Latria is any wayes termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated on the Image, is to be mad ones self, and to endeavour to make others so. Therefore others say, that the Images are not truly and properly worshipped, but the things represented at them, before them, or in them; but this,</hi> saith he, <hi>destroyes the worship of Images, and is against the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Church, which directs the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, words, and signs of adoration, (even incense) to the Images, as when we say to the Cross,</hi> O Crux ave spes unica. This we see is the <hi>Burden</hi> of the <hi>Song,</hi> among them all; the <hi>Church</hi> practises thus, and thus; this <hi>practice</hi> must be defended one way or other, and happy the man that doth it best; but still the practice must be continued, for <hi>Catharinus</hi> inveighs bitterly against <hi>Erasmus,</hi> for saying, <hi>he thought it safer and easier to take Images out of Churches than to fix the just bounds of Worship and to prevent Superstition.</hi> And he grants at last,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that by a fiction of the mind, supposing the Image to be the Person represented, it may be said, that the Image is to be worshipped with Latria,</hi> yet he concludes, <hi>that no one ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he could ever see, did allow, that Images might any way be worshipped with
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:59802:328"/>
Latria, but all of them did abominate such an expression.</hi> And he adds, <hi>that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of</hi> Thomas <hi>doth rather take off from Images, that true and real worship, which,</hi> he saith, <hi>from the Nicene Council ought to be given to them, and terminated on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves though for the sake of the things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by them.

                        <hi>that the doctrine of giving La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria to Images is repugnant to Fathers and Councils, especially to the Definition of the Council of</hi> Nice; and he adds, <hi>that there is no more connexion between a sign and the thing signified, than between two rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as between Father and Son, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Son represent the Father, yet no man will say, that by the same act of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whereby I know the Son as a Son, I do know his Father, for then the Relative opposition would be taken away, and the different definitions of correlatives; so,</hi> saith he, <hi>although by the Image a conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption doth arise of the thing represented, yet it is not the same act of knowledge whereby I apprehend the Image and the thing represented: but suppose it were so, there is not the same reason for worship as for knowledge. For it is not repugnant to an Image as an Image to be apprehended by the same act with the thing represented:
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:59802:328"/>
but it seems repugnant to an Image as an Image to be worshipped with the same worship with the thing represented; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an Image, however considered, is an insensible Creature, to which they all grant no worship is due; and although it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent never so much, it doth not change its nature, but a block remains a block still, and a Stone doth not become rational by it.</hi> But, <hi>say they,</hi> Is not the Kings Robe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped with the same worship that his Person is? <hi>I confess,</hi> saith he, <hi>the whole Person as clothed is worshipped, and his clothes are no more separated, than any other habits or dispositions he hath about him. But, if the Kings Robe be separated from his Person, what reason is there to worship that as the King himself is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped? and the Princes Image is neither substantially nor accidentally the same with the Prince, and therefore is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with his Robe; and although some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be due to the Kings Image, yet no man ever saw, unless by the compulsion of some Tyrant, a Princes Image worshipped after the same manner that his Person is. And S.</hi> Augustin <hi>gives no other reason for the worship of the humanity of Christ (which he compares with the Princes Robe) but because it is united to the Divinity; which
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:59802:329"/>
reason cannot hold for such an Imaginary Union, between the Image and the thing represented, and therefore it ought not to be worshipped with the same adoration. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,</hi> saith he, <hi>if this were allowed, we might sacrifice to an Image, as well as do other acts of Latria to it, which cannot be said without blasphemy;</hi> but he concludes, <hi>that he defines nothing, and submits all to the judgement of the Church.

                        <hi>that although almost all the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were for Latria to be given to the Cross, yet that it is point-blank against the definition of the Council of</hi> Nice; <hi>and it is an unsatisfactory answer to say, they only were against Latria to be given to Images for themselves or absolute Latria; for no man ever doubted of that, that they were not to have divine worship for themselves; and the Council puts a distinction between the worship of the Image and the Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar; and joyns Images with the Gospels and Vessels, which no man ever thought were to be worshipped with any kind of Latria: and that, when S.</hi> Basil <hi>saith, the honour of the Image passes to the Prototype, he means no more than that the Image is honoured for the sake of the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented: and that, if an Image may be worshipped with Latria, then sacrifice may
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:59802:329"/>
be offered to it, which was condemned in</hi> Carpocrates <hi>and the</hi> Collyridians: <hi>and then those things which have a nearer conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than an Image may be better worshipped so, as the B. Virgin which bore him in her womb. Neither is it enough to say, they have proper excellencies of their own; for they might receive a double honour, the one proper, the other relative; and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing no danger of errour, then it might be done, and</hi> Medina, he saith, <hi>yields it of the B. Virgin not absolutely, but by reason of the conjunction between Christ and her while he was in her womb.</hi> Thus far in the opinion of these men, the case seems desperate as to the reconciling the doctrine of giving <hi>Latria</hi> to <hi>Images</hi> with <hi>Reason,</hi> or the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Nice.</hi>

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:59802:331"/>
the <hi>Image</hi> doth not contain the <hi>Prototype</hi> in the first, it does in the latter sense, <hi>i. e.</hi> in plain terms, although the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> be not in the <hi>Image,</hi> yet we may fancy him to be there; which being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, the mind of him that worships is carried primarily to the <hi>exemplar,</hi> and by way of <hi>concomitancy</hi> to the <hi>Image</hi>; not believing the <hi>Image</hi> to be <hi>Christ,</hi> (for that were a dangerous thing) but that it doth <hi>represent</hi> him as if he were there: and consequently this <hi>Imagination</hi> is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to perform all acts of <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> to the <hi>Image,</hi> as if the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> were actually present.

the <hi>Trees</hi> to be the <hi>Persons</hi> whose names he called them by, he would no doubt, (if he had been versed in <hi>School Divinity</hi>) have answered to this very subtilly with <hi>Suarez,</hi> that he was not such an Ass, not to distinguish the <hi>esse reale</hi> of the <hi>Tree,</hi> from the <hi>esse repraesentativum</hi> of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;</hi> and although he <hi>bowed</hi> and made <hi>Leggs</hi> to the <hi>Trees,</hi> he did not consider them in so doing as <hi>Trees,</hi> but as <hi>represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> those <hi>Persons</hi> to whom he was bound to shew all that <hi>Reverence,</hi> which he shewed to the <hi>Trees</hi> upon the <hi>Imagination</hi> that they were those very <hi>Persons;</hi> so that the <hi>Reverence</hi> was <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>per se</hi> shewn to those <hi>Persons, and but concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanter &amp; per accidens,</hi> and after <hi>an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our manner,</hi> to the <hi>Trees.</hi> But saith <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez, the Image is not so properly adored, as co-adored, as the Kings Robe is with his Person; and although the Image be really different from the Person of Christ, yet he is worshipped in his true Being as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the Image, and as it were vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and so they both become one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and that Person is worshipped, and the Image together with him with the very same act of adoration.</hi> I am glad to hear that, saith the <hi>Schoolmaster,</hi> for I hope by this means, I may do my <hi>Reverences</hi> to the

the Image were to be worshipped with a respect only to the exemplar, then it could not be denyed that an Image of Christ was to be worshipped with Latria.</hi> 2. <hi>He would not have it said before the people that Images are to be worshipped with Latria, but rather the contrary, because the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions necessary to defend it are too subtle for their noddles, and the truth is, the men that make them do hardly understand them themselves.</hi> 3. <hi>But if we speak among our selves and of the plain Truth of the case, Images may be worshipped with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria, but then it is improperly and</hi> per ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidens: <hi>as it is represented in the Image.</hi> 4. <hi>If we speak of worship</hi> per se &amp; propriÃ¨, <hi>so no Image is to be worshipped with La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria; because this was condemned by the Nicene Council.</hi> 5. <hi>Yet,</hi> he saith, <hi>that the worship which ought to be given to Images</hi> per se &amp; propriÃ¨, <hi>is analogically and reductively the same that is given to the exemplar,</hi> i. e. <hi>the worship of an Image of Christ is analogical Latria:</hi> So that <hi>it is,</hi> and <hi>it is not Latria; it is so,</hi> but we must not <hi>say so</hi>; yet if we speak of the <hi>proper worship of Images,</hi> that <hi>is not so</hi> and <hi>yet it is so,</hi> i. e. <hi>analogically</hi> and <hi>improperly</hi>; but if we speak of the <hi>proper worship of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> then it is not so.

<q>Thou shalt not make to thy self any Graven Image, nor the Likeness of any Thing which is in Heaven above, or in the Earth beneath, or in the Waters under the Earth; Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor worship them; for I the Lord thy God am a Iealous God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

If this be <hi>T.

G.</hi> say, <hi>that an Image when it is made an object of Divine worship becomes an Idol?</hi> And doth it not then follow that the Law in express terms doth condemn the Worship of God by such an Image?

And if this Law doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid such Images, then the signification of an <hi>Idol</hi> is not here to be taken for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation</hi> of a <hi>Figment,</hi> but of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and most real Being in the World.

Being just like it;</hi> but it was <hi>lawful</hi> to worship Him with <hi>the Image of a man,</hi> as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>that</hi> Oneph <hi>or the Creator of the world was worshipped under such a representation among them?</hi> It is certain, that both these <hi>sorts</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> were among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and according to <hi>T.

That there is a distinction to be made between such <hi>Images</hi> as have <hi>no

                        <hi>that the Reverence which the Iews shewed to the Ark and Cherubims, was of the same nature with the worship they give to Images;</hi> and he thinks, I have not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the argument he brought for it.

difference between the <hi>object</hi> and <hi>local cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance</hi> of worship, by our lifting up our hands and eyes towards heaven when we worship <hi>God</hi>; but no man that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands our Religion can say, that we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the <hi>heavens,</hi> but only <hi>God</hi> as present in them; wherefore <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>object,</hi> and looking up to heaven, barely the <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> When we praise any person for some excellency in him, if he be present, we naturally turn our face towards him, to let others by that circumstance under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, of whom we speak; but which way soever we looked, the same person would be the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>praise</hi>; when we do this at anothers mentioning his <hi>name,</hi> no man of common understanding will say, that the praise is directed to the very <hi>name</hi> of the Person; and if a man makes a Panegyrick upon another, and reads it out of a <hi>Book,</hi> no one suspects that his praise is therefore directed to his <hi>Book.</hi> Thus it is in the <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> the <hi>Object</hi> is that <hi>Being</hi> to which the <hi>worship</hi> is dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; but because external Acts must have some local circumstances, by the position of our <hi>countenances,</hi> and the tendency of our <hi>posture</hi> either towards <hi>Heaven,</hi> or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards some <hi>place</hi> as the more immediate <hi>Symbol</hi> of a <hi>divine presence,</hi> the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:59802:369"/>
is apparent between such a direction of the <hi>act</hi> towards a <hi>place,</hi> and the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it towards an <hi>Object,</hi> in case it can be made appear that may be a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> which is not an <hi>object</hi> of it. For which we must consider, (1.) That the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> is that <hi>to which</hi> the <hi>worship</hi> is given either for its own <hi>sake,</hi> or for the <hi>sake</hi> of that which it <hi>represents</hi>; but a <hi>local circumstance</hi> doth only circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe the <hi>material act of worship</hi> within certain bounds. And the proper <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> is a <hi>Person,</hi> either <hi>really present,</hi> or <hi>represented</hi> as <hi>present.</hi> The <hi>Idolaters</hi> who worshipped their <hi>Images</hi> as <hi>Gods</hi> (if at least any considerable number of them ever did so) it was upon this account, that they supposed some <hi>Spirit</hi> to be <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated</hi> in the <hi>Image,</hi> and so to make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it a <hi>Person</hi> fit to receive wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Those who worshipped the <hi>Elements,</hi> or <hi>heavenly bodies,</hi> did it not on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>matter</hi> whereof they were made; but of those <hi>spirits</hi> which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to rule over those things they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped, as I have already shewed in the general discourse. But it is not necessary in order to an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> that the <hi>Person</hi> be <hi>really present;</hi> for if men by <hi>imagination</hi> do suppose him <hi>present</hi> as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:59802:369"/>
by an <hi>Image,</hi> that makes those who worship that <hi>Image</hi> perform the very same <hi>acts,</hi> as if he were <hi>actually present;</hi> and in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> they do make this <hi>representation</hi> by an <hi>Image,</hi> a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground for making that an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship</hi>; which we say is the very thing forbidden in the Second <hi>Commandment,</hi> viz. that any <hi>Image</hi> should be worshipped on the account of what it <hi>represents</hi>; and therefore it forbids all kind of <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to be <hi>worshipped</hi> by men: because an <hi>Image</hi> seems to have such a <hi>relation</hi> to the thing it represents, that they may pretend they give <hi>worship</hi> to it on another account than meerly its matter and form, <hi>viz. the thing represented by it.</hi> Thus when the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is drawn from the <hi>exemplar,</hi> as it is both in the <hi>Councils</hi> of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Trent,</hi> they thereby shew, that they do make the <hi>Image</hi> a <hi>true object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> although the <hi>reason</hi> of it be drawn from the <hi>Person</hi> represented. But suppose men worship <hi>God</hi> towards the <hi>West,</hi> as the <hi>Iews</hi> did, or towards the <hi>East,</hi> as the <hi>Christians</hi> did; what is there in this that doth represent <hi>God</hi> to us? what is there that we fix our worship upon, but only himself; <hi>God</hi> hath no where forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den men to worship Him towards the place
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:59802:370"/>
of His presence; for even our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath bid us pray, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven;</hi> and supposing God had promised a more peculiar presence in His <hi>Holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> it was as lawful to worship <hi>God</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that, as towards <hi>Heaven;</hi> but that which <hi>God</hi> hath strictly forbidden, is the <hi>worshipping</hi> of any thing on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>representation</hi> either of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> or of His <hi>creatures</hi>; for this doth suppose that <hi>Image</hi> to be made the <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> although it be on the account of what it represents. 2. Supposing the same external <hi>acts</hi> to be performed towards an <hi>Image,</hi> and towards a <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> particular <hi>presence;</hi> yet the case is not alike in both these, if those who do them, declare they do them not with a design to <hi>worship</hi> that <hi>place.</hi> For to the making any thing an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> there must be some ground to believe that they intend to <hi>worship</hi> it, either from the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>actions,</hi> or the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> they live in; but in case it be expressly declared, that what they do, is only intended as a <hi>local circumstance,</hi> there is no ground to charge them with making it an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship.</hi> Thus those in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who declare that they do not <hi>worship</hi> the <hi>Image,</hi> but
<pb n="709" facs="tcp:59802:370" rendition="simple:additions"/>
only <hi>worship God</hi> before an <hi>Image,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they perform the same external <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> yet are condemed of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,</hi> because hereby they declare they do not give <hi>worship</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>decrees</hi> of their <hi>Councils:</hi> Much more certainly will those be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by them who declare it <hi>unlawful to worship any thing on the account of representation</hi>; and that they do only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the <hi>acts</hi> of outward <hi>worship</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a particular place, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to worship that place, but only to <hi>worship God</hi> that way. And this was the case of the <hi>Iews</hi> as to the <hi>worshipping</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> towards the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> they declared it utterly unlawful to do one because <hi>God</hi> had strictly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it; and they though it as lawful to do the other, because he allowed the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it: and it was sufficiently known among the people of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that they had no intention to <hi>worship</hi> either the <hi>Ark</hi> or the <hi>Cherubims.</hi> 3. Where there is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>local circumstance</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> the <hi>same thing</hi> would be worshipped, supposing that <hi>circumstance</hi> changed; but where any thing is an <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> that being changed, the <hi>same thing</hi> is not <hi>worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped.</hi> This makes the difference between
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:59802:371"/>

                        <pb n="721" facs="tcp:59802:376"/>
intends. And to what purpose are words of the largest signification put into a <hi>Law,</hi> if the sense be limitted according to the most narrow acceptation of one word men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned therein? for there is no kind of <hi>Image,</hi> whether <hi>graven</hi> or <hi>painted,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a real or imaginary Being, but is comprehended under the signification of the words set down in the Law. To this <hi>T. G.</hi> answers,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 47<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> 48, 49, &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>that how large soever the signification of this word</hi> Temunah <hi>or simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude be when taken by it self, yet in our present case, it is limited by the following words, Thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them, to signifie something which is made to be worshipped as God, that is, to be an Idol. And so, by the word Idol in the Commandment he understands such an Image as is made to represent for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship a Figment that hath no real Being; and by similitude an Image or resemblance of some real thing, but falsely imagined to be God; but,</hi> he saith, <hi>it was nothing to the purpose to put the word similitude in its largest meaning, that is, as signifying any Image whatsoever though made with respect to the worship of the true God, when God himself commanded the Ark and the Cherubims to be made with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect:</hi> (doth he mean to <hi>represent</hi> the true

                        <hi>God?</hi> or to be <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>worship?</hi> which I have already shewed to be false.) <hi>That which I am to prove,</hi> he saith, is, <hi>that the word Similitude is to be taken so here; whereas,</hi> he affirms, <hi>that the word simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is to be restrained to the similitude of false Gods:</hi> And to make all sure, he interprets <hi>similitude</hi> only of the <hi>represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>false Gods,</hi> and <hi>bowing down</hi> to and <hi>worshipping that similitude</hi> is the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping that Similitude as God: i. e.</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Likeness</hi> to be the <hi>Thing</hi> it self. I cannot blame <hi>T. G.</hi> for making the thing forbidden in the Commandment, if it be possible, more absurd than their practice in the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> is; but, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath made the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>himself</hi> more <hi>ridiculous</hi> let the Reader judge. <hi>By similitude,</hi> he saith, <hi>is here to be understood, only the Similitude of False Gods, as the Sun, Moon and Stars, and other like things which they worshipped as Gods</hi>; this I confess is intelligible and true, although not the <hi>full</hi> meaning of the <hi>Commandment</hi>; but what then is, <hi>bowing down to and worshipping this similitude? that is,</hi> saith he, <hi>to worship this similitude as God:</hi> How is that? Is it by believing the <hi>Similitude</hi> to be the <hi>Thing?</hi> as the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Sun</hi> to be really the <hi>Sun?</hi>

this is absurd enough of all Conscience, and they were <hi>sottish Idolaters</hi> indeed that did so.

                           <hi>Take ye therefore good heed to your selves, lest ye corrupt your selves, and make you a graven Image, the similitude of any figure,</hi> &amp;c. the ground of that Caution is expressed in these words, <hi>For ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake unto you.</hi> If the whole intention of the <hi>Law</hi> had been only to keep them from worshipping the <hi>Heathen Idols,</hi> or <hi>Images for Gods,</hi> to what purpose is it here mentioned that they saw no <hi>simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of God,</hi> when he spake to them?
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:59802:382"/>
For although <hi>God</hi> appeared with a <hi>simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> then, yet there might have been great <hi>Reason</hi> against <hi>worshipping</hi> the <hi>Heathen Idols,</hi> or fixing the intention of their worship on the bare Image.

most pure Spirit, whom man never saw, be expressed by a gross body, or visible simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? or how can the infinite Majesty and Greatness of God incomprehensible to mans mind, much more not able to be compassed with the sense, be expressed in an Image?</hi> With more to the same purpose, by which our <hi>Church</hi> declares, as plainly as possible, that all <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>God</hi> are a disparagement to the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> therefore let <hi>T.

                        </note> 1. <hi>From the Preface of the Law; because the Reason there as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, is, I am the Lord thy God</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Soveraign honour</hi> is only to be given to me, and to none besides me. Or, as I think, it is better expressed in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me:</hi> and who denies, or doubts of this? but what is this to the <hi>Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Yes,</hi> saith <hi>T. G. The same reason
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:59802:384"/>
is enforced from Gods jealousie of his honor</hi>: very well, <hi>of His Soveraign Honour? but provided, that supreme worship be reserved to Him, He doth not regard an inferiour worship being given to Images:</hi> Might not <hi>T. G.</hi> as well have explained the <hi>First Commandment</hi> after the same manner, <hi>Thou shalt have no other Soveraign Gods besides me;</hi> but <hi>inferiour</hi> and <hi>subordinate Deities</hi> you may have, as many as you please, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Reason of the <hi>Law</hi>; which <hi>T. G.</hi> thus paraphrases, <hi>I am the only supreme and super-excellent Being, above all, and over all, to whom therefore Soveraign Honour is only to be given, and to none besides me.</hi> Very true, say the <hi>Heathen Idolaters,</hi> we yield you every word of this, and why then do you charge us with <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Thus by the admirable <hi>Test</hi> of <hi>T. G</hi>'s <hi>reason,</hi> the <hi>Heathen Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are excused from the breach of the <hi>First Commandment,</hi> as well as the <hi>Papists</hi> from the breach of the Second. 2. He proves it <hi>from the necessary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prohibition of the Law on the one side,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>and the supreme excellency of the Divine Nature on the other; For from the supreme excellency of God, it necessarily follows that Soveraign Worship is due only to it, and not to be given to any other Image or
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:59802:384"/>
thing: but if we consider Him as invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble only and irrepresentable, it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on that account precisely, that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign worship or indeed any worship at all is due unto it.</hi> Which is just like this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Reasoning. The <hi>Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of a <hi>Husband,</hi> is the <hi>Reason</hi> why the <hi>Wife</hi> is to obey him; but if she consider her Husband, as his name is <hi>Iohn</hi> or <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> or as he hath such <hi>features</hi> in his <hi>face</hi>; it doth not follow on that <hi>account precisely,</hi> that she is bound to obey him and none else for her Husband. And what of all this, for the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>School Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> May not the <hi>reason</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> be taken from one particular thing in a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> and yet there be a general obligation of <hi>obedience</hi> to that <hi>Person,</hi> and to <hi>none else besides him?</hi> Although the <hi>features</hi> of his <hi>countenance</hi> be no <hi>Reason</hi> of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> yet they may serve to <hi>discriminate him</hi> from any other <hi>Person,</hi> whom she is not to love and obey. And in case, he forbids her familiarity with one of his <hi>servants,</hi> because this would be a great <hi>disparagement</hi> to him; doth it follow that because his <hi>Superiority</hi> is the general <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of <hi>obedience,</hi> he may not give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Reason</hi> for a <hi>special Command?</hi> This is the case here. <hi>Gods Supreme Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> is granted to be the <hi>general Reason</hi> of
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:59802:385"/>
                        <hi>obedience</hi> to all <hi>Gods Commands</hi>; but in case he gives some particular precept, as not to <hi>worship any Image,</hi> may not he assign a <hi>Reason</hi> proper to it? And what can be a more proper reason against <hi>making</hi> or <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping</hi> any <hi>representation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> than to say, <hi>He cannot be represented? Meer invisibility</hi> I grant is no <hi>general reason</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi>; but <hi>invisibility</hi> may be a very proper <hi>reason</hi> for not <hi>painting</hi> what is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible. There is no worship due to a sound, because it cannot be painted;</hi> but it is the most proper reason why a <hi>sound</hi> cannot be <hi>painted,</hi> because it is not <hi>visible.</hi> And if God himself gives this reason, why they should make no graven Image <hi>because they saw no similitude on that day,</hi> &amp;c. is it not madness and folly in men to say, this is no <hi>Reason?</hi> But <hi>T. G.</hi> still takes it for granted,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 67.</note> 
                        <hi>That all that is meant by this Commandment, is that Soveraign worship is not to be given to Graven Images or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes; and of the Soveraign worship,</hi> he saith, <hi>Gods excellency precisely is the formal and immediate Reason why it is to be given to none but him.</hi> But we are not such Sots (say the <hi>Heathen Idolaters</hi> again) to give <hi>Soveraign worship</hi> to our <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Reason</hi> of your <hi>Command</hi> doth not reach us; but we may worship our <hi>Images,</hi>
                        <pb n="739" facs="tcp:59802:385"/>
as well as you do yours. 3. He proves it, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> thus, <hi>I grant that no perfect Image of God can be made, and that God need not by a Law forbid an impossible thing; but from the Divine Natures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invisible it only follows that men ought not to presume to make any Image, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to represent it as it is,</hi> i. e. a perfect Image; <hi>and the Law in vertue of it must be to forbid making any such Image; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to my self, the irrepresen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness of the Divine Nature as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely considered, cannot be assigned for the proper cause or reason of this Law.</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry subtilly argued! What I said, <hi>could not be the sense of the Law,</hi> he takes to be <hi>the sense of it,</hi> and from thence argues against the <hi>Reason I had given:</hi> which is as if I should say to him; <hi>T. G.</hi> denies, <hi>That this Commandment doth contain any prohibition of the worship of God by an Image</hi>; but the Law must be understood to forbid <hi>worshipping God by an Image</hi>; therefore according to <hi>T. G.</hi> the <hi>Law</hi> doth forbid <hi>worshipping God by an Image.</hi> Call you this arguing <hi>ad hominem</hi>! One would think it were to a <hi>creature</hi> of a lower rank. He saith, <hi>I deny that the Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids making an impossible thing,</hi> i.e. <hi>a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Image of God</hi>; he asserts, <hi>That the
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:59802:386"/>
Law must be understood to forbid the making of any such Image;</hi> and from hence he infers, that <hi>according to my self,</hi> that cannot be the <hi>reason of the Law which I assigned</hi>; because from <hi>that reason</hi> that only follows to be forbidden by the <hi>Law,</hi> which I said could not be the thing <hi>forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi>: and he saith, <hi>must be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden by it.</hi> Before <hi>T. G.</hi> had gone about to prove any thing from hence against my self, he ought to have shewed, 1. That Gods irrepresentable Nature doth only hold against making <hi>impossibilities,</hi> that is, <hi>perfect Images of God.</hi> 2. That this must be the meaning of the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he saith, <hi>I denied.</hi> 3. That when I denied, and he barely affirmed it, he can argue <hi>ad hominem</hi> from my <hi>denial</hi> and his <hi>affirmation</hi> of the same thing, against the <hi>Reason</hi> alledged by me, <hi>viz.</hi> I assigned from <hi>Scripture,</hi> that no <hi>Image</hi> is to be made of <hi>God</hi> because He is <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Invisible;</hi> now saith <hi>T.G. I will prove from your own words, this cannot be the Reason of this Law.</hi> How so? <hi>You say, that the Law doth not forbid making a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Image of God, for that is impossible.</hi> And what then? doth it hence follow, that the Law doth not forbid making a possible Image of God? <hi>Hold,</hi> saith <hi>T. G.
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:59802:386"/>
Gods infinite Nature doth only hold against a perfect Image, and this must be the meaning of the Commandment</hi>; which I utterly denied. And so if <hi>T. G.</hi> will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>ex concessis,</hi> it must proceed thus, I deny that the Law doth forbid an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Image of God, or that Gods infinite Nature doth only hold against such Images; and therefore <hi>according to my self,</hi> this <hi>infinite Nature of God</hi> cannot be the <hi>reason</hi> why <hi>Images</hi> are forbidden in the Second <hi>Commandment.</hi> Can any man in the earth discern the consequence of this? When I say the Law is made against <hi>possible Images,</hi> and that the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented so perfect to deter men from making the most imperfect <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>God, because they are a disparagement to Him;</hi> doth it follow from my words that this <hi>Reason</hi> cannot hold against the <hi>making</hi> of <hi>Images?</hi>

                        <hi>T. G.</hi> having given us such a <hi>Test</hi> of his <hi>Reason;</hi> I now follow him to the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> he gives of the <hi>places</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> produced by me. To the <hi>First,</hi> Isa. 40.18. <hi>To whom will ye liken God? Or what likeness will ye compare unto Him?</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>T.G. p.</hi> 69.</note> He Answers, <hi>That there is a likeness of representation and a likeness of Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; if the words be understood of the
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:59802:387"/>
former,</hi> then he saith, <hi>it only follows that such a likeness is not to be made.</hi> Which is all that I desire. But again he is at it, <hi>That I deny the prohibition hereof to be any part of the Law:</hi> Is it possible for <hi>T. G.</hi> to say this, when my design is to prove the contrary? but <hi>By Likeness</hi> T. G. under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands <hi>a perfect representation</hi>; why doth he not say then, by <hi>likeness</hi> is understood <hi>sameness</hi>? which is not <hi>representation,</hi> but the <hi>thing</hi> it self. All representation by the art of man must fall very much short of the <hi>perfection</hi> of the meanest animal; and no <hi>Image</hi> can represent a thing <hi>as it is,</hi> but <hi>as it appears</hi>; not in regard of its <hi>invisible nature,</hi> but of its <hi>outward lineaments</hi>; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore <hi>T. G.</hi> must deny any <hi>likeness</hi> of <hi>representation,</hi> or he must yield that to be a <hi>likeness</hi> of <hi>representation</hi> in an <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God</hi> which doth not <hi>perfectly represent</hi> him. For if it had the <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it would be <hi>God. If the words be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of a likeness of comparison, then the meaning,</hi> he saith, <hi>is, that none of the Idols of the Heathens are to be compared to Him in Wisdom,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Greatness, or Power.</hi> But me thinks if not the <hi>Hebrew words,</hi> nor the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast,</hi> nor the LXX, nor other versions, could prevail with <hi>T. G.</hi> yet the <hi>Vulgar Latine</hi> should have
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:59802:387"/>
had Authority enough to let him know, that these words are not spoken of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idols,</hi> but of an <hi>Image of God, Cui ergo similem fecistis Deum? aut quam Imaginem ponetis ei?</hi> which surely ought to signifie more with him, than meerly the <hi>Contents</hi> of the <hi>Chapters</hi> do with us.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15. he answers, <hi>That</hi> de facto <hi>no manner of similitude was seen at the giving of the Law, by the people</hi>;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>p.</hi> 71.</note> 
                        <hi>that afterwards they might not take occasion to conceive it to have been a proper repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation of the Divinity, and so entertain an erroneous conceit of God.</hi> And doth <hi>T. G.</hi> think, there was not as much danger of <hi>dishonouring God</hi> by <hi>worshipping</hi> any such <hi>representation</hi> of God, as by <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an erroneous conceit of God in their minds?</hi> But why must this be understood only of a <hi>proper representation,</hi> when the words are, <hi>no manner of similitude</hi>; is there <hi>no manner of similitude,</hi> but a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per representation?</hi> and yet after all this, the <hi>Images of God</hi> allowed and <hi>worshipped</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church</hi> are as much in danger of making men <hi>entertain erroneous conceits of God,</hi> as any <hi>similitude</hi> of that time; and therefore as much against the <hi>Reason</hi> of this <hi>Commandment.</hi> But <hi>T. G.</hi> very modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denies, <hi>these words to contain a Reason
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:59802:388"/>
of this Commandment</hi> (although they be, <hi>For ye saw no manner of similitude,</hi>

G.</hi> is resolved to make just such another <hi>Test</hi> of Scripture as he did of <hi>Reason</hi>; Could it ever enter into a mans head waking, that these words are a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reason</hi> of the <hi>Whole Law,</hi> and not a particular <hi>Reason</hi> of that <hi>Command</hi> which immediately follows it, and by the very words relates to it? <hi>Ye saw no similitude,</hi> therefore <hi>make no similitude</hi>; this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and natural, and easie to all capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: but <hi>ye saw no similitude; therefore obey my Law</hi>; Hold there, saith <hi>T.

<pb n="745" facs="tcp:59802:388"/>
than think to save themselves by such a mean defence.</p>

This argument therefore doth not concern Catholicks in making the Image of Christ and his Saints with respect to their honour.</hi>

herein fell back to the Egyptian Idolatry.</hi> Here then is the <hi>state</hi> of the <hi>Question</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; to resolve which, and to bring it home to our business, I shall propose these two things. 1.

I shall examine the evidence on both sides, <hi>whether the Israelites did fall back to the Egyptian Idolatry?</hi> I offered several reasons to prove that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had no intention to quit the worship of that <hi>God,</hi> who had so lately given them the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai.</hi> 1. From the <hi>occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of this <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which was not any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of <hi>infidelity</hi> as to the true God; or that they had now better reasons given them for the worship of other Gods besides him; but all that they say is, that <hi>Moses</hi> had been so long absent; that they desired <hi>Aaron</hi> to make them Gods to go before them. To this <hi>T. G.</hi> answers, <hi>that the

lies in this, that <hi>Aaron</hi> said, <hi>it was a Feast to Iehovah,</hi> when they were to sacrifice to the <hi>golden Calf;</hi> either therefore he must suppose that worship was intended for the honour of the <hi>True God,</hi> or he must give the name of <hi>Iehovah</hi> to the <hi>Calf</hi>; which would shew him to have been more <hi>sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> than the <hi>People,</hi> for they only called the <hi>Calf</hi> by the name of <hi>Elohim,</hi> but he gives the name of <hi>Iehovah</hi> to it, which was that peculiar name God was known by to the <hi>people</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> upon the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his promise in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>

                        <hi>I appeared unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>and to</hi> Isaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob <hi>by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Iehovah was I not known unto them: wherefore say unto the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>I am Iehovah, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>What then? Is it the Idols having a name, that makes the worshippers Heathen Idolaters?

allowed of the first sort, that the Iews did worship the True God in the Idol.</hi> Then an Image of the true <hi>God</hi> may be an <hi>Idol,</hi> and those <hi>Idolaters,</hi> who worship such an Image. <hi>But they erred most grievously,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmin, in three things:</hi> 1. <hi>That they sacrificed to the Idol,</hi> i. e. gave divine worship to it. 2. <hi>That they believed the Divinity to be in it:</hi> how doth that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? no more surely, than those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Images</hi> to <hi>speak</hi> and to <hi>work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> 3. <hi>That they thought God to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and like the Idol, i. e.</hi> the <hi>Israelites</hi> thought the great <hi>Iehovah</hi> to be just of the <hi>fashion</hi> of the <hi>Calf.</hi> What prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fools must some men make the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> that they may not appear as great <hi>Idolaters</hi> themselves? 7.

                        <hi>then God turned and gave them up to worship the Host of heaven</hi>; whereby, I said it was observable, that the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the <hi>Calf</hi> was distinct from the other <hi>Heathen Idolatry,</hi> this being a <hi>punishment</hi> of the other.

party, that would be sure to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to him, then by little and little to open the great <hi>Design</hi> to them, which he aimed at all this while. But it was too great a <hi>Change</hi> for such a <hi>Polititian,</hi> to say at the very first to them; <hi>Come, renounce the God of Israel without more ado; I have set up other Gods for you to worship, and I command you all immediately to obey me</hi>: methinks, this would seem too harsh and unpolitick, and too dangerous for so new a <hi>Government</hi> as his was; a little <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence for tender consciences,</hi> for a time, with the sweetest words, had better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such an <hi>Achitophel,</hi> as <hi>T.

which made them so earnest for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>way</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> which was so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the rest of the World.

Was it credible, that God should suffer so great a part of mankind to run on in such <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as a few <hi>Iews</hi> accounted it?

Besides all this, they ought to consider, how much the honour and safety of the Nation was concerned in embracing the same <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> way of <hi>worship</hi> which prevailed round about them. Their pretending to greater <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> than their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> made them <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and <hi>reproached</hi> by their <hi>Neighbours</hi> of all sides, <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amalek,</hi> the <hi>Philistins,</hi> and those of <hi>Tyre:</hi> but if they returned to the <hi>worship</hi> of the <hi>Neighbour Nations,</hi> they might be sure of the <hi>assistance</hi> of the

                           <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> with whom <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had lived many years, who would be ready to help them on all occasions; and their lesser enemies would then be afraid to disturb them.</q> Thus we see what plausible pretences there were to have drawn the people off from the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> to the <hi>Idolatries</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi>; but we read not the least intimation of this <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in the whole <hi>History</hi> of this <hi>Revolt</hi>: but <hi>Ieroboam</hi> only saith, <hi>These are thy Gods which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> which was the most unpolitick way of perswading them to return to the <hi>Gods</hi> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Besides he not only appointed a <hi>Feast</hi> like unto that in <hi>Iudah,</hi> but it is said,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12.32.</note>

no <hi>contradiction</hi> in it: For the notion of <hi>Idolatry</hi> as applied to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> is consistent with its owning the general <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> as to the <hi>True God</hi> and <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> and giving <hi>Soveraign Worship</hi> to them; when therefore we say, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not err in any <hi>Fundamental</hi> point of the <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> I there at large shew, the meaning to have been only this, that in all those which are looked on by us as necessary <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> we have the <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>approbation</hi> of the whole <hi>Christian</hi> World of all Ages, and are acknowledged to be such by <hi>Rome</hi> it self; but the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> looks upon all her <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which we reject, as <hi>necessary Articles of Faith:</hi> so that the force of the Argument comes only to this, that no <hi>Church</hi> which doth own the ancient <hi>Creeds</hi> can be guilty of <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And I farther add, that when we enquire into the <hi>essentials</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> we think it not necessary to go any farther than the <hi>doctrinal points</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; because <hi>Baptism</hi> admits men into the <hi>Church</hi> upon the profession of the true <hi>Faith</hi> in the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> but if beyond the <hi>essentials</hi> we enquire into the moral <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity</hi> and <hi>soundness</hi> of a <hi>Church,</hi> then we are bound to go farther than the bare
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:59802:410"/>
profession of the <hi>essential</hi> points of <hi>Faith</hi>; and if it be found that the same <hi>Church</hi> may debauch those very principles of <hi>Faith</hi> by damnable <hi>errours,</hi> and corrupt the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by vertue of them, then the same <hi>Church</hi> which doth hold the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> may notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lead men to <hi>Idolatry</hi> without the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a contradiction. But <hi>T. G.</hi> saith, <hi>That Idolatry is an Errour against the most Fundamental point of Faith.</hi> What doth <hi>T. G.</hi> mean by this? I suppose it is, that <hi>Idolatry</hi> doth imply <hi>Polytheism,</hi> or the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of more <hi>Gods</hi> than one, to whom <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign worship</hi> is due; then I deny this to be the proper Definition of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> for although, where ever this is, it hath in it the nature of that we call <hi>Idolatry</hi>; yet himself confesses, the true notion of it to be, <hi>The giving the worship due to God, to a Creature</hi>; so that, if I have proved that the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> is the giving the <hi>worship</hi> due only to <hi>God</hi> to a <hi>Creature</hi>; then, although the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> may hold all the <hi>essentials</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and be a <hi>true Church,</hi> it may be guilty of <hi>Idolatry</hi> without contradiction. But it may be <hi>I. W.</hi> in his <hi>Reply,</hi> saith something more to purpose; (at least it will be thought so, if I do not answer

                        <hi>that if the</hi> Roman <hi>Church doth hold any kind of Idolatry to be lawful, she must needs hold an Errour destructive to a Fundamental and essential point of Faith, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence a Fundamental errour incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the essence of a true Church.

or the <hi>Honour</hi> due only to <hi>God</hi>; but the <hi>Roman Church</hi> may give the real <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> due only to <hi>God</hi> to a <hi>meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and yet at the same time, tell men it is not a part of the <hi>Honour</hi> which is <hi>due</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> To make this plain even to the understanding of <hi>I.

                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.20.</note> 
                        <hi>that even the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens were left without excuse; no such

matter,</hi> saith <hi>T. G. the Creatures repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God rudely, remotely, darkly and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly</hi>; which make an excellent para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase on the words of the Psalmist,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.1.</note> 
                        <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God, and the Firmament shews his handy-work.</hi> Mens <hi>handy-work</hi> by <hi>Images</hi> will do it rarely, presently, effectually, inflamingly; but <hi>Gods Work</hi> doth it <hi>dully, remotely, rudely,</hi> and <hi>imperfectly.</hi> O how much the <hi>skill</hi> of a <hi>painter</hi> exceeds the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>God!</hi> Whereas in truth the least work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture infinitely exceeds the greatest art of man in curiosity, beauty, strength, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and every thing that can discover <hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Power. But,</hi> saith <hi>T.

<pb n="806" facs="tcp:59802:419"/>
foot?</hi> This sort of <hi>Wit</hi> is a delicate thing, and endures no rough handling. But still I say it is not in the meer <hi>quickness</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation,</hi> but in the <hi>perfections</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, that natural things do so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the most artificial Images; and we are to consider that in all representations of <hi>objects</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> those are the most <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> which best set forth the <hi>Nature</hi> of that <hi>Being</hi> as it deserves our <hi>worship.</hi> Now in this respect, the <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi> manifest <hi>Gods eternal Power,</hi> and what is it the <hi>Image</hi> of an <hi>Old man</hi> represents?

                        <hi>much more ought we to worship Gods Works with a Relative worship.</hi> 2. <hi>Becaus they worship the very places where the Saints have been; as a Stone on which they have sate, for the sake of contact and propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; much more ought we to worship Gods Creatures, to whom He is far nearer than the Body of a Saint to a Stone.</hi> 3. <hi>Because they receive gifts from Princes with great veneration, although mean in themselves; therefore since all the Creatures are Gods gifts we may worship them for His sake.</hi> 4. <hi>Because a man is the living Image of God, therefore as a Wooden Image may be worshipped for the sake of the exemplar, much more,</hi> saith he, <hi>ought such a lively Image as man is.</hi> Thus we see how men of the greatest understanding among them, have discerned the necessary consequence of their own principles of <hi>worship,</hi> and
<pb n="810" facs="tcp:59802:421"/>
find there is no defending them, without yielding the lawfulness of <hi>worshipping God</hi> through any of His <hi>Creatures</hi>; and <hi>living men</hi> rather than <hi>dead Images,</hi> on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a fuller representation of God; and saith <hi>Lugo, With the worship of</hi> Latria, <hi>in respect of God, and an inferiour worship on the account of His proper excellency.</hi>

<pb n="825" facs="tcp:59802:428"/>
but the plain reason is, because the <hi>Nicene Council</hi> was begun at <hi>Constantinople upon the</hi> 17 <hi>of</hi> August; <hi>but the Emperours Guards would not endure their sitting there, as</hi> Theophanes <hi>relates,</hi>

ground they may, <hi>if they who worship Images give divine Honour to them</hi>; but <hi>Aquinas</hi> and his <hi>Followers</hi> contend that <hi>Divine Honour is to be given to them</hi>; and therefore they fall under the like cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. And by their argument, all that worship <hi>Images</hi> must come under it; For either they <hi>worship Images</hi> for <hi>themselves,</hi> and then they all acknowledge it is <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi> or for the sake of the <hi>exemplar:</hi> which if it be the <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>object</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> as represented by the <hi>Image,</hi> it must have the same <hi>worship</hi> which the thing considered in its own being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves; which being <hi>divine honour,</hi> that must be given to the Image.

                        <hi>That although the Image of Christ can only represent the humane Nature as separate from the Divine, yet the charge of Nestorianism doth not follow; because the Object of their worship, is that which is conceived in their minds; and worship being an act of the Will, it is carried to the Prototype, as it is conceived in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; but their understandings being free from Nestorianism, their Wills must be so too:</hi> which is all the sense I can make of <hi>T.

Matter of Conscience, and not a <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Nicety.</hi> For if the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> be so asserted in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that in what way soever it is practised, there is by their own confession such <hi>danger</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; the <hi>General Terms</hi> of <hi>Councils</hi> serve only to draw men into the snare, and not to help them out of it. 2.

<pb n="850" facs="tcp:59802:441"/>
                        <hi>Dominion</hi> over us, we must not use those <hi>Acts</hi> to any <hi>Creature</hi>; and therefore here the most material <hi>Question</hi> can be asked, is, whether the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> be the <hi>same</hi> which we are to use to <hi>God</hi> or no, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether they are <hi>acts forbidden</hi> or <hi>lawful?</hi> for if they are the <hi>same,</hi> they are forbidden; if not, they may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

If the <hi>Yeomen</hi> of the <hi>Guard</hi> should see an old <hi>Courtier</hi> approach with many <hi>bowings</hi> to the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> and there fall down upon his <hi>Knees,</hi> and kiss the <hi>Arms</hi> of the <hi>Chair,</hi> and deliver his <hi>Petition</hi> to it for a good <hi>Office</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi> and observe that he doth this frequently, and with great gravity,

I am afraid they would hardly hold their Countenances long to see such a <hi>solemn Fop</hi>; and yet this pleasant <hi>Courtier</hi> might pretend, that he did all this as imagining the <hi>King</hi> to be there <hi>present</hi> by <hi>representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and that he did not give this <hi>Honour</hi> to the <hi>Chair</hi> of <hi>State absolutely,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>as a piece of Wood</hi>; but only <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> and for the <hi>sake</hi> of his <hi>Master</hi>

                        <hi>Rules</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> are to be observed, where there is no intrenchment upon <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Laws</hi>; and every man that comes to <hi>Court</hi> enquires after the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> and he that keeps within them doth his duty, and never fears the <hi>Yeomen</hi> of the <hi>Guard.</hi> If the <hi>Orders</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> were for men to pass through the <hi>Presence,</hi> or other <hi>Chambers</hi> without any <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> would not the <hi>Yeomen</hi> of the <hi>Guard</hi> be as ready to observe those who used it? Their business is to observe <hi>Orders</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to see that others do it. And this is the only way how this <hi>parallel</hi> can reach to our <hi>Case</hi>; all that we plead for, is, that <hi>the Rules and Orders be observed which God hath given us for His Worship</hi>; since He hath given <hi>Laws</hi> we ought to obey them; and since He hath appointed what He will have done, and what He will not, we must follow His <hi>Rule,</hi> and not our own <hi>extravagant Fancies,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that we have pretty devices to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Him with, which He hath expresly forbidden. In such a case, we have <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to enquire, whether the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> be the <hi>same</hi> that He hath <hi>forbidden</hi> or no: but not where the whole matter depends on <hi>custom,</hi> and <hi>general Rules,</hi>
                        <pb n="853" facs="tcp:59802:442"/>
which every man may easily know; and no one hath any reason to be scrupulous as long as he keeps within the <hi>measures</hi> of <hi>Decency.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But withal, the force of my Question lay in the <hi>confession</hi> of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> who acknowledge on one side, <hi>That if the Act of Worship be the same that is given to the Prototype, it is Idolatry</hi>; on the other side, <hi>if it be distinct it is Idolatry</hi>; and then I had all the reason in the world to put this Question, because either way they are entangled by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their own party. But as if <hi>Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the <hi>Guard</hi> should be so senseless, as some of them to tell a poor <hi>Countryman,</hi> when he is going through the <hi>Presence Chamber, that if he gives the Chair of State the same Honour he gives the King, he commits Treason</hi>; and others say, <hi>if he does not, he worships the Chair for it self, and so commits Treason</hi>; would not any man say, the Countryman had reason to stand, and scratch his head, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what he does, for he doth not care <hi>to commit Treason,</hi> and if he must do it one way or other, for his part he would go some other way, or be better resolved what he is to do. Thus in our case <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
                        <pb n="854" facs="tcp:59802:443"/>
saith, <hi>It is Idolatry to give the same worship to an Image which is due to God: Vasquez</hi> saith, <hi>It is Idolatry to give distinct worship</hi>; therefore if a man would avoid <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he must give none at all: especially when there is no necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at all of doing it; and therefore it is in no case parallel <hi>with the difficulties about sight and motion,</hi> which <hi>T.

                        <hi>and that is due to God himself; and the other relative, that may be given to the Image: or rather, in the same act of worship is a double Notion, the one as it tends to God himself, which is absolute Latria, the other as it reflects on the Image for His sake, which is relative Latria.</hi> Which distinction I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy examined, and shewed the vanity of in several places; and that there are many in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> who hold <hi>absolute Latria</hi> to be given to <hi>Images,</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>grounds</hi> of a <hi>Relative Latria</hi> any <hi>Creature</hi> may be <hi>worshipped</hi>; therefore I shall keep to what is proper to this place. 1. <q>I said this distinction is just as if an unchaste Wife should plead to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, that the Person she was so kind with, was extremely like him, and a near Friend of his, that it was out of respect to him, that she gave him the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his bed; can any one think that
<pb n="856" facs="tcp:59802:444"/>
such an excuse as this would be taken by a jealous Husband?

no kind of excellency to deserve it from you.</hi> Alas poor <hi>T. G!</hi> how doth he argue like a man spent and quite gone!

which <hi>Vasquez</hi> charges with <hi>Idolatry,</hi> did agree with him in all <hi>external acts</hi> of <hi>adoration to Images;</hi> and went farther than <hi>Vasquez</hi> thought fit as to the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>; for they said, both ought to <hi>concurr</hi> in the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> and that this <hi>inferiour worship</hi> was <hi>terminated on the Images themselves</hi> (as I have shewed at large in the stare of the Controversie.) Now saith <hi>Vasquez,</hi> to assert and practise <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images</hi> after this manner is <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, for it is expressing our submission to a meer inanimate thing.</hi> But do we say, that all <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> are to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Ground</hi> that is <hi>holy;</hi> or that any one <hi>act</hi> of <hi>worship</hi> is to be <hi>termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> upon it; or that any <hi>submission</hi> of our <hi>minds</hi> is to be <hi>used</hi> towards it? All these we utterly disavow as to the <hi>Reverence</hi> of <hi>Sacred Places,</hi> and these things being declared, we yet say there is a <hi>Reverence</hi> left to be shewed them on the account of their <hi>discrimination</hi> from other <hi>places</hi> and <hi>separation</hi> for <hi>sacred uses</hi>; which <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> is best expressed in the way most common for men to shew <hi>Respect</hi> by, which was <hi>putting off Shooes</hi> in the <hi>Eastern parts,</hi> and of <hi>Hats</hi> here; (of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>worship,</hi> I have
<pb n="864" facs="tcp:59802:448"/>
spoken before.) I hope by this time, <hi>T. G.</hi> sees a little better the force of the argument of <hi>Vasquez,</hi>

Which is in effect to say, that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in allowing <hi>bowing to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> doth give the very <hi>same worship</hi> to it, which their <hi>Church</hi> requires to be <hi>given to Images</hi>; and that they who do one and not the other, do not attend to the <hi>Consequence</hi> of their own <hi>Actions.</hi> I shall therefore shew, 1. That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not allow <hi>any worship</hi>
                        <pb n="869" facs="tcp:59802:450"/>
to be given <hi>to the Altar.</hi> 2. That the <hi>adoration</hi> allowed and practised in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is of a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Nature</hi> from the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> doth not allow any <hi>Worship</hi> to be given to the <hi>Altar.</hi> For this I appeal to that <hi>Canon</hi> wherein is contained the <hi>Explication</hi> of the <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> in this particular. <q>Whereas the Church is the House of <hi>God,</hi> dedicated to his holy Worship,<note place="margin">Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. <hi>c.</hi> 7.1640.</note> and therefore ought to mind us, both of the Greatness and Goodness of his Divine Majesty, certain it is that the acknowledgement thereof, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly in our hearts, but also out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with our bodies, must needs be pious in it self, profitable unto us, and edifying unto others. We therefore think it very meet and behooveful, and heartily commend it to all good and well affected People, members of this Church, that they be ready to ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord the said acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, by doing Reverence and obeysance both at their coming in and going out of the said Churches, Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, or Chappels, according to the
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:59802:451"/>
most ancient Custome of the Primitive Church in the purest times, and of this Church also for many years of the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The reviving therefore of this ancient and laudable custome, we heartily commend to the serious consideration of all good Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, NOT WITH ANY IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENTION TO EXHIBITE ANY RELIGIOUS WOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP TO THE COMMU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION TABLE, THE EAST OR THE CHURCH,</q> or any thing therein contained in so doing, or to perform the said gesture in the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Eucharist, upon any Opinion of the CORPORAL PRESENCE OF THE BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DY OF JESUS CHRIST ON THE HOLY TABLE OR IN THE MYSTICAL ELE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENTS, but ONLY for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Gods Majesty, and to give him ALONE that honour and glory that is due unto him and NO OTHER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WISE. And in the practice or omissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Rite, we desire that the Rule of charity prescribed by the Apostle may be observed, which is, That they which
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:59802:451"/>
use this Rite despise not them who use it not, and they who use it not, condemn not those that use it. This is the full declaration of the <hi>sense</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> about it, made by those who met in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,</hi> and were most zealous for the practice of it.<note place="margin">Speech in Star-Chamber. <hi>p.</hi> 43.</note> Agreeably to this <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop Laud</hi> speaks, when this was charged as an <hi>innovation; To this I answer,</hi> saith he, First, <hi>That God forbid that we should worship any thing but God himself.</hi> 2. <hi>That if to worship God when we enter into his House, or approach his Altar be an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was a very old one, being practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by</hi> Jacob, Moses, Hezekiah, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                        <hi>but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Altar: and Idolatry it is not to worship God towards his holy Table. Now with us the People did ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them fully and apply them to God,</hi>

                        <hi>and to none but God.</hi> From whence it appears that God is looked on as the <hi>sole Object</hi> of this <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> and that our <hi>Church</hi> declares, that it allows no <hi>intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of <hi>exhibiting any Religious worship to
<pb n="872" facs="tcp:59802:452"/>
the Communion Table,</hi> or <hi>East</hi> or <hi>Church,</hi> or any <hi>Corporal Presence of Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. That the adoration allowed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> is of a very different <hi>nature</hi> from the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>Images.</hi> For, (as I have fully made it appear in the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Controversie</hi>) the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth by the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Councils,</hi> require <hi>Religious worship to be given to Images</hi>; and that those who assert <hi>this inferiour worship</hi> do yet declare it to be <hi>truly Religious worship,</hi> and that the <hi>Images themselves</hi> are the <hi>Object</hi> of it: (whereas our Church declares point-blank the contrary) nay, that those <hi>Persons</hi> are looked on by the <hi>Generality</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> as suspected at least, if not condemned of <hi>Heresie,</hi> who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise all the <hi>external acts of adoration</hi> to <hi>Images,</hi> but yet do not in their minds look on them as <hi>Objects,</hi> but only as <hi>Occasions</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> which make the difference so plain in these two cases, that <hi>T. G.</hi> himself could not but discern it.</p>
                     <p>But to remove all scruple from mens minds, that suspect this practice to be too near the <hi>Idolatrous worship,</hi> which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> I shall consider it not only as to its <hi>Object</hi> (which is the
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:59802:452"/>
main thing, and which I have shewed to be the <hi>proper Object</hi> of <hi>worship,</hi> viz. <hi>God</hi> himself, and nothing else) but as to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>act,</hi> and the <hi>local circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of doing it <hi>towards the Altar.</hi> 1. As to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>act,</hi> so it is declared to be <hi>an act of external adoration of God</hi>; which I shall prove from <hi>Scripture</hi> to be a <hi>lawful</hi> and proper <hi>act</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship.</hi> I might prove it from the general <hi>consent</hi> of <hi>Mankind,</hi> who have expressed their <hi>Reverence</hi> to the <hi>Deity</hi> by <hi>acts</hi> of <hi>external adoration,</hi> from whence I called it a <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral act of Reverence,</hi> but I rather choose to do it from <hi>Scripture</hi>; and that, both before the <hi>Law</hi> had determined so punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> and <hi>under the Law</hi> by those who had the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test regard to it; and <hi>under the Gospel,</hi> when the <hi>spiritual nature</hi> of its doctrine would seem to have superseded such exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts of worship. 1. <hi>Before the Law,</hi> I instance in <hi>Abraham's servant</hi>; because <hi>Abraham</hi> is particularly commended for his care in instructing his <hi>Houshold to keep the way of the Lord</hi> in opposition to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idolatry,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 18.19.</note> and this was the <hi>Chief Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> of his House, of whom it is said three times in one Chapter, <hi>That he bowed

                        <hi>whereby we express our inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or Subjection to another.</hi> So it is said of the <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> when they heard that the <hi>Lord</hi> intended to deliver them out of <hi>Egypt, They bowed their heads and worshipped</hi>;<note place="margin">Exod. 4.31.</note> when <hi>Moses</hi> declared the <hi>Institution</hi> of the <hi>Passeover</hi> to all the <hi>Elders</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> it is said again, <hi>The People bowed their heads and worshipped.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">12.27.</note> 2. <hi>Under the Law</hi>; when they were so strictly forbidden in the same words <hi>to bow down or worship any Image or similitude</hi>; yet the outward <hi>act</hi> of <hi>adoration</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> was <hi>allowed</hi> and <hi>practised.</hi> So <hi>Moses</hi> commanded <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>seventy Elders</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>bow themselves a far off</hi>; the very same <hi>word</hi> which is used in the <hi>second Commandment.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">24.1.</note> And when <hi>God</hi> had so severely punished the Israelites <hi>for bowing to the Golden Calf;</hi> yet when He appointed the <hi>Pillar</hi> of <hi>Fire</hi> for the <hi>Symbol</hi> of His <hi>own presence,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">22.8.</note> it is said, <hi>That when all the People saw the Cloudy Pillar stand at the
<pb n="875" facs="tcp:59802:453"/>
Tabernacle door, they rose up and bowed themselves every man in his Tent-door.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">33.10.</note> When <hi>God</hi> appeared to <hi>Moses,</hi> it is said, <hi>That he made hast and bowed his head to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the earth and worshipped.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">34.8.</note> And when <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> came to the <hi>door</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> of the <hi>Congregation,</hi> they are said <hi>to fall upon their faces.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Numb. 20.6.</note> In the time of <hi>David,</hi> upon his solemn thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to <hi>God</hi> it is said,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 29.20.</note> 
                        <hi>All the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion blessed the Lord God of their Fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Lord and the King.</hi> And in the time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.29.</note> 
                        <hi>When they had made an end of offering, the King and all that were present with him bowed their heads and worshipped.</hi> 3. <hi>Under the Gospel</hi>; we are to observe the difference between the same <hi>external act of worship,</hi> when it was used towards <hi>Christ</hi> and toward His <hi>Apostles.</hi> When the <hi>Syrophoenician woman</hi> came to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in one place it is said, <hi>She worshipped Him</hi>; and in another,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.25.</note> 
                        <hi>That she fell at His feet</hi>; but in no place is there the least mention of any check given to her or any others,<note place="margin">Mark 7.25.</note> who after that manner <hi>worshipped Christ:</hi> But when <hi>Cornelius</hi> came to S. <hi>Peter,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 10.25, 26.</note> and <hi>fell down at his feet and worshipped him,</hi> he would by no
<pb n="876" facs="tcp:59802:454"/>
means permit it, but said, <hi>Stand up, I my self also am a man</hi>:<note place="margin">Revel. 19.10.22.9.</note> And when S. <hi>Iohn fell down at the feet of the Angel,</hi> he would not suffer it, <hi>but bade him worship God.</hi> That which I observe from hence is, that even under the <hi>Gospel</hi> the <hi>external acts of Religious adoration</hi> are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> so that men are to blame when they give them to any <hi>Creature,</hi> but no <hi>Persons</hi> are condemned for giving them to <hi>God.</hi> And I desire those who scruple the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>giving to God such exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal adoration under the Gospel,</hi> how they can condemn those for <hi>Idolatry,</hi> who give it to any <hi>Creature,</hi> if it be not a thing which doth still belong to <hi>God?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if all the scruple be about the <hi>dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting</hi> this <hi>Adoration,</hi> one way more than another, I say still <hi>it is done in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Primitive Church,</hi> as our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> declares, and which every one knows, <hi>did worship towards the East</hi>; and this at the most is but a <hi>local circumstance</hi> of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Worship,</hi> which I have already shewed to be very different from an <hi>Object</hi> of it, when I discoursed of the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Israelites worshipping toward the Ark and the Cherubims.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="877" facs="tcp:59802:454"/>Thus, through the Assistance of God, I have gone through all the material points of <hi>T. G</hi>'s <hi>Book,</hi> which relate to the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nature</hi> of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; and have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently weighed and considered every thing that looketh like a <hi>difficulty</hi> in this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie</hi> about the <hi>Worship</hi> of <hi>Images,</hi> and do here sincerely protest, that I have not given any <hi>Answer,</hi> or delivered any <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> which is not agreeable not only to the inward <hi>sense</hi> of my <hi>Mind,</hi> but to the best of my understanding to the <hi>sense</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> And if the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties</hi> of <hi>T.

For I do not love to represent <hi>others</hi> worse than they are; but I daily pray to <hi>God</hi> to make both my self and <hi>others</hi> better: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I know I have the hearty concurrence of all who are truly <hi>Good.</hi>
