            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The TRYAL and CONDEMNATION of Dr. <hi>OLIVER PLUNKET</hi> Titular Primate of <hi>IRELAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Third of <hi>May</hi> 1681. in <hi>Eaſter</hi> 33. <hi>Carol. Secund. Reg.</hi> Dr. <hi>Oliver Plunket</hi> was arraigned at the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> Bar for High Treaſon for endeavouring and compaſſing the Kings Death, and to levy War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to alter the Religion there, and to introduce a foreign Power, and at his Arraignment, before his Plea, he urged for himſelf, that he was indicted of the ſame High Treaſon in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and arraigned, and at the day for his Tryal the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt him did not appear, and therefore he deſired to know if he could be tried here for the ſame Fact? The Court told him, that by a Statute made in this Kingdom, he might be tried in the Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> or by Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> in any part of <hi>England,</hi> for Facts ariſing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that his Arraignment there (he being never tried upon it) was not ſufficient to exempt him from being tried here; becauſe till a Tryal be paſſed, and there be a Conviction or Acquittal thereupon, an Arraignment, barely, is no Plea: For in ſuch Caſes the party is not put twice in danger of his Life, which only is the thing the Law in ſuch Caſes looks after to prevent. He then deſired time for his Witneſſes, which they told him he could not do till after Plea pleaded; whereupon he pleaded <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> and put himſelf upon the Country for his Tryal; and after ſome conſideration had about time to be allowed him to bring his Witneſſes from <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Court appointed the day for his Tryal, to be the firſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in next Term, which was full Five weeks time.</p>
            <p>And accordingly on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term, he was brought to his Tryal, and Proclamation, as in ſuch Caſes is uſual, being made, it proceeded thus.</p>

               <speaker>Plunket.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I have been kept cloſe Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner for a long time, a year and an half in Priſon; when I came from <hi>Ireland</hi> hither, I was told by perſons of good repute, and a Counſellour at Law, that I could not be tried here; and the reaſons they gave me were, that firſt the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and all other Statutes made here, were not received in <hi>Ireland,</hi> unleſs there were an expreſs mention made of <hi>Ireland</hi> in them: So that none were received there but ſuch as were before <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Act. So I came with that perſwaſion that I could not be tried here, till at my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment your Lordſhips told me it was not ſo, and that I muſt be tried here, though there was no expreſs mention made of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Now, my Lord, upon that, whereas my Witneſſes were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and I knew nothing of it, and the Records upon which I very much relye were in <hi>Ireland,</hi> your Lordſhip was pleaſed to give me time from the <hi>4th.</hi> of the laſt month to this day; and in the mean time, as your Lordſhip had the Affidavit here yeſterday, and as Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> can teſtifie, have not diſpatched only one, but two to <hi>Ireland:</hi> into the Counties of <hi>Armagh, Dublin, &amp;c.</hi> and where there were Records very material to my Defence: but the Clerk of the Crown would not give me any Copy of any Record at all, unleſs he had ſome expreſs Order from your Lordſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that whether it were that they were miſtaken, or wilfully refuſed. I could not get the Records which were very material for me. For in ſome of thoſe Records ſome of theſe that accuſe me were convicted of high Crimes, and others were Outlawed and Impriſoned, and broke Priſon; and there were other Records alſo of Excommunication againſt ſome of them, and I could not get the Records, unleſs your Lordſhip would inſtruct me in ſome way or other, how I can get over them that are moſt material for my Defence. The Servants that I ſent hence, and took Shipping for <hi>Ireland,</hi> were two days at Sea, and caſt back again, and from thence were forced to go to <hi>Holly Head,</hi> and from <hi>Holly Head</hi> in going to <hi>Dublin</hi> they were thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen days, the Winds were ſo contrary; and then my Servant went about to go into the County of <hi>Armagh</hi> and <hi>Derry,</hi> that were a Hundred miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Meath,</hi> and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; ſo that in ſo ſhort a time, my Lord, it was morally impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to have brought the Witneſſes over; and thoſe that were ready to have come, would not ſtir at all, unleſs they had a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42345:3"/>
Paſs from hence, becauſe ſome of them were <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> and they had heard that here ſome were taken Priſoners that were <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>man Catholicks,</hi> and that none ought to come without a Paſs; and they being Witneſſes againſt the King, they might be clapped up here, and brought into very ill condition: ſo they ſent one over that made Affidavit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>It was the Affidavit was read here yeſterday.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunket.</speaker>
               <p>So that, my Lord, I conceive your Lordſhip will think I did it not out of any intent to put off my Tryal; for Captain <hi>Richardſon</hi> is here, who knows that I writ by the Poſt, and deſired them to come with the Pacquet-Boat, and they writ over to the Captain after they were landed; ſo that I depended upon the Wind and the Weather for my Witneſſes, and wanted your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Order for the Records to be brought over, and that their Examination might be brought into Court, and their own original Examination here might be compared with it. So I humbly beg your Lordſhips favour, the Caſe is rare, and ſcarce happens in five hundred years, that one ſhould be in my circumſtances. I am come here where no Jury knows me, nor the Quality of my Adverſaries; If I had been in <hi>Ireland</hi> I would have put my ſelf upon my Tryal to morrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Witneſſes, before any Proteſtant Jury that knew them and me. And when the Orders went over, that I ſhould be tried in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that no <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> ſhould be upon the Jury, and ſo it was in both the Grand and other Jury; yet then when I came to my Tryal, after I was arraigned, not one appeared: This is manifeſt upon the Record and can be proved.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>There was no Proſecution of you there.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunket.</speaker>
               <p>But, my Lord, here is no Jury that knows me, or the quality of my Adverſaries; for they are not a Jury of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood that know them, and therefore my Caſe is not the ſame with other Caſes. Though I cannot harbour, nor do not, nor will not, nor ought not, the leaſt conceipt of hard meaſure and injuſtice; yet if I have not full time to bring my Records and Witneſſes altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I cannot make my Defence. Some were there then, ſome afar off, ſo that it was a miracle that in ſix or ſeven Counties they could do ſo much as they did: But they got in ſeven or eight of them, yet there were five or ſix wanting: Therefore I beſeech your Lordſhip that I may have time to bring my Records and Witneſſes, and then I

will defie all that is upon the Earth and under the Earth to ſay any thing againſt me.</p>

               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> 'tis in vain for you to talk and make this diſcourſe here now; you muſt know, that by the Laws of this Kingdom, when a man is indicted and arraigned of Treaſon or Felony, 'tis not uſual to give ſuch time; 'tis rare that any man hath had ſuch time as you have had, five weeks time to provide your Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: If your Witneſſes are ſo cautions, and are ſuch perſons that they dare not, or will not venture for fear of being apprehended, or will not come into <hi>England,</hi> without ſuch and ſuch cautions, we cannot tell how to help it; we can't furniſh you with Witneſſes, you muſt look to get your Witneſſes your ſelf; if we ſhould ſtay till your Witneſſes will come, perhaps they will never come here, and ſo you will eſcape out of the hands of Juſtice. Do not be diſcouraged in this, the Jury are ſtrangers to you peradventure, but they are honeſt Gentlemen, and you ſhall have no other upon your Jury; and you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that if there be not ſome Fact proved againſt you, that may amount to Treaſon, you ſhall be diſcharged; they are perſons that underſtand ſo much, and we will direct them ſo much. You ſhall have as fair a Tryal as if you were in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but for us to ſtay for your Witneſſes, or ſend you back to <hi>Ireland,</hi> we cannot do it: Therefore you muſt ſubmit to your Tryal. We heard your Affidavit yeſterday, and we did then tell the Gentlemen that moved it, as much as we tell you. You are here to be tried, look to the Jury as they are called, and except againſt them if you will.</p>

               <p>My Lord, we will quickly come to the Evidence. But in ſhort, You have heard his Charge is as high as can be againſt the King, and againſt the Nation, and againſt all that is good. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Endeavour of this Gentleman was the Death of the King, the Deſtruction of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the raiſing of War: And to accompliſh this, we charge him, that there was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy made, Aſſemblies and Conſultations had to theſe ends, and raiſing Mony to accompliſh it. Gentlemen, Dr. <hi>Plunket</hi> was made, as we ſhall prove to you, as they there call him, Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he got that Dignity from the Pope upon this very Deſign. He did by Vertue of that Power, which he thought he had gotten, make out Warrants, Significations, I know not what they call them, to know how many men in <hi>Ireland</hi> could bear Arms from ſixteen to forty; he raiſes Taxes upon the People and the Clergy there. But, my Lord, the particulars will beſt fall from the Witneſſes that we ſhall call and prove it by, and we need not make any aggravation; for ſuch a thing as this cannot be more aggravated than 'tis.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, the Character this Gentleman bears, as Primate under a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42345:6"/>
Foreign and uſurped Juriſdiction, will be a great inducement to you to give credit to that Evidence we ſhall produce before you. We ſhall prove, that this very Preferment was confer'd upon him upon a Contract, that he ſhould raiſe 60000 men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Pope's Service, to ſettle Popery there, and to ſubvert the Government. The Evidence that we ſhall give you, will prove how it leads to deſtroy the King, and I take it according to the reſolutions that have been, to raiſe War in the Kingdom, and to introduce a Foreign Power; will be certainly Evidence of an Attempt and Machination to deſtroy the King. Aſſoon as he was in poſſeſſion of his Primacy, he goes about his work. There are two great neceſſaries to be provided, Men and Money. For men, having this great ſpiritual Juriſdiction, whereby, indeed, all that are under it are become Slaves, he iſſues out his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants to all the Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give an account, and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the ſeveral Pariſhes, of all the men in them above fourteen and under ſixty. And Returns were accordingly made by them, that he might accordingly take a meaſure what men to pick out for the Service. The next thing was Money, my Lord; and your Lordſhip takes notice, that when the Mind is enſlaved, the Purſe, nay all the Body bows to it. He iſſues out his Warrants to his Clergy, to make a Collection of Mony, in all parts great Sums were levied, and when they were levied, we ſhall give you an accompt by our Proofs, that ſeveral Sums were iſſued out, and ſent into <hi>France</hi> to further the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. There was alſo proviſion made of great Ammunition and Arms, and we ſhall prove in particular, ſeveral delivered out by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Order, to carry on this thing; and to go through ſtitch with this buſineſs, he takes a view of all the ſeveral Ports and places in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where it would be convenient to land: for they were to have from <hi>France</hi> an Auxiliary Force, and upon his view he pitched upon <hi>Carlingford</hi> as the place. We ſhall prove the ſeveral Correſpondencies between <hi>Rome</hi> and him, and <hi>France</hi> and him, and ſeveral Meſſengers imployed, and Monies iſſued out from time to time for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. This will be the courſe of our Evidence; and we ſhall begin firſt with ſome that do not ſpeak ſo particularly to this Doctor, but prove there was a general Deſign in all parts of the Kingdom of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to bring in the King of <hi>France,</hi> and extirpate the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And then we ſhall call the particular perſons to the particular Facts againſt him. Firſt we call <hi>Florence Wyer. [Who was ſworn.]</hi>

               <p>Pray give the Court and the Jury an account of what you know of any Plot in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to introduce the Romiſh Religion, or to bring in the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wyer.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I know there was a Plot, both before <hi>Plunket</hi>'s time, and in his time; for it was working in the years 65. and 66. but it was brought to full maturitie in the Year 1667. For then Col. <hi>Miles Rely,</hi> and Col. <hi>Bourne</hi> was ſent to <hi>Ireland</hi> from the King of <hi>France,</hi> with a Commiſſion to muſter as many men as he could, promiſing to ſend an Army of 40000 men with a Commiſſion, upon St. <hi>Lewis</hi> day in <hi>Auguſt</hi> next following, to land at <hi>Carbingford,</hi> to deſtroy all the true Subjects, to deſtroy the Religion as it was eſtabliſhed there, and to ſet up the <hi>French</hi> Kings Authority and the Roman-Catholick Religion. And one <hi>Edmond Angle</hi> that was a Juſtice of Peace and Clerk of the Crown, ſent for all the Rebels abroad in the North to come up into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Longford,</hi> and they marched into the head Town of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſired the Town; the Inhabitants fled into the Caſtle: then they came up to the Gaol, thinking to break it open, and by ſeting the Priſoners free, to join them with them; but then <hi>Angle</hi> was ſhot, received a deadly wound, and drop'd off his Horſe, and they fled. So then when they were without the Town, one <hi>Charles Mac Canell</hi> alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and took away all the Papers out of his pocket; which, if they had been found, would have diſcovered all. This occaſioned Col. <hi>Bourne</hi> to be ſuſpected; and being ſo ſuſpected, he was taken Priſoner, and turned to <hi>Newgate</hi> in <hi>Dublin.</hi> Then Col. <hi>Reiley</hi> ſled away again to <hi>France,</hi> and the Plot lay under a cloud during the life of Primate <hi>Reiley</hi> the Priſoners Predeceſſor. This Primate <hi>Reiley</hi> died beyond Sea. Then many of the Popiſh Religion would have had the Primacie conferred upon one <hi>Duffy;</hi> but the Priſoner at the Bar put in for it; which might have been oppoſed, if the Priſoner had not engaged and promiſed that he would ſo manage affairs, that before the preſent Government were aware, he would ſurpriſe the Kingdom, provided the Pope and King of <hi>France</hi> would ſend a competent Army to join with theirs for the effecting of it. So the firſt Year of his coming over, I was in the Friery at <hi>Armagh:</hi> I was an acquaintance of the Friers, and they invited me. And one <hi>Quine</hi> told the Priſoner, that they thought <hi>Duffy</hi> would have been Primate. Said he, 'Tis better as it is; for <hi>Duffy</hi> hath not the Wit to do thoſe things that I have undert<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Told whom?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wyer.</speaker>
               <p>The Priſoner, that he did expect <hi>Duffy</hi> ſhould have been Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate? but the Priſoner made anſwer, 'Tis better as it is; for <hi>Duffy</hi> had not the Wit to manage the things that I have undertaken for the general good of our Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Now tell me this? What things were thoſe he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken? did he explain himſelf?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wyer.</speaker>
               <p>No further than thoſe words: But I did conceive this was his

meaning; becauſe I knew partly of it my ſelf, knowing of the former Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>I ask you only what words came from him; and you ſay they were, That <hi>Duffy</hi> had not the Wit to manage what he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the general good of their Religion.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wyer.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; and then again in his Aſſembly, kept by him, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Inferiours to collect ſuch ſeveral Sums of Mony as he thought fit, according to the ſeveral Pariſhes and Dignities, to aſſiſt and ſupply the <hi>French</hi> Forces when they came over.</p>

               <p>I have ſeen the Mony collected; and I have ſeen his Warrant <hi>ſub poena ſuſpenſionis</hi> to bring it in, to redeem their Religion from the power of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government. Again, there were thoſe Rebels that went to <hi>Longford—</hi>

            <sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wyer.</speaker>
               <p>9 Year, 8 Year, 7 Year ago, and the laſt Year of all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Then it was ſeveral times, you ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Wyer.</speaker>
               <p>Yes; and he procured the <hi>Macdonels</hi> a piece of Mony out of the Exchequer, pretending to do good Service to his Majeſty; but he ſent them for <hi>France,</hi> meaning they ſhould improve themſelves and bring themſelves into favour with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and come over with the <hi>French</hi> King to ſurprize <hi>Ireland.</hi> This one of the ſaid Rebels told me. So I have ſeen the Priſoners Letter directed to the grand To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Flemming,</hi> deſiring that they ſhould go to <hi>France,</hi> and he would ſee them, in ſpight of all their enemies in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſafe aſhoar. And <hi>Flemming</hi> ſhould return again a Colonel, to his own glory, and the good of his Country.</p>

               <p>Yes, I do as well as my own. I have ſeen Capt. <hi>O Neal,</hi> Son of General <hi>O Neal,</hi> coming every year into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and carrying three Regiments to the <hi>French</hi> King into <hi>France;</hi> and he uſed to come over to <hi>Ireland</hi> every year to get a recruit; and he did get my Brother to go with him, and ſo much importun'd me, that I could hardly withſtand him; but I did not yield to his deſire: He told me it was to improve me for my good; to improve my ſelf in Military Diſcipline, and then I ſhould return for <hi>Ireland</hi> a Captain under the <hi>French</hi> King, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize the Kingdom and ſettle the Popiſh Religion, and then I ſhould be reſtored to my Eſtate.</p>

               <p>He ſays, my Lord, that 10 years ago I had ſuch a deſign in hand, and he knew the Mony was collected for theſe very ends, and he knew of the deſign from that ſame Capt. <hi>O Neal</hi> whom I employed and ſent abroad; and that I had a deſign to bring in the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford,</hi> and went about to all the Ports in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and pitched upon that as the moſt convenient; and yet it is ſo inconvenient for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Foreign Force, that any one that knows any thing of the Maps of the World, will eaſily conclude it otherwiſe. But, I ſay, my Lord, why did not he tell ſome Juſtice of the Peace that I was upon ſuch a deſign, but let me live in <hi>Ireland</hi> 10 Years after, and never ſpake of it till now?</p>

               <p>When he ſaw me all the time, and to the time of my taking Priſoner, and never ſaid one word; for I was a Priſoner 6 months only for my Religion, not one word of Treaſon ſpoken of againſt me for ſo many Years: why did not he acquaint ſome Juſtice of the Peace with it before?</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duffy.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I was in the ſame Conſult my ſelf, and was as willing to proceed in the matter as any one in the world.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Duff.</speaker>
               <p>As I am a Chriſtian, I have been a hundred times in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. And when you were creating Prieſts, you would always ſend for me to be preſent; and I wonder how the man ſhould forget himſelf?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunket.</speaker>
               <p>I do not ſay I have not ſeen him, or that I am a ſtranger to the man; but in the company of Biſhop <hi>Duffy</hi> I never ſaw him, nor I never ſent him Orders to pay any mony: and if he did pay any mony, he might ſhew the Order.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Duffy</hi> did ſend me to Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunkets,</hi> and I met Dr. <hi>Plunket</hi> as I was coming out of the City. I had been half a year at the Spaniſh Embaſſadours, and he ſent me for <hi>Ireland</hi> again, and then I lived at the Convent in <hi>Dublin;</hi> and then when I knew that he
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42345:13"/>
would come to Town, I went to <hi>Rings end,</hi> where the Ships came in, to meet him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunk.</speaker>

               <speaker>Duff.</speaker>
               <p>Yes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunk.</speaker>
               <p>If you were, you were inviſible: But I ask you, why did not you tell this to ſome Juſtice of the Peace?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Juſt. <hi>Dolben.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Good Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> he tells you he was as willing to forward it then as you.</p>

               <p>How come you now to change your mind?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duffy.</speaker>
               <p>I went into <hi>France</hi> in (77) and I was not a year there alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but when I have ſeen how the poor people there are brought into ſuch ſlavery by the <hi>French</hi> King, I thought of it, and had rather the Devil ſhould reign over us, than the <hi>Frenchman.</hi>
               </p>

            <sp>

               <p>He gives you a very good rational account why.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duff.</speaker>
               <p>I have been at Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunkets,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Patrick Plunkets,</hi> where there fell ſome variance about ſomething this man had done to Father <hi>Duffy.</hi> Says Biſhop <hi>Duffy,</hi> I might have had you drawn and quartered, if I were as ill a man as you: and I might have been Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> if I would have undertaken thoſe things that you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took. Upon that, ſays Sir <hi>Nicholas Plunket,</hi> What is that? Why, it was ſaid it was to raiſe 60000 men in <hi>Ireland</hi> at any time whenever the <hi>French</hi> or the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King ſhould wage War with <hi>England, Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland.</hi> And this man did confeſs before my face to Father <hi>Duffy,</hi> that it was not only to exalt himſelf, but all the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and all the Gentry that had loſt their Eſtates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunk.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Duffy,</hi> one word with you; Is not this out of malice to me for correcting ſome of the Clergy?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Duff.</speaker>
               <p>You had nothing to do with me, for I was a Friar.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Swear <hi>Edmond Murfey. (which was done.)</hi> Tell your whole knowledge of Dr. <hi>Plunket</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Plot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Murf.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe you my Lord. I was one of the firſt Diſcoverers of this Plot; but of nine Witneſſes, I have but one in Town.</p>

               <p>Yes, Titular Primate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Att. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>Under whom did he claim that Authority? under the King, or under the Pope?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Murf.</speaker>
               <p>I think he could not be under the King at all.</p>

               <p>Why then I would ask you a little; you remember I was by, and 'tis no laughing matter, Mr. <hi>Murfey,</hi> you will find it ſo. What do you know of any Orders iſſued out by Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> to raiſe mony from the Prieſts?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>I think it was about this. If the D. of <hi>York,</hi> and the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> fell out together, that he had ſome men to raiſe about that matter, and if the D. of <hi>Monmouth</hi> would raiſe the Proteſtant Religion—</p>

ſuller than <hi>Duffy</hi> to the Grand Jury. Afterwards about 3 weeks ago the Tryal coming on, he ran away and lay hid, I took a great deal of pains to find him out, and ſent Meſſengers about; at laſt I heard he was got to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadors, I ſent, and they ſpied him in the Chappel; but the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſadors Servants fell upon the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and beat him; the Embaſſador was firſt ſent to about it, and his Excellency promiſed that he ſhould be brought, and when he was found he told me but the laſt night, that all he had ſworn before the Grand Jury was true, and he was ready to make it out again.</p>

is never a Nation where the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion is profeſſed, but hath an Agent for their Spiritual Affairs at <hi>Rome,</hi> and this was for the Spiritual Affairs of the Clergy of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>I deſire nothing, that is a truth, every Nation hath an Agent, and that Agent muſt be maintained; and the reaſon is this, becauſe we have many Colledges beyond Sea, and ſo there is no Country of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, but hath an Agent in <hi>Rome.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>About this Letter you were ſpeaking of, pray, will you tell what fell out about it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Moyer.</speaker>
               <p>I will tell you how it fell out afterwards. Then I came along into <hi>Marſeilles</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and there were 2 Captains that had as much notice as I had in that Letter, for they were diſcourſing that they would advance themſelves in the <hi>French</hi> Kings Service, and hoped, that by the King of <hi>France</hi>'s help to have the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith ſet up in their own Country; why, that diſcourſe paſſed off, for I was mightily afraid of any ſuch thing, becauſe I was of another opinion; for perhaps I might think the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith would flouriſh as well as ever it did, and hoped ſo as well as any body elſe, but not by the Sword. As I came to <hi>Madrid,</hi> there came one <hi>Hugh O Donnell,</hi> Son to <hi>O Donnell,</hi> with Letters of Recommendation, and thoſe Letters were to intitle the young man Earl of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and likewiſe that his Majeſty the King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould help him for <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the form of the Letters he had. And then as I came for <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſpeedily after there came Letters of Recommendation to me, that I ſhould preſent ſent my ſelf to my Lord Primate, to hear Confeſſions, and be heard preach. I came to his Lordſhip at his own Houſe the <hi>9th.</hi> of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> (74) and there he kept me ſeveral hours, and approved me; and the Copy of the Approbation I have to ſhew. And after a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute we went aſide, and went to look Father <hi>Patrick,</hi> and there he ſhewed me ſuch and ſuch things. And after a long diſcourſe I told my Lord Primate, I ſee your Lordſhips Letter, which you ſent by young <hi>O Neal,</hi> in ſuch a place, and he ſhewed me the Contents of it; and, ſaid I, Ay, my Lord, 'tis a good Intention &amp; Deſign, if it can be done without Bloodſhed; then my Lord muſed a little, and, ſaid he, well Father <hi>Francis,</hi> (which is my name in Religion, my Chriſtian name is <hi>John)</hi> pray will you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42345:19"/>
keep it ſecret, well my Lord, ſaid I, you need not fear; for, ſaid he, what ever I have done herein was not for my own good, but for the publick good of the Catholicks. Well, ſaid I, 'tis well, Then does he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me into the Pariſh of where this Mr. <hi>Murfey</hi> here was to put in a Bull, that I had from my Lord Primate, which Bull was brought here laſt year; and there he proferod me high Promotions, if I would further ſuch things, and ſolicite ſuch Gentlemen as I knew would be private in ſuch a buſineſs, ſuch as were old Commanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my Friends and Relations. Shortly after this I ſaw <hi>Plunket</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel,</hi> and Captain <hi>Con O Neal</hi> practiſing to bring Souldiers ready for <hi>Ireland,</hi> aſſoon as they could get opportunity. This Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Con O Neal</hi> coming to the place where we kept our Priory, and he and his Brothers were Sons to General <hi>O Neal.</hi> And there Captain <hi>Con</hi> comes in the night time and lodges with us, and diſcourſed with his Brother and I, becauſe I was his Companion beyond Sea, about theſe matters, That he expected my Lord Primate and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrels</hi> coming thither that night, to make ſome propoſals about the Church and other Aſſairs. After ten a clock, or thereabouts, my Lord Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> came with others in their company, and there they and Father <hi>O Neal</hi> did conſult amongſt themſelves, that they ſhould ſend Captain <hi>Con</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> and to <hi>Barcellona,</hi> with ſuch and ſuch Inſtruments; and ſending thoſe Inſtruments away, Captain <hi>Con</hi> departs the Country and goes for <hi>France</hi> ſoon after; and ſpeedily my Lord Primate undertook, that he and Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> ſhould view <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſee how Affairs ſtood. Soon after my Lord Primate calls a General Provincial Council, and ſends out his Orders to levy ſuch and ſuch Taxes and Subſides, and Warrants to all the Pariſh Prieſts, that they ſhould give them new Liſts to know whether the Numbers they had ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> before, would comply with that Liſt. And then <hi>O Neal</hi> went to view the Forts of <hi>Charlemont</hi> and <hi>Dun Gannon,</hi> whileſt thoſe Lords did collect the mony; the Orders I have ſeen with my own proper Eyes, and his own man confeſſed before the Council in <hi>Ireland</hi> that my Lord gave them under his Hand.</p>

               <p>To Levy ſo much Mony <hi>per</hi> Prieſt. I cannot remember the particular Sum; but that every Prieſt ſhould give ſo much towards an Agent in <hi>Rome</hi> to Solicite their buſineſs and forward it.</p>

Your paternities paternal Letter and Citation homeward, I did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly peruſe. As for my Lord <hi>O.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Moyer.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and afterwards, when he ſaw I was in communication and familiar with theſe Privy Councellors, then he was certain I had diſcovered the matter, and then he got a great many devices to get the Letters out of my hand.</p>

And that you, in order to this, did take a Survey of all thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks that were able to bear Arms, from 16 to 60; and there is plentiful
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42345:22"/>
Evidence, that you did go a Circuit there to peruſe all the Towns, and ſee which might be moſt convenient for the taking in, and enter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taining the <hi>French,</hi> and landing their Forces; and <hi>Charlemont,</hi> you did deſign that for one ſtrong place to be taken, and <hi>Dun-Gannon</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther, and that you did deſign the <hi>French</hi> Army to land at <hi>Carlingford,</hi> and all that was with you, tells the reaſon you gave, why that ſhould be the place, that they might come up with a burdened Ship to the very Gates of the Town, that you did, in order to the entertaining theſe foreign Forces, raiſe mony, that you did ſend out your Orders <hi>ſub poena ſuſpenſionis</hi> to all that were of the <hi>Roman</hi> Clergy, and that this mony was received, ſeveral of them teſtified that they paid it to you, and this man hath ſeen great numbers of perſons pay mony to you upon theſe accounts.

               <p>My Lord, firſt as to the firſt point, I anſwer, that I never re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceived a farthing of mony out of my own Diſtrict, and but for my own Livelihood, and that I can prove by thoſe that have received it for me, that I never received over threeſcore pound a year in my life, unleſs ſome Genleman would now and then give me 10 <hi>s.</hi> for my relief. For, my Lord, this is the way in <hi>Ireland,</hi> every Prieſt hath ſo many Families allotted to him, and every <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Family gives 2 <hi>s.</hi> a year <hi>(as they that profeſs that way, know)</hi> and the Prieſts give me who am Superior over them, in my own Diſtrict, ſome 20 <hi>s.</hi> ſome 30 <hi>s.</hi> and I never got ſo much in my life as to maintain a Servant, and this was atteſted before the Council in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I ſay I could never get ſo much as to keep a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and till now I never got a farthing out of my own Dioceſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I have been called to an Arbitration or ſome ſuch thing, it may be for my Journey and Expences 40 or 50 miles they would give me ſomething for my maintenance; if you ſhould find any thing elſe, I will be content to ſuffer; and if my Evidence were brought from <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there is nothing but what would be made clear, both under their own Hands and by Records, and that is all well known, and was atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in his preſence before the Council in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which threeſcore pounds was a very ſmall thing to maintain me, and I never had above one Servant, and the Houſe I lived in was a little Thatch'd Houſe,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42345:23"/>
wherein was only a little Room for a Library, which was not 7 foot high, where once this fellow came to affront me, becauſe I had hindred him from begging, and that's for the Mony. For the Men, I defie any one that ever ſee me make a Liſt of Men in my life, or can produce any Liſt made by my Order. I was never in my life at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> at <hi>Cork,</hi> at <hi>Dun-Gannon,</hi> at <hi>Limerick,</hi> &amp;c. or thoſe parts of <hi>Munſter</hi> which were the chief Ports where the <hi>French</hi> ſhould come in, and not in <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> which is the narrow Seas in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> which any one that knows the World will judg to be a very improper place for the <hi>French</hi> to land in. 'Tis all one as to ſay that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould come in at a poor place where they could get nothing, it being at the narrow Seas, and they never ſaw me there in their lives.</p>

               <speaker>Plunk.</speaker>
               <p>Well, one does ſay he ſaw me there, but if I had my Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes here, I could prove he was a Friar, and declared an Apoſtate by his own Provincial, as this Gentleman is, and becauſe I hindred them to beg in my Diſtricts, therefore they have this malice againſt me, that is all. Well, my Lord, that is for that: I was never in my life in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naght;</hi> and they cannot ſay, I took any Liſt in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> nor was twelve miles in <hi>Munſter</hi> in my life: But thus, my Lord, ſometimes there would be, as our way is, ſo many Families aſſigned to every Prieſt, <hi>(and this is the plain truth)</hi> this Prieſt perhaps complains to me of the inequality, my companion near me hath 150, and I have but three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore, which I muſt rectifie; though I never knew but one of theſe Complaints. And if I had my Witneſſes from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Records, I would defie all theſe Witneſſes together. For my ſending to <hi>Rome,</hi> I had never an Agent in <hi>Rome</hi> for theſe ſeven years paſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I was not able to maintain him, and indeed it was a great ſhame to us; becauſe there is never a Community of Fryers, that hath a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge beyond Sea, but hath ſome Agent at <hi>Rome.</hi>

               <p>Only this, my Lord, your Lordſhip ſees how I am dealt with. Firſt and foremoſt, I have not time to bring my Witneſſes, or my Records, which if I had, I would not weigh one farthing to leave my Cauſe with any Jury in the world. Beſides all this, I am brought out of my own native Country, where theſe men lived, and I lived, and where my Witneſſes and Records are, which would ſhew what theſe people are. I ſent by the Poſt and did all that I could, and what can I ſay when I have not my Witneſſes againſt theſe people, they may ſwear any thing in the world; you cannot but obſerve the improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the thing in it ſelf, and unto what a condition I am brought. My Lord, my Life is in iminent danger, becauſe I am brought out of my own Country, where theſe people would not be believed againſt me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sol. Gen.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I think this matter lies in a narrow compaſs, the Evidence hath been long; I would only repeat the ſhort Heads of that which hath been given at large. He is indectid for a Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to kill the King, the Overt act is an Endeavour to introduce a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to raiſe an Army, and levy War there; and the Proof of it hath been very full. The Proof in general, that there was a Plot to introduce the <hi>French,</hi> is plain by all the Witneſſes, and the Proof in particular upon this perſon at the Bar, hath been as plain as any thing can be. They prove to your Lordſhip in general, that there was an Expectation that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould come in, that there was an Invitation of <hi>Florence Wyer</hi> the firſt Witneſs, to go over into <hi>France,</hi> and ſpeedily he ſhould have a Command upon his return, in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that there were Preparations; for this appears by the Oath of Secrecy given to ſeveral men. Forty men that came along with Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> to keep it private during their lives; and there was a farther proof of that general Conſpiracy by <hi>Duffy,</hi> that when there was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meeting of ſo many thouſand people for Confirmation, there was by the Gentlemen at that meeting a ſecret Conſultation how to carry on the Deſign, and how to liſt men, and to look out the old Officers in the late Rebellion, and to ſee what poſture they were in, as to the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42345:24"/>
of this Deſign, and this comes now particularly to the Priſoner who was by at this Conſultation, ſo the Witneſſes do tell you. But that that comes nearer to him, is, that he did iſſue out Orders for the raiſing of Mony, and that he did raiſe Mony purſuant to thoſe Orders, and did receive Mony for that very purpoſe; this is proved by three Witneſſes, <hi>Duffy,</hi> and <hi>Mac Legh,</hi> who paid the Mony, and by <hi>Moyer</hi> the laſt Witneſs, who ſaw him receive it from ſeveral Perſons. This is poſitive upon him; nay, they ſay farther, that there was a Liſt made of the ſeveral men, in the ſeveral Pariſhes, that were able to bear Arms upon occaſion, from ſixteen to ſixty, and there was a Liſt of a matter of threeſcore thouſand men that were ready upon any occaſion to riſe for the purpoſe, and this Liſt was delivered over into the hands of the Priſoner at the Bar. There is one Witneſs, <hi>Duffy,</hi> that ſays farther, that he ſaw a Letter under his hand in <hi>France</hi> to the Cardinal <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to invite the French King into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and he did wonder that he ſhould ſpend his Time and Blood in Wars againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> which was a Roman Catholick, and not come into <hi>Ireland</hi> to extirpate the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. And this Letter is confirmed by another Letter, which was ſeen by <hi>Moyer,</hi> a Copy of which is produced, which he tranſlated from the Original in Latin, and the Letter was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Neal O Neal,</hi> whom the Priſoner ſays he had no concern for, but to give him ſome Recommendations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunket.</speaker>
               <p>I gave him no Recommendations.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, he ſays he did not give him any, nor ſent any Letter by him.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Then he urged, that he went along begging by the way, but 'tis proved he was ſent by him, and ſent with Letters, and that by his Brother in Law, who met him at <hi>Mants.</hi> And 'tis proved by <hi>Moyer,</hi> who ſaw the Letter opened, taking it to be but a common Letter of Recommendation, he read the Letter and took a Copy of it, and tranſlated that Copy, which Tranſlation is enough to verifie all the matter which the Witneſſes have ſworn, for 'tis agreeing to what he ſaid to Cardinal <hi>Bouillon</hi> in his other Letter, that it was more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Catholick Princes to agree together to extirpate Hereſie, than to vary amongſt themſelves, that now was the time: for there were threeſcore thouſand Men ready to riſe upon ſuch an Invaſion. This is the ſubſtance of the Letter, and this proves fully the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy this man was ingaged in, his receiving Mony, his Liſting Men,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42345:25"/>
and his Invitation of Foreign Princes. And this is fully proved.</p>

               <p>It was likewiſe agreed that <hi>Carling ford</hi> ſhould be the Port, and 'tis like enough to be the Port, for 'tis a very large Port, that Ships of the greateſt Burthen may come up to the Town, and the Town it ſelf but a weak Town. This is the ſubſtance of the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and this is proof enough, we think, to convict any man of this Fact.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Serj. <hi>Jeff.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall trouble you but with one word that hath been omitted. I think 'tis a Cauſe of great Example, and that thing which the Priſoner ſeems to make his Excuſe hath been anſwered by a Favor and Indulgence from the Court in a very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner. For, in as much as this Gentleman would make it a very hard caſe, That he is brought out of his own Country, and hath not his Witneſſes; it is very well known that by a particular Favor of the Court, which is not uſual in theſe Caſes, he had between five and ſix weeks time for preparation for his Tryal: ſo that truly as to what does appear, I think all the Witneſſes that have been examined, are Witneſſes to be credited, except you Gentlemen, of your ſelves can convict upon your own knowledge theſe Perſons of any Miſdemeanor, which I think you cannot, much leſs of Perjurie. But beſides, the Witneſſes we have produced, all which ſpeak to the Plot in general, and four of them fix it upon the Perſon at the Bar; they ſpeak parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, and every one agrees in Circumſtances, and that other that ſpoke mincingly, I put it upon; it is the greateſt Evidence that can be. For that perſon that could come before a Grand Jury, and there be the main Witneſs, but when he comes here, muſt be ſcru'd and pump'd to diſcover the ſeventy thouſand men. And I ſuppoſe you did obſerve how difficult it was to know of him, whether this Perſon was Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or whether it were from the authority of the King or the Pope, a very probable thing, that he ſhould be ſuch a one as the King deſigned to be Primate and Superintendent of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Further, my Lord, this I deſire to take notice of too, that <hi>Wyer,</hi> the firſt Witneſs, fixes four particular things upon the Priſoner at the Bar, which have not yet been taken notice of. Firſt he fixes a diſcourſe with another perſon that was Competitor with him for this very Office, Biſhop <hi>Duffy,</hi> and he gives the reaſon why he was admitted into the Office rather than the other, becauſe he was a man of greater Ability to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42345:25"/>
carry on the Deſign, and though he does not give you an account of the Deſign; yet the reſt of the Evidence do, and make it to be the Deſign then carrying on. Another thing is, he tells you of the ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one into <hi>France,</hi> that was to come back again in order to this Deſign, I think his name was <hi>Mac Donnel,</hi> and then the great Tory <hi>Flemming</hi> and he were to come back again Colonels in the Army that was to be raiſed. The next perſon, that fixes it upon him, is Mr. <hi>Han O Neal,</hi> and he gives the plaineſt Circumſtances, That at a time in <hi>Auguſt</hi> when Biſhop <hi>Tyrrel</hi> came to the Houſe of one <hi>Bradey</hi> with ſo many men well equipped with ſuch and ſuch Arms, and took the Oath of Secreſie; he himſelf, but not only he, but the other Prieſt <hi>Mac Legh,</hi> was preſent at the ſame time, and took the ſaid Oath, and he does tell you that that very Prieſt was ſent to <hi>Dublin</hi> to diſcover it at that very time, and ſo he hath fixed the Perſon, and Time, and the Buſineſs they came about. Then <hi>Mac Legh</hi> comes and tells you the ſame thing in every circumſtance; Ay, but ſays the Priſoner at the Bar, and he would make it to be a great Objection, How chance that they have concealed this all the while, and not diſcovered it to ſome Juſtice of the Peace? Why, ſays one, I was under your Juriſdiction in that place, that is the very reaſon he gives wherefore he durſt not, and ſays another, I was concerned and as earneſt as the Priſoner or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny body elſe, but going into <hi>France,</hi> I obſerved the ſlavery that all the Subjects were under, under the Tyranny of that King, and apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſame King was to come into <hi>Ireland</hi> by the means of theſe Gentlemen; I was concerned at it, and had rather the Devil ſhould reign over us than ſuch an one, and therefore I will diſcover it. And he ſaid very well I think, that he had rather have the Devil to reign; for it ſeems to be him, or one in his ſhape that reigns after that manner. And there are two perſons that ſwear to the very year that they were obliged to raiſe the mony, and ſwear poſitively, they ſaw his Orders <hi>ſub poena ſuſpenſionis,</hi> I do not know whether they mean hang'd or ſuſpended from their Office. But it ſeems it was ſo terrible that it made them pay twenty Shillings a piece for three years ſucceſſively. And there is another Gentleman that tells you, that out of a ſmall Living, wherein he was concerned only as Curate to a third perſon it had been paid two or three times; and another, though he was exempt himſelf from the payment, yet ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident was he of the Priſoner's at the Bar, that he was preſent when
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42345:26"/>
he ſaw thirty or fourty pay this Tax, and whereas the Priſoner at the Bar would make it thought a ſtrange thing, that he ſhould raiſe ſo much mony, who had but a houſe ſeven foot high, it ſeems there is above that thatch'd houſe a Chappel.</p>

            <sp>

               </speaker>
               <p>But now, my Lord, that which ſubſtantially proves what theſe Witneſſes ſay, is the Letter that is ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Secretary of the College <hi>De propaganda Fide,</hi> which is the laſt Letter that the laſt Gentleman ſpeaks of, wherein he does particularly take notice, that he had taken care to raiſe ſuch moneys, and view all the Ports and places of ſtrength. And, my Lord, that which is a very great circumſtance to back the Evidence of the firſt Letter to the French Cardinal <hi>Bouillon</hi> which was taken notice of by the firſt Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and there is ſuch a paſſage in this too, that the Catholick Princes ſhould not ſpill one anothers blood, when they might better employ it here in <hi>Ireland</hi> for the propagation of the Faith; this laſt Letter takes particular notice of that very inſtance too, that inſtead of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Swords againſt one another, they had better come to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Catholick Faith in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Theſe four Witneſſes are pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual and preciſe in every particular circumſtance of the Caſe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them there is nothing but the common Objection. If I had ſuch Records, and Witneſſes here, I could make my Defence; that is, if he had thoſe things that he has not, he might appear to be another man than he is; but I am ſure, as it appears upon the Evidence that hath been given by all the Witneſſes, there is a plain proof and a full proof of every Treaſon laid to his Charge.</p>

               <p>Look you, Gentlemen of the Jury, This Gentleman here, Mr. <hi>Plunket</hi> is indicted of High-Treaſon, and 'tis for Conſpiring the King's Death, and endeavouring to bring the <hi>French</hi> Army into <hi>Ireland</hi> for to Invade that Kingdom, and to plant the Romiſh Religion in that Kingdom. You have had Evidence againſt him that hath been fully examined. And theſe things do ſeem to be very plain by the Witneſſes, That he himſelf hath taken a Commiſſion, or a Grant, or what you will pleaſe to call it, from the Pope to be Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he hath taken upon him to make Laws as the Provincial and that he hath undertaken and endeavoured to ſettle the Popiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that Kingdom, and in order to that, he hath invited the Aid of the French Army, and that he hath for the better landing of them, looked out what places were moſt convenient for them; That he hath ſet a Tax upon the Clergy within his Province for the facilitating of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42345:27"/>
all this, and for the making preparations for the entertainment of this Army. This the Witneſſes teſtifie againſt him, and that there were ſome Towns, as <hi>Dungannon</hi> and another Town, that were to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to the <hi>French.</hi> Now you muſt conſider concerning theſe Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: If you believe the Evidence that hath been given, and which hath been repeated by the Kings Counſel, and if you believe that he did deſign to bring in a French Army, to eſtabliſh the Roman Religion there again, and that he took upon him to raiſe mony for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſurvey'd the Ports, and made ſuch proviſions, as the Witneſſes ſpeak of, and was in that Conſpiracy; you muſt find him Guilty, I leave it to you, it is a pretty ſtrong Evidence, he does not ſay any thing to it, but that his Witneſſes are not come over.</p>

               <p>My Lord, may it pleaſe your Lordſhip, I have ſomething to ſay, which if your Lordſhip will conſider ſeriouſly, may occaſion the Courts Commiſeration and Mercy. I have, my Lord, for this Fact
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42345:27"/>
been Arraigned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and brought to my Trial there. At the day of my Trial all the Witneſſes voluntarily abſented themſelves, ſeeing I had Records and Witneſſes to convince them evidently and ſhew what men they were, and the prepenſed Malice that they did bear to me, and ſo finding that I could clear my ſelf evidently, they abſented themſelves on the day of my Tryal no Chriſtian appeared, but hither over they come, and procure that I ſhould be brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where I could not have a Jury that knew the Qualities of my Adverſaries, or who knew me, of the circumſtances of the Places, Times, and Perſons; the Juries here as I ſay were altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to theſe Affairs, and ſo, my Lord, they could not know many things that conduce to a fair Tryal, and it was morally impoſſible they ſhould know it. I have been accuſed principally and chiefly for ſurveying the Ports, for fixing upon <hi>Carlingford</hi> for the Landing of the <hi>French,</hi> for the having of ſeventy thouſand Men ready to join with the <hi>French,</hi> for collecting Mony for the Agents in this matter, for the aſſiſting of the <hi>French</hi> and this great Utopian Army. A Jury in <hi>Ireland</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of men that lived in that Country, or any man in the World that hath but ſeen <hi>Ireland</hi> in a Map, would eaſily ſee there was no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that that ſhould be a place fit for the <hi>French</hi> to land in, though he never was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet by the Map, he would ſee they muſt come between the narrow Seas all along to <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> and the Rocks, and ſuch places would make it very dangerous; and by their own confeſſion it was a poor Town, and of no ſtrength, a very ſmall Garriſon, which had not been ſo, if it had been a place of any conſideration. And whereas I had Influence only upon one Province, as is well known, though I had the Title of Primate of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath of all <hi>England;</hi> yet the Arch Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> will not permit him to meddle with his Province; and 'tis well known by the Gentry there, and thoſe that are accuſtomed to the place; That in all the Province of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter,</hi> take Men, Women and Children of the Roman Catholicks, they could not make up ſeventy Thouſand. This, a Jury there, my Lord, had known very well, and therefore the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which are very favourable to the Priſoner, have provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that there ſhould be a Jury of the place where the Fact was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as Sir <hi>Thomas Gaſcoine,</hi> as I have heard, had a <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> Jury, though he was tryed at <hi>London.</hi> And then after my coming here, I was kept cloſe Priſoner for ſix Months, not any Chriſtian was permitted
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42345:28"/>
to come at me, nor did I know any thing, how things ſtood in the World. I was brought here the third of <hi>May,</hi> to be arraigned, and I did petition your Lordſhip to have ſome time for my Tryal, and I would have had it put off till <hi>Michaelmaſs,</hi> but your Lordſhips did not think ſit to grant ſo long, but only till the eighth of this month, when my Witneſſes who were ready at the Sea ſide, would not come over without Paſſes, and I could not get over the Records without an Order from hence; which Records would have ſhewn that ſome of the Witneſſes were indicted and found guilty of high Crimes, ſome were impriſoned for Robberies, and ſome of the Witneſſes were infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous people, ſo I petitioned the eighth of this month, that I might have time but for twelve days more, but your Lordſhip thought when the motion was made, that it was only to put off the Trial, and now my Witneſſes are come to <hi>Coventry</hi> yeſterday morning, and they will be here in a few days, and ſo for want of time to defend my ſelf in, I was expoſed to my Adverſaries, who were ſome of my own Clergy, whom for their debauched Lives, I have corrected, as it is well known there. I will not deny my ſelf, but that as long as there was any Toleration and Connivance, I did execute the Function of a Biſhop, and that by the ſecond of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> is only a Premunire, and no Treaſon. So that, my Lord, I was expoſed defenceleſs to my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whereas now my Witneſſes are come, that could make all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. I did beg for twelve days time, whereby you might have ſeen as plain as the Sun, what thoſe Witneſſes are that began the Story, and ſay theſe things againſt me. And, my Lord, for thoſe Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the ſeventy thouſand Men, and the Monies that are collected of the Clergy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they cannot be true, for they are a poor Clergy that have no Revenue nor Land; they live as the Presbyterians do here, there is not a Prieſt in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> that hath certainly or uncertainly above threeſcore pounds a year, and that I ſhould collect of them forty ſhillings a piece, for the raiſing of an Army, or for the Landing of the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Carlingford;</hi> if it had been brought before a Jury in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it would have been thought a meer Romance. If they had accuſed me of a <hi>Proemunire</hi> for the exerciſe of my Epiſcopal Function, perhaps they had ſaid ſomething that might have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, but my Lord, as I am a dying man, and hope for Salvation by my Lord and Saviour, I am not guilty of one point of Treaſon they have ſwore againſt me, no more than the Child that was born. but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42345:28"/>
I have an Atteſtation under my Lord of <hi>Eſſex</hi>'s hand concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my good Behaviour in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not only from him, but from my Lord <hi>Berkley,</hi> who was alſo Governour there, which the Kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney ſaw; But here I was brought, here I was tried, and having not time to bring my Witneſſes, I could not prove my Innocency, as otherwiſe I might. So that, if there be any Caſe in the World that deſerves Compaſſion, ſurely my Caſe does; and 'tis ſuch a rare Caſe, as I believe you will not find two of them in print, that one arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſhould be tried here afterwards for the ſame Fact. My Lord, if there be any thing in the World that deſerves pity, this does, for I can ſay, as I hope for mercy, I was never guilty of any one point they have ſwore againſt me, and if my Petition for time had been granted, I could have ſhewn how all was prepenſe Malice againſt me, and have produced all Circumſtances that could make out the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of a perſon. But not having had time, and being tried, I am at your mercy.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, you have nothing further to ſay in Bar of Judgment, you have ſaid all you can?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunk.</speaker>
               <p>I have nothing further to ſay, but what I have ſaid.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Then Proclamation was made for ſilence, while Judgement was paſſing upon the Priſoner.</hi>
            </p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, Mr. <hi>Plunket,</hi> You have been here indicted of a very great and hainous Crime, the greateſt and moſt hainous of all Crimes, and that is, High Treaſon; and truly yours is a Treaſon of the higheſt nature, 'tis a Treaſon in truth againſt God an your King, and the Country where you lived. You have done as much as you could to diſhonour God in this caſe; for the bottom of your Treaſon was, the ſeting up your falſe Religion, than which, there is not any thing more diſpleaſing to God, or more pernicious to mankind in the World: a Religion that is ten times worſe than all the Heatheniſh Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, the moſt diſhonourable and derogatory to God and his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all Religions or pretended Religions whatſoever; for it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to diſpenſe with Gods Laws, and to pardon the breach of them. So that certainly a greater Crime there cannot be committed againſt God, than for a man to endeavour the Propagation of that Religion; but you, to effect this, have deſigned the Death of your lawful Prince and King. And then your deſign of Blood in the Kingdom where you lived, to ſet all together by the ears, to deſtroy poor innocent people,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42345:29"/>
to proſtitute their Lives and Liberties, and all that is dear to them to the Tyranny of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> and that by introducing a <hi>French</hi> Army. What greater evil can be deſigned by any man? I mention theſe things, becauſe they have all been fully proved againſt your, and that you may take notice, and repent of them, and make your peace with God, by a particular Application for Mercy for all theſe Faults: For it ſeems to me, that againſt God, your Prince, and fellow Subjects, you have behaved your ſelf very ill, deſigning very great evil to all theſe; and now it hath pleaſed God to bring you to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I muſt tell you, peradventure what you urge for your ſelf might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce pity, if it were to be believed, that is, that you are innocent, and had Witneſſes to prove it, but we cannot ſuppoſe any man inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that hath had a legal and a fair Trial, and a Trial with as much candor to you, as your Caſe could bear, or as perhaps any man in ſuch a Caſe ever had. You had time upon your Requeſt to ſend for your Witneſſes, to help you in your Defence, and to have proved your Innocence, if you could have done it; Time long enough to your own Content, you your ſelf thought it ſo, at the time it was given. To give a Priſoner under your circumſtances five or ſix weeks time to ſend for Witneſſes, is not uſual, we could have put you upon a preſent Defence, and hurried you out of the World by a ſuddain Trial, if we had had any Deſign againſt you; but we go on in a fair way, and with legal Proceedings, and with as much Reſpect to you, as in ſuch a Caſe could be uſed, for we gave you all the fair Hearing and Liberty that you deſired to have.</p>
               <p>Look you, as to what you urge, that your Trial was in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whereas your Offence was in another, that is a thing that does not become you by any means to object; for you have had a Trial here by honeſt perſons, and that according to the Laws which obtain in this Kingdom, and that too of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is by a Statute not made on purpoſe to bring you into a Snare, but an ancient Statute, and not without Preſidents of its having been put in execution before your time. For your own Country will afford you ſeveral Preſidents in this Caſe, as <hi>O Rurke,</hi> and ſeveral others that have been arraigned and condemned for Treaſon done there. So that you have no reaſon to except againſt the Legality of your Trial. You ſay, now you have Witneſſes that could prove all this Matter, why that lies in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42345:29"/>
mouth of any man that is condemned to ſay; but pray conſider with your ſelf, what Regard ought to be given to this. We cannot help it, if your Witneſſes don't come, you may remember they wanted not Time nor Opportunity to come over, but you told us they would not come unleſs they had a Paſsport.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunket.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, they got a Paſs to come over afterwards, and ſo in eight days they came hither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>You might have provided your ſelf, if they wanted ſuch a thing. In the firſt place, no body is bound to give it them; much leſs could you expect it for them without asking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>I could not get the Copies of the Records neither by any means, unleſs I had an Order from the Council, and they would not give that Order, unleſs your Lordſhip appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>We cannot tell that, you ſhould have petitioned in time.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>How could any one foreſee, unleſs he was God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that they would deny it, or that he could not get out a Copy of a Record, paying for it, without a Petition. All the Friends I had told me, upon Motion there it might be had, but here I have it under the Lieutenants and Councils Hands, that they would give no Copy of Records without Order from hence, which before I could know it, it was impoſſible for me to have them ready againſt my Trial.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Sir, I do ſpeak this to you, to ſhew you that thoſe Objections, which you ſeem to make againſt your Trial, have no weight at all, but in this Caſe it is not the Jury that are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial as the Witneſſes themſelves. I appeal to all that heard your Trial, if they could ſo much as doubt but that you were Guilty of what you were charged with. For conſider here were perſons that were of your own Religion, the moſt of them Prieſts, I think almoſt all of them in Orders.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>There were two Friars and a Prieſt, whom I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to correct this ſeven Years, and they were Renegadoes from our Religion, and declared Apoſtates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you Sir, they gave an Evidence very home to your
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42345:30"/>
matter; you had liberty to examine them, and they gave you a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Accompt of any thing you ask'd. Let me but put you in mind of one thing. You made Exceptions to one's Evidence, (and indeed that was very much of your Exception to all) why he did not reveal this in all that time: Truly he told you he was of your mind, till he went into <hi>France,</hi> and ſaw what a Slavery and Miſchief you endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to introduce upon his and your own Countrymen, and this his Spirit roſe againſt, to ſee what a condition <hi>Ireland</hi> was like to be brought into. And pray, did not he give you a full Anſwer to that Queſtion?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>I had ſufficient Witneſſes to prove he was an Apoſtate, and was chaſtiſed by me, and therefore had prepenſed Malice againſt me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Chief Juſtice.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore I have ſpoken this to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, I hope, of your ſelf, and all that hear it. I do now wiſh you to conſider, you are near your end. It ſeems you have liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a falſe Religion hitherto; it is not too late at any time to repent, I wiſh you may have the Grace to do ſo; In the mean time there is no room for us here, to grant you any kind of Mercy, though, I'le tell you, we are inclined to pity all Malefactors: Who ever have done evil, we are inclined to pity them, and wiſh heartily that they may repent, as we do, that you may of what you have done. But all we can do now, is, to ſay what the Law ſays, and that is to paſs Judgment upon you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Plunkett.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip to give me leave to ſpeak one word. If I were a man that had no care of my Conſcience in this matter, and did not think of God Almighty, or Conſcience, or Heaven, or Hell, I might have ſaved my Life; For I was offered it by divers people here, ſo I would but confeſs my own Guilt, and accuſe others. But, my Lord, I had rather die ten thouſand deaths, than wrongfully accuſe any body. And the time will come when your Lordſhip will ſee what theſe Witneſſes are, that have come in againſt me. I do aſſure your Lordſhip, if I were a man that had not good Principles, I might eaſily have ſaved my own Life; but I had rather die ten thouſand deaths, than wrongfully to take away one farthing of any mans Goods, one day of his Liberty, or one minute of his Life.</p>

               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Well, however the Judgment which we give you, is that which the Law ſays and ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore you muſt go from hence, to the place from whence you came, that is to</hi> Newgate, <hi>and from thence you shall be drawn through the City of</hi> London <hi>to</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne; <hi>there you shall be hanged by the Neck, but cut down before you are dead, your Bowels shall be taken out, and burnt before your Face, your Head shall be cut off, and your Body be divided into Four Quarters, to be diſpoſed of as his Majeſty pleaſes.
