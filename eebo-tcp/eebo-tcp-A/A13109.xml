            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

IN all delibrations of moste priuate actions, the very heathen are wont, first to consider honesty, and then profit. Some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also many times, not without some blind regard to a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature which they vvorshipped before the altar of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovven God. Oh the strange Christianity of some men in our age, vvho in their state consultations haue not so much respecte to Pietie as those first men had to honesty, nor so much regarde to honestie, as they had to profit: &amp; are therfore iustly giuen vp of the Lord our God to seeke profit vvhere in deed it is not, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by theyr lusts to embrace a shewing &amp; false Good in stead of that vvhich is the good End of a vvise man. Yea, vvho neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the holy and sure vvisedome of God in his vvord, vvherein are the onely honorable enstructions for polytyques, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestest rules of gouering our houses and ovvne person, do beate their braines in other bookes of vvicked vile Atheistes and sette before them the example of Turkish and Italian practises, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lorde many times thrustes theyr hands into the neste of vvaspes and hornets vvhile they seek the hony of the svvete bee.</p>
            <p>Thys sicknes of mynd haue the french dravven from those Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steern partes of the vvorld, as they did that other horrible disease of the body: and hauing alreadie too far VVestvvard, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the one contagion, doe novv seeke notably to infecte our minds vvith the other. And because this infection spreeds it selfe after an other maner from the first, they haue sent vs hither not Satan in body of a serpent, but the old serpent in shape of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vvhos sting is in his mouth, and vvho doth his endeuour to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce our Eue, that shee and vve may lose this Englishe Paradise. VVho because she is also our Adam &amp; soueraigne Lord or lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lady of this Land, it is so much the more daungerous &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he so much the more busily bestirres him.</p>
            <p>Novv although the truth be that vppon further ripping vp of this serpentine attempt, vve shall find the Church notably vnder mined by the Pope: the verye foundations of our common vveall dangerously digged at by the french: &amp; our deere Queene Elizabeth (I shake to speake) ledd blyndfold as a poore Lambe
<pb facs="tcp:18498:3"/>
to the slaughter: yet should not my feare be so great, knovving her Maiesties vvisedome sufficient to teach her, in such a matter as this, neither to trovv a Frenche man nor once here speake a dayly hearer of masse (for she may knovv him by his hissing and lisping) but that some English mouthes professing Christ are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so persvvaders of the same. And though this ship fraughte vvyth Englands bane, vvere already vndercrossed saile vvith the freshest gale of winde in her sterne that can blovv in the skye for our best port: yet had vve counter puffes and counterbuffes ynough to keepe him aloofe and to send him backe againe into the deepes, if he had none but onely french maryners and onely french tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle. But alas this ship of vnhappy loade hath emong vs &amp; of our selues (I vvould, not in Princes Court) those vvho with all theyr might and maine helpe to hale it in: and, as though the blustring vvindes of our enemies malice and the broade sayles of our sins were not sufficient to giue it a speedy passage hither, our ovvne men vvalke on thys shoare and lay to theyr shoulders with faste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lynes and cables to draw it in. This is our mischiefe, thys is the swallowing Gulfe of our bottomles destruction: els myght vve thinke our selues impregnable. It is not the feeble assault of this carpet squire that vvold make vs come to the vvalles or once shut the gates against him.</p>
            <p>Therefore albeit I wote vvell you vnderstand already in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, what is that great calamitie thus imminent ouer our heades whereof I speake: and albeit the bare consideration of some fevv apparant circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances of thys strange sought mariage by Fraunce vvith England, do suffyciently moue and affecte euerye Christian hart, in respect of the hurt to the Church of Christ: euery Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish hart, in respect of the detriment to England: and euery honest affectionate hart of anye her maiesties louing true seruant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the greate daunger thereby comming to her royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yet to thende our mindes may be the more earnestlye stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, by more particularly vveighing the euills of this matter, vve vvill enter into the partes of thys practise and gage the verye bellye of this great horse of hidden mischiefes &amp; falshoode meant
<pb facs="tcp:18498:3"/>
to vs. And according as those not halfe taughte Christians and halfe harted Englishmen vvhiche persvvade and sollicite thys french mariage, haue in theyr mouthes nothing but the churche and common weale, pretending hereby eyther against their own conscience or of some other humor that blindeth them, to bring greate aduauncement to religion and aduauntage to the state, vvith many smooth wordes of I wot vvhat, assurance to her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties person: I will likewise dravv al my reasons to those chiefe heads of Religion, and the Pollicie, shevving &amp; prouing, I hope, that this is a counsaile against the Church of Christ, an endeuor of no vvell aduised Englishman, as vvell in regard of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> state, as of her maiesties good estate. to euery of which it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious and capitall. In the ende I vvill aunsvvere such of theyre aduerse or peruerse reasons as shall be lefte vndisproued in thys my proofe.</p>
            <p>And first if a man vvould here bring in the Church to speake <note place="margin">The church.</note> for her selfe, standing vpon the doctrine of her Prophetes and Christ the Lord, leaning vpon the piller of truth, vvhose crovvne and garlond is to suffer rather then to vse any vayne helpe of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Gods lavve: mild thoughe she be without all gale in her hart, and haue no vvords in her hony swete mouth but of a most louing mother: yet vvould she with sharpe reproofe take vp these goodly procurers of her vvelth as very practisers of her vvoe, she vvoulde call them to account vvhy they take her holy name in their mouthes, and she vvould scarce repute them for her chyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren vvho vvill nedes forsoth be her fathers. for (to reason vvith these Politiques in their ovvne professyon) can they thinke anye counsaile holesome to the state or becomming good counsai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, which can not be once deliberated of, much les put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, without both despising of the Prince and contemptuous breach of the country lavves? they must needes say noe, if they haue any sincerity or playne dealing left. at least they wyll saye nay for feare. And think they that any their vayneglorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise can proue to the lyfe or health of the church, which is offered her with shamefull dishonour to her spouse, vvith the separating
<pb facs="tcp:18498:4"/>
her from her Lord God, and vvith the treading vnder foot of that precious lavve, vvhich îs her holy rule for order, and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne preseruatife againste all headlong confusion? if they say yea, vve say nay, and proue it nay. Namely that this procuration of mariage, is a breach of Gods lawe, and not onely for the sinne thereof is against the church because it hasteneth vengeaunce, but vve shevve by demonstratiue reasons that it goeth to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gorge of the Church.</p>
            <p>I trust, I shall not neede to proue to these mens consciences this Maior proposition or Maxime, that is to say, Syn prouoketh the wrath of God, and that greate sinnes call down great plages, and mighty sinners are mightily punished. This argument, The vvorld sinneth, such a citie sinneth, such a land sinneth, such a try be, such a kindred, such a family, such a soule sinneth, Ergo, the <note place="margin">Sin draweth vengeance.</note> vvorld, such a city, land, trybe, kindred, family, soule, shall feele the vengeance of that high lavvgeuer against vvhom they sinne: is a most necessary consequence.</p>
            <p>This next though it be but the Minor in order and vvill not perhappes vvithout farther proofe be yelden vnto by thys kynde <note place="margin">This mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is sin.</note> of protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: yet is it as true as the former, that is, that it is a sin, a greate and a mightye sinne for England to geue one of Israels daughters to any of Hemors sonnes: to match a daughter of God vvith one of the sonnes of men: to couple a Christian Ladye, a member of Christ, to a Prince &amp; good sonne of Rome that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian mother citie. For the inuincible manifestastion ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this truth, let vs first consider England as a region purged from Idolatry a kingdome of light, confessing Christ and seruing the liuing God: Contrariwise, Fraunce a den of Idolatrye a kingdome of darkenes, confessing Belial and seruing Baal. Then let vs remember vvhat was the first institution of mariage, which <note place="margin">Iustitution of mariage.</note> is set before vs, as a directory rule for vs in our mariages for euer, and vvhereunto Christ teacheth vs playnly in al cases and other incidentes of mariage, to looke back, vvhen, vpon a case put of mariage, he aunsweres. IN THE BEGINNING IT VVAS NOT SO. The first mariages were betvvene payres in Religion, and in the
<pb facs="tcp:18498:4"/>
feare of God. And the first vvritten commaundements that are giuen by Moses touching mariage, haue their regard to that first <note place="margin">The first Lavves.</note> institution, as it were to the oldest lavve. The vvhich Moses right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnderstanding and according to the interpretation of al lawes vvhen they bid or forbid any thing, do therevvith forbid or bid the contrarye: He also in Denteronomie forbad those matches <note place="margin">Deut. 7. 3.</note> vvherein the sonnes of God vvere giuen to the daughters of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, adding thys reason. for, saith he, such mariages wil make thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to fal from me. And this place at once, may expound those other many places vvhere it is sayd, least they make thy children to commit Idolatry, to be added as a certaine punishment by the iudgement of God, and not for a doubtfull reason as some vvould fayn haue it, that seke to dravv the lavves of God to their lustes, who should rather rule theyr lustes by the lawes. VVhich pure institution of mariage S. Paul also continues: when enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holy vse thereof to all sortes of men, he yet hath this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, that it be in the Lord; that is to saye, in his feare, as it was from the beginning, and according to his former commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his vvorde.</p>
            <p>It is more then enough to breake the holy ordinaunce insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of God, vvhich ought to gouerne vs without further enqui rye of reason or commodity. But as the holinesse of his lavves is <note place="margin">The end of holy maria.</note> holesome to vs, euen in this life by obedience: so doth theyr tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression breede vs infinite incommodities. For the ende of this holy kind of mariage is our mutuall helpe and vpholdiug one an other in the feare of God. vvhich appeareth by the reason of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding those vnholy mariages, vvhich is, least, sayth the spirit of God, their sonnes drawe your daughters or their daughters your sonnes from the Lord. Nowe as the one comes to passe vvhere <note place="margin">The hurt of vnholy ma.</note> thorder of God is kept: so the contrary effect must iustly followe vpon neglect. especially if such a mariage be made in a gospellike land vvhere the lavv of God is preached, and contrarye to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning giuen out of Gods booke. Then vvithout peraduenture all blessing is taken awaye, and the plague follovveth. And to teach our politiques by reasonable argumentes, what other reasons
<pb facs="tcp:18498:5"/>
haue the lavves of all lands to ioyne like to like in mariage, but for the norishing of peace and loue betvvene man and vvife, and for the vvell bringing vp of the children in euery familye, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make them profitable members in some seruiceable voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: considering that families are the seedes of Realmes and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie partes of common vveales, where if there be good order, the vvhole land is vvell ordered: and contrary, as in anye instrument if euery string or many strings be out of tune, the whole musick is marred, and who so vvill preserue any entier, must conserue euery part: so if the families be distempered and out of tune, the vvhole land is disturbed.</p>
            <p>Thinke you that the common vveal can haue this care for her lesse partes, and thus prouide for the vvell trayning vp of her chil dren, &amp; that the church of England vvherin this holy lavv of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious matching &amp; marying the faithful vvith the faythful is giue by Christ, to this end, that their children might be sanctified, and holily brought vp in christian religion: thinke you I say that the church wil easely depart vvith her deere daughter her daughter of hiest honor, Elizabeth the Queene of England, vvho is the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of the holy ghost: and vvill not hold her fast in her louing armes as being loath to giue her to a straunger, one that hath shevved no signes of regeneration, and her selfe vvant thassistaunce of a faythfull husband, and her children of her body, if any she haue, vvhich receiue outvvard sanctification and entry into the bosom of the church thorough the promise of their faythfull parentes, be in danger to be profaned before they be borne, and to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted after they are borne and thorovvout al their education?</p>
            <p>S. Paul speaking of contrary couplings together, compareth them to the vneuen yoking of the cleane Oxe to the vncleane <note place="margin">The dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of such maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</note> Asse, a thing forbidden in the lawe. And here againe the lawes of men vvhieh medle but vvith the distribution of the things of this life, haue learned this equitie of the lavves of God, that it is a greate disparagement for health to be ioyned in mariage vvith any foule disease, for beuty vvith deformity, youth vvith decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite age, or to tender a townes man daughter to a gentilman of
<pb facs="tcp:18498:5"/>
birth. A citizen of Rome vvoulde hold foule scorne to mary a Barbariane. And the common vvealthes of England &amp; Fraunce I dare say, vvould meruail if eyther our Queene or Monsieur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both great princes borne, and of high linage, should seeke or consent in mariage vvith any lovv borne or contemptible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Haue the lavves of common vveales prouided thus vvel for men? the vvorld, standes it thus vppon her slippers of reputation, in obseruing what is comely in mariage and honourable for ech personage: and shall the lavves of God, trovv you, be of none effect? or shall it not be much more ougly before God and hys angels, vvhen an Hebrew shal mary a Cananite' there is no such inequalitie as that of religion: no such disparagement, as not to be faythfull no such dignity of Principality, as to be a good chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: and no such slauery, as to be a Barbarian from Christ Iesu.</p>
            <p>Perhappes some man vvill defende these vneuen Irreligious mariages, by abusing that place of 1. Cor. 7. But vvithout any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpe, that text it selfe is selfe sufficient to deliuer it self from that violence: and the lavv of God from the beginning &amp; to the end all one, vvith the obedient practise of Gods children, and the plages vpon the transgressors: do euidently shevv, that Paul there speaketh onely for the continuance of such mariages as were first not vneuen, being made in time of infidelitie on both partes, and by the aftercalling of one party are become vneuen: for thè co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance I say, of such mariages, and not vneuenly to yoke any Christian which is free to one not faithfull.</p>
            <p>Novv as by reasons it appeares vnlavvfull, so by examples it <note place="margin">Examples.</note> may appeare hurtfull. Those good men of whom vve loue to be esteemed the children and follovvers, Abraham and Isaac had <note place="margin">Gene. 24 3.

Those ill men to vvhome vve vvoulde be ashamed to be resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, made this maner of mariage. The old vvorlde vvhich thus defiling it selfe was therefore vvashed in the vniuersall flood. And Esau, whose fault yet was in this poynt lesse then ours, for they wythout care of Religion tooke the fayrest and such as perhaps vvere next hand: vve should, in this match, send further of for our mariage and haue not so much respect as to the fayrest. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so far giuen ouer of God, as to forget euen that part whyche we would gladliest please. And emong those good men whome we set for holy examples, this maner of mariage vvas euer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the scripture emong theyr faults. As the Israelites which thus fel away from the seruice of God, and withal out of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. As Samson and Salomon whose vertues we must imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <note place="margin">Iudg. Psal. Salomon.</note> and not these their sinnes.</p>
            <p>VVhere Salomon might serue for all examples, and hym will I chiefely name and namely vrge (speaking novv of kingly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and courtly mariage makers) because he vvas a king, and also because, that godly Courtier Nehemiah doth notably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it in a stronger case: vsing Salomons sin în this maner of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy <note place="margin">Nehe. 13. 23</note> mariages, as a reason to separate the Israelits fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wiues vvhich they had already maried, yea and by vvhome they had had children born to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: thinking it an ilfauoured noise to heare theyr children gibber in the streetes halfe Hebrewe halfe Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dod. I pray you marke then how much more force Salomons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hath to disswade a mariage that is yet but in parle &amp; not concluded, to make no such fayre reckoning of a babe yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne whose shape we see not, and how much more ilfauoured it vvere for vs that in our churches speake the language of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan to ioyne vvith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that in their masse mumble the straunge tongue of Rome. And if woman, that vveaker vessel, be strong enough to dravve man through thaduantage vvhiche the deuill hath vvithin our bosome, (I meane our naturall corruption and proonesse to Idolatry) hovv much more forcibly shall the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb facs="tcp:18498:6"/>
vessell pull vveake vvoman considering that vvith the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitie of strength there is ioyned, as great or more readinesse to Idolatrye and superstition. And if the husband vvhich is the heade be dravven aside by his vvyfe ouer vvhome neuerthelesse he hath authoritye and rule: hovve muche more easely shall the vvife be peruerted by her husband to vvhome she is subi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ecte by the lavve of God, and ovveth both avve and obedience, hovve soeuer the lavves by prerogatif or her place by preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce may priuiledge her.</p>
            <p>And here note this, that euery vvhere it is set dovvne hovve the vvicked peruerted the good, but no vvhere that the better part conuerted the wicked. for euen the ill ralke or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation of ill men, corruptes good maners. And sith Salomon a peereles king, beloued of God, as Nehemiah saith, so furnished in vvisedome and of vvhome there vvere such certaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations that he was the child of God, dyd yet thys foulye fal by ioyning himselfe in mariage vvith Idolatrons vveme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in so much as diuers now thinke they find almost as many reasons to call in some doubt his saluation: I pray God it may seeme fearefull in the eyes of all other Princes and princesses, vvormes to him in wisedom, to do the like fault, for dread of the like sequele. VVher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appeares how vaine that promise is of theirs, who say that Monsieure shall be instructed in our religion, and drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his, by going with our Queene to hers: besides that we woulde be loath, with so certaine great peril to our Queene, who is emong men and vvomen the chiese to vs: to attempt the vncertain win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of him who is emong all men the least to vs. And if there were in him any hope of tollerable inclination to religion it wold rather shevve now in the time of his sute to our Queene, by that meanes perhaps thinking to be lesse lothsome to her and les ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable to her people. but we haue no cause to hope it. for he vseth no protestant in the matter of mariage, although for some other colour he hath seemed to make some reckoning of some in some respect. And if there were hope, yet in so vnaduised rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to venture against the word of God, we may well looke for
<pb facs="tcp:18498:7"/>
Gods iudgement to come betwene, and punish our folehardines that he which loueth peril may abide and perish therein.</p>
            <p>But these discoursers that vse the word of God with as little conscience as they doe Machiauel, pycking out of both indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently what may serue theyr turnes, perhaps they will thinke to escape all hetherto sayd, by calling in question (for their mouthes are their owne to dispute of any thing without care of resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) <note place="margin">Papist.</note> whether to mary with the Papist that worshippeth the Lord of Heauen and earth? be against those interdictions in the law which seeme to compas in no more but the Canaanites Iebusites &amp;c. And mere pagan nations: and whether to mary with the papist <note place="margin">Cananite. Pagan.</note> who in generall termes protesteth Christ, be to mary in the lord.</p>
            <p>To answere these men whose doubts procede euer of theyre lust, to giue themselues liberty, and not of a conscience affrayd to offend God, I might say, that if to confes the Lord of heauen and earth, be ynough to auoid those interdictions then might we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termary with Turks, Iewes, Moscouites, and diuers other painni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes: and, as far as I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, with some of the Cannibals. Looke the storyes of the new Indians. And albeit the Papist protest Christ in word, yet sith the vnity of the Church is noted to be herein that Christians be the houshold of faith, in the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal doctrine whereof, what it is, what is the vse, worthines, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, the papistes dissenting from vs as farre as they that scatter wher we gather, it wil be hard to make them of one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful houshold with vs.</p>
            <p>But to yeelde them a degree somevvhat nearer vs then Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, compare them with the Moabites and the Ammonites, who were cosens to Israell by the flesh and had Lot for theyr fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <note place="margin">Moabite. Ammonite. Ishmalite. Edomite.</note> or let them stand with Ishmael Abrahams bastards son, yea at once let them be in regard to vs with Edome, Israels twinne brother, both which had the circumcision of flesh: yet vvas it not lavvful for the Isralites to mary with them: &amp; in Salomon, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is counted emong other his sinful mariages, that he maryed <note place="margin">King. 1. 11.</note> with those nations. But that we may yet giue somewhat more to these strayners for lustes sake at a gnat and swallowers of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel
<pb facs="tcp:18498:7"/>
through conscience (for they are more precise to doe pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wrong, then to doe the gospell right) let vs I say, suffer the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish churche to be made more of then she is worth, let vs take her at the best and in as good accompt as any learned gospeller hetherto hath set her and let her haue the allowaunce of two or three graines to be massier then the Edomite and finer then the pagane, to hang in an euen ballance and to be of one assaie or touche with the Idolatrous and trayterous Israelits that fel from <note place="margin">Idolatrous Israelites.</note> God and were false to the house of Dauid theyr king: yet shal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes be to light and to drossie to mary with vs. For neither was it lawfull nor luckie for the Iewes to mary with those Ieroboa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Israelites, for al theyr ontward circumcision, and though they worshipped on the hill of the patriark fathers.</p>
            <p>For this purpose reade well the storye of Iehoram king of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huda the son of good Iohosaphat that made a notable reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Gods house. and for all his fathers sake you shall see it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected against him and rendred as a reason of his other great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious sins, that he had maried in the house of Achab king of the Samaritane Israelites. The wickednes and sinne of vvhyche kinde of mariage, as it is euinced by the very word of God and punishment vpon the person of Iehoram: so îs it proued by the horrible punishments following vpon his generation. For Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah or Ochoziah son of Iehoram, by reason of the Quene mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Athalia, fell in such a leag vvith the king of Israell that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <note place="margin">Athalia.</note> his quarel, he fel with him vpon the svvord of Iehu. After vvhose death the Queene mother and dovvagier Athalia, plaied Rex and slew al the princes of the blood and peeres of Iudah. All which murdures began, and are set downe to haue com for that mariage with the daughter of Achab, whose seede the Lord had sayd to purseu to the rote. VVherby it appeares that whoso mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with any vvicked race, doe make themselues and their sede partakers of the sinnes and plagues of that race and their aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. And because the match of fraunce with thitalian Athalia &amp; hir furies in that lande, especiallye those at the mariage of her daughter Margeret, vvill of themselues applye them selues in
<pb facs="tcp:18498:8"/>
euery respect to agree vvith her of Iudea, and proue the sin and punishment of such vvicked vvilling matches betvvene Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an true Ievves and popish bastard Israelites: I onely name it and leaue it to the trembling consideration of all, especially of suche as it neerest toucheth, vvhom I besech, in Gods name, to stand vveightily vpon it.</p>
            <p>These things do necessarily infer the third proposion, vvhich is the conclusion or finall sentence of Gods punishment against <note place="margin">Conclusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againste England.</note> this poore church, for this sinne if it be committed. Faire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is their pretext of peace to the Church, vvho seeke that thing that must be the cause of such a vvoefull effect.</p>
            <p>So that if our mariage makers be not so spirituall, as that the sin vvhich this mariage hath simply in it selfe and of it selfe, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for being against Gods lavv, can not make them yeld to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fes the daunger it bringeth to the church: let vs compel them to come in by looking at the tayle of sinnes and punishments that this venemous serpent of sin draggeth after it.</p>
            <p>It is not in Gods church as in the Grecian host. there, delirant reges, plectuntur Achiui. but vvith vs, Regis ad exemplum totus <note place="margin">The Kings sin striketh the Land.</note> componitur orbis. The sin of the Prince maketh the people to sin, vvhereby euery one beareth his sin, and the Lord findes mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter ynough in Prince and people to vvrap the one and the other in the same calamitye. In reasoning it is truely sayd, one absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie begetteth an other. euen so hath sin a fruitfull generation. and as the vertues are sayd to be chained together, so is neuer one vice or sin alone.</p>
            <p>But specially the breach of this lavve of God, in vvhom soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer priuate person it lighteth, dravveth not onely a certaine fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling avvay to the goodman or goodvvife of the house so vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maryed, but a daunger also to children, seruants, and euery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiner of that houshold. much more manifold is the danger, vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the honorable dame and (as in humblenes I may say) the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvife of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d shold be so (which God forbid) vneue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly matched It vvere more perilous to the ouerthrovv of Religion in thys faythful houshold of England, then if in one day vvere consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb facs="tcp:18498:8"/>
the like mariages of a hundred thousand of other her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. for the straightest and roundest going Prince shall vvyth much a doe keepe his people vpright, especially in Religion. But let the Prince laake neuer so little, and the people vvil halt right dovvne. The Princes fal is like that of a mighty Oake, vvhich beares dovvn vvith it many armes and braunches, therfore is it often recited in the scripture, that Ieroboam sell avvay fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God and all Israell vvith him. again, for the sins of Ieroboam vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he caused all Israell to sinne against the Lord.</p>
            <p>Novv if the French fautors of this mariage, vvhich can enlarg theyr pollicy and mince the vvord of God as they list, vvill yet cast about an other croked by vvay to meete vvith this great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, that, forsooth, it shalbe capitulated, onely lavvful <note place="margin">Monsieurs masse no priuate mas.</note> for Monsieur and a fevve of his nation to haue theyr miserable mas vvithout the admission of any Englishman: surely these me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neyrher measure this article at the standarde meatvvande of the Lord, nor vveigh the easines of performing it in a vvise mannes ballance. For, I pray you, doe but goe vpon the Tamis and see vvhat companies goe to the french mas: enquire vvhat num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers flocked in at backfield gates to the portugale mas: hovv the Spanish massers had theyr customers more then ynough: and you shall easily see the loose reckoning of these men in matters of so great valeue. they vvill kepe better bookes of theyr crovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. do they see deputed Ambassadors, hable to break our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est lavves of Gods honor, in themselues and in so many of our nation: and can they think as they speake, that so great a prince, the husband (vvhich God forhid) of our Queene, and perhaps (vvhich God defend) honored vvith the name of our king for our Quueenes sake, shall not and vvill not giue him selfe hys ovvn conditions for his ovvne religion, to hym and his, and so many of ours as vvill seeke it at hys hands?</p>
            <p>But vvether thys be their grosse ouersight, or vvhether they vvink vviles agaynst religion I vvil not novv dispute: this is more then vvonderful, that such as pretend outvvard profession of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion should make so irreligious accompt of Religion: Oh the
<pb facs="tcp:18498:9"/>
vvickednes of our professors and the hypocrisie of our protestan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes. Is not Idolatry the highest treason that can be agaynst the Lords ovvn person? doth it not go directly to the poynt he stands most on for his honor? do our lips say that vve are zelous of gods honour, and tender ouer hys church, &amp; can our harts rest in quiet and not tel her maiestie hovv great a dishonor it ys to haue one mas, and vvhat a plague it menaceth to the church? vve doe not loue her, whatsoeuer we say vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flatteryng hyr, perhaps, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vanytyes, vve do not fall dovvn before hyr vvyth teares, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaylyng the vvrath of God kyndled agaynst hyr, yf by hyr adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed permyssion, and by meanes of hyr marya<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, God should be so hyghly dyshonored in thys kyngdome, vvhervvyth he hath honored her.

If Baal be your god take you to hym altogether. honest men serue one mayster and hym vvholly, and our mayster vvyll be so serued or not at all.</p>
            <p>Of all sinnes ingratytud ys odyous vvyth God and man: no vnthankfulnes lyke to ours, vvho hauyng bene thus long mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in peace: and in the begynnyng hauyng all natyons our enemyes, haue novv many faythfull borderyng freendes, and are rych at home through our peace and by the blessing of God: wil novv svvarue from the Lord, and trust to our ovvn deuises, and make leage vvith them, and suffer theyr Idolatry in our land, that neuer lesse loued vs then novv, vvhen they looke fayrest. Good Lord (if it be possible) make vs vvyse vvythout experience of our soly. Thys vvere to set vp altar agaynst altar, and vvyth Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus to offer the foule svvine in the holy sanctuary, for this sin of Idolatry committed, great iudgements haue bene executed vpon the transgressors. vvhereby all they that beleue the story of the scripture, and are not stark Atheistes, must confes that thys feare vvhych vve feare is no vayne feare.</p>
            <p>The old vvorld vvas drovvned, the people of God often giuen <note place="margin">Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for Idolatry.</note> vp into theyr enemies handes, and in the end, the tvvelue tribes of Salomons kingdome rent a sunder, and a perpetual translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:18498:9"/>
often tvveluethes out of Salomons posterity for euer. Ieroboam vvhen he set vp alters in the land of Israel contrary to Gods law, he would haue bene loath that any man should haue sayd he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Idolatry or made the people Idolatrous: yet that sin fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovved, and he throvven. out of Gods fauour, noted with a foule blot for a ringleader in sin often reputed in the scripture, his king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom cam to naught, &amp; the vvhole people suffered a transmigrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on irretornable in Affiria. The onely feare of thys sin hath made the heares of many good mens heads stand right vp. Dauid durst not take the Idoles name in his mouth, he would then haue sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to haue set vp an Idole to be worshipped.</p>
            <p>The memory of Asa is with a holy prayse, for that his mother <note place="margin">1. Kin. 15. 13 2. Chr. 15. 16</note> Maacha hauing set vp a woden Image in a groue, he would not suffer her to haue her vvicked religion to the dishonour of God, but vvithout reuerence of her superstitious request deposed her from her dignity vtterly, and brake downe her Idole, stamped it, and burnt it at the brooke Kidron. In which story I pray you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue these two circumstances, king Asa the son, to his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the maner hovv he did it, euen with despight to Idolatry and zeale to God. The Lord send Queene Elizabeth the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting commendation of Asa for many such notable actes. Elize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us protesteth by othe that he woulde not once talke with Ioram King of Israel had it not bene in the presence of Iosaphat. Priuate men are bidden to flye from Idolatry, &amp; Princes beare the Lords sword to make it flee and to chace it far away. If therefore they vvill have his hand to hold vp theyr svvord, they muste let ther svvord serue him chieflie. But most notably the feare of thys sin euen before it was committed, and hovve ielous therefore they should be that are in authority, appeares in the ende of Iosue, where the children of Israell feared least the Lord vvould impute to them as all one faulte to commit Idolatrye in them selues and not to remoue it in their brethren. VVhich made them vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the the tribes of Ruben, Gad and the halfe of Manasseh, after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Canaan, at theyr departure home, ouer Iordan, had sette vp but one Alter, of a good meaning in deede and for a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:18498:10"/>
of theyr vnity in Religion vvith theyr brethren, but suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the reste of the trybes to be set vp to the dishonour of the Lord and contrary to his lavv, vvhych commaunded but one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter throughout the land: they the other ix trybes &amp; a halfe whose lotts vvere fallen vvithin Iordane, assembled themselues, and, had not theyr rulers and princes that went Ambassadors ouer to Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, broughte a reasonable and a religious satisfaction by the Reubenites answere, vvere ready to fal out vvith theyr brethren vvhome othervvise they loued, rather then to vvincke at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor of theyr heauenly father.</p>
            <p>The reason of vvhich theyr doing I beseech all gouernours to marke, vvhich vvas, they feared least thorough that one Altar the anger of God should also haue consumed them. Novv if one Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, set vp in the vttermost corner of that land, threatned destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole: and the offence of tvvo trybes and a halfe, made all the rest to feare: if these Israelites feared so much at the building of an Altar vvhych vvas meant to the honour of God, and onely contrary to the outward shevv of the vvordes of the lavve: shall not vve tremble at thys Alter vvhich all the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the vvorld can not conceiue vvell of, as that vvhich hath none vse but to serue the deuil? good Nehemiah for one piece of thys our sin found in the people, feared the wrath of God &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed publike fasting &amp; prayer Let vs folovv his example that the Lord may be still our God and remember vs to do vs good.

I must needes giue the pryce of godlesse impudencie to those, vvhich vvyll needes forsooth mayntaine thys mariage as a mean to assure religion in fraunce, and to preferue the professors there from more massacres. These men haue lyke vnkind mothers, put (as it vvere) theyr owne child. the church of England to be nour sed of a french enemy and friend to Rome, and novv very kindly they take in both armes the church of fraunce, and giue it a priuy deadly nipp, vnder colour of offering it their teates, vvherein is nought but vvind if not poyson. As therefore the ennemies to Gods truth seeke those churches ruin, throug hatred to religion: so should we, who are members of one body vvith them, haue a care of them as of our selues. The enemies think there kingdom of Antichrist can not stand, vnles Christ be put out of these chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches: let vs knovv, as those reformed Churches next vnder God and theyr owne forces, haue stoode by good neighbourhood, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so that there standing is our necessary strength.</p>
            <p>Certainly the Pope seeth vvell that one great staye vvhy ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the French King in Fraunce, nor the Spanish king in the low countryes, can destroy religion, is the helpe and avve of other Princes confessing the gospell, emong which our Queene is in regard with the chiefe. A game he seeth as vvell, that next vnder God, one greate cause vvhy hys interdictions against vs, take no place in England nor Ireland: and that those kings to whom hee hath giuen our land as it vvere to vvhom soeuer occupanti, can not come to take possession of vs: is, because that they of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion in both those countryes are as a brazen doore, and an yron wall, agaynst our popish enemies. and therefore by thys match, he seekes to sunder them from vs and vs from them, and so by vnbarring our brazen doore and treading dovvne our vval, to lay open hys passage to vs. I vvill not therefore vouchsafe this straunge suppositon of these persvvaders, the place of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to be aunsvvered in the ende, but vvill vse it for an other mayn reason of proofe in thys part, that thys mariage is agaynst the church, because it is agaynst the churches of Fraunce. the vvhich it must needes kill in the place, as they say, and vvithall
<pb facs="tcp:18498:11"/>
giue our church a deathes wound.</p>
            <p>Here is therefore an imp of the crovvne of Fraunce, to marye vvith the crovvned Nymphe of Englande. It is proued alreadye that his comming shakes the church in Englande, and hovv shall he stablish the religion in France. VVhat is France to the church <note place="margin">France.</note> of God, and to England for religions sake. Fraunce is a house of crueltie especially against Christians a principll prop of the tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering house of Antichriste, and vvithout vvhich our VVesterne Antichriste had bene ere this sent to his brother Mahomet into Greece vvhether he long sence sent his maisters the Emperoures of Rome.

VVhich though the Lord doe not yet bring in vppon hym thorough hys long suffering, yet assuredly there is a measure of hys wickednes measured out, and a tyme for his iudgements, vvhensoeuer the Saintes of God haue filled his bottle vvith teares. The plague common to the house he hath. That is, he vvants one of his loins to sit vpon his seate. So that vve see by proofe in three brothers that the Lord wyll not leaue one of Ahabs house.

            <p>Touching thys prynce novv offered to thys church in mariage, if he be behynd in mischiefes, remember he is younger in yeeres, <note place="margin">Monsieur.</note> and neuer came to that hability by myght of a kingdome to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his inborne malice to the church. and the discredit of hys brethern haue notably hindred hym that vvay. Neuerthelesse, so farre as his place vvould suffer, he hath bene vsed to doe that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to Rome, and damage to the church, that he vvas fit for. At the mas sacring mariage he vvas not old ynough to execute any thing, but vvas set by hys mother to cry and vveepe at the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: that so shevving some misliking of them, hys credit might be saued for such another desperate match. all the rest of the credites of the king then, and hys mother, brother, and sister being lyttle enough to colour that mischiefe. since that tyme he hath bene set a vvorke in Fraunce and Flaunders. diuers counterfeit fallings out betvveene hym and his brother, and suddein appeasings. VVhen he fled from the Court to Dreux, declaring hymselfe protector of common liberty, he quickly made first a truce, and then a peace, vvhereby to frustrate the gathering and keeping together of that great armie of protestants. If hys meaning had bene but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to religion, he vvould not haue bene at that stately assembly and signed with them, the abolishing of religion in Fraunce. He vvas content to be vsed to pull townes out of the protestantes hands, and in warres agaynst them, namely La charite &amp; Issoire. where, after hys reuolt, he committed such abominable cruelties
<pb facs="tcp:18498:12"/>
and beastly disorders as if he novv meant neuer so good fayth &amp; had neuer so honest a mynd in these matters: yet is it not lyke that this mans foule hands should lay one stone of Gods church Yea so farre is the Lord from blessing such a disloyall hand in his publicke seruice, to the saluation of others: that he curseth hym in publick and priuate, in towne and field, euen in hys ovvn soule and body to euerlasting death, vnlesse he make open acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of so open and shamefull outrages, and perseuer in vvell doing. After thys he leapes ouer Paris vvalles as fleeing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Court: and tooke on hym the voyage into Flaunders vvyth shew of some tollerable mind to religion or at least to helpe the oppressed professors: vouing vvith diuers solemne othes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king others to sweare, that they vvould neuer come at the court againe and yet presently vpon his retorne, he left his poore court all amased at Alencon, and vvith tvvo or three gentilmen onely posted to yeeld himselfe into the kings hands vvith these words. Syr I yeeld my selfe to you to dye at your feete, in your seruice, assuring you that neuer vvill I be estranged from you: vvith moe lyke vvords, such as detect greatly the French lightnes and french falshood in hym, generall to all papistes of that nation. The king vvith many embrasings and caresses gaue hym the best vvelcome in the vvorlde. On vvhich day also came to the Court the Duke Guise the great ennemy to the church of God vvith fiue or sixe hundred horses vvith vvhom vvhatsoeuer vnkindnesses he had seemed before to haue, he novv entered into a present familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie and open kindnes.</p>
            <p>VVhen vve speake therefore of Fraunce and of the practises there against the church: of their some time mitigated nature to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards <note place="margin">Queene.</note> Religion or of dissentions in apparance: and bruites of ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, vvhich the Queene mother puts as visarde vpon her prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises: vve must cast our eye wholly to her, as the very soule where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the bodies of the king, of Mousieur, of theyr sister Marguerit, and of al the great ones in Fraunce do moue, as a hundred hands to effect hyr purposes.

And thys soule of Fraunce, as it hath bene moste eager and obstinately bent against Christes church in all thinges vvherein she entermedled: so aboue the rest hath she bene a da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous practiser in mariages. For to begin vvith the mariage of her other daughter into Spayne, in the lyfe of her husband, vvhat <note place="margin">France ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth vvith Spaine and Piemont.</note> tyme a sister of hys vvas maryed into Piemont, &amp; so three greate princes linked in a threefold cord (as it vvere) by that alliaunce: all the world knoweth, that the capital capitulation and article of inprimis (as I may say) in that threefold mariage, was, against God and his annoynted. which strong cord, though the Lorde vvhich is in heauen laughed to scorne and turned to the strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the tvvisters thereof, insomuch as the father dyed present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the daughter liued but a shorte tyme after and with small ioy: yet hath not thys spyder left to twist once more.</p>
            <p>And albeit in the mariage of the first daughter she spedde not <note place="margin">Parisien mariage.</note> so well, by reason there was no sin of the church in it (for they yoked themselues asses to asses) yet in ioyning thys latter sister vvith the king of Nauarre, she had better luck, because our sins ioyned with hers, in that we ioyned one of our Oxen to one of her shee asses. In thys tragedy she played her part naturally, and shewed howe she gouernes all Fraunce. Her daughter Margerit vvas the stale to lure and allure them that othervvise flewe hyghe houering a far of and could not be gotten. her son, then king, was in all the haste become a father to the Admirall and those of the religion. Monsieur that then was and now king, he played false semblant, as though he had bene merueylons angry at the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age &amp; at the grace which the Admiral and the rest of the religion found with the king. Monsieur that now is, he played the childes part or weeping part, reseruing hys credit as is a foresayd, til a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per age, all thys whyle the mother as setter forth of thys earnest game, stoode holding the booke (as it were) vppon the stage and told her children and euery other player what he should say. the
<pb facs="tcp:18498:13"/>
last acte was very lamentable. A king falsifyed hys sworne word: The mariage of a kings sister embrued with blood: A king mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered hys subiectes: many noble &amp; honourable gentilme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vsed: valiant men surprysed by cowards in theyr beddes: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents put to death: vvemen and children without pitye tossed vpon halberds and throvvne downe wyndowes and into Riuers: learned men killed by barbarous souldiers: the seyntes of God ledde to the shambles all the day long and all that weeke long, by vyle crochetors or porters: the church of Christ rased, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nest egge broken, as farr as mens mischeeuous reasonable wit cold reach: and, that which was worst, those that liued, were com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pelled to forsweare theyr God: and little ones Christened before to Christ, were novv dipped agayne to Antichrist.</p>
            <p>He therefore that loueth the church, can not think this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to promise any happynes to Gods church in Fraunce. Noe certenly as touching the church, it hath that mischeuous ende set vnto it by them, which the former mariages had. God graunt we harken not in thys match to the present French king and his bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther: least by abusing vs also inmariage thorough our sinnes, vve thorough vnaduised policie fall in the same snare vvith our good brethren: and the king with hys brother for so abusing vs, be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to theyr fathers and buried vvith them in the same graue or hel of infamie, by Gods manifest iudgements vpon them. And which is all the good can come to the churches of Fraunce by thys mariage, the Queene mother, seeing novv all her foure sons after a sort to be kinges, fynd that delphick ansvver of her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar spirites subtilly fulfilled: so as she may chalenge no longer life of the deuill, but that he to vvhom she hath giuen her selfe, muste rid that Realme and those poore churches of her.</p>
            <p>A man vvould thynke that thys matter needed not to be anye vvhit set forth, but that the very name of the Parifien mariage should a fray any protestant of Eugland or Fraunce from euer lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for any good to come, by committing this il. yea the scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging rod vvhich followed so hard at the heeles of that sinne, and vvhere iudgement began at Gods house, should as a thonderclap
<pb facs="tcp:18498:14"/>
of Gods vvrath astonish all politiques. And if Thadmerall &amp; the hundred thousand men vvemen and children, vvhose innocente blood solemnized that mariage, myght be sent to vs againe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the dead: they would, out of theyr heauenly loue to Gods church heare on earth, lyuely and hottly diswade thys kind of mariage: they vvould lay forth the harmes of that mariage: with such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiued afections as their wounds would bleede afresh and theyre headlesse bodies speake (as it were) before you. But vve haue Moses and the Prophets, vve haue Christ and his Apostels: if we beleeue not them, we shall be taught by late experience, and go the way of our Parisien brethern. Yea though thys mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, should not haue, towards vs, that malicious bloody ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vvhych is meant, and that it should but vveaken vs, as that of Spayn did, alas neuertheles for the poore protestantes in france: there ruin were present. for we saw when, before the great mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, there vvas a new coloured freendship made with our Queen such as vvith other Princes (in respecte whereof both she &amp; they vvere notably abused and vvronged by the massacer following:) that friendship serued first to bleare the eyes of the French pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, and after to put them quite out. which single friendship vvith the Queene, if it made the french king the bolder to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the murder, how far will he presume hauing a brother in the hart of our Court to refresh the remembrance of his alliaunce &amp; to stay any contrary aydes from hence, vvhyle he seise vpon hys protestants and vvorry them lyke sheepe.</p>
            <p>And if Monsieur had any sinceare meaning to relieue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, he would employ all that credit and familiarity vvhych he now hath, whyle he is present vvith the king, to the protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts <note place="margin">Feeble hope of Monsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eurs change.</note> good: euen now when as they seeme to haue some neede of him. He meanes nothing les: and that he means the contrary, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely be gathered by the manye blasphemous speeches and cruell threatnings agaynst reformed religion, proceeding from suche as bene in the trayn of hys present legate a latere in England. hys ill vvyll also to helpe the protestants, may appeare, that wher as there haue bene since the last peace many violences, murders, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:18498:14"/>
outrages, and iustice for those facts denyed, and establishment of churches, vvithstood, all against the edict: yet Monsieur, shevved neuer to haue any common compassion, such as some man wold haue vpon beastes, when he saw them ouerburdened. In fraunce, he hantes the mas, and is hanted onely of papistes. In Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he ioyned himselfe onely with the Papistes, and strengthned that tumultuous parte of the VVallons from whence all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent disorder there, comes, and thaduantage to the Spaniard by mutuall discention. hys messenger here, though he be in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conuersation with the kings Ambassador, and at one table: yet can not one mas serue them, but they must haue three or four Priestes, that doe nothing but goe from the tauarn to mas and from mas to the tauarn. A miserable hope therefore of the maisters change to good.</p>
            <p>And to conclude thys part, vulesse he had some extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry purpose and some Italian Quintessence of mischiefe meante to be compassed against the church of Christ, in vvhich seruice the Pope will employ hys catholike and hys christien sonne and all his sonnes, and they like obedient fooles doe hys will. it could not be possible that hee woulde speake of comming hether with any meaning. For pope, mother, and brother, and all papistes vvould resist it. and he himselfe for his owne part, would cast with hymselfe, that, being next king of Fraunce, if he should be here at the death of hys brother, he might beholden for a noble hostage till they had restored vs our manyfold wronges. and againe on the otherside, it might put hym in danger of hys French king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, being there but slendrly beloued for his famelie and for his person, and where other greate houses for valure in theyr per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and perhapes title of theyr auncesters would be iudged by the vvise and by the multitud more worthy to reign ouer them. and so perhaps we might keepe a gage that they would not care to redeeme.

In tyme of poperye vvhen the Romane prelate vsurped vpon our prince for conferring benefices, Abbeis, and such liuings here, to <note place="margin">Priors aliens</note> Italians, French, and other alians at hys pleasure, yet vvould the kings of those blindest dayes suspect treachery in these holy Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots and Priors whom othervvise they made theyr Goddes, &amp; vvould vvithout feare of sacriledge, sequester theyr profites vnto the kings cofers and seize the lande of those holye alians, leaste they might perhaps vvage foreigne soldiar vvith English pay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst the king of England. vvhereof they gaue manifest experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to king Henrye the fift vvho hauing founded an Abbay vvherein he put French fryers, and in a visitation, as theyr founder fynding them negligent in theyr deuotions: he asked the good father of the house vvhat vvas the cause. vvho ansvvered flatlye that they could not naturally pray for him, that had bene enemy in himselfe and his auncesters to them and theyr forefathers and to theyr land vvhich by kind they loued. so much nature remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

Novve if a founder of a beggerly rable of fryers, could not haue theyr prayers, vvhich at that tyme vvent a begging and vvere neuer so deere but a man might haue a long paternoster for a peny: hovv deinty vvoulde they be of theyre monye to Englishmen and hovve liberall in almes to ayde theyr ovvne countryes and countrymen? Likewise in the dayes of king Edvvard the first, certaine aliens richly beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificed, refused to ayde the king in hys vvars: for vvhich obstina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, albeit the Pope vvould not let him depriue them, yet vvas he so bould as to put them out of his protection, leauing theyr liues out of defence or reuenge by lavv. For these reasons, to thys daye it is expressed in the most large and most benificiall Legitimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to any alien, that he shall not dvvell in Barvvick, Hampton or such maritime or other towne of trust. and all for feare leaste that theyr loue towardes theyr own countryes, or hatred to ours bredde in theyr bones, should neuer out of the flesh. So that vve see no alien is made so legalis or ligeus to the crovvne of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land but with some restraint to him in respect of the state, which can neuer so kindly matriculate him as the childe vvhich she hath born in her owne vvombe</p>
            <p>And we are the more loth to put our shoulders vnder this bur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den any more, because already vve haue felt the weight of the little finger and smarting whips of thys incommoditye. vvhich vvould seeme yet so much the more irksome to vs, if novve after moe then tvventy yeeres svveete fredome therefro, we shoulde be pressed dovvne vvith the heauy loynes of a vvorse people &amp; beaten as vvith scorpions by a more vile nation. In vvhich respecte it hath bene alwayes yelden vnto her maiestie, for the chiefe and first benifite done to thys kingdome, that she redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it and yet, not she but the Lord by her, from a forraine king: according to the worthynes vvhereof, it hath bene from time to time notably set forth in monumentes of ecclesiasticall story, and ciuil cronicles, as a singular commendation to the happy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of her reigne: yea it made her subiectes in loue with her the very first day, &amp; hath encreased it mightely to thys houre. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

            <p>For whereas all these kinds of aliances with realmes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted for mutuall support, thys aliance presently in talk, hath no such hope. These Frenchmen gaue such tryall of theyr loyall ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and of theyr profitable neighbourhood to the Grecians, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvhile they were yet in Galatia from vvhence their french <note place="margin">Frenchmen.</note> bragge is to come, eyther els in theyr vagabond time while they sought a place to set their foote on, that an Emperour of Greece burnt them vvith this caremarke vvhich they cary till this day:

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>According to the vvhich counsell of Greece, the true and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall old English nation neuer esteemed nor loued the French: they haue it sonck so deepe and deepely layd vp in theyre hart, as the sauour wherewith theyr yong shels were seasoned to the son from graundfather to father, who in teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shoote wold haue them image<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a frenchman for theyr butt, that so in shooting they might learne to hate kindly, and in hating learne to shoote neearely. Out of thys inbred hatred it came, that Frenchmen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other aliens beare thys addition in some of our auncient chronicles, Charters, and, statuts to be the auncient ennemies of England. And can it be saufe that a straunger and Frenchman, should as owner possesse our Queene, the chiefe officer in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, our most precious rych treasure, our Elizabeth IONAH and ship of good speede, the royall ship of our ayde, the hyghest tovver, the strongest hold, and castle in the land?</p>
            <p>It will not be receiued for aunswer to affirme barely, that thys feare is without ground of truth, because, forsooth, the Realme <note place="margin">Alteration of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> must still be gouerned as before. vve knovv that de iure it shoulde be so. But in matters of kingdomes, who can say that de facto it
<pb facs="tcp:18498:19"/>
shalbe so? will any perswader of thys mariage offer himself a gage of lyfe and death, that it shall be so? If he and many moe vvoulde yet are they no counterpoise to the Queene and Realme, whose life and good estate comes here to be warranted. For if he marye her vvith that good loue on both parts, which I wish with al my poore hart betweene her maiestie and her godly husband when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer she shall marye: yet shall he beare a greate swaye vvith her, vvho beares all the swaye vvith vs. and if he doe not loue her (the Lord keepe her from prouing) then must shee feare hym. so as for feare or loue, he will rule her and the whole land for her sake. And thys is done many times without taking on him supreme authority. for if he doe but eyther giue or sel, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the French manner our chiefe offices: he may rule thoughe not as head, yet by those his promoted creatures, as by so manye hands and feete. and though he be not president in the counsayl, nor once admitted to sit personally in the chamber: yet vvoulde it be no hard thing for him to thrust in at the doore such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailors in whose mouth he may speake, and by them, as by hyred spialles, to know what is doen at that bourd: and as by knightes at his post to passe or repulse vvhat him pleaseth.</p>
            <p>The example of the king of Spayne serues for me in this case, and not for those which woulde make vs beleeue he stoode for a <note place="margin">K. of Spayn.</note> cypher in Algorisme. For how many great matters obteyned he? and it is knovven too well, what pensionars he had of that hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable company of counsailors, againe, at that time, the mariage with Spayne was not so dangerous nor offering such cause of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spition as nowe. for there was not yet come into the worlde out of the smokye pyt of hell any such holy leage as absolueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand all conspiratif oathes giuen vs. Fraunce and Spayn were then in wars: they are since allied by mariage of a French daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by whome Spayne hath a daughter: and the lest alliance in the vvorld bindes them together against religion. And thoughe I esteeme the king of Spayne for a loyall king of inuiolate fayth &amp; vvhole honor in respect of the French king: yet am I so farre off from sound truste in eyther of them both, that considering howe
<pb facs="tcp:18498:19"/>
Spayn doates vpon that dronken harlot of Rome, I vvould be loath that eyther Frannce or Spayne shoulde haue such a Porter here to let them in at a posterne gate, as Monsieur is. Yea I do not onely set thys popish French fayth behind the Spanishe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of promise holding: but I affirme without doubting, that it is not so safe to contract this neere alliance with these French, as to make some other commun amitie with those Moores beyonde Spayn. whose barbarian religion and region, though it be farther from vs then Fraunce: yet doe those mores hold more Fayth with straungers then these French doe vvith themselues.</p>
            <p>A most illcome guest therefore to all sorts of men here. for to take thys vvhole land in a lump, and to make no difference of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist or protestant: I am sure the deuoutest papist that hath an Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lysh hart left to knok vpon in his breast, wyllbe afrayde to call Monsieur his mayster. But a most daungerous guest to thys quiet of the state must he needes be, that to the griefe of the greatest <note place="margin">Contrary religion.</note> part and chiefe strength of the lande, requires open exercise of a contrary religion, for him selfe and hys, giuing great hope therby to others of obteyning some indifferent Interim. Now to proue that any alteration in religion or expectation to haue religion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is a politique bile enflaming the peace of a setled and euen state: I might haue sufficient authority, to some men, out of mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciauel. But I loath once to take vp hys best textes thoughe they were vvritten in golden letters of the fayrest text hand. Hereon vvill I onely rest for thys poynt, that to alter our good religion, or to giue any premission to so wicked Idolatry as is hys, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay Gods blessing from the state, whose prouidence it is wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Rulers reigne and states doe stand. And let him, pardie, that holdes himselfe the best politique, hold thys with me for a corner stone and most luckie principle in policie: that, as to bring in and hold true religion, procureth Gods protection, and worketh sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects obedience of hart farre aboue all other lawes or feare of lawes: so, to put out Gods gospell and to bring in Idolatrye, or to enlarge Antichrist and streighten the passage of Christ, doth shut all bessing from heauen: so as the Lord shall curse our counsayle
<pb facs="tcp:18498:20"/>
and cast vs in our vvisedome of ouerweening. In vvhich behalfe, we haue somewhat already felt of that iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for our fault of once deliberating so vngodly a thing. for wisemen in marieng of theyr children will most willingly seeke houses of auncient a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and carefully doe auoyd the seede of olde enemity, which is heriditarie, as other diseases are. and we are not so wise in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of our common vveale. for what house is more aunciently enemy to her maiesties royall auncestors and thys land, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of Valois? what king more out of leage or longe truce with thys <note place="margin">Valois.</note> state then he of Fraunce? as he who can not be content onely to vsurpe a kingdom from vs, but is impatient that our prince shold so much as beare the true title thereof. And if we vvere such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies when vve had but ciuill quarrelles and onely, vter regna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, hovv should not our hate be multiplyed, vvhen it is de aris et focis, and consequently, vter sit et viuat? And if entermariages e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselues in theyr ovvne family, can not stay this furye of theyrs, but that for religion onely and none other quarel, their very pitie is cruelty euen vpon theyr ovvne bovvels, murdering and massacring one another by thousands and ten thousandes: hovv shall any mariage make them friendes to vs, vvhom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute as olde enemies and haue yet bleeding in theyr chronicles the dishonors and vvounds heretofore giuen from hence to their kinges &amp; aunceters? No no, vvell sayd that vvise Troyan Timeo Danaos vel dona ferentes: and vvell may a simple Englishman say, timeo gallos, namely Valesios, nuptias ambientes especiallye such mixt mariages, vvhich vve knovv to be othervvise agaynste theyr ovvne conscience.</p>

And that cruelty raged not onely on the poore and selye ones, but it tooke the noble men and great princes by the throate. Yea the king of Nauarre hymselfe who vvas the spouse in that infamous mariage to the

end of the world, had the deadly sword hanging ouer his head by a tvvine thred, and had felt the poynt thereof if he had not to hys dishonour (the Lord be honoured in his repentance) renied hys God.

            <p>Beside thys late experience in our eyes of theyr daungerous dealings in mariages emong them selues, vve may learne, if vve <note place="margin">Examples auncient.</note> be so happy, by the auncient hurts that Englande haue receiued through royall intermariages vvith that nation: and by the rules vvhich the vvise English counsellers of those times haue set down as a state vvisedome for their succeding counsellers. yea vve may see, that these mariages vvith Fraunce or vvith any other partes of that present dominion, before or sence it vvas united to that crovvne, haue alvvayes endamaged England, and sometime Fraunce to. so as, for most part, they might be reckoned emong those ill bargaynes that no bodye gaynes by, and therefore be <note place="margin">Henry first</note> lyke cursed from aboue.

            <p>So that of old, the alliances of Fraunce dyd set husbande and vvife together by the eares as in Henry the second and Edvvarde the second: the father and son together, as they did Henry the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and hys three sons, Henry, Rycharde, and Iohn: brother a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst brother, as Rychard and Iohn: the king and hys people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither,

And because I find the vvords of thys Duke set dovvne more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly in a French chronicle then any vvhere els, I vvill vse theyr <note place="margin">A vvitnes vvithour ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</note> ovvne vvords as the fittest testimony in thys case. The alliance of Fraunce (sayth that Duke in that french story) hath bene the ruine of England, and this nevve frendship betvveene these kings (sayth the Duke) shall neuer make me loke for any assured peace attvvene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for (sayth he) ther vvas neuer yet any trust or religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or truth in the vvord or promises of the French. VVhat an aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent &amp; hereditary disease of disloyalty is this in the royall seate of Fraunce, especially since the Maiors of the housholde became kinges? And though thys Dukes voice in thys counsell vvere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruled by the multitude, or rather by the lust of the king: yet did the king and his people and their children feele hovve true it was in sequele. For first thys externe amitie with Fraunce, bred home enemitye in England. It cost vs for an earnest penny the tovvne of Brest in Britanie, by meanes of the kings outlandish Queen. And poore king Richard vsing in priuate connsaise alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the French companions, such as his vvyfe brought: began to disdeyne his ovvne naturall kinsmen and subiects, and finallye follovving ouermuch the cruell and riotous counsel of such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, namely the Constable of Fraunce and Erle of S.

Henry of Lancaster, afterwardes Henry the fourth. vvho during the tyme that he platted thys enterprise, founde hospitalitye in Fraunce for all king Rychards alliance vnder his father in lavves nose. The French match it vvas vvhich vvithin one yere brought the king to dishonorable captiuitie, death, and deposing. vvhich appeares, for that in story it is rekoned, emong other thinges that alienated from him the loue of hys subiects, so farre as when he vvas taken, hys enemy vvas fayne to saue hys lyfe by garde from hys ovvn people, and also it is obiected agaynst hym that he had made thys alliance vvith Fraunce, not calling to counsail the thre estates of England. Euen the last mariages vve made vvith France <note place="margin">Henry. 5.</note> vvere lyke vnhappy to the end. Henry the fift that noble king had the alliance of Katherin daughter to Charles the seauenth of Fraunce, and after had the possession of Fraunce, first by right of descent and mariage, then by conquest of sword, and lastly by co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenant agreed with king Charles and his peeres. yet coulde he none othervvise hold theyr loue, but hauing theyr necks vnder hys yoke. VVhych vnion of possession and right, to that realme, <note place="margin">Henry. 6.</note> vvas aftervvard fortified by crouning hys sonne Henry the sixt in Paris and by a nevv match betweene hym and Marguerit daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a French Charles, as most men saien, vvhich cost hym first for a princely brybe, the dukedome of Angeow and Ereldome of Main, and after many miserable destructions of our English che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualry &amp; people lost both the new co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quired title &amp; ancient heridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarye dominions on that side, and finally vvrought an ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious depriuation of Henry the sixt from this realme. I think, I might set dovvue all such matches, as vnhappy ones: and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivvise those matches nothing so vnhappy, but for the most parte prosperous, vvhich were made eyther at home or in other places, as vveren al those mariages made since Henry the sixt as by Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvarde <note place="margin">Home mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges happy.</note> the fourth her Maiesties greatgraundfather, and by her maiesties graundfather and by her father.</p>

And if our wise and renoumed forefathers of England passed vvithout stombling o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the threshold of suspecting the french aliance, euen then wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the french men professed &amp; held the lavves of atmes vvyth theyr enemies as soldiers: let vs not be nicely fearefull to passe the bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of honorable modestie, in iudgeing of the present princes vvhich professe to deceiue and break fayth vvith such as vve are, yea let vs boldly &amp; vvisely cast this doubt that they vvhose frend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ships vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had not so il purposes, but thought it their honor to match with vs, wrought vs yet thys woemust nedes novv hurt vs according to their hateful falshod in dealing with vs, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they esteme, according to their doctrin of Rome, no better then dogs.</p>
            <p>Novve as there is daunger on the parte of the French for great troubles to follovve by thys mariage, as vvell for that they haue nevv fangled and stirring common wealth heads, lusting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Innouations, as also for the ielousie of tvvo so neere borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring kingdomes: euen so vvill it be harder then yron for English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <note place="margin">Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

and who are the scome of the kings Court, which is the scomme of all France, vvhich is the scomme of Europe, vvhen they seeke, like horseleaches, by sucking vpon vs to fill theyr beggerly purses to the satis fieng of theyr bottomlesse expence: the poore playne and rude Englishman firste giue him the elbovve in the strete, then the fist and so proceeding to farther bicquerings in pryuate quarrels, great troubles ryse of small beginnings. for as touchinge the humble, mild, persecuted, and religious Frenchmen, that we receiue him as a vvelbeloued brother, and that our old grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging nature against the french in this respect, is expelled, as it wer vvith a fork. that comes by the force of religion, the Lord hauing wrought it in our heartes. But against these irreligious, haughtye and faithlesse frenchmen, that bring in a religion contrarye to ours, &amp; haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science nor loue to vse vs kindly, our English nature vvil return a main to his own course. which thinges also may euidte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly appeare to any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that wold but mark how sadly &amp; heauily &amp; with hovv sorovvful cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenances all the multitude of English both nobilitie &amp; comminaltye looke, casting vp theyr hands &amp; eyes to heauen vvhen they doe but talke of the matter.</p>
            <p>This stinging straunger of Fraunce muste vve keepe vvarme in our bosom at our ovvn intollerable charge, which is another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not to be neglected, sith treasure is a principall sinevv of any <note place="margin">A charge to the Realme.</note> state: and therefore vvould not be wasted, much lesse therevvyth to buye our own harme. For they are ouer credulous to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vvho vvith the emptie name of Monsieur, and of the French kings brother, wold promise such other fooles as list credit them, mountaines of golde and great gaine to thys royall state, by hys vvorshipfull reuenues forsooth bringing in king Phillip (vvho serues them in thys deuise for all in all) for theyr example. Fyrst vvho knowes not thys in generall that euery prince, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so rich, will hoard vp hys owne treasure, and spend of the straunge purse. and it is a notable policie for our french enemye, by this meanes to weaken the verye knees and hammes of our Realm. Novv, that vvhich other princes do of worldly vvisedom: Monsieur must doe of meere necessitie. for let his receiptes be

great for a subiect, yet shall they not be sufficient to maintain his mind in state of so great a priuce &amp; companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our Queen. for eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alreadie his debtes &amp; expences are sayd to be farther at odds with his reuenues, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many yeres receipts can yeld the arerages.</p>
            <p>But these perswaders, as men hauing theyr eyes daseled vvyth the golden sun, are ouer affectioned to thys match and can not see that Monsieur hath not moe countyes then king Phillip had archdukedomes: nor so many dukedoms as king Phillip had king<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>domes: and that he is not able to dropp halfe testons for king Phillips pîstelas: nor vvith siluer to weighdowne his gold: as also that king Phillip for al those dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; mines of treasures, was content to be pingling vvith our purses: made Queene Mary to aske moe extraordinary and frequent subsides and taskes, then had bene seene in so short a raigne: further causing her to borow more loanes of hundred powndes, forty pounds tvventy pounds, and ten poundes of her subiects, then vvere euer payd agayn by a great sort. thus gleaning the monie from the subiects, &amp; by arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls lading out of the eschequer, that both the land and the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer was left as empty to the Queenes maiestie that novv is, as it vvas many a daye.

And yet must vve haue king Phillip broughte in for example of a gainefull ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to England. In dede vve had great cause to thank the Lords mercy, vvho deliuered vs from that king his power, as vve had to thank our sins that vve vvere giuen into hys hand. but vve may say vve scaped a scouring. for, but that he vvas newly setled in his owne kingdome, and could not tary to be warme in his bedd here, the end vvould haue ben vvorse then the beginning, he wold haue holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hard, if not for the soile of the kingdom, yet for the nauie, for the ordinance, and other chiefe moueable treasures
<pb facs="tcp:18498:24"/>
and reall Ievvels of the land. All vvhich thinges come in a more daunger with thys Prince, because if he be king of fraunce, he shalbe neerer and readier by colorable polices to vvythdravv by little and little all thinges from hence in her Maiesties lysr, &amp; by force to chalenge them, if (VVhich God say nay to) she shoulde be hys vvife and dye before hym.</p>
            <p>There is another daungerous daunger in thys forreine french match that aryseth yet far higher, in that he is the brother of <note place="margin">Monsieur heir aspara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Fraunce &amp; the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers therby.</note> childles Fraunce. So as, if Henry the thyrd novv king, should dye the morrovv after our mariage, and Monsieur repare home, as we may be svre he would, into hys natiue country a larger and better kingdom: then, by all likelihode, eyther must our Elizabeth goe vvith him out of her ovvne natiue country and svvete soyle of England, vvhere she is Queene as possessor and inheritor of thys imperial crovvne vvithall regall rights, dignities, perogatiues, pre heminences, priuileges, autorities, and iuredictions of thys kingly office and hauing the kingrike in her owne person, into a forrain kingdome vvhere her vvritt doth not runn &amp; shalbe but in a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovved Maiestie as the moone to the sonn, shining by night as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kings vvyues, and so she that hath ruled all this vvhile heere shalbe there ouer ruled in a straung land by some belledame not vvithout avve perhapps of a sister in lavv, and vve hyr poore sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects that haue bene gouerned hetherto by a naturall mother, shalbe ouerlooked at home by some cruel and proud gouernour, or els must she tary here vvithout comfort of her husband, seing her selfe despised or not vvifelike esteemed and as an eclipsed son diminished in souereinty, hauing such perhappes appoynted to serue hyr and be at her commaundement after the french phrase, vvhich in playn English vvill gouerne her and her state.</p>
            <p>In thys great matter vvhat an illuding ansvver is it agayn by the particular example of the king of Spayne to put avvay thys <note place="margin">Spanish K.</note> reason grounded vpon these tvvo generall rules. The first is, that a straunger mighty king brought into a realme to ayde them as <note place="margin">strange ayd.</note> vvas the Turke and his sarasins, or vpon any lighter occasion, vvill hardly be gotten out againe. The second, a straunger king
<pb facs="tcp:18498:24"/>
dravven in by our sins and sent by Gods iustice for our punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not ridd vvithout Gods extraordinary help. Novv syr, because vve vvere once happily dispatched of Spayne, therefore vve shall once againe commit thys gross follye and contemne that generall rule of policie. And because the Lord in mercy dyd once deliuer vs from Spayn, therfore vve vvill tempt him agayn by deliuering our selues into the hands of Fraunce. Alas for these men, if king Phillip had neuer maryed Queene Mary and if thys matter had ben to dispute xxvij. yeeres agoe, then had they had no one reason for theyr side, nor no ansvver to escape any of our arguments. and thys absurd manner of reasoning is very Maccia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelian logick, by particular examples thus to gouern kingdoms and to set dovvn general rules for his prince vvhereas particulars should be vvarranted by generals. But there mayster vvrested hys vngratious vvit euer to the mayntenance of a present state, and these foolish schoolers put forth theyr gross conceipts to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrovv of thys present, in hope of, I vvot not vvhat, futur com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon vvealth of their ovvn head. Some subtilty ther is also in this <note place="margin">French ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage more dangerous the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spanish.</note> aunsvver, that vvhen vve are to deliberate of Fraunce vvhych is the more nere and more auncient, therfore more daungerous enemy, to anoy vs vvith his forces and to hold vs if he once haue vs: they bryng vs in example Spayn, a more remote potentate &amp; an auncient friend, one that vvas at that tyme of one religion vvith thys kingdom, and therfore not so pricked to hasten some chaung in our state, as thys man, vvho being ledd by Antichrist must not endure vvith any patience that state vvher Christ is. Moreouer our dispofitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> more ready to vvarr with Fraunce then vvith Spayn, is holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by more continual occasions giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of both sides, by more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueniencie of means to perform sodenly, vvhich vvill make them let no opportunity slyp, that may bring so com bersome a neighbour vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as vve are.

might so easely let by helping vs. But now is there no enemity betvvene Fraunce and Spayne to let thys practise: they are of kin by the flesh, and by theyr religion. and the holy leage ties them togither in that respect as it vvere faggotstiks. And in truth Spayn being so far and Fraunce so nere, Fraunce hath great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage in thys co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison and cannot be so letted of Spayne, as Spayn may be by him.</p>
            <p>These daungers vvherein this daungerous pactise of mariage vvrappeth Queen Elisabeth in hyrlyfe time and hyr England to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether alike, vvill, I doubt not, moue those in authority to auoyd them and others that are priuate to pray against them most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently.

as had a sound body and holy soule, and yet not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither, onles she may first find it to stand with her lyfe and safety:</p>
            <p>And vvhen I think more earnestly of thys matter, me thinkes it must needes come first of a verye French loue to our Queene and land, to seeke thys mariage, euen now so eagerly at the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most tyme of hope to haue issue, and at the very poynt of most <note place="margin">Note.</note> daunger to her Maiestie for childbearing: whereby they think, if her Maiestie haue issue, to see eyther the mother die in childbedd (vvhich the Lord forbid) and the land left again as theyrs hath bene, to an infant: or els to see both mother and childe put in a graue, and so the land left a spoyle to forrein inuasion, and as a stack of vvood to ciuill vvars. All is one to them sauing that they desire the vvorst to befall vs. And if there be any perswader of this straunge mariage, in whom remaynes yet a simple mind but missed or miscaried, I desyre hym or her, and I charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they vvill answer to God of theyr truth to their Mistres of England &amp; English brethren, that they close theyr hand and put theyr fingar to theyr mouth, and vvaigh better hereof as vvell by the lavve of God, as of humane policie vvhich must, no doubt, agree vvyth Gods law. I cousell them to consider these daungers common to them selues vvith all other. and if they looke vvell about them, they shall find thys mariage a right vnhappy one, and on no side happy, vvheresoeuer they turne them.</p>
            <p>For let it be that he haue issue by her and that none but feamal only: vve haue hazarded our kingdom for putting it in the hands of the father, vvho vnder colour of some tutorship to hys daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <note place="margin">Issue female onely.</note> vvill haue her into Fraunce and so eyther adioyne this land to Fraunce, or mary her to some French or other stranger at hys ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: and all this vvhyle vve neuer the neere possession of our old right in Fraunce whych vve so much desired. for the Salique lavve barres hyr quite. And though she should come and dwel in England, yet her bringing vp being in Fraunce, her father will nousell her in hys own religion, and so she comming home shall striue to staplish popery, as the late Queene of Scotts did when shee came out of Fraunce: vvherupon ensued those bloodshedds

Holy king Henry, as they call hym, vvhom I suppose they wyll bring in for example, vvas crovvned in Paris: and yet lost all on that side before he was a man, as I remember, or soone after, and before hys vnhappy death, he lost thys land also. vvhich losse of both came by striuing for both. So that he may with more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">Henry the sixth no good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvade by.</note> be recorded emong those fallen princes at the lowest of Boc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caces vvhele, or in our English booke of fallen Maiestrates, then to be reconed vp by any faythfull English man for a patern of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation to our present Queen Elizabeth. VVho so vvyl auoyd those feareful effects, must auoyd the cause from vvhence they procede and not bring such examples to be followed. This exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple of Henry the sixt, vvould proue like to our present case if it vvere pursued. For, the complection and constitution of Monsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur, is not to liue long, but to leaue his child in the cradle, for the reasons hereafter remébred. And if the byrth of thys child should any vvay endanger our Queen: the poore infant if he ouerliued shold haue tvvo ouer great scepters to play withall: euen as Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the sixth had. and so much the worse as there are euen novve one or tvvo houses in Fraunce vvhich vvould easely be saluted as kings, and of whom both Monsieur and the king that novve is, may vvell stand in feare. perhappes these men wold prouide that this chyld should be borne in Monmouth and not at vvinsor and then they would think all sure. Me thinks they should runn head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on this remedy that are blinded in thys euill. Thus it comes oftentimes to passe, that flattery vvoundeth princes euen vvyth the very self thinges it so fairely beareth in hand.</p>
            <p>And if he should haue a son and a daughter, so as both of them <note place="margin">Issue male and female.</note> ouer liuing theyr parents, the son should be actually king as vvell of hys fathers as of his mothers kingdome and then dye wythout issue: hys sister yet liuing: is it not more then probable in this case that the next prince of the blood in Fraunce vnder pretence that England vvas once vested in the blood of the French king and vnder theyr gouernment vvyl drawe it also by thys vnity of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session vvith the crown of Fraunce, vnder the law Salique and so quite vnqueen the desolate sister? for the least color in the worlde

ioyned vvith the sword in a stronge highminded kings hande, makes a good tytle to a kingdome, euen agaynst father, mother, wyfe, brother, and sister: as storyes witnes, and according to that vvhich is sayd, No fayth in matter of a kingdome. Much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst that poore daughter vvhich then should be a straunger in the house of Fraunce. The actuall possession of her brother, vvyll make no tytle: neyther wyll it be any plea, to say that by our lavves, lands descended from the mother are guyded to the heyrs of the part of the mother. but our issue must be battel, vvhich is a tryall most incertain, most perilous to the daughter vvho being out of possession, shal haue much adoe to find equiualiant cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions.</p>
            <p>And if thys Monsieur should haue by our Queen, two sons or moe: it must needes breed forrain vvars and ciuill partaking tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <note place="margin">Two sons or moe.</note> disagreement of the brethren, vvhyle the younger looking back to the tymes of william the first, vvould chalenge to haue kingdomes and such regall dominions deuided emong chyldren, as the Conquerer did vvith England and Normandye: and the elder knovving himselfe according to the present lavves heire to both vvould clayme both: vtterly denying this carpet conqueste of Monsienr to be any conquest lyke that of VVilliam. And so that miserable ciuill dissention in England renued after hir, which in the peacemaking mariage of her noble grandfather, and in the person of hyr royall father, and in continaunce of that ligne in hir hitherto is happyly quenched. He that confesseth all these inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences and weenes to prouide for them with his penn in hys studye, or by acts of parliament, or by any other conditioning of oathes and sworn promises contested at theyr hygh altar of their masse, forgets the many experiences of sayths most solemnly ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, falsified. on the other side he that scornes thys our particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing of thys matter and putting of the case, vvhat if he haue is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue male onely, or female onely, must be put in mind agayn, how vnlyke it is for her to haue any: hovv daungerous for her to haue but one: and hovv her yeeres doe necessarily denye her many. he must also remember on the side of Monsieur hovv fruteles a race
<pb facs="tcp:18498:27"/>
that is. his eldest brother had none: his seconde brother but one &amp; that a daughter: hys thyrd hath none: all of them being a forced generation by phisick after many yeeres, vvhen theyr mother fea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red to be put avvay as barraine. No vvhere therefore are vve to match vvith lesse hope of issue. And if it seeme curiositie that we proceede further in thys case, as to say what if Monsieur should haue both male and femall, or diuers males: I require of hym but so much foresight and casting of doubt for the happy staying of thys crovvne in the English ligne of our auneient kings, as noble men and other great landed ones at thys day haue. vvho in their vsuall conueighances do marshall the fal of theyr inheritances by limitation vpon limitation euen to the tenth son of theyr body begotten and to the tenth nephevv of theyr foresayd tenth son of hys body begotten. May it be lavvfull, so to prouied for the continuance of pelting maners in one familie of a subiect: and wil he not carefully cast a fevv doubts for holding of the crovvne vvith many principalities and dukedoms, for the preseruation of the capitall corporation of England: in respect vvhere of al other the greatest castelles, honors, and manors, are but mesnalties or rather very messuages and tenancyes paraual. Issue therefore, or no issue by thys Frenchmans body: the issue of this Frenchmans marrage is most dangerous to thys Realme, and the very conside<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ration of it fearefull in behalfe of our lief soueraigne.</p>
            <p>But these gloosing Frenchme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue vvhet on some of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvaders, <note place="margin">These faire vvords make no wise man fayne.

Other of our mens teeth are made to vvater with fayre promises of reposseding those seigneuries and countryes vvhich theyr no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble forefathers enioyed: as though, by meanes of thys mariage, they vvould set foote there (I knovv not hovv) before the french <note place="margin">Reuenue.</note> vvere a vvare, and sending ouer some colonies from hence of such superfluous gentilmen as themselues, they vvould holde it maugre the king there. vvith such braue vvords the false flattering frenchmen, bring fond credulous Englishmen into a supposed
<pb facs="tcp:18498:28"/>
paradise. These brauing English gentlemen are as farre from the wisedom of theyr noble auncestets of whom they speake, as from theyr courage. It vvere verely a conquest fit for gentlemen, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say the recouering of our former losses, and to begin euen vvyth our last losse first. but if these mens eyther wisedome vvere such as vvere lyke to gette it, or theyr courage such as vvere lyke to keepe it, they vvould remember that in tymes passed, the noble<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Englishmen delighted rather to be seene in Fraunce in bright ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour then in gay clothes and masking attyre. they did chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vvinn and hold by manly force, then by such esseminate meanes. Yea vvhen they did obteyn any thyng by mariage, it was not that England vvas maryed to France, but by marying france <note place="margin">As the wise is subiect to hir husband: so is hir cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to hys land.</note> to England. vvherein is great difference if a man haue the witt to marke it. For if eyther vve vvere Frenchmen or our nation more large and pleasaunt then Fraunce: vve might perhaps haue reason simply to desyre it. Then should our land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be the royall seate, our king should be resident emong vs, and our empire encreased by so many vassalles. vvhich though, by the mariages of our former kinges the flowers of kinghthood, vvould haue fallen out other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise in processe of tyme, to the same bondage of thys lande, if they had styll kept Fraunce, because theyr succeeding children kinges of England vvoulde haue remoued thither as into a more rich and pleasaunt kingdome out of Englande deuided from the world: yet had euen our forefathers in the dayes of those victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kings, that reason to desire it which vve vvant. that is, they vvent thither vvith theyr kings to be maisters of countrey and people, and to hold it by aims as strongest: &amp; vvheresoeuer theyr king vvent he was styll an Englishman, and trusted most &amp; most aduaunced Englishmen. yea those kings had euer Animam reuer tendi, as I may say, into England<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much as king Henrye the fift vvho had set surest foote in Fraunce, yet he had a mind to be brought after hys death out of fickle Fraunce into vvell stayed England. and here vve haue hys boanes. But in this mariage our Queen is to be maryed, and both she and we poore soules, are to be mastered and, vvhich is vvorse, mistrised to. And as for the
<pb facs="tcp:18498:28"/>
issue he shall be meere French, no more acknovvledging vs, then that other Pharaoh which neuer knew Ioseph.</p>
            <p>Thys therefore vvere a desyre more lyke the noble blood of those tymes, rather to fight for that vve haue not, then to daunce for that vve haue: yea, I vvill say to these dauncers for a garlonde and not for a kingly crovvne, as that duke of Glocester sayde. It vvere more commendable for these ioyly mates to demaund by word and sword those dominions whych vve haue lost, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by mariage to shut the gates of recouering any thyng lost, and to open agate of loosing all that is left. And if these men vvere ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regenerate with theyr lyuing brethren by the Gospel, or yf they were not degenerate from theyr deceased noble fathers, &amp; remained but in theyr pure naturalles, they would neuer so speak for a faultor prince of Rome, and one that may be warranted to vs and our heyres for an enemy auncestrell, as I may say, and of an hatefull blood from many graundfathers. And if they had but that naturall sense vvhich all lyuing creatures haue, to eschevv in theyr kindes all contrary and hurtfull thinges, they vvould not so labour thys matter. For vvhat if some of these perswaders can <note place="margin">English French little vvorth.</note> talke a litle French, and peraduenture haue none other Englishe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation vvherein they excel theyr poore countrymen, nor wherby to clymbe one step to that height they loke at: yea what if they cold speak french naturally: think they for a little french in theyre tongues ende, to be so much set by? alas poore men, how vainely they gape at french promises, with losse of theyr Englishe possessions: If they should haue theyr desire, it vvold not be long before theyr tongues would make theyr harts ake. It might be honiemoone awhile with them but aftervvard french would be no deinty dish, and these seely interpreters vvere happye if they might quietly stand without the dore. vvhatsoeuer therfore their estate is now, it can not be so ill, as that must needes be vnder them. they shall know hovv sweete the onely freedome in a mans naturall common wealth is, by experience of that irksome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to serue so waivvard a master as is he that by slight or force conquers. vvho though he wyll loue well the dominion so gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
<pb facs="tcp:18498:29"/>
yet wil he neuer trust but esteeme vvith a vile estimation, al those that helped him to it, and scarce deeme them vvorthye to lyue in that land which they haue deliuered hym.</p>
            <p>But the graund reason and mother argument of these perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is the gaynefull honorable and strong alliance which muste <note place="margin">Alliance with fraunce what it is</note> of necessity come by matching vvith the house of France: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hangs an other dwainling daughter reason, that great partye, forsooth, that Monsieur can make vs in that kingdome. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyther of whych reasons though I suppose they can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for maintenance of theyr conceipt, but that is alreadye in theyr seuerall places eyther expresly remoued, or more then by the way ansvvered: yet for theyr pleasures who think themselues neuer answered onles theyr reason haue an expresse reproofe, I vvill be bould with the reader and a little passe order to obiect it against me selfe agayne and handle it a part. First I demaunde of these aduenturous commonwealminglers vvhether they vveene thys strength and honor to be had in the lyfe of this king? and if so, then vvhither by hys ayde and friendly alliance? if they say yea, yt is contrary to that they say in an other odd reason of brideling the king, who surely will neuer strengthen that vvhich must curbe him, and it is proued also that if he and his brother ioyne in any thyng, they vvyll doe it smally for englands good.</p>
            <p>If they thynke thys great match of honorable strength in the present kings lyfe, to be by reason of the great party onely that Monsieur can make in Fraunce without the king: they are vvyde <note place="margin">The sely great party of Monsieur</note> and litle think of tvvo other houses, which according to the two chiefe factions in Fraunce, haue most deuoute fauourers and ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dicted follovvers, as men bene respectiuely mynded towardes them and theyr professions. vvherof, the one house can haue more exequutioners of any hys cruell determination to offer vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, and the other more faythfull ayders and companions of lyfe and death in defence of theyr consciences liues and goods, then euer Monsieur could bring into the field vvhen he ioyned hymselfe with the Malcontents eyther in Fraunce or the lovve conntryes: or then euer he coulde haue either to rescue hym out
<pb facs="tcp:18498:29"/>
of hys feyned restraint, or to fall to hym for hys gard, when he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ruun in some feare from the Court. Yea, of these two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialities in Fraunce, as vve haue no neede of hys helpe for vvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs the one part, who be already, in the feare of God &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian loue, so vnited to vs, and in all leeful thinges so affectionate to the Queenes maiesty, as, there homeloyalty saued, they vvysh her al prosperytie and long life to the glory of God and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the truth: So is not Monsieur in such credit vvith the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he can gain vs ther harts. For albeit, that be his best side indeed, yet is he of so smal reckoning among the papists, that <note place="margin">Monsieurs companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</note> vnles the king will, he shall not haue one great on so much as hys companion or counsaylor. For looke into the gouernment of hys pryuate affayres: and though he be a great prince the kinges <note place="margin">Counsailors Seruants.</note> brother, yet hath he not one man of mark or of great credit that followes hym: but a crew of vnruly youthes. Yea when he takes any publike enterpryse in hand, as that of Flaunders, whych stode hym so much vpon in honor, and whych vvas vvyth secrete intel <note place="margin">Enterprises</note> ligence betvveen the king and hym, and by collusion: yet because the king could not, for bewraying that counsail, declare his vvyll ouertly and lyking to that voyage, not one Lorde of name acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed him. And let vs beleue our eyes in this his woeng of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <note place="margin">VVoeng messenger.</note> No doubt very good manners which he can not but knovv required as vvell in regard of hyr Maiestie as of hys own highnes, some proportion to haue ben kept in the quality of his messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sent to her Maiestie. It is therfore vvant of hauing at his deuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion such as had ben meet for such an Ambassage. Els had vve had an other manner of man, and not thys, I wot not vvhat, who hath no credit in Fraunce but as a minion of Monsieurs &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer place he presently hath, it is much increased euen since he came hether to vs and by the credit hereof. In so much as I think scorne in hyr Maiesties behalfe, and the whole land takes it as an old french frump, that no worthyer or nobler person is emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in so worthy and noble a message to our Queen.</p>
            <p>But letting goe the poore party of Monsieur to be hoped for in Fraunce, we wyll in sinuate the small valew therof, by shewing
<pb facs="tcp:18498:30"/>
in a word or two, hovv little worth the accepting in alliance, the house of Fraunce is: eyther in thys present king as our brother, or in Monsieur, though he were reigning french king and (which the Lord forbid) out husband. It is alteady proued that Fraunce is our auncient foe and that theyr very frendships haue proued enemityes to vs. Here then we seeke to make a nevv frend of an <note place="margin">Fraunce, an old foe. A new frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> old enemy. such an one as vve may not trust, as well for the non tryall of hys loue, as for the often tryal of hys hatred. I remember that Hector and Achilles are supposed to haue found the verye gifts of enemies to be deadly dangerous, yea such gyfts as vvhen they had them, made for theyr defence: vvhereupon the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had in prouerbe that, enemies gyfts were no gyfts. And if there be such a malicious influence of an enemy into his gyftes, that they seeme as it were, poysoned, and can not be saufely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of hys hand, especially by a prince: Hovv can we without desperate daunger receiue into our bosom the old enemy hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe? certainly, we may take vp thys prouerb, &amp; the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is as authentike as that other of the Grecians, by a much more stronge reason: that is, that an old enemy friend, is no friend. vvhich prouerb, though in christian reformed men it may nowe and then be falsified. yet do I not see, but in men vnregenerate by the gospell, it remaynes true: and to beleue it false, is perilous to prince or priuate person in choyse of friend or allie.</p>
            <p>But if these perswaders vvyll needes haue thys paynted man to be a man, and thys no frend to be a friend: yet is he of necessity a <note place="margin">A da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous friend.</note> most daungerous friend, by reason of hys largely spred dominion vvhich makes hym esteeme himselfe as the iron pot, and vs as the earthen crock, vvith whom vvhen he floteth on the sea, he weens he can dash vs into shards at hys pleasure, according to that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of Alciat. And though by the might of the hygh potter of mankind, &amp; framer of kingdoms, he hath found our sides as hard as yron, and vve haue found hym as brickel in our hands as clay: yet the pryde he conceiueth in his owne might, vvil make thys dreadles enemy, an intollerable and an insolent friend to vs, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he may find vs as seruiceable as he found his old friend Scot
<pb facs="tcp:18498:30"/>
land. vvherein his old rancour styll lurkes and vvyll prouoke him to take any occasion. Thus vnder trust on our side, shal be shrovv ded treason on theyr part: vvhich could neuer haue hys effect, yf vve vvere styll enemies standing on our own gard and in nothing trusting them.</p>
            <p>Again, a most vnsure and slippery frend he is. for they that seke vtilem amicitiam, as he now doth, vvil also sodenly break friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, inhonestae vtilitatis causa. vvherein he hath the start of vs be <note place="margin">An vnsure friend.</note> fore vve ioyne, vvhile vve standing on our honor and Christian conscience, as it vvere, at the listes, shall giue none offence but vvith much adoe take any giuen, pretermitting the best occasion of resisting in time the beginnings: he, that hath made ship vvrack of honor and conscience, shal make hys profit of our conscience, and lye in vvait to fall out for aduantage, and to break thorough euen vvhatsoeuer surest band of alliance.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, a needlesse friendship is it vvhich vve seeke. For hetherto vvithout theyr helpe and in despight of their beard vve continually haue holden our ovvn, and many times preuailed vp <note place="margin">A needlesse friend.</note> on theyrr hauing thereforh tryed theyr mallice of 500. yeeres to be contemptible, let vs not vvithout any need in the vvorlde ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept theyr friendship novv vvhen it is most doubtfull: least the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of loue compasse that which hatred could neuer come neere. Lastly, as in common alliances, it is no credit to entertain a reiec <note place="margin">A dishono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> ted friendship: so is thys french alliance dishonorable to vs, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect it is the refuse of Scotland, vvho being vveary of their pride and vntruth, haue cast them off novv a good whyle since and all ther old neere felovvship, vvith resolute purpose so to continue because they find much more profit and safetie in these more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged termes of neighbourhode vvherein they stand present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then in theyr false &amp; insolent former friendship. And to speak truth, the honest late dealings of French are such, and they so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noumed for an hatefull seede of an hatefull house, as, I suppose, they are not like to find friendship els vvhere vvith any Christian prince of Maiestie, especially to ioyne vvith them in this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of mariage. vvhich made theyr present king Henry the thyrd
<pb facs="tcp:18498:31"/>
as haughty as he is, to stoupe to a mean mans daughter a vassal of his own And what if it vvere possible to make some thing of this no friend? to hold thys vvett Eele by the tayle, as they say, and to haue his friendship fast, and that the same vvould be in any thing needfull, profitable vvithout perill and not dishonorable, which <note place="margin">A dammage able friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

For first this new found french friend of fraunce, vvilpresently cost vs our old friend of Burgondy: vvhich faythfull societie, yf our vallant politîque auncesters preferred be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore that vntrusty alliance vvith Fraunce, enen then vvhen it was not yet maryed to Austrich, nor crovvned vvith Spayn: vvhen it vvas not yet enlarged vvith hir Italian dominions and midsea Iles, nor enriched vvith her golden Indians: &amp; if also then it were more profitable to vs then Frannce: hovv shall Fraunce be novv to be preferred before it, or proue more profitable to vs novv then that? And it is not onely for peace and vvarr, that Burgondy hath ben entertayned before Fraunce but euen to this day, the merchaunts vvyll tell you that the onely lovv countryes here at hand of that dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are more worth to vs for venting the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusage and aboundance of our country commodities, and for the transporting hither of the most necessary merchandise of for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reign parts, then is all Fraunce.

            <p>It followeth then necessarily vpon that vvhich hath ben sayd, that we who already beare the floure delice quartarly, receiue no honor by ioyning with it Par pale.

            <p>Those therefore that persvvade this band of strange alliance, must needs be such Englishmen as find themselues not aduanced in thys state according to that desert vvhich they conceiue in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues and therefore disdeyn at others good estate: or els such, as are past hope heare and hauing nothing, knovve they can loose nothing what change or tombling soeuer come. but these be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate dangerous Englishmen, vvho for the satisfieng of theyr disdainful or hongry humor care not to let the common vveale blood euen in her Basilica vaine, vvho hauing now liued, by Gods grace, and through the great loue of hir subiects tovvards hir, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeeres in a miraculous peace: and ben a beholder and iudge of other lands troubles: should now by thys mariage throw, as it vvere, into the sea, not her ring vvith Policrates, but hir precious selfe: and putting hir prosperitye to the plunge: send it to flote or sinck, by dravving into England a great spark of that family which hath ben a fyre brand in Europe. VVe can not hold this fire in our bosome, and not be burned therevvith. Novv that vvhich is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the vvhole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale must be noysome to euery part.</p>
            <p>To begin wtih the chiefe thereof, hir Maiestie, in vvhom as two persons or bodies (as they say) do presently fal in consideration, the one her naturall body, such as other priuate ons haue, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, her body politique or common vveale body vvhich is her body of Maiestie, incorporate in vnderstanding of the lavves: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so seuerall discommodities and hurts are here to fal in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also, in respect of these hir tvvo bodyes. which all beit they be of that nature as nothing can be harmefull to one, but the
<pb facs="tcp:18498:33"/>
same is ful of harme to both: yet haue I in speaking of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth handled also her maiesties ciuill body: as that vvhich can no more be remoued from the common vveale then the heade from the body: and as that which hath mutuall suffering vvith the common vveale in weale and vvoe, as hath the head vvith the body.</p>
            <p>And for her very selfe or selfe self, as I may say, which is hir na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body, though it godly pleaseth hir, according to the lavves <note place="margin">The Queen in hir natural and priuate consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </note> of all vvell ordered realmes, and maner of all good princes, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide thaduise and consent of all her estates, not to conclude hyr mariage before she parle in parliament vvith hyr subiects, before she consult vvith the lawes and call the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vveale as it were to common counsail, so as she on the one side may chaleng of it an assured maintenance of her doing vvith body and goods, as a thing vvhich had their generall consent, and the vvhole land, on the other side, may say, I haue chosen such a Lord as I dare put in trust with my Queene, for so much as it also is to be maried with her, and in sort to be gouerned by him that shal be her gouernor: yet is she for her part to haue her particular lyking and harts con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentation in this match, in respect of that life she must lead vvith a husband, so as shee may say vvithin her selfe, I am gladly satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed in this choyse. els should she be in vvorse poynt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worst of hyr wardes, of vvhom she doth not so absolutely claym the mariage by any tenur, but that yet her te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der may be their choise. Let vs then see vvhither this prince be a conuenable mariage in regard of her priuate person, vvho is already proued most vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and extremely daungerous for hyr princely personage.</p>
            <p>Here comes first to our remembraunce, her constant dislike &amp; indisposed minde tovvarde mariage fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flovver of her youth <note place="margin">Dislike to mariage in generall.</note> vvhich in al that loue her, bredes feare of a disconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted lyfe, if at these yeeres she take not her best heede and faythfullest aduice in hyr mariage. Thys first difficulty on the part of hyr Maiestie, offers a second as great a difficulty on the part of his excellency, <note place="margin">Monsieur no Paragon.</note> that is that he shold hardly be the man that choise man of choyse in all respects to content both eye and mynd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18498:34"/>
And if anye that persvvades this mariage think to haue quite himselfe substantially out of these tvvo difficulties onely by a bare obiecting of them vvith referring ouer to bee aunsvvered by her maiestie, as in vvhose hart rests the best knovvledge of hyr disposition to mariage, and contentation to this man: such one must be told, that he doth not his bounden endeuour, especially if hys place giue any leaue to debate at large vvith her. In thys poynt, belike, he is to learn of euery parent or other vvhatsoeuer that hath a louing care of theyr daughter or deere friend. vvho vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on a mariage moued vvill not set them dovvn and rest in saying, you knovv vvhither it be fit for you to mary, and you knovve vvhither his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be fit for you &amp; to your lyking: but cannot con tent themselues, onlesse they presse to helpe hir vvith theyr best aduise laying about to search and enquire, vvhether he be such as they vvish. and if they find him othervvise, they lay the matter forth in tyme and franckly tell it her, least thorough their silence or negligence, she fall in daunger of an ill husband, the greatest crosse that may be layd on a poore vvomans shoulders. The same should be much more diligently don in mariage of a Queen and her realme and it is a faythles careles part, to leaue hir helples in hir choise of the person and personall conditions of hir husband to hir ovvn onely consideration. vvhich hovv so euer sufficient it be, so much the more hath she need of help, as the matter is more vveightie in hir then in common matches. I merueile therfore they could not see, that as that meate brookes not vvell vvhich is crammed in against the stomak: and as nothing is sayd to be don egregie vvhich is vndertaken inuita Minerua: so surely in thys mariage the successe of ioy and contentation can not be promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if ther be eyther a generall vntowardnes to desire that state of lyfe, or none harty affection tovvardes that person which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth.</p>
            <p>And for the presence or shewe of this mans person, although I vvot vvell, that as for most part the svveet and amiable or croked <note place="margin">His person.</note> conditions of mind ben (as I may say) vvritten in the lines of a louely or ill shape of body or face: so contrarivvise that sometime
<pb facs="tcp:18498:34"/>
a vertuous mind is meanely lodged and dwels in a homely cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: yet doe I not gladly medle with thys particular, but vvil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so referr it to hir Maiesties enteruieue, if it must needes come to that poynt, Onely this I humbly besech hir, that she wyll vievv it and suruieu it, and in vieuing she vvil fetch hir hart. vp to hir eyes and cary hir eyes down to hir hart. And I besech God graunt hir at that time to haue hir eyes in hir heade euen in that sence in vvhich Salomon placeth a wise mans eyes in his head: and then I doubt not but vpon conference of hir wyse hart and hir eyes togither, he shal haue his dispaching aunswer. But of many circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of hys body I cannot hold my peace because I hope be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vvell conceiued and digested vvith other thinges that are and may be sayd herein they vvyll let this enteruieu.</p>
            <p>I may not nor meane not to deny his great place that righte vvhich is due to all men: that is to recken reports and bruits as re <note place="margin">His ill spent youth hither to.</note> ports and bruites. And though they speake in all laguages, of a merueilous licentious &amp; dissolute youth, passed by this brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode: and of as strange incredible partes of intemperancie play ed by them, as those worst of Heliogabalus: yet will I not rest vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on coniecturalls. Onely this I touch lightly and cannot passe vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly in so high a matter as is the mariage of my Queen, that it is vvorth thinquiry after. For if but the fourth part of that misrule bruted should be true, it must needes dravv such punishment fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, vvho for most part punisheth these vile sins of the body, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the very body and bones of the offenders, besides other plagues to thyrd and fourth generation: as I vvould my poore lyfe might redeeme the ioyning of Queene ELIZABETH to such one in that neer knot vvhich must needes make hir halfe in the punishments of those his sinnes. Hir Maiesties father had a law passed by parliament in his tyme, that whoso had vnlawfully knovven that vvoman with vvhom the king was to mary, and did not before mariage come in and bevvray it, shold vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aftervvard detected, be holden litle better then a traytor. Hys care to haue a good woman vvas Christian and royall: he vvyst vvell, as the preambles of those statutes purport, beside the pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb facs="tcp:18498:35"/>
contentation to him selfe that as vvel the sinnes of father &amp; mother as the plague of theyr sins descends to the children: and considering hys chyldren were to be left gouernours of the land, which mightso also haue part in these punishments, his care vvas so much more to be approued because it vvas also for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vveale. The same reason is to moue in vs all a harty desire thas hir Maiesty should mary vvith such a house and such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as had not prouoked the great vengeance of the Lord. And surely considering the haynousnes of the sin in euery person, with the concurrant circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stances in this case of a prince, the law was a iust law. vve can haue no such law against strangers: therfore, in hir Maiesties name I require at the hands of al English Ambassadors &amp; other trauayling Englishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abrod, &amp; of all vvise men at home, that they vvilbe hir diligent espialls herein: geuing faithful aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisement, not of such seldome or small fautes as men corruptly call tryckes and pranks of a young gentilman, but vvhither hys lyfe hath ben so monstrously wicked as is reported. for it is no small matter for a Queene the head of the lande to ioyne in any maner with that person ouer vvhom the ineuitable plages of the most true Lord do hang. This is to approch to the plague when it commeth, and not, as Salomons wise man doth, to withdrawe hymselfe when he seeth it.</p>
            <p>His youth of yeeres is an apparant inequalitie of this match, &amp; a secret discouery of his mynd not singlie affected vvith true and <note place="margin">His youth presently.</note> simple loue to that he should chiefely seeke. for emong vs of the meaner sort, not one in a thousand of those younger men that seke ther elder matches, but doth it in side respects. and hovv can vve thinke other wise in a young prince, heire apparant of france. It is quite contrary to his young appeties which vvyll otherwise haue theyr desire. It is therefore eyther for want of liuing and mayntenance to hys mynd, and then is he not fit for this realme: or els is it certenly for some other notable practise vvhich muste needes be dangerous, because so great a man must be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and because it is not disclosed.</p>
            <p>He is differing from hir Maiestie in religion: thagreement wher <note place="margin">His religion.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:18498:35"/>
in as it worketh by Gods blessing, a most neer knot of good vvill and perfect liking in all things euen emong straungers: so, by the vvords of Christ, a disagrement in this kind brings the svvord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvene father and children, brethern and sisters, betvvene a man and hys vvife. Yea vve haue seene in our dayes, parentes and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands being papistes, thorough the vnnaturall cruelty of that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian heresie, vpon the least occasion and vvithall gredinesse to haue deliuered vp to death their children &amp; vvife. And if al bands be little enough to hold loue and to worke a comfortable lyfe here in earth against the many miseryes of this noysome pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: let vs not dispise that vvhich is the chiefest and strongest.</p>
            <p>And which I may not forget who so marieth with any pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvorshipper can not tell vvhen to be sure of him. for they haue <note place="margin">Pope playes fast &amp; loose. in mariages.</note> one knife to vnloose all alliances vvith kingdoms and fayth giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to princes, that is the popes dispensation, vvhich is so iust in it self as vvhither it bynd or loose it may not be examined. if therefore after our mariage (vvhich God first let) the changeable decree of a pope vvill pronounce the mariage no mariage, eyther vpon some nevv aduantage to the church of Rome, either els because Monsieur could haue no children by our Queen, &amp; for that there must of necessity sit vpon that throne some of the blessed seed of Medices, vvhich vvas sent into Fraunce from a pope: no doubt this son of the pope in Fraunce is as much bound by popish obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to leaue against Gods lavv his vvife, as his son of Spayne vvas to take against Gods forbodd his own sisters dau<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ter. And as much conscience vvill the holy father make to breake a lavv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mariage for his aduauntage, as to licence a lavvles. vvhat a feare of dishonor vvorse then the dishonor, vvere this, to depend vpon the incertain pope vvhither vve shall at any time hereafter be decreed to haue liued in vnlavvfull mariage yea or no. If any man anusvver hereto that this doubte is too farre fetched and hath no reason to be conceiued: let him at once take this replye for maintenance of thys and diuers other like reasons that are &amp; may be made. That vvhosoeuer is carefull of the life and honour of a prince, casts more doubts then for a common person. In
<pb facs="tcp:18498:36"/>
theyr palaces they must haue more gards for night and day, more porters more hus shirs and more doers to come to them euen in time of peace, then common persons haue. But vvhen the enemy of a prince comes to be considered of, then princes will vse theyr longest hands of strength, theyr tendred nosed cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sailors &amp; most percing sight of theyr vvise and faythfull seruants. and who wold not suspecte any trechery from that Roman ennemy of enemyes vvhich like a iugling Aegiptian playes fast and loose with all the vvorld and is singularly a deuowed enemy to our Queene as he vvas lately to hir Maiesties father, because he refused and reiected one of his like godlesse dispensations for a lyke lawles mariage.</p>
            <p>An other reason might be made a gainst thys mariage, that, if <note place="margin">His absence by being chosen K. dls where.</note> thorough his ambitious mind, not so blamevvorthy in such a prince as hurtfull to such as should chuse him, during the life of his brother he should be chosen king elsvvhere: it might cause his absence litle to hir maiesties comfort. But this reason I bring not for the force of it or for vvant of other. for I suppose the late ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable leauing of Poleland vvilbe a lesson to any kingdome or state of free election how they shall chuse this brother. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Qu. Maries counsailors had that respect to hir high honor that they did not mary hir to K. Phillip till he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was a king in the lyfe of his father: so likewise these men vvould not talke of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur, til he were hir maiesties peere by being chosen king by the franke election of any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> state: I vvould not feare thys matter. The onely cause therefore vvhy I thought this reason worth any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by that occasion to shew the strange aunswer that is made thereunto by these persvvaders, who in theyr common discourse and talke for this mariage, obiecting a gainst themselues this dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger of his absence, doe yet agayn bring in K. Phillip, as theyr ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that Monsieur need not be long absent from his wife, no more then vvas K. Phillip. First, all that they can say herein, is, that he neede not belong absent. Then can vve say that thys K. Phillip was so long away that his absence pinched Qu. Maries hart, and killed hir with vnkindnes. But in deed I feare not this in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conuenient for his being chosen king any vvhere.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:18498:36"/>
One head reason yet remaines which perhaps you think long for and me thinks I haue sayd nothing in this last part till I haue vsed it. That is the danger to her maiesties person many wayes, namely and aboue the rest, lest this should be but a frandulent se <note place="margin">A capitall perill iustly suspected.</note> king of hir by him, the more easely to possesse an other afterward Of which meaning, there is such apparant presumption, and the great peril ensuing hath such euidence of being ineuitable: as we may not rest in the credulous security of these smoth dangerous words: that, in good sooth, it is not so to be thought of by a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prince, but to be reiected as a senceles conceipt, once to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that he wold seeke to any other so far inferior to our Queen in Godlines, vertue, vvisedom, beauty, and vvhose peere in many respects is not to he found. This is but Reinards flattering of our kingly byrd and vvell natured Chanticlere in his goodly svveete voyce and fayre fethers.</p>
            <p>VVhen noble men and princes in Fraunce, stoode on theyr ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor for all theyr actions, and vvould say nothing but true: they vvere vvorthely beleeued in the honorable vvord of a noble ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Yea we are derely taught, not to heleeue them in theyr oth. And this rule that they presse vs vvith, of not suspecting lightly, holds more streightly emong priuate men in their priuate matters, then for maiestrates and counsailors vvho in their char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for church and common weale, cannot lightly be to chary or suspitious. And that vve may not here seeme to forge our selues a doubt, but that wee suspect such a thing as is very lyke to be meant by them: and the very lyke vvhereof hath ben committed by them heretofore: let vs speake of this forrein prince sauing his grace that vvhich othervvise vve could forbeare euen of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a prince vvere it not that it makes necessarily to the helth and vveale of our naturall princ.</p>
            <p>VVhat then is this Christian prince thus set before vs whose
<pb facs="tcp:18498:37"/>
credit must be so sacred as no charity must suspect it? he is the bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther of the most Christian king, so called. many foule men haue <note place="margin">The credit that the french king lends his brother.</note> fayre names All the popes canonized dead saints are not saintes: no more are all hys lyuing treschrestiens, of the best sort of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. This most christie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> family of kings, is that vvhich euer made more deinty to fall out vvith the great Turke, then vvith other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen popish Christians: and hath held peace with the Turke when others haue ben in vvars: vvith out regard of that secrete society, vvhich is, without speaking, contracted betwene men of one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion against a common enemy: and vvhich, as a former fayth, is implicatiuely excepted in any truce vvith an infidel. Yea which former fayth ought to be kept, though vvith breach of expresse words of any subsequent league: and therfore more then treschres tienne heede to be taken in such leagues. This is that most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stien Prince, vvhose brother not long since, accepted a kingdom vvith promise and oth to maintaine therein thopen exercise of Turcisme, arrianisme, iewisme, papisme, anabaptisme, and such monstruous professions besides the truth of Christes gospel. this is that most Christien prince, vvhose most christien brother, hath sworn to the tolleration of our religion in his owne kingdome: vvhich yet he seekes to destroye by slieghte or force vvith out choyse. This is that most christien court, vvhere Macciauel is theyr nevv Testament, and Atheisme is theyr religion. yea whose vvhole pollicie and gouernment, seemes te set the Turkish tiran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as a patarne, and they dravve as neer to it as theyre auncient lavves vvill any vvayes suffer in so small time. To conclude, thys is that treschrestien thron, vvhich to the shame of all kinges (so much as in them lay) by the disceite of an oth, in person of a king vvith some hypocrisie in religyon, by the bayt of a mariage, by hope of assurance in forreine leagues, by the base abusing of hys ovvn mouth to speake fayre, and personall visiting him in hys sicknes vvhose lyfe he sought, stained themselues vvith the blood of a number of theyr subiects vvhich resting vpon theyr kynges fayth, came vpon confidence vnder the lee, as it vvere, of rheyr protection. Insomuch as they are novv bankrupt of all credite
<pb facs="tcp:18498:37"/>
vvith theyr ovvn subiects, and vvith theyr own brother in lavve, husband to theyr sisters. so as vpon no royal oth they vvil come in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but stand on theyr gard, and keepe tovvnes for theyr defence, Neither vvould the king of Nauarr trust theyr sister so far, as to <note place="margin">His sister not trusted by hir husb.</note> receiue hir for his vvyfe: til her mother rydyng rounde aboute Fraunce caryed her to him, and together with her daughter put him in quiet possession of more tovvnes for hys fvrther defence. And yet vve may not suspect this Christian prince a brother of the same brother and sister. and if vve do suspect him in behalfe of our Queenes sauftie, we are streightvvayes sencelesse and suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without ground of our conceites: and vvho so forsoth, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth these doubtes, vvill deuise anye thinge that may hinder this mariage. This dare I boldly say that he who casts not these doubtes, is not vvisely suspitious. and he that passeth them ouer being once put in doubt, may passe ouer any thing that makes for hir maiestes good estate. And a most strange dreame it is of theirs vvho will haue thys match a bridle to the french king, a snaffle to Spayn, and a stopgamble to all practises of competition for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, or any other trayterous attempt at home or abroad. vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, all the contrary, it layes the raynes at randon on the necke of thys horse of hidden treason, and sets a rider of choyse vpon him for the nonce: yea and opens all the portes to forraine enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>For to come neere the person of thys our french prince: could all his countenances of being restrayned vppon his brothers first <note place="margin">Monsieur &amp; his owne credit.</note> returne from Poleland: and fallinges out with him aftervvard, his ronning from his mother: his secrete vvithdravving from the Court: and the Queen mothers trotting betwene hir sonnes as a broker of reconcilation, win him so much credit emong the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in Fraunce: as they vvould trust him for a leader, and not hold him stil for a suspect? could hys goodly aydes offered to the states in the low countryes, vvith personall taking vpon him their defence, preuaile so farr: that he could come any farther vvithin them, then that they could by their own forces vvel auoyde hym? No no, the hurtfull helpe of thys shiuering reede hath appeared

by the euent in both countryes, and that it is no staffe of trust. <note place="margin">This mach no stopp to practises of competition or popery.</note> Most vnhappy therefore are they that may take heede by others, whose hands it hath hurt and vvill not. But let vs against our con science admit Monsieur to be in this matter simply seely or sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply bonest: yet is he set a work and ruled by his brother and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this sute follovved for him vvith the manifest goodwyll of hys mother the motherpractiser of France.

            <p>From no place more fitly then out of Fraunce can they fetche thys instrument of our vvoe. Fraunce is a neighbour, therefore conuenient by the place. It is a land ful of a vvell trayned soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, &amp; hath all ready great numbers mustered that abyde but theyr vvatch vvord. it is now at peace vvithall, and therefore at leasure: onles they vvyll make vvarrs to themselues. for cruelty they are approued, to execute any thing.

Yea, onlesse vve our selues close our owne eyes, vvee may see that it is a very french popish vvoeng, to sende hyther smooth tongued Simiers to glose and glauer &amp; hold talk of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and yet in the meane while, Iaques Fitzmaurice who hath bene in France and conuersant vvith Rosse, and euen novv came immediatly thence into Ireland to inuade our Queenes domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion there and assemble the trayterous papistes in nomine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini domini papae.

She hath already cost vs ynough of our Englishe blood, and she cares not though she make hauock of nobilitye &amp; people: she seekes hyr own turne by hooke or crooke.

            <p>Let other mens squaymish iudgements keepe them in vvhat temper of suspecting, it lykes them: I can not be so blockish but to thinke that it is more then lykely, he comes for thys Mary: to the end that vvhereas, yf there be any rebellious papists at home which can do nought for want of a leader, &amp; those fugitiue rebels abrode, can doe nothing onlesse there be first some hurliburly in the land: this man may be he, vvhere they shall firste make head, and so grovv into a body of rebellio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. which aftervvard they meane to ayde vvith theyr forrein forces, to the destruction of those foolish rebelles as vvell as of vs. And though, in truth, with out flattery, she be inferior to our Queene, in all the best gyftes yet may I vvell ynough thinke, that Monsieur vvyll stoope to hir as vvell as king Phillip theyr old example, vvhome yet againe they vse euen here, did stoop in Flaunders and other vvhere, most lowly in that respecte and beyonde all curtesie euen in Queene Maryes lyfe. yea I doe not see, vvhy I should not make these gyfts and excellencies of our Queene, so many arguments to proue great likelihood of impossibilitye to knit fast to hyr, the mind of Monsieur so contrarily qualified. For loue is a knitting of lyke myndes togyther first, &amp; then of bodyes by accident. And though foule bodyes be oft in loue vvith the outvvard beauty of others: yet vvas there neuer foule vicious and Irreligious mind in loue vvith a vertuous and religious soule. If any man yet againe thinks it an vnvvorthy suspition of so hygh a prince, let hym heare once agayne that one of that brotherhood dyd compasse as vnvvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a purpose: and all by laying to gage that vvorthines vvhych hys maiesty myght chalenge, and by hys personall action, vvhych he iudged no man vvould once suspect, in a mariage of hys sister as neere to him as this brother is to the novv king. <note place="margin">New french falshod nevv English wise<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome.</note>

that which theyr forefathers vvould neuer do, let honest English men suspect that which theyr auncesters could neeuer misdeeme Especially in those matters, wher popery comes betwene as the motif, and the french ben the instruments. For to do that Roman sinagogue seruice, the french, doe accompt as fayre vertues, all foule lyes, treasons, poysonings, massacres, and turning of realms vpside down. And for recompence of theyr braue nighte xploit at Paris, they were brought immediately, as it vvere, in a carte of tryumphe in at Rome gates: where the world is vvitnes of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyricall prayses and solemne orations pronounced in theyr perpetuall fame, with many ioyfull fyres in honor of that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, vnmanlike, and treasonable victory vpon the noble Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that slept in the oth of hys king. But though the hope of lyke commendation may make these men attempt the lyke fact: yet are these wicked praysings of the pope but a shadow of praysings and make as much to the true honor of the french, as theyr paper excommunication and burning by image at Rome, doe hurt the good Christian in body or soule.</p>

If it should be don by English forces one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, as it must be indeede, (for he hath none to command) oneles they saye that hys brother vvyll both man him and money hym, and then they forgette that vvhyche they sayde of being a bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to Fraunce. If, I saye, Englyshe money and Englyshmen must do thys enterpryse it may be much better achiued, now while we haue the lavv in our own hands, and may command: then when vve shall be couert baron, and haue put our sword into an other

hand. vve haue not so much neede of hym for a captayne, as he hath of our strength to serue hym. Neyther doe I thinke more truth in any of these theyr reasons, then that vve should serue to vvorke theyr vvill in those lovv countryes. and if any thing vvere gotten, that should vvholy goe to Fraunce: but our butin in Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land, should be euen as good in these vvars to be taken for france agaynst Spayn, as it vvas vnder Queene Mary, in the vvarres for Spayn agaynst Fraunce. at vvhat tyme the vvhole losse, euen a greeuous losse to any Englishman that shall looke from Douer castle ouer to the other side, fell on our part.</p>
            <p>But in deede if it please hyr maiestye to ayde those lovv coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes: as it vvyll be most for our honor in the enterpryse, and for our gayne in atchieuing, to doe it of our selues, vvhyle uve are at <note place="margin">The lovv countryes.</note> lybertye, and not vnder straunge restraint: so is it novve high time for the neede they haue, vvho by these delayes shal be soone past helpe. and so the king of Spayne haue hys vvyll. And, in truth, the best vvelcome force and of most profit to those countryes, must be the English vvithout french. for the popish party of Arthois and Henault, neuer loued the french, and novv dare not trust the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: <note place="margin">Artoyes and Henault.

            <p>And it is more absurd that Fraunce vvoulde consent to send hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther a brydle for himself. those that are of this mind, presuppose a <note place="margin">This match no bridle to Fraunce.</note> ielousie betweene the French king and Monsieur: vvhych vve must first graunt them. or els they fayle to proue thys in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynning. Now, albeit I thinke, that the best fayth can not be meant, but betvvene the best men: yet may we be assured that
<pb facs="tcp:18498:40"/>
hovve soeuer they stande betvvene themselues for Fraunce, they vvyll styll agree to anoy England and hold togither lyke brethren the change of that ayre for thys and hys comming ouer sea vvyll not change that mind: and styll shall he be hys brother and son of his mother: vvho seeing that both of them doe follow this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, no doubt they wyll prouide agaynst theyr ovvne brydeling. And it is lyke ynough, though Monsieur knowes a peice of theyr purpose: yet knowes he not the depth of thys mischieuous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise. For they doe not vse to impart more to him then falles to hys part to play. The king remembers, that he hymselfe when he vvas Monsieur, being made priuie to the the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> purposed horrible massacre, had like to haue marred al, by lauishing out a word here of to one of hys deerelyngs: had not Lignerolls mouth ben stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with papp and the hatchet as they say. Besides, that Monsieur vvas neuer admitted so farr in connsail as the present king nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed so stanche.</p>
            <p>And if a man may guesse sometime, what a thing is, by recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">This vvoing comes not of loue to our Queen.</note> vp vvhat it is not: we shall not find in the king, nor his bro ther, nor mother, any louing cause to bring this nevve loue in theyr mind.

It is farr from <note place="margin">King.</note> probabilitie, to thinke that the king sends him hither, because he vvould be rid of hym. as though he stoode in fearefull doubte of hys greatnes vvhyle he vvere in fraunce. It is sufficiently proued othervvhere, that he is not followed nor esteemed generally in Fraunce, by papist or protestant. And if there vvere any such ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie in the kings head, thys vvere no vvisedome by aduauncing his brother to so puissant a kingdom to make him more dread.</p>
            <p>And in Monsieur vvhat doe we find that may so earnestly send hym hither. he is here apparant to Fraunce: dangerous therefore <note place="margin">Monsieur.</note>

in respect of reasons otherwhere alledged, for hym to be absent: espetially the present king being so far gon and spent in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, as some of these perswaders vvill say, vvhen they wyll further thys match. And if he should come in with that honorable shew becomming hys greatnes, and as any other such man wyll come that woeth with good meaning, and feareth not any detectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of hydden trecheryes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hys voyage hyther would be mightely charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. a thing ill becomming hym, vvho is already drawen drye to the botom and extremely indetted vvith hys other coloured voy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>age into Flanders. And onelesse some notable practise pricked hym hyther, the very passage ouer the sea vvould appall this fresh water soldiar, hauing read that betvvene thys and Normandye there perished in one bottom, three kingly children. but vtterlye vvould he be discouraged by thaduenture of honour whych he makes in sayling hyther, vpon so slender likelihoode of speeding or rather vpon great reason of repulse: if his care of honor vvere not lesse then his greedines to accomplish hys other mischiefe. And if he should speede (which God forspeake) yet must he com to a people that loues hym not nor hys trayne: and vvhere neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the <note place="margin">England can not loue Monsieur.</note> lesse he must haue hys gardes and trayne prescribed and limit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted in regard of the state. And thys people if heretofore it hath bene so manly as to mayster thys generation of Capet in hys own or rather our home of Fraunce: me thinks thys Monsieur can come with small hope to finde good seruice at our handes, vvhose fingers wyll itch at hym in our home of England.

            <p>The assured and great euils that grovv here out to our head the Queene: make no lesse agaynst the vvell doing of the lesser limes of the land.

This is a slip of Hugh Capet, and the practise of theyr mother and them in their ovvn country at this present, is, to raze all auncient french houses and to reare vp new, bringing al, as neere as they can, A la Turkesque that all being there creatures may fall dovvn and vvorship them.
