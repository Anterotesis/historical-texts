         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<date>Octob. 16. Anno 1651.</date>
            </head>
            <p>AGain, the Word of the Lord came unto me, when I was
awake, being ſad, about the Epiſtle, 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> But the Lord
anſwering, ſaid, That men do not underſtand how delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him it is, to deſtroy the Wicked from the Earth, and
to lay waſte and overthrow Kingdoms and Cities filled with the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars
of impieties: and on the contrary, to defend his own, and free
them from Oppreſſors, although he alſo ſuffers ſome of theſe to be
overwhelmed by the ſame, and through thoſe occaſions doth bring
them into Heaven to himſelf. But that men will not conſider, that
all things are brought to paſs by his only diſpoſure and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all events; bidding me be of good chear, and not be moved
at the raſh judgments of men; that his Favour did remain towards
me and others, as his Sons and Brethren: for ſo he, while living on
the Earth, called his Friends, who loved him, that he accounted
them for the Treaſure of his heart, unto whom he is wont to reveal
his Secrets, not to the World: that even he himſelf being delighted
in them, and they being delighted in him, may enjoy pleaſure, the
manner of which thing, and how he dealeth with me, that none
did underſtand beſide he and me.—both temporal and
eternal; for he did not reveal his hidden Treaſures promiſcuouſly to
all, but to thoſe for whom they are meet, and to whom he pleaſeth
to reveal them: for the which I having given thanks unto the Lord
Jeſus, requeſted to fall aſleep; And the Lord ſaid, <hi>Sleep thou my
Beloved, I will ſhew thee ſingular things.</hi> I ſlept ſoundly therefore in
a moment, and I ſaw my ſelf by a narrow winding paſſage, being
exceeding ſtrait, yet very ſmooth; I entred it with labour, going up
and down, until I came unto a company of men of both ſexes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cloathed in plain rayment, talking together in ſilence, and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
together with delight, ſome of whom notwithſtanding were, as
it were, fearful, and as they ſeemed to me, much trembling: But as
ſoon as I awaked, the Lord ſaid; <hi>Lo, theſe are they whom I have choſen
out of the world, being unſeen, without deceit, alſo taking pleaſure in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60176:3"/>
them in the time of ſtorms, in the midſt of whom I walking, do protect them,
having a care of them here on Earth; and the Angels my Servants do
miniſter unto them, of which adminiſtring Spirits, what Troops there are,
I will ſhew unto thee at another time, only do thou truſt in me.</hi> I praiſed
God therefore, with the 103<hi>d Pſalm;</hi> and having ended my prayer,
I wrought theſe things. <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>

            <p>Early in the morning after my prayers were ended, I ſlept again,
and lo a young-man of a beautiful ſhape, and having comely hair,
bearing Enſigns or Trophies in his hand; the which being beheld,
I wondred what it ſhould be. And preſently in that Buckler I ſaw a
Lion, with his two feet raiſed upright, and over againſt us a Vail
ſpread, being very beautifully painted. The which when I beheld
what it would betoken, I obſerved that I was not aſleep: and I ſaw
there a very pleaſant Field, through which divers Nations did go
with Horſes, with great familiarity among themſelves. Which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
as ſoon as it vaniſhed, I betaking my ſelf to prayer, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
what thoſe things might ſignifie, I fell into ſleep, but I ſoon
again awaked: And the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>Thou haſt ſeen the Lion of
the Tribe of</hi> Judah, <hi>the Root of</hi> David, <hi>whoſe Strength and Arm ſhall
be revealed to the Nations of the Earth, which thou haſt ſeen from all the
corners of the world, after that I ſhall have deſtroyed the multitude of thoſe
that dwell on the Earth, that will not acknowledge my Name. For I the
Governour of the Earth, will perform my New Work, in renewing my Laws
throughout the Nations, that</hi> Sion <hi>may triumph, and</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>may be</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60176:4"/>
               <hi>rebuilt: where my Sons ſhall ſerve me without Idols and Idolaters, the
which I will beget in the room of thoſe, who do now blaspheme me and my
Name, committing Abomination with the Whore, thoſe Kings of the Earth
who have begotten Heatheniſh Abominations upon the Earth. For the
Waters of the Flood that toſs the Ark ſhall depart, in which I will keep you
my beloved Ones, being a ſmall number, until a day of Peace, unto which
there hath not been the like ſince the beginning of things: For my Sons ſhall
come from far, the which I will beget unto my ſelf upon the face of the
Earth, the which ye ſhall admire at, whence theſe ſhould come, they being
Children begotten by a Man without a Woman, being nurſed up without a
Mother. Do thou my Servant ſeal what my mouth hath ſpoken to thee
to day. But do ye who wait for me, watch and pray, truſting on me your
Creator, being ſingle and ſincere one towards another. I will preſerve you,
but I will overthrow thoſe, both mine and your enemies, with the Flood.

of Me and my Name, who bring reproach on me and my Name. I will
therefore now at length, in theſe laſt dayes, have all Hereſies, worſhipping
of Idols, and all erroneous Worſhip to be rooted out, and that indeed firſt in

he who reſisteth the proud, but do distribnte my Gifts to the humble, and

(unacceptable to me) as</hi> Waldenſes, Huſſites, Lutherans, Calviniſts,
<hi>&amp;c. I therefore cry out, Be ye All even now at length, a little before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetting,
One in Me, with the Father and Holy-Spirit, all of you indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently,
with all who deſire Salvation. O I wiſh that ye ſons of men would
remember, how that I before my Death, prayed my Father and your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
my God and your God, for you; that all ye, whoſe Natures I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
a Body like unto you, ſin only excepted, might be One.</hi>

               <hi>Nicholas Drabicius,</hi> being a Miniſter of the Church in <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
which is called by the name of the <hi>Brotherly Unity,</hi> is commended for
ſingleneſs of mind, without any deceit, and for the love of Juſtice
and Zeal, enduring no Iniquity (but he either reproved it, or ſhewed
diſpleaſure againſt it.) Laſtly, being ready to ſuccour the neceſſities
of any neighbour whatſoever, almoſt beyond example, as is wont to
be ſaid of him by good men that are yet alive, in an extraordinary
manner; and it may be moſt truly ſaid of him, That he was ready
even to divide his heart with any one. The Church being afterwards
diſperſed through the perſecutions of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he ſaw
that he was not baniſhed far off, he betook himſelf to the imployment
of Cloathing, for which cauſe eſpecially the reſt of his Brethren
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60176:8"/>
ſuſpended him from the Office of the Miniſtry, as a Traytor or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate.
In this ſtate of Exile, and as it were of Excommunication,
firſt the Word of the Lord came unto him in the year 1638, and ſo
until 1664, he now being 77 years of age: he hath the place of
his abode in <hi>Moravia.</hi>

            <p>As concerning the queſtion, Whether or no theſe Prophecies, or
the like, ought to be publiſhed? Mark, The ſaid Prophecies will
prove either falſe or true: If falſe, then there will, when publiſhed,
come of it two notable profits: one is, that thereby Kings and
Princes will be the more ſure, and prove good; becauſe, if bad, falſe
Prophets would never ſtir againſt their Government. The ſecond
is, that the Subjects will henceforth beware of falſe Prophets, and ſo
keep to more firm obedience. But if the ſaid Prophecies ſhould prove
true, then there would, when ſuppreſſed, come of it two irrepairable
dammages: One is, that ſuch who kick againſt the pricks, will be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
at the Bar of the Lord Omnipotent, and be found guilty of
Suppreſſion of the Lord's Voice, when he roareth like a Lion, to warn
the Nations and Rulers thereof that they might not periſh unawares,
but ſave themſelves according to his direction. The ſecond is, that
they will be found guilty of High-Treaſon, both to the King, and the
Subjects or People, like one that knew they ſhould be murdered and
deſtroyed, and yet hid it. Therefore whatſoever thoſe Prophecies
might be, falſe or true, they ought not to be kept under a buſhel; but
let them be ſet forth as a Candle, that every one may take notice of
them, either to Salvation, or to beware of falſe Prophets: Or elſe,
ſome might be ready to think, that men ſuppreſſing the publication
thereof, were convinced of ſomething, and afraid in their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ſomething which they ſought to prevent the Lord's Judgment
upon: even as if humane craftineſs were able to prevail with the
Power of the Lord of Hoſts, and ſtop it: which is but a pittiful wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
to be laugh'd and mocked at by him that ſitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Lord and his Anointed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.</p>
