            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I thinke he meanes not of these fathers, who liued last be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, but transcending them he passes vp to his elder fathers <hi>Abraham, Isaack, Iacob.</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>I thinke so indeede: His Apologie cleares him sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both of heresie and noueltie, which his aduersaries would haue imputed to him.</p>

               <p>No <hi>(Sir)</hi> I will make known to you, that it is 1500 yeeres since this same Religion prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and professed now, was then preached and professed by our Ancient fathers.

               <p>So it was indeed: but in the first hundreth yeere we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Christianity, and eight hundreth yeere after Christ, we were infected with Papistrie, and now againe hath God called vs by the light of the gospel to our ancient Religion of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby wee worshippe the Father in his sonne according to his word, and no other way.</p>

                  <p>I read that a certaine Duke of <hi>Frisland</hi> named <hi>Raboldus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the yeare of our LORD nine hundreth, being perswaded (as hee pretended) to embrace Christianitie, as he went to bee baptized and had the one of his feet in the water, he demanded of the Bishops <hi>If all his Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were damned?</hi> the Bishops

answered more rashly then wisely, they were all damned: whereupon the Duke pulled backe his feete againe, saying, <hi>Then I will also bee damned with them.</hi> Thinke you this a good answere?</p>

                  <p>Truely the places are so plaine, that very children may vnderstand them, and I would God that these poore people, who of a blind mind dote after Masses, thinking by it to gette the pardon of their sinnes, had this benefite of Gods word, as you haue it, that so by the light of it they might come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>

                  <p>And I wish the same from my heart, But now to confirm you yet further, I pray you mark how blasphemous and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a thing their Masse is. First, is not this a mockerie of GOD
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13175:106"/>
the Father, To desire him to accept his owne Sonne: Is Christ out of the fauour of his Father? said he not; <hi>He is my Son in whom I am well pleased?</hi> shall a mortal &amp; miserable sinful Priest be a Mediatour, or Peacemaker betweene the Father and the Sonne, praying the Father that he would accept his Sonne, and send downe an Angell to take vp his bodie into Heauen?</p>

                  <p>Secondly, see you not how it inverts Gods ordinance? for where hee hath ordained a Sacrament, wherein God offers and giues his Sonne to vs; they haue changed it into a sacrifice, wherein they offer vp the Son to the Father.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Is it not an iniu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious thing to Christ, to say that any can offer him vp to God, but himselfe?</p>

                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Fourthly, Is it not a decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the people, to say that an vnbloudie Sacrifice (such as they say the Masse is) can bee propitiatorie to obtaine remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinnes?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>It is indeed, and expresly against the Word of God you haue alledged, <hi>Without shedding of bloud there is no remission:</hi> they grant themselues that in the

               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, since by this you see how they derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christs sacrifice, which is the first part of Christes priestly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, I will now let you see how they also cut away the other, namely, his intercession. Marke that place of the Apostle, <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator of God and Man, the Man Christ Iesus.</hi>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>R.</speaker>
                  <p>They haue a distinction for that, and say, there is but one <hi>Mediator of redemption,</hi> but for <hi>Intercession</hi> many.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>C.</speaker>
                  <p>But will you consider the place; and you shall see where the Apostle sayes, there is but one Mediator, he is speaking of

                  <p>Now if you apply that to our present question, the doubt is easily solued: So long as the World was blinded with idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and the Masse (which in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is but a Masse of Heresies) Sathan laie quiet, hee was not troubled in his Kingdome, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:13175:116"/>
hee raised no trouble in the World: but since the light of the Gospell discouered his darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that hee findes his Kingdome decaying, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe falling by the preaching of the Gospell, now he bestirres himselfe more busily, and doth what he can to disgrace this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gell by vile heresies of some that impugne it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane liues of others who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it.
