            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Narrative of the ſtrange Apparition which appeared over this City of <hi>London</hi>
in the yeare 1642. about the time that the late King <hi>Charles was forced away from his</hi>
Parliament by the rude multitude.</head>
            <p>IN the yeare 1642. in the <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> Holidayes, there appeared over this City of <hi>London,</hi> a Bow of
Smoake in the Firmament (in a cleere Star-light night no cloud ſeene) which had his motion over the
City about three houres before it diſpierſed it ſelfe. The riſing of it was about <hi>Aldgate</hi> or <hi>White Chappell,</hi>
and extended it ſelf as farre as St. <hi>Giles</hi> in the Fields to our appearance, and began his motion over the North
part of the City, moving in a perfit body (for about three houres) towards the South, till it came over the
<hi>Thames,</hi> and there, and then ſcattered and diſpierſt it ſelfe. The bredth of the bow was about an Ell to our
ſeeming: It was obſerved by divers Gentlemen in the <hi>Fleet</hi> which I ſpare not to name, Sir <hi>Iohn Digby,</hi> Mr.
<hi>Thorne</hi> of <hi>Bedford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Newcomin,</hi> 2. reverend Divines, Mr. <hi>James Howell,</hi> a knowing man, and they and divers
more of quality, gave their opinion, that this Apparition was not Naturall, but ſent by God to give warning to
this City, and that the Bow of ſmoake intimated Fire that ſhould conſume it, and that God ſent it of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to give warning. I doubt not but many hundreth in the City ſaw it, but ſlighted it, as being ſmoake a
common vapour that comes out of every Chimney, and appearing at that time of Night when few people
were abroad, twixt Eight and Eleven at night, there could bee little notice taken of it; but at the <hi>Fleet</hi> upon
notice given, moſt of the Gentlemen of the houſe went up into the Leads, where you might looke over all
the houſes as farre as <hi>Aldgate,</hi> and had a full view of the manner and motion of it, which ſtruck a great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
into many of them, whereof I was one, and did obſerve it from almoſt the beginning, till it came over the
<hi>Thames</hi> and diſpierſt it ſelfe. So much for the deſcription and manner of this apparition.</p>
