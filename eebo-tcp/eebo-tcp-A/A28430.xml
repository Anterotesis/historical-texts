            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>MEthinks I already behold some haughty Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, strutting and looking down from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as from the Devils Mountain upon the Universe, where amongst several other inferiour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he happens at last to cast his eye upon this Treatise; when after a quibble or two upon the Title, he falls foul upon the Book it self, damning it by the name of an <hi>Atheistical, Heretical Pamphlet:</hi> and to glorifie his own Zeal, under the pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Champion for Truth, summons Ignorance and Malice for his Seconds: But such a Person un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands not wherein the Nature of Atheism con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists, how conversant soever he may otherwise be in the Practice of it. It were Atheism to say, there is no God; and so it were (though less directly) to deny his Providence, or restrain it to some particulars, and exclude it in reference to others. Such are A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, who maintain such Opinions as these: and so are those Hereticks, who erre in Fundamentals, and continue obstinately in such errour's. But the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Vulgar people (whose Superstition is grounded upon the assimulating God with themselves) are apt to think that every one they Hate, are God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's Enemies; and that whosoever differs from them in Opinion, (though in never so trivial a matter) are Atheists, or Hereticks at least: Not rightly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> That in every Nation, he who feareth the Lord and worketh Righteousness, is accepted with him. And <hi>Minucius Felix</hi> says well
<pb facs="tcp:57640:4"/>
to the same purpose, He is the best Christian, who makes the honestest man. Heresie is an act of the Will, rather than Understanding; a Lye, rather than a Mistake: and thus St. <hi>Austin</hi> expresses it, saying, <hi>Errare possum, Haereticus esse nolo.</hi> Heresie and Schism, (says the ingenious Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>) as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly now used, are two Theological Scare-Crows, with which they who uphold a Party in Religion, used to fright away such as making an enquiry into it, are ready to relinquish and oppose it, if it appear either erroneous or suspicious. For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of a Painter, who having unskilfully painted a Cock, drave away all the Cocks and Hens he could find, that so the imperfection of his own Art might not appear, by comparing it with Nature: so Men for some ends, not willing to admit of any fancy but their own, endeavour to hinder all enquiries by way of Comparison, that so their own deformity may not appear. Therefore if any man blames me for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Christianity</hi> with <hi>Paganism,</hi> it shews nothing but his unworthy distrust of the sufficiency of that Religion he professes.</p>
            <p>There are two sorts of Iudges unto whom all Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are obnoxious, viz. the Ignorant, and the Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. As for the Ignorant, they are such men as I before was speaking of, than whose Approbation I dread nothing more: <hi>Simili simile gaudet,</hi> is a maxim that holds true as well in all other things, as Physick; and there is nothing would make me have so ill an opinion of my self, as to hear one of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me. But the other Iudge, viz. the man of
<pb facs="tcp:57640:4"/>
Learning and Iudgment, is the He I fear, and before him only will I arraign my self. <hi>Non-age</hi> is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Plea for the First-fruits of Young men, but that I disown; for he that thinks himself old enough to write a Book, can hardly excuse the folly that is in it, by calling himself Child: Nor have I ever seen a Piece that was written by one of 16 years of age, which was fitting for one of 17 to read; such Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings being commonly like Poems that were made by men when they were half drunk, unintelligible to any persons but such as are in the same condition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore waving all such frivolous excuses, I shall first disclose those things which are most liable to censure, and then clear my self as well as I am able.</p>
            <p>Perhaps there may be these three Exceptions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken against this Treatise, viz. my numerous Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Latine Sentences, my rambling from my Subject, and my uneloquent Stile.</p>
            <p>First then, as for my many Quotations, whether in <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>English,</hi> the Nature of the discourse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Were it a bare Moral Essay, wherein I made use of none but my own Fancy, there to come in with a <hi>dixit autem Dominus,</hi> or other such scraps of Latine, were to render my self ridiculous: But this being a discourse of other mens Opinions, they would be thought my own, though father'd upon the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Heathens, did I not cite my Authorities from the Authors themselves; so that I am enforced to play the Pedant even in my own defence. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, I have had some Enemies, who were so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous, as to cast that Reproach upon me when
<pb facs="tcp:57640:5"/>
they saw this discourse but in Embryo: so ridiculous as well as uncharitable, were their Censures. A man that with diligent search and care should collect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Statues or Pictures of divers eminent Persons, and expose them in some publick place to the view of all Spectators, would not thereby procure to himself the repute of a good Painter or Statuary; and yet certainly this Act of his were laudable, and in some measure obliging: but it would render him most immodestly arrogant, if among the Pourtraictures of those eminent men, he should erect his own. Now this would be my case, if while I present you with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of great Philosophers concerning the Infinite Being, I should vent any part of my own inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fancy among theirs: Wherefore expect it not, for I neither have vanity nor ability sufficient to erect an Opinion of my own; but acknowledge my self totally subdued under the commands of that Government, whereto Providence hath assign<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d my Life. Besides, in this Tract is comprehended a Relation of various Sects contradictory the one to the other, so as I cannot be said to hold them all: Neither (as I know of) have I any where shew'd my self the least partial; but if one had stronger Arguments to justifie their Opinion, than the other, blame not me who deliver them but <hi>recitativé,</hi> and am as it were their <hi>Amanuensis,</hi> without ever concerning my self with the intrinsick value of their Doctrines.</p>
            <p>As to the second exception, that charges me with rambling from my Subject, if this be an errour, it is an errour on the right hand, wherein I am but better
<pb facs="tcp:57640:5"/>
than my word. Constancy is not so absolutely necessary in Authors, as in Husbands: And for my own part, when I have my Pen in my hand, and Subject in my head, I look upon my self as mounted my Horse to ride a Iourney, wherein although I design to reach such a Town by Night, yet will I not deny my self the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of going a mile or two out of the way, to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my senses with some new and diverting prospect. He that always keeps at home, and never goes so far as to the end of his own Parish, only once a year in Procession, may be call'd a good Husband, but God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from such a Companion. I confess I cannot but love both Men and Books of a Rambling Fancy, for even their very Extravagancies are diverting: Now he that is of this humour, will be sure to give me his voice. However, in this I have honour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate (though imperfectly) the great <hi>Montaigne,</hi> whose umbrage is sufficient to protect me against any one Age of Criticks.</p>
            <p>Now for the third and last exception, against my Stile; I was never so well accomplish'd as to study the Iingling and Cadences of words, the happy expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the more soft or harsh toned Syllables how to place them right; nor had I ever the modishness to search in the Looking-glass which words gave the most grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful motion to the Lips: No, I confess my only endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is to write and speak so as to be understood; and as for Rhetorick, I leave that to those who delight more in the study of Words, than Nature of things. Rarely have I seen Orations full of Fancy, for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors bring matter to words, and not words to matter;
<pb facs="tcp:57640:6"/>
besides, the gravity of Philosophy would as ill become fine Language, as the Philosopher himself fine Cloaths.</p>
            <p>These are the main Exceptions which I conceive may be urged against me: but if I have omitted any other, it proceeds from the abhorrence I have to read over that thing twice, which I my self have written. This Piece I am sensible cannot be altogether exempt from the evil Censures of some disaffected and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested persons; as for instance, the Fanaticks and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who pleaded a Call from God to do the Work of the Devil, cutting off their Soveraigns Head, and are herein exploded for it; also all manner of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who counterfeiting the true Religion, are as much Traytors to Heaven, as those who counterfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coyns, venting false Metal for true, are Traytors to the King. By such persons as these I expect to be condemn'd; but the Ingenious Reader (if impartial) will not esteem it less worthy, for its sufferings under their Iudgments: since by the same Reason, he must also raise an outcry against the most sacred part of Philosophy, because <hi>Socrates</hi> suffer'd under it. There is nothing so virtuous or pious, which a contrary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will not decry: as on the other side, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so mean or base, which has not from some Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested persons receiv'd Adoration; even an Ape it self has not wanted <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Syllogisms to back him, so long as thousands lived by extolling him. <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Religio potuit suadere malorum.</hi> Great is <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Ephesians.</hi> But not to persecute you with too long a <hi>Scotch</hi> Grace, before so short a Meal; pardon your coarse Entertainment, and you are wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.</p>

            <p>AS the lustre of an Oriental Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is more clearly perceiv'd, when compar'd with counterfeit Stones; so Christianity appears in its grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test glory and splendor, when compar'd with the obscurity of Paganism; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of the one, serving but as a foyl to the beauty of the other. Nor doth the Divinity of our Scriptures ever better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, than when compar'd with the follies of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> the <hi>Alchoran<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of Heathen Law-givers; which is an infallible sign of their Excellency, that they so well bear the Test of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison. Now upon these considerations, <hi>Arnobius, Minucius, Clemens, Lactantius,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:57640:7"/>
               <hi>Origen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Tertullian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and other Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the first Centuries, undertook to vindicate their Religion to the Heathens; which is also the design of this Treatise: and if any one resents it otherwise, his want of Charity betrays his Irreligion, and shews him to be none of the best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, who thus whips the Fathers upon my back. Some men there are whose Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, like weak Stomachs, turn the most wholesom food into corruption; and these are the Enemies I expect. In this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course I undertake only to declare the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd and monstrous Doctrines of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Superstition concerning this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as far as may shew the blind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures which meer Nature presented to their Philosophers, yet not to all of them, but to those only which have been the most considerable. And here I have not omitted to produce the most powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, which they made use of to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their Vanities: partly, as unwilling to fight against a shadow; and partly, as knowing our Religion scorns to have them betray'd by a weak and dis-ingenuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of either their Lives or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, Christianity being of it sell able to foyl them, even in their richest dress.</p>

            <p>To begin then with the Original of their Superstition: It did certainly proceed from some crafty discerning person, who having observed what is most dear to Mankind, thought by pretending himself able to assist in the preservation of that one particular, (whether he were so or no) he might thereby procure an esteem and credit in the World: which having once obtain'd, it would not be difficult under the pretence of other peoples good, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his own. Thus observing that in this World the Body is every mans chief Favourite, a wise <hi>Hippocrates</hi> comes and pretends to know what will conduce to its health: being assur'd that Mankind, that sets so high a value upon life and ease, would be largely bountiful to him who should be able to prolong and preserve either; and from hence arises the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. In the same manner the Law-giver<note place="margin">Primus in orbe Deos fecit Timor.</note> observing a notion of some future Being implanted in every mans heart, pretended to have some extraordinary way reveal'd to him from an invisible Power, whereby he was able to instruct the People how to make that future estate happy, if they would but pursue his directions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the better to countenance such a Revelation;

they have absented themselves from the World some time before they divulg'd it. Thus <hi>Minos</hi> having for twelve years led a retired life in a Cave, at last came forth, and pretended to have spent all that time in conversing with <hi>Iove,</hi> whose Son he feign'd himself to be; also that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his mouth those Laws which he divulged to the People. Also <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> after he had for some time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed himself in a Wood, appear'd in publick, and prescrib'd those Laws to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which he pretended to have been deliver'd him by the Nymph <hi>Aegeria.</hi> A like Stratagem was made use of by <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras,</hi> who after two years retirement in a Den, feign'd himself to be risen from the dead, preaching up Rewards and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments in another life, to the great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the People, who very much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his Doctrine, because he had told them of all things which had happen'd amongst them during the time of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: A thing very easie for him to do, after he had been informed of the same from his Mother and Wife. Also <hi>Zamolxis</hi> (whom <hi>Laertius</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> call, <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras his Disciple,</hi> though <hi>Suidas</hi> and others oppose it) deliver'd those Laws to the <hi>Scythians,</hi> which he pretended to have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57640:8"/>
receiv'd in a certain Cave, where he had been conversing with the Gods. Nor did <hi>Epimenides</hi> get himself less reputation, by his pretence of having slept fifty years. And last of all, <hi>Mahomet</hi> having in the same manner retir'd himself into the Mountains of <hi>Arabia,</hi> did there by the assistance of <hi>Sergius</hi> and two <hi>Iews,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that fabulous Law which he after divulg'd unto the World, as coming from the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> with whom he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded himself very familiar. And thus we see with what Arts each Law-giver en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to establish their Laws among men, thinking thereby to purchase that immortal Fame, which their Ambitions so much desir'd: For as one of the Ancients well observ'd, <hi>Amari, coli, diligi majus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perio est.</hi> But oh the Impiety of these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who father'd all their Follies upon their Gods! not considering, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever speaketh in the name of the Gods, intituleth them to whatsoever he publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and consequently if his Doctrine be false, (as that of theirs must needs be, by reason of the absurdities found therein) intituleth the Deities to false Doctrines.</p>

allowing plurallty of Worlds, but only one infinite Body, govern'd by the Divine Spirit, acting all in all. <hi>Spiritus intus alit.</hi> So as when they mention'd <hi>Gods</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, they meant only divers facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which their Soul of the World (<hi>viz.</hi> God) had infus'd into several Creatures peculiar to them.

            <p>The most plausible Arguments they had to justifie their wicked Opinion of the Soul's mortality, or unrewarded conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proceeded from their contemplation of Man, whose Body when he dies, they plainly saw was by putresaction mingled with the Body of the World, from whence it was: And by the same reason they were so credulous as to believe his Soul mingled with the Soul of the World, from whence that was. Their Priests also agreeing herewith, (though in another form of words) taught, that in death the Soul went to God who gave it, and the Body to the Earth of which it was composed: therefore as when the Sun-beams shine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a dark room, and enlighten it, you may easily exclude it from shining into the room, but can never intercept or cut those beams off from their original, the Sun: the like relation they conceiv'd the Soul of Man had to the Soul of the World, whereto it ever hath an inseparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: the same also they held to be in all other Creatures, according to their several degrees of animation from one and

But <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> went further then this, who living in a Republick, and so perhaps having his Philosophy infected with their kind of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, gives the Soul of all things a kind of reciprocal preferment and recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by rarefaction and condensation of its corporeal nature.

with whom all its thoughts vanish. But those of the Vulgar, especially if vicious, they also acknowledged to be immortal, however to remain more or less grieving, for the loss of that beatifical fruition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they had led on Earth a life more or less vicious.</p>
            <p>Which Opinion (meer Nature, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightned Reason being Judge) can't ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit it self of many errors: First, they did not explain themselves, how they could be capable of a confin'd locality; nor where, nor in what subjects those Souls should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, when they left their Bodies.

Further, they grosly asserted, that those departed Souls could have no knowledge of particulars, for that they are not discernable, but by our bodily senses, which represent them unto us; but they pretended their knowledge to be only of Universals, whereas there are no such things really in Nature, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only meer aggregate terms, devised by our selves for conveniency of discourse, to save the labour of enumerating parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.

There is nothing that more betrays the Souls infinity, than Thought; as when in one minute a man can think of the Northern and Southern parts of the World, and in one moment run over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand Leagues both of Sea and Land: but the chief Argument this point of their Philosophy relyes upon, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex knowledge, which we have in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving our selves to know: and this they will have to be done without help from the imaginative Representation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they say, the Soul may know, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57640:16"/>
that part be lost. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently mark this inward perception of our knowledge, it may perhaps be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the inward experience, which our imaginative faculty gives us of what we know, and doth no more evince any separable faculty of the Soul, (as <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> observes) than the reflex and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick perception of smart, which a man's Foot gives him in a Fit of the Gout.</p>

            <p>Now the Ancients thinking the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World to be universally diffus'd through all things, not only Animals, but such as we call Inanimates, consider'd it so as that the various actings thereof, might not be unfitly compar'd to the Musick of a pair of Organs, where all the wind comes from the Bellows, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distributed into several Pipes, makes Musick so long as it remains in them, but so soon as it is passed through the Pipes, the wind of each Pipe mixes with that of the others again, and then the Musick ceases: Thus they foolishly conceived to be infused into all Creatures, each of their Spirits from that of the World, and so to act according to the various tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraments
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57640:17"/>
of those several Bodies, which they possess as long as they remain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but immediately when they pass through them, they mingle again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously with one another into the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the World, from which they were sent, and thus their former ways of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ceased.</p>
            <p>Others there were that look'd upon the Soul to be to the Body, as we see Gunpowder is to the Gun, (if I may fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illustrate an Ancient opinion, by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern comparison) and that a Body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Soul, is but a piece of Ordnance uncharg'd, useless to the operation Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture assign'd it. Therefore when men run mad through over much wit, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or learning, they may not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be said to be over-charg'd: as on the contrary, the reason why men <hi>vasto corpore</hi> are generally more heavy, dull and half witted, may proceed from their being under-charged. As we see the same quantity of Powder which gives a Report in a Pistol, gives little or none in a Cannon, the disproportion of the Gun diversifying the effects.</p>

            <p>Some of the Ancient Philosophers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a vain ambition of getting eternal Fame, by raising some particular Sect of Philosophy, which might generally take amongst men, set up for one of these ways: either to please the Voluptuous, who care for nothing, but delighting their senses without any further regard: or by pretending to Futurity and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to make a more glorious noise, and thereby thought to prevail more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and universally, as over-awing the timorous, and alluring the ambitious: in which way they adapted eternal ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours to evil doers, and everlasting glory to the virtuous. This they not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hoped would make their Sect to be admitted and cherish'd by Princes, as commodious to Government. Also this latter sort to compass their end, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to wrest their Doctrines of the Soul so far from meer illuminate Nature, as one of the Ancients said, They deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd things more like Dreams, or Old Wives Tales, than Truths: and at length Posterity following their Ancestors like Carriers Horses in a track, without seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57640:18"/>
out any new or better way, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd such frenzies from one another, and improved them with such dotages of their own, as surpass'd all Poetick Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and instead of taking with the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, grew ridiculous. For in truth they needed as much and as weak credulity, as ever any vulgar Superstition did: but were not so craftily fitted to draw vulgar capacities to honesty, or terrifie them from vice, as other Superstitions were. Their news of separate Souls in coelestial Joys, or infernal Agonies, <hi>Enumerus</hi> the<note place="margin">Sext.

All this would do little or no good upon the prophane Rabble, for they would say within themselves, if this be all, we will not for such Metaphysicks forbear any manner of pleasure or profit, how base soever. On the other side, should you hear <hi>Mahomet</hi> assuring the people, that if they would lead a pious, religious and obedient life in this World, they should hereafter live for ever in most pleasant Gardens, with variety of delicious Fruits, beautiful Women, and high affections, with abilities renew'd eternally: but if they led an irreligious life, and were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient

unto his Doctrine, they should hereafter be deliver'd up to horrid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, who would for ever torment them in a Lake of material Fire and Brimstone: this Doctrine, when once by education, and the solemnity of publick Authority, implanted and upheld in the minds of men, proves far more prevalent with them, than the sublime notions of <hi>Plato,</hi> how well grounded soever: and as to an exact proof before natural reason, clear and not prepossess'd, perhaps <hi>Plato</hi> would not have much the odds of <hi>Mahomet; Nihil est infelicius homine cui sua figmenta dominantur.</hi>

            <p>Many good Moral men, and some of the Fathers, as <hi>Tertullian, Lactantius,</hi> &amp;c. held the Soul to be <hi>ex Traduce</hi> from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son, and that for these reasons: First, if every man hath a new Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd into him at his birth by God, and not lineally descended to him from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Eve,</hi> how then can they be guilty of, or suffer for Original sin? 2.

If the Soul be not <hi>ex Traduce,</hi> then Man the most perfect of all Creatures, were worse than a Beast, who begets both matter and form. 4. Every like doth not then beget his like, an error in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy it self. 5. All that have Seed in themselves, do not propagate their kind. 6. Gods Command, <hi>viz. Gen.</hi> 1. the Creatures to increase and multiply, would be useless and of none effect. 7. God would infuse a Soul to be punish'd here and hereafter for anothers sin, <hi>viz. Adams.</hi> 8. God seems to concur to the act of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, or Adultery, in that he furnishes their unlawful Issue with a Soul; and if a Man lye with a Beast, and beget a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster half a Man and half a Beast, God will be thought to infuse a Soul into that unnatural conception, and it is a <hi>Quaere</hi> what will become of that Soul hereafter? 9.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57640:19"/>
opinion of Gods infusing the Soul imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into every man at his first Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This opinion of the Souls being <hi>ex Traduce</hi> (like the Body) from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is illustrated by the <hi>simile</hi> of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Candle by another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Holy Writ, God first lighted <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom Posterity receiv'd their light, without diminishing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thereby, any more than one Torch is diminish'd by lighting another.

different Temperaments more or less pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to receive it: and they that held this Opinion, laid down for an infallible maxim, that <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur admodum recipientis;</hi> and from hence (say they) it comes to pass, that some men are more ingenious, others more stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid. But generally they held, that men were more clearly rational, whilst other Animals are stupid and dull, yet all from one and the same original Spirit, varying only according to its different fuel. Just as Lamps, some shine brighter and some more dim, according as their Oyl or Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From hence (say they) it proceeds, that we often see as much difference between Men and Men, as there is between Men and Beasts, only as stupidity is most prevalent in Brutes, so is frenzy in Men. Nor did the Heathens perceive any considerable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt us and other Creatures, than what is occasion'd by speech and use of Letters, whereof they being ignorant, could only think of objects, noises, and what they felt, heard or saw, but could hold no mental discourses, as Men did who had the use of Letters. Let us hear what <hi>Mountaign</hi> says on this subject.<note place="margin">

between them and us, why may it not be in us, as well as in them? for we understand them no more than they do us; by the same reason therefore may they despise our ignorance, as well as we theirs: And we may as well think the <hi>Chineses</hi> Beasts, because we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them.

We entertain one another with mutual Apish tricks; and if I have my hour to begin, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, so hath she hers. As we hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the tamer sort of Beasts, so do the wilder hunt after us: and therefore as Sheep or Oxen are made for Men, so (if you will credit <hi>Mountaign</hi>) are Men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort made for Lions, Bears, Wolves, Tigers; the weakest for the strongest. Such as keep or entertain Beasts, (as he goes on) may rather be called their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, than they theirs. <hi>Democritus</hi> was of the opinion, that Men have learnt most of their Arts from dumb Creatures: as that the Spider taught us to weave, the Swallow to build, the Nightingale to sing, and divers Beasts the Art of Physick. St. <hi>Austin</hi> in his dispute with the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees,</hi> seems to give Beasts the use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.

Birds chuse rather a round than a square form, did they not know the conveniency of it? what makes them take first Clay, and then Water, unless they guess'd the moisture of the one, would mollifie the hardness of the other? would they floor their Apartments with Moss, did they not know, how much more soft and warm it would be for themselves and young ones? what makes them shelter themselves from stormy weather, build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cabbins toward the East, but that they know some winds are more healthful than others? why doth the Spider spin her artificial Web thicker in one place than another, using sometimes one, sometimes another knot, had she not an excellent contrivance?

            <p>The ingenious Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> is zealous for Apparitions, and in a Reply to that shrewd Objection, That the Devil only appears to silly weak people, he says, That the Devil will not appear to the wicked, for fear of converting them: but if this Argument held, he must never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to any, for certainly his appearing can never advance his Kingdom, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the contrary.

            <p>Again, others whose <hi>Ideas</hi> were more chearful and vigorous, did frequently cast away their lives, in hopes of being wrapt above the Skies; as the <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Guiney</hi> use to do, who upon any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of their condition, (thinking their Being no longer to be preserv'd than it is a Well-being) do often make-away themselves, in hopes to go dance with their deceased Friends beyond the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The prodigious power of such waking dreams, have produc'd such horrid effects in minds dark and suscep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible of them, especially when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented <hi>Ideas</hi> of Terrour. As at this time we frequently see poor old silly Women confess, and really imagine that they have convers'd with evil Spirits, in the shape of black Dogs, or have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57640:25"/>
flown in the Air, and so have suffer'd for Witches, when perhaps <hi>Bedlam</hi> had been much fitter for them. Nor is a man that is incredulous in the point of Witches, without some reason on his side. The ingenious <hi>Bergerac</hi> in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs saith thus: I have never heard any story of Witches, but it was said to be acted above an hundred miles from the place it was told me; the laying the Scene at which distance, made me sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Relators aim'd to render it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the curious to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the truth; also that they were in the shapes of Cats, found in the midst of a Field. Without many witnesses; the testimony of one person alone ought to be suspected in things miraculous: Near a Village; it was easier to cozen the Clowns: Twas a poor old Woman; Necessity might make her lye, to get money: She was old; Age weakens Reason, and makes talk too much; or else she hath invented this Fable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain her Neighbours withall: Age decays the sight; she took a Hare for a Cat: Age makes fearful; she thought she had seen fifty for one. And 'tis much more probable, that any one of these things may happen, which are
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57640:25"/>
every day seen, than such an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary accident. Again, the party thought to be a Witch, being some ignorant old Country-woman, hath not wit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intangle her self from the intricate Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions which are put to her, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is so stupified with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, that she is rendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of making any pertinent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to justifie her self; which if she doth, men conclude the Devil speaks in her; if she saith nothing, they believe she is convinc'd by a guilty Conscience, and so she is presently condemned: Or for the better evidence whether she be a Witch or no, they cast her into the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where if she sinks, she is drown'd; and if she swims, she is convicted for a Witch. But would the Devil be such a Fool? He that could at another time give her the form of a Cat, can he not now give her the form of a Fly to escape in? No, say they, Witches lose their power when they are in the hands of Justice: But this is ill contrived, for it is not the way to encourage others to serve the Devil, for him thus to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his servants in time of need, the old Serpent should be wiser than so. Besides it may be observ'd, that all these
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57640:26"/>
reputed Conjurers and Witches are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally beggarly and poor: Therefore is it probable that any persons should expose themselves, upon the hope to continue poor and odious, to misery both in this World, and that which is to come? How can it be admitted with<note place="margin">Montaign.</note> reverence to the Divine Nature, that Prophecy should cease, and Witches so abound, as seems by their frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions; which would make one think, the strongest fascination is incircled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ignorance of the Judges, malice of the Witnesses, or the stupidity of the poor parties accused. These are the things which are urged against this Opinion.</p>

            <p>This, I say, was an opinion generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd among the Heathens, only the wiser sort (so reputed) asserted, that God made all things of nothing but Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; whom they acknowledge to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and therefore could not imagine that there were any other real things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him: supposing that if there were, then God must have been but one eminent thing among many others; which to speak or think, might be esteem'd as great and sottish a blasphemy in Philosophy, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: and to this purpose <hi>Lucan</hi> speaks,</p>

               <item>2. Several parts of the Deity (as Stones, Metals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) must be void of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</item>
               <item>3. Idolatry were no crime, but only an amicable officiousness in one part of the Deity toward another.

            <p>Now they who held this vain Opinion, term'd every Creature (especially Man, who is esteem'd the most excellent of all others) a <hi>Microcosm,</hi> or little World, as composed of <hi>Psyche</hi> and <hi>Hyle.</hi> Also <hi>Moses</hi> hath been thought to intimate as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57640:28"/>
much, in saying, That in the beginning of the Creation, the Spirit moved upon the Waters; for so the <hi>Rabbins</hi> and <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balists</hi> expound him. They say it was the <hi>Ruah Elohim, viz.</hi> the Spirit of God, which moved upon the Waters. <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> seems likewise to agree with this Doctrine, asserting the beginning of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things to proceed from Fire and Water: But <hi>Moses,</hi> who was skill'd in all the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Learning, alludes perhaps to their <hi>Hieroglyphicks,</hi> wherein the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of an <hi>unit,</hi> signified <hi>God;</hi> as a <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,</hi> stood for a <hi>Non-entity, i. e.</hi> for No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the character of <hi>Ten,</hi> did signifie the <hi>World:</hi> and in the old <hi>Hebrew</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, as in our modern Figures, of a different shape, the figure of an <hi>unit</hi> placed before a Cypher, signified <hi>Ten,</hi> by which was meant the <hi>World,</hi> as I said: and hereby they express'd that God made the World of Nothing. And perhaps in further conformity herewith, he is said to make Man more excellent than other Creatures, after his own Image; that is, not in outward Effigies, or Features of face and limbs, but as the Universe composed of Spirit and Body. And so they held the World to be consisting of a Being partly corporeal and visible, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57640:29"/>
partly spiritual and invisible: the visible or material part, by reason of its more or less gross and solid corporeity, is of it self more or less unfit for motion, but properly capable to receive the impulses of the more active spiritual part: And thus in the little World of Man, as long as his Spirit remains in him, it quickens his gross Body, carrying it up and down from the remotest parts of the Earth, contriving many projects, and working great things, however in a moment after that Spirit is gone, the Body is left a dull putrid piece of Earth, and all his Thoughts perish.</p>

            <p>But here give me leave to <hi>Montaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,</hi> and so far to digress from my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as to acquaint you with a great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, which happen'd among the Ancients concerning Motion; for although, as I lately told you, there were some who thought the material part of the World unfit for motion, yet there were others of a contrary sentiment; and from hence arose the dispute concerning the motion of the Earth. <hi>Aristotle, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho Brahe,</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ld that it was immovable,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57640:29"/>
(especially the two former;) because they saw the Sun rise in one place, and set in another, as also their Houses stand in the same place to day, as they did yesterday, they thought it an infallible truth that the Sun danced about the Earth, whilst that stood still to receive its Salutation. In opposition to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine there have risen up several men, both Ancient and Modern, who have affirm'd the contrary; it hath been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for above these 2000 years. That the Globe of the Earth moved, was of old the opinion (if not of <hi>Orpheus</hi>) of <hi>Thales, Aristarchus,</hi> and <hi>Philolaus</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> and is maintain'd by <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus, Kepler, Zongomontanus, Origa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp;c.</hi> They held that the Sun, like the Heart of Man, is plac'd in the midst of the Body of the Universe, as the most convenient seat to heat and animate the whole, and that the Earth mov'd about it: For (say they) we do not place a<note place="margin">1</note> Candle in the corner, but in the midst of the Room, when we would have it give most light. Besides, the circular motion<note place="margin">2.</note> of the Planets round about the Sun, seems to argue that the Earth doth the same, and the Sun stands still. Further,<note place="margin">3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> it is more reasonable to believe, that the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57640:30"/>
Earth which hath need of light and heat, should go to seek what it wants, than that the Sun should go to seek what it wants not: The Fire doth not turn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Roast-meat, but the Roast-meat before the Fire. Again, 'tis urged, Rest<note place="margin">4.</note> and Immobility is a more noble condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than Motion, wherefore more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the Sun a type and resemblance of God. And then they observ'd, heavy<note place="margin">5.</note> things were kept up in the Air, only by virtue of motion, as a Stone mounted in the Air by a Sling; and therefore how do we know (say they) but that the Earth, like a Child's Humming-Top, may be kept up by its own motion, and the swiftness of that motion, like that of the Tops, might make it seem immovable. They who deny the motion of the Earth,<note place="margin">6.</note> must also deny it to hang in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> which were an absurdity. Lastly, it may<note place="margin">7.</note> seem much more credible, that the Earth moves five Leagues in a minute, than that the eighth Sphere in the same time<note place="margin">8.</note> moves above fourty millions; which it must do, if it be true that the extent of the Heavens be infinite: so that to have all the Heavens move round in twenty four hours, were to measure an infinite by a finite.</p>

But it still censures those of the <hi>Altenasack</hi> for Hereticks, chiefly because they can't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the everlasting and merciless Hell, esteeming it a thing that would rob God of

his Attribute of Mercy, which they hold were not infinite (as all his Attributes must be) if in no measure it extended to the most wicked and wretched Creatures. Not considering how short soever a mans life is, it matters not, for he hath an offer made him, either of eternal happiness or misery, and he might chuse either which he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Nor is Eternal misery more dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to a vicious life, than Eternal happiness to a vertuous, so that he plays but upon the square either way.</p>
            <p>Now amongst those Heathens there were a third sort of men, whose fancy (as they themselves thought) was of very obvious experience, but seem'd to be stifled and suppressed, as neither suiting to the wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of men, nor conducive to the governing of them: And these are those which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a man to be neither Soul nor Body, but only the Result of their Conjunction, which vanishing, he was for ever uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and lost. Because that which in its best estate was esteem'd but a shadow upon Earth, they ignorantly supposed, must on the parting of the Body, whose shadow it was, be for ever lost. Yea, and as I shew'd before out of <hi>Lucretius,</hi> they held that if the same Body could return upon Earth again, and be reunited to it, that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57640:35"/>
might constitute a new man, but of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to the former; no more than my sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow which I shall have next year, will be to my this years shadow, although I have the same body next year, as I have this. And this <hi>Chimaera</hi> of theirs is by one of their own Writers compar'd to Clouds gathering together, under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of various shapes, as of a Castle, Gyant, Mountain, or the like: In which appearances they often produce real effects, as Thunder, Lightning, Winds, Rain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till by their separation the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, Castle or Mountain vanish; as also the real effects soon pass away, but still the same Clouds remain, though in new Conjectures and Appearances: which vain opinion is express'd in these verses.</p>

There is not any opinion in the World, hath been more generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in the hearts of men, than this of the Souls future estate: and how should it have been so long rooted in our minds, were there nothing of truth in it? Nature which makes nothing in vain, hath implanted in Man a desire of Immortality, which desire is vain if he be not capable of it. Nothing is corrupted but by its contrary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which hath no contrary (as the Soul) must be free from corruption. The Harmony of the World, which permits not things to pass from one extreme to another without some mean, requires, that as there are pure Spirits and Intelligences, which are immortal, and Substances corporeal and mortal; so there is a middle nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these two, <hi>Man,</hi> call'd by the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> on this account, the Horizon of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse, because he serves for a link and

Also since the Soul can know all sorts of Bodies, it must be consequently exempt from all corporeal Entity. As the Tongue to judge aright of sapours, must it self have none; the same may be said of the eye, to discern well of colours. To say that the Soul is mortal, because it acts only by the help of its Organs, were to draw a conclusion from an uncertainty, it being never yet prov'd, that the Soul cann't act of it self without its Organs. The Law of all Nations is the Law of Nature, and the belief of the Souls Immortality is a dictate of it: But the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers are as rare as Earth quakes, which (if there were no other Reasons) would be a miserable Argument to prove the motion of the Earth.

            <p>The Heathen Philosophers (as I shew'd you) were much divided in their Opinions concerning the Souls future estate, some held it mortal, others immortal. Of those that held the mortality of the Soul, the <hi>Epicureans</hi> were the chief Sect, who notwithstanding their impious Doctrines, yet some of their lives were vertuous. <hi>Cardan</hi> had so great a value for their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions, that he appear'd in Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. <q>It appears (says he) by the Writings of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Diogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertius,</hi> that the <hi>Epicureans</hi> did more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously observe Laws, Piety, and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity among men, than either the <hi>Stoicks</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57640:41"/>
or <hi>Platonists:</hi> and I suppose the cause thereof was, that (as <hi>Galen</hi> tells us) a man is either good or evil by custom, but none confideth in those, that do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess sanctity of life. Wherefore they were compelled to use greater Fidelity, thereby the better to justifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session: from which reason it likewise proceeds, that at this day few do equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the fidelity of Usurers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they are most base in the rest of their life. Also among the <hi>Iews,</hi> whilst the <hi>Pharise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thus if you compare the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of great Employs; for their fault was not any want of ability or honesty, but their general desire of leading a private life, easie and free from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, although inglorious. For where Immortality is not own'd, there can be no ambition of posthumous Glory, such as excited Tyrants to commit those fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which the Poet derides in these two lines: <q>

                     </q> Neither (as he goes on) doth the hopes

            <p n="1">1. They denied any knowledge of the Divine Nature, because, say they, to know adaequately is to comprehend, and to comprehend is to contain, and the thing contain'd must be less than that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains it; to know inadoequately, is not to know.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the uncertainty of the Senses, as <hi>ex. gr.</hi> our Eyes represent things at a distance to be less than really they are: A
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57640:43"/>
straight stick, in the water seems to be crooked; the Moon to be no bigger than a Cheese; the Sun greater at Rising and Setting, than at Noon: The Shore seems to move, and the Ship to stand still; square things to be round at distance; an erect Pillar, to be less at the top. Neither do we know (say they) whether objects are really so as our eyes represent them to us; for the same thing which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears<note place="margin">Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> out of <hi>Sext. Emp.</hi>
               </note> white to us, seems yellow to him that hath the Jaundies, and red to a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that hath red eyes; also if a man rubs his eyes, the figure which he beholds seems long or narrow: and therefore it is not improbable, but that Goats, Cats, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, which have long pupils of the eye, may also think those things long which we call round: For as Glasses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the object variously according to their shape, so it may be with our eyes: And so the sense of Hearing deceives: Thus the Eccho or Trumpet sounded in a Valley, makes the sound seem before us, when it is behind us. Besides, how can we think that an Ear, which hath a narrow passage, can receive the same sound with that which hath a wide one? Or the Ear whose inside is full of hair, to hear the same with a smooth Ear? Experience tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57640:43"/>
us, that if we stop, or half stop our Ears, the sound cometh not in the same manner, as when the Ears are open. Nor is the Smelling, Tast or Touch less subject to mistake: For the same scents please some, and displease others; and so in our Tasts, to a rough and dry tongue that very thing seems bitter, (as in an Ague) which to the moist tongue seems otherwise; and so is it in other Creatures. The like is true of the Touch: For it were absurd to think, that those Creatures which are covered with Shels, Scales, or Hairs, should have the same sense in touching with those that are smooth. Thus one and the same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is diversly judged of, according to the various qualities of the Instruments of Sense, which conveyeth it to the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; from all which the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>eptick</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that what these things are in their own nature, whether red, white, bitter or sweet, he cannot tell: for, says he, why should I prefer my own conceit in affirming the nature of things to be thus, or thus, because it seemeth so to me? when other living Creatures perhaps think it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. But the greatest fallacy is in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of our inward senses: for the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy sometime is perswaded, that it hears and sees what it doth not; and our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57640:44"/>
is so weak, that in many disciplines scarce one demonstration is found, though this alone produces Science. Wherefore it was <hi>Democritus</hi> his opinion, that Truth is hidden in a Well, that she may not be sound by men. Now although this Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine is very inconsistent with the light of Christianity, yet I could wish <hi>Adam</hi> had been of this perswasion, for then he would not have mortgaged his Posterity as he did, for the purchase of a Twilight Knowledge. Now from these sinister ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations it was, that they esteemed all our Sciences to be but Conjectures, and our Knowledge but Opinion. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doubting the sufficiency of humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, they would not venture to affirm or deny any thing of the Souls future state, but civilly and quietly gave way to the Doctrines, &amp; Ordinances under which they lived, without raising or espousing any new Opinions. And in those times all the great Innovations and Embroilments among men, were set up by the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonists,</hi> who were highly possess'd with the desire of Immortality and Glory. Which thing being observed, did great violence in those days to the belief of the Souls Immortality, making men the less willing to censure those for Atheists
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57640:44"/>
who doubted or denyed it, but sociably to admit them into business, and Trusts of the highest importance. The <hi>Chineses</hi> have a Religious Sect call'd the <hi>Nanto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi> who preach up publickly the Souls Mortality. Also at this day in the <hi>East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Indies,</hi> (where the greatest swarms of Man-kind live, and those of many Sects and Religions,) it is found by our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants trading thither, that not only the far greatest number are of those which believe no other rewards or punishments for the Soul, except what it shall after death meet with, in a new Body upon Earth; but also they find by Commerce with them, that they are the most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently remarkable for their honesty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any of the other Sects. From whence <hi>Postellus</hi> observes, that few men can debauch Nature in themselves to such a degree, as to commit all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they were capable of, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they believ'd no reward or punishment hereafter: For, says he, you must either acknowledge Superstitions unnecessary, or else defile your own Natures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess men to be worse then Beasts, who can live without those terrours, and yet not devour one another unless in cases of necessity.</p>

            <p>Thus if you seriously recollect the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Opinions concerning the Souls estate after death, we shall find that the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive among them, had but a slender conceit of the Souls eternal condition, or at best they thought (as <hi>Bernier</hi> says the Inhabitants of <hi>

               </hi> believe,) that it would mix with the Soul of the World again: like Water taken out of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean in a Bottle, and swims therein for a while, till by some accident or other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broke, it returns back to the Sea from whence it was taken; or else passing from one Body to another, and then in either case, its condition, whether good or bad, would be of no concern to its former Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Which made <hi>Seneca</hi> so little value his future state, as to speak of it with a <hi>Quid mihi curae erit Transfuga?</hi> So that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what I can find, they look'd upon Man to be made up of Soul and Body together; not Body without Soul, nor Soul without Body, but Man to be the Result of both, <hi>viz.</hi> Soul and Body. With whom (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their vain Opinion) it fares after death, as with a <hi>Parliament</hi> after Dissolution, which being made up of three Estates, <hi>Lords Spiritual, Lords Temporal,</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> remain a <hi>Parliament</hi> whilst
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57640:45"/>
the King pleases to grant them his <hi>Fiat:</hi> But when the King gives his word to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it, the three <hi>Estates</hi> remain still, but the <hi>Parliament</hi> is gone. And thus they held Man to be the Result of Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, till God pleases to command his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, after which the Soul and Body remain in a separate Being, only that the <hi>Man</hi> as well as the <hi>Parliament</hi> is lost in the Dissolution. And to proceed further with this comparison, as the <hi>Parliament</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the Kingdom, of which they are a smaller part, so did the Heathens believe that <hi>Man</hi> in some kind represents the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, of whom he is a portion. So as by this we may see the effect of all their impious Tenents, concerning the Souls fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture estate, was, that Man is but a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger in this life, and the World his Inne, till sickness brings up the Reckoning, and Death comes in with an <hi>All is paid.</hi>

            <p>These were the most considerable O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the Heathen Philosophers; yet for as much as there was never any Sect but had some defect either in Theory or Practice: Some have thought it best not

            <p>Now to all these various Opinions, there have been opposed various Objections: As first, If the Soul be a portion of the Divine Spirit, inseparable from that its Original, and acted thereby, men would then indulge themselves, by thinking all the Evil they committed would go upon Gods Score, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their own: <hi>Et mallant emendare Deum, quam seipsos:</hi> That all Industry were discourag'd, all blame or praise taken away. Therefore <hi>Tully</hi> calls this <hi>Ignava Ratio:</hi> Who blames the Sword for a murder, and not the hand that imployes it? Nay, in Creatures sensible, if a Lion or a Serpent kills a man, they but act according to their Natures. To all which their usual Answer was, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant allowing unto the Soul of Man a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Will, not subject to be forced out of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57640:47"/>
its own Conduct; Wherefore men are said to be tempted into vicious courses, but not dragg'd or compell'd. And besides this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Nature (saith the Philosopher) hath implanted in the heart of man, before he debauches himself by evil customs, a harmless and kind disposition, not willing to destroy or hurt other men, unless it be upon an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Necessity, for his own Preservation: and then, when enforced by such Necessity, though he choose to do it, as of two evils the least, yet he cannot act it without regret, unless by evil Converse he hath poison'd that inbred Goodness which he brought with him into the World. And upon such, one may observe the Justice of Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; the courses these vitiated Spirits take, end in Poverty, or some other misery, and so brings them either to a Prison, Hospital, or Gallows at home, or else to be slain in a Foreign War, wherein they ought not to have concern'd themselves. And thus we see Punishment was ever judg'd due to all free Agents, for depraving of their Natural Tempers, so true is that saying, When Man lost his Innocence, he lost his Happiness; and that of the Poet is no less,</p>

            <p>Another objection wherewith the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were much perplex'd, (as indeed they had reason to be) was their want of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that the Soul should meet with future Justice, demanding withal, how then in this Life could the baser sort of Spirits be deterr'd from gainful Villanies, as might be acted in secret, and so never like to be discover'd, but to escape the Punishment of the Laws, and hatred of men, such as Perjuries, unsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Murders, concealing dead mens Trusts, and the like? especially those who by Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Immortallty, have quite extinguish'd the Light of Nature in their minds.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57640:48"/>
being like a Pitcher with two ears, that may be taken on either side) the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have adventur'd in this Subject, to take the Pitcher by the left ear, and rather than not justifie their Opinions, have (against all Reason) adventur'd to reply upon the things objected, with such fallacious Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as these:</p>
            <p>1. They seem to question whether any Villany could be so secretly acted, as might not admit some hazard of being discover'd; and if so, then the danger of that might ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them into honesty. But grant (say they) that Vices may be carried on with such secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as no mortal eye could discover; yet we find by a long and sad experience, that in those places, where by publick institution men are taught to expect Divine Justice after death, as some of us from <hi>Aeacus:</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less such dull and debauch'd Persons, have seldom their minds so clear and sedate, as to weigh and regard those future accounts; or if they do, it is not till at the point of death, when they are past doing any more mischief, and that then the Apprehensions of <hi>Elysium,</hi> or the <hi>Stygian</hi> Lake, produces as little good to the Publick, as to themselves; Vice first leaving Them, and not they Vice. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,<note place="margin">ibid.</note> say they, if such persons would betimes
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57640:48"/>
recollect themselves, they might easily find, that no Humane wit could sound the depth of Nature; and therefore how can men assure themselves, but that God who hath sound out this way of immersing a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit into flesh and bloud, thereby to make it smart and grieve, which otherwise, in its pure Nature, it could not have done, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Opinions: How therefore (say they) do men know, but that the same Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Wisdom, even without a miracle, may use it so again? or take it into mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of other wayes as natural to chastise it in a more afflicting manner, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way hath so little purified it.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the very Heathen Laws themselves, as recorded by their own Historians, shew how much inferiour their Vertues were to ours.

            <p>Another grand objection to those Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, who denied the Souls Immortality, and by consequence, all future entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to a vertuous or a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, was grounded on their frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of men eminent for Vertue, to live and dye in misery: whereas others notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for Vice, lived and died in great prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. This put as well Philosophers, as also Saints to their wits end, till the latter took Haven at the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there shelter'd themselves against all fears: (but they are not within the reach of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, which meddles with nothing but the vain conceits of men, who had not that Port to friend.) In answer to this unanswerable objection, some of them, especially the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> would make us believe that Poverty, Contempt, a Dungeon, Nakedness, Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and rotting in the Streets, are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally evils, especially to a noble mind that can defie Fortune. But these Bravado's become only Mad men, and whosoever is conversant in such Writings, doth only study to make himself a Fool: and perhaps the <hi>French</hi> have respect hereunto, when they call a learned Ass <hi>Un Philosophe.</hi> Such a mans Character is ingeniously given us by <hi>Horace,</hi> in these three lines:</p>

            <p>But to return to our Objections: There have been offer'd better Solutions than those of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> (though not at all convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to any Rational man:) As first, they surmise, That peradventure those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which we take for sincere, may be counterfeit and mistaken, proceeding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from some wicked motive. Thus the Souldier whose courage we admire for scaling a Wall, it may be (say they) he is moved by malice to murder some particular Enemy of his, or he knows not of a Mine ready to spring under him. Thus also when a Woman is prais'd for Chastity, perhaps either it is for want of Opportunity, <hi>Casta quam nemo rogavit,</hi> or from some natural Defect in her Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Frigidity and Flegm, or else for fear of Conception, and from an unwillingness to have her Reputation lie at the mercy of a loose young mans tongu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. Again, (say they) if you see an Officer refuse a Bribe, consider if he be not one of a plentiful Fortune, that covets Vulgar applause more than a Superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Riches: Or consider whether the Bribe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57640:50"/>
were not small and inconsiderable, because many will hazard their Reputation for Pounds, who will not for Pence: Or observe whether the time was secret and convenient, wherein the Bribe was offer'd: or, last of all, whether it was not refus'd out of a prospect of some greater Advantage, when he could not possibly receive both. As the <hi>Banditi</hi> will let pass a single Passenger, rather than by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulting him miss the Booty of a whole <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van.</hi> In which cases their Honesty proceeds <hi>à metu, non moribus.</hi> Nor is there any thing more frequent, than to see the wickedest of men highly to act Religion;</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57640:51"/>
For in the minority of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they had alway in their mouths that humble Sentence of our Saviours, <hi>If men strike you on one cheek, turn the other; if they take your Cloak give them your Coat also.</hi> But when they were grown an hundred thousand strong, then they fell to doing the Work of the Lord diligently, (as they called it) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Use of another of Christs sayings, <hi>Blessed are the meek</hi> (meaning themselves) <hi>for they shall inherit the Earth;</hi> and thus singing to the Lord a new Song, they plunder'd all <hi>Germany.</hi> Now these are they who do the greatest mischief to Religion: These are they whom the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> calls the greatest A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, for that they are ever handling Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things without feeling; and these are they that in a perverted sense fulfill that saying of the Scriptures, <hi>Godliness is great gain:</hi> For by reason of their Imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ety, seeing they can expect to receive little Benefit from our Saviour in the next World, they resolve to make what advantage they can of him in this. Like Jugglers, they carry only their coal of zeal in their Mouths, not being heated themselves, with what they go about to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame others. But as it addeth deformity to an Ape, to be so like a man; so the near resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that Hypocrisie bears to Religion, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

it the more deformed. By which you may see, how little we can judge of Religion by outward appearance, Now in such like cases, when the searcher of hearts afflicts them in this Life, we, who see the outside only, do foolishly question Divine Justice.</p>

            <p>Another Reply which the Philosophers made to the aforesaid Objection, was this; That admitting the Vertues which men so highly extoll, were not hypocritical, but in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, yet (say the Philosophers) for ought we know, they are not in the ballance of Nature of such weight and Value as men esteem them; but that it may fare with them as Coyn made of Copper or Leather, which though by Proclamation it goes at a high rate in one Country, it will not do so in another, for want of intrinsick Value.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57640:52"/>
               <hi>viz.</hi> Wisdom and Industry: for without Wisdom Industry is but Labour in vain; and without Industry, Wisdom is but a bare thinking; and thoughts, though never so wise, unless put in execution, are but dreams, which produce no real effect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Clown having his Cart overthrown, desir'd aid of <hi>Hercules,</hi> to set it upright again; the Daemon bids him set his shoulders to the Wheel, and lift at it, and then much might be done. Also to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Lucian</hi> tells us, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten troubled with the impertinent Requests and Petitions of Princes, and Generals on both sides for Victory, to prevent any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trouble of that kind, hath for the future decreed, That whenever two Armies meet, the greater number <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>hall overcome the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, provided the Conduct, Discipline, and Courage of both be the same. Furthermore, says the Heathen, if you observe the several kinds of misery among men, and the Causes from which they proceed, you shall for the most part find the want of Wisdom, Industry, or both, to have been the cause. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, when men are taken with horrid Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, they usually come from an excess in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or drinking, or from such things as with a careful observation, they might easily have
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57640:52"/>
perceived to be disagreeable with their health. Some are put to death for siding with a weak Faction; others are beggar'd by Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and spending beyond their Revenue, or by not keeping a vigilant eye over it, but leaving the managery thereof to careless or false Servants. Again, others have been ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd by being bound for their dear Brethren over a Glass of Wine: among these may be reckoned Princes, who are ever ruined by their Favourites, unless the Prince has the good fortune to ruine them first, being, like <hi>Actaeon,</hi> subject to be slain by their own Hounds. These and a million of other follies produce the ruine of most men, who still owe their fall to want of Wisdom: Insomuch, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients had an opinion, that the Gods before they brought any calamity upon a man, would first unwit him, as to some particular occasion, and then punish his oversight; <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere quos vult Iupiter, hos priûs dementat.</hi> Whereupon, when Persons esteem'd pious and good natur'd, are upon these or the like Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours cast into Prisons, or other misfortunes, the fear lest at another time the like may befall us, breeds a compassion which takes more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the misery, than the folly which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd it. Hereto some may rejoyn, That they have observed several that for the greatest
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57640:53"/>
part of their Lives have been unblest, and poor, who by their Neighbours have been ever esteem'd pious, industrious, and of good Understanding. To which it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, It doth not often happen to be so: But whensoever it doth so fall out, if we narrowly mark their courses of life, it will not be difficult to perceive some notable foolish errours, which like Maw-worms destroy a man without any great outward appearance of Evil. Or else peradventure if they would enter scrutiny with their own hearts, they might find they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon themselves or others, more than upon that Almighty goodness, which made and preserves all things, being the only root of all prosperity; who by this deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, having as much as in them lies, cut themselves off from that root of Divine Providence, they become like Boughs set in a Chimney, which soon wither: And last of all, (say they) if Sicknesses and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are sent us because of our Sins, what makes Brutes subject to the same?</p>
            <p>These are the chief Arguments that I find any where recorded by the Heathens, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their wicked Opinions, which are answer'd by the impulses of every mans own heart; for the belief of a future state
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57640:53"/>
is implanted in every ones Nature, and this appears as well by the progress of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and Superstition, as of the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: For no Religion of what kind soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, whether false or true, could have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten so general a possession in the hearts of men, or have been so long entertain'd in the World, had there not been in Nature some sense of a future Being, which hath from the beginning made the generality of men so apt to receive Religious Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any kind whatsoever, without which foundation to work on, even <hi>Solon, Lyeur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> might soon have abrogated their own Laws in despair.</p>

            <p>But to proceed, without any relation to the Souls future account, I find by some of the wisest of the Ancients, that they thought they could never have too high an opinion of Gods goodness, or too base of mans wickedness; whose Vices nevertheless (since Nature doth nothing in vain) they esteem'd not altogether unnecessary to the well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of Mankind: For, sayes one of them, <q>If from History, or Experience, you but observe any one Age, you shall find it hath much the resemblance of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought piece of Tapestry, wherein is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented

            <p>As for the manner of their Worship, and the places wherein they celebrated their Heathenish Rites and Ceremonies, that being a Subject unnecessary in this Discourse to trouble you with; I shall only give you this short Account of it, which I find already collected to my Hands by that Learned Satyrist <hi>Cornelius</hi>

               <q>As for the Gentiles (saith he) there were some very eminent for the Structures of their Temples; but others there were who never made Use of any: Of which number was <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who is Reported to have burnt all the Temples about <hi>Asia,</hi> at the request of his Magicians, esteeming it no less than Impiety to inclose the Gods in Walls. To the same purpose <hi>Zeno Cittious</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57640:55"/>
in these words: To build Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Temples (saith he) is no way necessary, for nothing ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Sacred by right, or esteemed Holy, which men themselves erect; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther among the <hi>Persians</hi> of old, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Primitive <hi>Hebrews,</hi> were there any Temples Dedicated to Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, till at last one was Founded by <hi>Solomon,</hi> in which if any think God can be included, he is reproved by the Prophet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Isaiah, Heaven is my Throne, the Earth my Foot-stool, therefore what is the House thou buildest for me?</hi> and <hi>Stephen</hi> the Protomartyr adds, <hi>Solomon built an House, but the most High inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits not in places made with Hands.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so St. <hi>Paul</hi> himself exhorts the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to the same effect, telling them that God dwells not in Temples made with Hands, for being the Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, he is not served by mens hands, he wants not their help. Furthermore, <hi>Origen</hi> in his Writings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Celsus,</hi> saith, that for a long time after <hi>Christ's</hi> Death, there were no Churches, built; and so far goes <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </q>  But I conceive, that however the Pagans did some of them refrain from erecting
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57640:55"/>
Temples out of Superstition, yet the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Christians did it upon another account, <hi>viz.</hi> the Persecutions wherewith they were then oppressed. But afterward, when they had gotten Kings for their Nursing-Fathers, and Queens for their Nursing-Mothers, to favour their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Couse, they either erected publick Houses commodious for Devotion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted those Magnificent Structures, the Stately Temples Dedicated to <hi>Juno, Venus, Apollo,</hi> with the rest of their Gods and Goddesses, to the Service of the true God: and indeed most of the Christian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (as the Musk-melon from the Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill) were raised out of the filthy Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and Superstition of Paganism.</p>

            <p>The next thing I shall touch upon, is the Politick Institution of the Heathen Ceremonies in times of their Publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.

Solemnities wherewith they are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attended? Who would be ambitious of seeing the Lord Mayor without any Attendants? Of seeing two Horses run against one another, with no other Company but the Grooms that ride them? Would any Person give Money, and stay in a Croud for three or four hours together with empty Stomachs to see any of these Sights? Or would a man rise at four of the Clock in a Winters morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, riding seven or eight hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the cold, for the uncertain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of seeing nine or ten couple of Dogs, run barking after a Fox, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Company than theirs? Who would buy such small pleasures at so dear a rate, were they not attended with other Ceremonies? and yet as they are now performed, we see people almost mad upon them. Which shews how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious an Influence they have over our Affections in all kind of Pleasures. Nor are they less prevalent in matters of Grief and Affliction, as well for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling as heightening of it. All thoughts of the future Cares and Inconveniences of a married Life are drown'd in the Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possdt, and for that time banished by the Ceremonie of Company, Feasting and

Also in Death, what makes it so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, (but as the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> well observes) the Solemnity of Friends weeping and mourning about the Death-bed? Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that saying, <hi>Pompa mortis magis ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, quàm mors: ipsa.</hi> Now this being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the Ancient Lawgivers, (<hi>viz.</hi> how great an Influence such Pageantries have over the minds of Men) it made them under pretence of decency of Worship, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce all those vain superstitious Rites wherewith their Devotion was fill'd. Thus <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> first instituted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies among the <hi>Románs,</hi> thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a rude, harbarous People that had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a Kingdom by Violence, to the love of Piety, Justice and Religion. Thus he erected the Order of Vestal Virgins to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Fire in the Temple, and to do Sacrifice to the Goddess <hi>Vesta.</hi> Also he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted twelve men of an Order called the <hi>Salii,</hi> who in painted Garments were to sing Verses in praise of God <hi>Mars.</hi> Besides other Priests call'd <hi>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57640:58"/>
to him in affliction, than to have a God to flee to in his distress? The gretest ease in sorrow, is to have a Friend to break our mind to; and if so, how much greater relief and satisfaction must it be to an afflicted man, to have a God who is so well able to counsel, direct and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him, for his Friend, to communicate his case to? And therefore saith <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> A Christian while he is at his Prayers with his hands lift up to God, is unsensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all Punishment, Besides, the very thoughts that we have a Providence at all times to flee to, animates us with a new Spirit of boldness and resolution, which is no small assistant to our success: As for example, Take a Dog and mark what courage he assumes when he finds himself maintain'd by a man, who (as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> saith) is to him as a God, or <hi>Melior Natura.</hi> And of the same Use is Confidence in God, for it animates us with that assurance as ever renders us suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful.
