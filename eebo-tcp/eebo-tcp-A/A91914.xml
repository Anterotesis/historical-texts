            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>Dol-Common <hi>being forſaken by my Lord</hi> All-pride, <hi>and having written him a moſt lamentable Letter, his Lordſhip ſends her the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing anſwer.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <l>IF you're deceived, it is not by my cheat,</l>
            <l>For all diſguiſes are below the great.</l>
            <l>What Man or Woman upon earth can ſay</l>
            <l>I ever us'd 'em well above a day?</l>
            <l>How is it then that I inconſtant am?</l>
            <l>He changes not, who alwayes is the ſame.</l>
            <l>In my dear ſelf, I center every thing,</l>
            <l>My Servants, Friends, my Miſtreſs, and my King,</l>
            <l>Nay Heaven and earth to that one point I bring.</l>
            <l>Well-manner'd, honeſt, generous and ſtout,</l>
            <l>(Names by dull Fools to plague mankind found out)</l>
            <l>Should I regard, I muſt my ſelf conſtrain,</l>
            <l>And 'tis my maxim to avoid all pain.</l>
            <l>You fondly look for what none e're could find</l>
            <l>Deceive your ſelf, and then call me unkind;</l>
            <l>And by falſe reaſons would my falſhood prove,</l>
            <l>For 'tis as natural to change as Love.</l>
            <l>You may as juſtly at the Sun repine</l>
            <l>Becauſe alike it does not alwayes ſhine.</l>
            <l>No glorious thing was ever made to ſtay,</l>
            <l>My Blazing Star but viſits and away;</l>
            <l>As Fatal too, it ſhines as thoſe i'th' skies,</l>
            <l>'Tis never ſeen but ſome great Lady dies.</l>
            <l>The boaſted favour you ſo precious hold</l>
            <l>To me's no more than changing of my gold.</l>
            <l>What e're you gave, I paid you back in bliſs,</l>
            <l>Then where's the obligation, pray, of this?</l>
            <l>If heretofore you found grace in my eyes,</l>
            <l>Be thankful for it, and let that ſuffice.</l>
            <l>But Women Beggarlike, ſtill haunt the door</l>
            <l>Where they've receiv'd a Charity before.</l>
            <l>O happy Sultan! whom we barbarous call,</l>
            <l>How much refin'd art thou above us all!</l>
            <l>Who envies not the joys of thy Serrail!</l>
            <l>Thee, like ſome God, the trembling crowd adore,</l>
            <l>Each man's thy ſlave, and Woman-kind thy Whore.</l>
            <l>Methinks I ſee thee underneath the ſhade</l>
            <l>Of golden Canopies ſupinely laid;</l>
            <l>Thy crowching ſlaves all ſilent as the night,</l>
            <l>But at thy nod all active as the light.</l>
            <l>Secure in ſolid Sloath thou there doſt raign,</l>
