            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16463:21"/>
and raise your dispart from the Muzle-ring as high as the Transome, so you have laid the mettall at the Muzle in a Horizontall line with the mettall at the base ring. But for nicenesse I would make another dispart upon the Trunnions, which may be thus done, Lay a peece of soft waxe upon the Trunnions, and let one raise it in height, I meane, make it longer or shorter, untill that the mettall at the top of the base ring, the waxe betweene the Trun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and the dispart on the muzle ring, be all three of a precise height, and in an equall straight line direct.</p>
               <p>If I were to fire a Peece of Ordnance at a marke, to gaine credit indeed thereby, I would have a twine silke thread that should touch both the tops of the Disparts, &amp; come to the upper part of the base ring upon the midst thereof, by which thread I would direct my Ordnance to the marke many degrees better.</p>
               <p>I could wish that the Disparts should be skrew'd into the muzle ring of the Peeces, that it might bee used to that purpose, and had alwayes in readinesse belonging to the same Gunne, and upon any occasion taken out at pleasure.</p>
               <p>Also I could advise the Sea-gunners upon some occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to use disparts betweene the Trunnions of their Peeces, made of a just heights of purpose to serve there: <note place="margin">

If the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme be unequall. Also if the Gunner shoot without a just dispart. If one wheele bee higher than another. If the naves be one longer and wider than the other. When one wheele meetes with a stone to stay it: or that one wheele reverseth in soft ground, and the other in hard. The Carriage or Trunnion eares are higher one than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If the cariage be too wide, so that the peece lyeth not fast therein, but starteth in her discharge. If the shot be not equally round, the winde, if vehement, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hurt. The slight ramming, leaving space betweene powder, wad, and bullet, may alter her course.
