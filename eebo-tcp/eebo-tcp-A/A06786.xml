            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat famous Philosopher <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> extolling the Persian Lawes, testified that their Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens from their infancie, were educated and taught not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or almost to imagine any thing but honest and iust. Which was the cause, as <hi>Gellius</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Draco</hi> a Citizen of Athens made their lawes so strict and seuere, that it was said They were written with Blood, and not with Inke: whereas on the other side the Law made by <hi>Solon</hi> was compared to a spiders web, which taketh the lesser flies and suffers the greater to escape and to breake the same. So that (euerie extreame being vicious) Reason requireth a Law not too cruell in her Frownes, nor too partiall in her Fauors. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these defects are incident to the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Merchant,</hi> because the same doth properly consist of the Custome of Merchants in the course of Trafficke, and is approued by all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the definition of <hi>Cicero, Vera Lex est recta Ratio, Natura congruens,
<pb facs="tcp:14410:5"/>
diffusa in Omnes, Constans, Sempiterna:</hi> True Law, is a right reason of nature agreeing therewith in all points, diffused and spread in all Nations consisting perpetually, whereby <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum</hi> is distinguished and distributed by <hi>Number, VVeight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> which shall bee made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant. For the maintenance of Trafficke and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is so pleasant, amiable and acceptable vnto all Princes and Potentates, that Kings haue beene and at this day are, of the Societie of Merchants: And many times (notwithstanding their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar differences and quarrells) they doe neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse agree in this course of Trade, because riches is the bright Starre, whose hight Trafficke takes to direct it selfe by, whereby Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales doe flourish, Merchants being the meanes and instruments to performe the same, to the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Illustration, and Benefit of their Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies and States. Questionlesse therefore, the State of a Merchant is of great dignitie and to bee cherished; for by them Countreys are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, Familiaritie betweene Nations is procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and politike Experience is attained. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I haue beene mooued (by long obseruation) to put the worthines of the <hi>Customarie Law of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> in plaine and compendious writing, by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted principles, familiar examples, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue reasons, without affectation of curious words, more than the grauitie of the Theame (in some places) did require.</p>
            <p>I haue intituled the Booke, according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb facs="tcp:14410:5"/>
name of <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> and not <hi>Ius Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorum</hi>; because it is a Customary Law approued by the authoritie of all Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, and not a Law established by the Soueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of any Prince, either in the first foundation or by continuance of time. And beginning with <hi>Time, Number, VVeight</hi> and <hi>Measure,</hi> I doe descend to the three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three parts accordingly, by comparing them to the <hi>Bodie, Soule,</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, namely, <hi>Commodities, Money,</hi> and <hi>Exchange</hi> for money by Billes of Exchanges. The first, as the <hi>Bodie,</hi> vpheld the World by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation and Bartring of Commodities, vntill mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was deuised to bee coyned. The second, as the <hi>Soule</hi> in the Bodie, did infuse life to Trafficke, by the meanes of Equalitie and Equitie preuenting aduantage betweene Buyers and Sellers. The third, as the <hi>Spirit</hi> and Facultie of the Soule, (being sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euerie where) corroborateth the Vitall Spirit of <hi>Trafficke,</hi> directing and controlling (by iust proportions) the prices and values of Commodities and Moneys. For euen as, Merchants are the Instrumentall Cause of <hi>Trade;</hi> euen so is the Exchange for Moneys, the Efficient Cause with vs in the course of Trafficke, and become Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant or ouerruling the price of Commodities and Moneys, as aforesaid. This is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested by three <hi>Paradoxes</hi> alluding to the said three Essentiall Parts of Commerce, which (for a Corrollarie) I haue added in the latter end of
<pb facs="tcp:14410:6"/>
this Booke, with such other worthy obseruations as in the first Chapter are declared. And euen as the roundnesse of the Globe of the World is composed of the Earth and Waters: So is the Bodie of <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> made and framed of the Merchants <hi>Customes,</hi> and the <hi>Sea-Lawes,</hi> which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volued together as the Seas and Earth. In the description whereof, I have vsed to make repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Materiall points, according as occasion did minister vnto me for to make application there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the better vnderstanding of the Iudicious Reader, which is the maine Scope that all Writers are to regard and care for. The meanes whereby the differences and controuersies happening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Merchants in the course of Trade are ended, is also declared, which most of all require Breuitie and Expedition, and had need of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie proceeding, as was inuented for the <hi>Common Law</hi> of the Realme of England, the due commendation whereof is added heereunto; shewing also how of the same there might bee made an <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Science,</hi> and what obseruation of other Lawes are concurring with ours, both in the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Law, and the lenitie of Equitie, most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant with the <hi>Law-Merchant,</hi> the knowledge whereof is of so great consequence, that without it all Temporall Lawes are not compleat, but imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

               <head>AN INDVCTION TO LEX MERCATORIA, OR THE LAW MERCHANT, AND THE ANTIQVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE THEREOF. CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen Almightie God had created man, good and a sociable creature, who could not so well liue alone, as other creatures sufficiently prouided (by nature) for their sustenance; and had reason assigned and giuen vnto him, aboue all the said creatures: yet all the meanes and faculties of his bodie and soule, were not sufficient to make him happie whilest he was alone. But necessitie did require a concourse of men helping one another to supplie (with a common strength) the said weakenesse; for the burden of the said necessitie was so weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and great, that one man alone was not able to manage the same. Then it came to passe, that by mutuall contribution of offices, euerie man did afford means according to his abilitie for the common good, so that those which were of a strong bodie did emploie their labour to get liuing and maintenance for themselues and others: And those which were endued with the best part of the soule, as Vnderstanding and Reason, did vndertake the most important matters, teaching men how to liue well, and informing them of their felicitie (which they iudged chiefely to consist in vertuous actions) endeauouring to make impression in the soule of man, of certaine good lawes for the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation thereof, with a reference of them to the first law engraffed in the soule of man, as a part of that diuine light, which was infused in him to know (in some measure of perfection) the good and euill,<note place="margin">Called by the Grecians <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derisis.</hi>
                  </note> and accordingly to receiue reward or punishment.</p>
               <p>As for the other and better part of informing and guiding the thoughts and affections of men to a supernaturall end, that, as surpas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the compasse of that lower spheare wherein I now moue, must be left vntouched by me, who here take for my obiect not the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:14410:9"/>
but the ciuill life of man and the meanes thereto conducing.</p>
               <p>Touching therefore the externall part. The mutuall contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of offices amongst men hath from the beginning continued both in labouring and manuring the naturall riches of the lands in corne and pasturage, as in the immediate children of our first father <hi>Adam,</hi> and in planting Vines, and making an extract of the iuyce of the fruit of them, as <hi>Noah.</hi> Which riches in matter and foundation naturall, and partly also in alteration and managing artificially, euery possessor not long after the beginning of the world seuerally inioyed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie: and hence did proceed a commerce, first, in reall enterchange and communication of things of the same or other kinds, but all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall commodities, as sheepe for sheepe, sheepe for corne, wine for oyle, &amp;c. betweene man and man, or nations and nations, according to number, weight, and measure, and after, to auoid confusion, by <hi>a commune pignus</hi> currant mutuall, which we call money, both by way of merchandizing;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi>
                  </note> the most ancient euidence hereof is <hi>Abrahams</hi> purchasing for money a field for buriall. The obseruation and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes whereof, was the beginning of the Law-Merchant, and that especially when mankind was propagated into an infinite number, and the domestiques or neere hand commodities were not sufficient for their sustenance in some countries, and in other countries were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aboundant: Then of necessitie followed the vse of trusting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing, and trading; first, on the Land in the maine Continent, and then extensiuely vpon the Seas, both for fishing and negotiation. Then did merchants trauell from countrey to countrey: So in the dayes of the Patriarke <hi>Iacob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen</hi> 37.27.</note> did the merchants Madianits in their iourney meete with the children of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and then <hi>Ioseph</hi> was carried by their meanes into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and sold to <hi>Potipher</hi> for the good of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and all his family. And then it was and proued to be true, (which experience hath confirmed) that <hi>Vita ciculis in societate posita est,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merchant a most antient law.</note> 
                  <hi>socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas autem in imperio &amp; commercio</hi>: So that it plainely appeareth, that the Law Merchant, may well be as ancient as any humane Law, and more ancient than any written Law. The very morall Law it selfe, as written by <hi>Moses,</hi> was long after the customary Law of Merchants, which hath so continued and beene daily augmented successiuely vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on new occasions, and was not altogether made in the first foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Lawes whereby the Common-weales of Israel (whose Lawes were vniformely made by <hi>Moses</hi> from God:) or those of Crete, Cybaris, Sparta, &amp; Carthage, by <hi>Minos, Charondas, Lycurgus,</hi> and <hi>Phalcas.</hi> Neuerthelesse, many Emperours and Kings haue alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the ending of differences, which happen betweene Merchants, to be done &amp; decided according to the Law-Merchant, That is to say, according to the Custome of Merchants; who by their trauels found the diuersitie of weights and measures, and the goodnesse and vse of commodities pleasing to all nations, whereby the superfluities of them were vented amongst them. <hi>Vt quod vspiam nascitur boni, id apud omnes affluat.</hi>

               <p>Euery man knoweth, that for Manners and Prescriptions, there is great diuersitie amongst all Nations: but for the Customes obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the course of trafficke and commerce, there is that sympathy, concordance, and agreement, which may bee said to bee of like condition to all people, diffused and spread by right reason, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of nature consisting perpetually. And these Customes are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly those obseruations which Merchants maintaine betweene themselues, and if these bee separated from the Law of Nations, The remainder of the said Law will consist but of few points.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Are not the Sea Lawes establisted to decide the controuersies and differences happening betweene Merchants and Marriners? And is it not conuenient for Merchants to know them?

True it is, that the Law may abolish Customes, but Customes cannot derogate from the Law, because Magistrates will see them executed at all times. Customes haue their strength by sufferance; but the Law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth by absolute authoritie of a Prince. And yet Customes are of no lesse power than a Law, and the difference consisteth most in the manner. <hi>Lex est cui omnes homines decet obedire propter multa &amp; varia, &amp; maxime quia omnis lex est inuentio quaedam &amp; donum Dei.</hi> All men ought to obey the Lawes, which are many and diuers, and chiefly because all Lawes are (as is it were) an inuention and a gift of God.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. A merchant ought first to know the science of Arithmeticke, and to obserue the daies and times in all his negotiations, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the yeare in all countries, and to calculate all things or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The seuerall weights and measures of all countries concerning all commodities, and the correspondence of them, that there may be to him in effect but <hi>vnum pondus, &amp; vna mensura,</hi> that is, one weight, and one measure.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:14410:11"/>3. The science of Geometry, and some inspection of Cosmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the Mathematickes, thereby to know the scituation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, with their distance and spaciousnesse: and the distinct domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Princes by land and by sea, with their iurisdiction and duties for fishing and otherwise.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To know the three Essential parts of traffick, being <hi>Commodities, Money,</hi> and <hi>Exchange for money by Billes</hi> of exchanges; vnder which all the traffique and trade is performed in all countries, or by some of them, because they are the causes of commerce, whereof the effects are buying and selling of commodities, receiuing and paying of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, and deliuering and taking of monyes by exchange, with their Adiuncts and Accidents in the said course of traffique.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To know also the goodnesse of the principall commodities of all countries, either superficially for colour and beautie; or substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially for qualitie and vse. As also the weight, finenesse, and valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moneyes of all countries, with the proportion betweene the gold and siluer, and the manner of exchanges made by billes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the imaginary moneyes inuented to make exchanges betweene countrey and countrey.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The customes vsed in the buying and selling of commodities for money or billes obligatorie, or by way of Commutation or Barter.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The deliuering of moneyes at interest, or vpon Botomary, or vpon liues, annuities, or pensions in nature of rent, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The fraighting and setting forth of Ships, making of Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parties, Billes of lading, Invoice, and Couenants and contracts. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the sea lawes, to decide all questions and controuersies which fall out betweene Merchants and Marriners, and owners of Ships.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The customes, subsidies, impositions, tribute, and tolles payed vpon all the commodities imported and exported, within the dominions of all Princes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The manner of making of Assurances vpon goods, ships, the persons of men, or any other things aduentured by sea or by land; and the customes obserued therein betweene nation and nations.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The keeping of Merchants accounts, by Debitor and Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and the calculation of the diuersities of money, whereby the said bookes of account are kept.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The authoritie and proceedings of Merchants Courts, or Priors and Consuls, to decide their differences according to equitie in places where they are kept, or any other lawes imperiall or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to some countries, whereby Merchants controuersies are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; with the course of attachments and sequestrations, or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and finall determinations by arbitrators, or iudiciall decrees in any Chauncery or Court of Equitie.</p>
               <p>All these (making the customarie law of Merchants) haue neuer beene written by any Ciuilian or Phylosopher,<note place="margin">The customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Law of Merchants.</note> nor for ought I know, of any author, as is conuenient for Merchants; whereupon I haue
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14410:12"/>
(with Gods assistance) resolued to handle the same compendiously and substantially in this booke, vpon fiftie yeeres obseruation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and experience. And albeit that the sea lawes are comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therein, whereby the proceedings might seem to be promiscuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, neuerthelesse the method is followed as neere as the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter could affoord, according to the said three Essentiall parts of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke, or the three Simples of commodities: Money, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of money by Bills of exchanges, as hereafter may appeare.</p>
               <p>And this Law of Merchants hitherto obserued in all countries, ought in regard of commerce, to be esteemed and held in reputation as the Law of twelue Tables was amongst the Romanes. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you shall find euery thing built vpon the foundations of Reason and Iustice: and knowing the foresaid twelue points, you shall be able to please your owne minde, and giue satisfaction of your suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie to others. For the saying is true, <hi>Melius est Ciuitatem, ab optima lege, quam ab optimo viro gubernari,</hi> It is better to gouerne a Citie by a good Law, than by a good man. And it is better for a man to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Reason, than by his owne Reason to seeke to rule others.</p>
               <p>Finally, to giue satisfaction to the learned and judicious, I haue abstracted the obseruations of the learned in the Ciuile Lawes, vpon all the precedent points, and added them vnto the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, distinctly from the Customes of Merchants; vsing the ordinary name of Ciuilians in generall, without naming any particular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to auoid ambiguitie and vncertaintie in the Contents of this Booke, diuided into three parts, according to the said three Essentiall parts of Trafficke.</p>

                  <p>Now forasmuch as the odd six houres, could not conueniently bee brought to account euerie yeare: hee ordained that euerie fourth yeare one day should bee added to February, because foure times six houres maketh vp a whole day of foure and twentie houres, and the yeare wherein this odde day falleth,<note place="margin">The Leape yeare.</note> wee call com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Leape yeare, hauing three hundred sixtie six dayes.

                     </note> The which places of the Sunne are now changed and sliden backe in the Iulian Kalender, from the said obseruation of the Spring <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctium,</hi> as also from the Haruest <hi>Equinoctium</hi> (being about the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie six of September) the longest day then falling out the twentie fiue of Iune, grounded vpon this reason of preuention of the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall to the twelfth, eleuenth, and tenth dayes of the said moneths, and the thirteenth and fourteenth of September: But the chiefe cause proceedeth by reason that <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> did reckon the yeare to continue three hundred sixtie fiue dayes, and six houres; which is more than the iust Astronomers calculation by tenne minutes of an houre, and fortie foure seconds, accounting sixty minutes to an houre, and sixtie seconds to a minute: so that the yeare truely containeth three hundred sixtie fiue dayes, fiue houres, fortie nine minutes,<note place="margin">The difference as the account of yeares, for the errour.</note> and sixteene seconds, as is before declared, which difference in the space of one hundred thirtie foure years or thereabouts, maketh one whole day; and in the space of one thousand six hundred sixtie foure yeares,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14410:16"/>
being the time that the Iulian Kalender was set forth, vntill the last yeare, it commeth to twelue dayes, twentie two houres, fortie mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, and twentie fiue seconds.</p>
                  <p>For this cause sundry learned men haue heretofore desired that the same may bee reformed, to auoid inconueniences, and to haue a true account of yeares and dayes. And the matter was propounded to diuers generall Councells, but tooke no effect, till now of late yeares, by meanes of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, in the yeare 1582, and then it was permitted to one <hi>Aloysius Lilius,</hi> (professor in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicke Astrologie) to set downe this long desired Reformation; who being resolued to doe the same exactly by true account, was hindered by the Clergie, for they would not agree that the same should be drawne backe any further than to the time of the Nicene Councell, which was in the yeare 328: and hereupon hee brought the reckoning backe only ten daies, &amp; caused the fifteenth day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember to bee called the twentie fiue day,<note place="margin">Alteration of tenne dayes, and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences.</note> which is but obserued in some places, and brought great controuersie in diuers countries: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day of the Natiuitie of Christ, and other Festiuall dayes, and also dayes of keeping of Faires and Markets, are changed and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den tenne dayes before the accustomed time. And Merchants and others in making their Contracts and Obligations are often disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their dayes of payment, with diuers other inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.</p>
                  <p>Whereas men of true iudgement, might haue made this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Is it by the addition of Time, growing by certaine minutes and seconds euery yeare, arising to one whole day euery fourth yeare, in the moneth of February? Then, as it is increased thereby thirteene dayes in one thousand six hundred sixty foure yeares, it may by the same Rule decrease so much in few yeares,<note place="margin">A true and good reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Kalender.</note> by leauing out, and suspending that one day, which is so added, vntil it come to his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution and calculation of the Iulian Kalender; which may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in fiftie two yeares, beginning from the yeare 1620, being Leape yeare, and leauing out thirteene dayes, which is little more than one houre in the said, and is no perceptable difference; and after the said fiftie two yeares expired, to adde the said day againe, and there will not increase any one day more, but in one hundred thirtie foure yeares. And all the yearely obseruations may be accommodated accordingly.</p>
                  <p>I made an exact Table heereof, in the yeare 1604, whereby the day of the Natiuitie of our Sauiour fell out againe to bee the shortest day of the yeare. This Table was shewed vnto the Kings Maiestie of Great Brittaine (as I was informed) and howsoeuer pleasing, yet for some causes to mee vnknowne not held fit to bee established.</p>

And to shew their meaning more certainely, they will demonstrate the same by their fingers, still making signes as they speake: and when they will reckon twentie, they will hold downe both their hands to their feet, shewing all their fingers and toes; and as the number is greater, so will they double the signe. And when they appoint or promise any thing at a limited time, they will deliuer a little bundle of stickes, equall to the number of daies or moones that they appoint, and will themselues keepe another bundle of the like number; and to obserue their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time, they will euerie day, or moone, take away a sticke, and when they haue taken away all, then they know that the time of their appointment is come, and will accordingly performe their promise, which may be a president to many Christians.</p>
               <p>Thus much may suffice to haue noted concerning Number, and the coherence thereof with Time.

                  </head>
                  <p>TO weigh with few peeces or weights, take weights of augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation double, namely 1 <abbr>ll</abbr>, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64, making toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 127 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and with these 7 peeces you may weigh all things vntill 127 <abbr>ll</abbr>: and with treble augmentations, as 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243, and 729 <abbr>ll</abbr>, vntill 1093 <abbr>ll</abbr>. But the double augmentation is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for Germanie and England where the Centener of 112 <abbr>ll</abbr> is vsed.</p>
                  <p>There must be an especiall regard had concerning the Beames or Ballances for the iustifying of them: If it be an yron Beame trie the same emptie, and afterwards loaden with equall weights; and if it be a wooden Beame, it happeneth many times that the ends are not euen, or that the yrons about the ends are remoued more on the one side than the other; therefore trie the said Beame both emptie and loaden, and you may find a great difference in weight, which with knocking in the yron with a hammer may be remedied.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the weight of Antuerpe (whereupon all the aforesaid correspondencies are calculated) is bigger than the weight of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don foure vpon the hundreth, which may be thought a benefit: the same is not so to be accounted, because of the Custome of 4 <hi>pro cento</hi> for Trett, allowed betweene the buyer and the seller, at London, which taketh away the benefit. This Trett is taken by diuiding your

By meanes whereof the Testators wealth was vnknowne, and when hee gaue more than the proportion Arithmeticall came vnto, the order was to reduce the same to the pound of 288 Scruples, by diminution of euery mans rate accordingly.

                  <p>THe differences of the corne measures are verie necessarie to be knowne of all merchants and masters of ships, letting thereupon their ships to fraight; the Last (which is two Tunnes lading) being the ground-worke of it, vsed in all the harbors of the sea coasts diuersly. Foure and twentie small Barrels are accounted for a Last, as herring Barrels, being 18 beere Barrels, or 18 Ames of Antuerpe, which are three Tunnes of wine; and yet we reckon two Tunnes of wine for a Last, for two Tunnes of wine weigh the weight of a Last of corne, that is to say, one hoghead 500 <abbr>ll</abbr>, the 2 Tunnes 4000 <abbr>ll</abbr>

But the corne is laden Ioose, and filleth the roome full. One pound of wheate containeth about 9 thousand graines of wheat; and the Last of 4300 <abbr>ll</abbr>, is so many nine thousand graines in a Last. The corne measure most knowne is in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <hi>Modius,</hi> a measure, in Germanie a <hi>Molder,</hi> in the Low-countries a <hi>Mudde,</hi> in France <hi>Muy:</hi> and the Last differing in so many places, it is not amisse to account the weight of a Last of wheat from 4200 to 4800 <abbr>ll</abbr>, the Last of Rie from 4000 to 4200 <abbr>ll</abbr>, the Last of Barley from 3000 to 3400 <abbr>ll</abbr>: Oats are yet lighter, which is the cause that the Oats measure is made bigger to counteruaile the weight.

                  <p>It is also to be obserued, that the difference of corne measure is of 6 vpon 7, also 3 to 4, and 2 to 3, and in some places one wil make two.

The propertie of all colours is to bee subiect to the ayre and Sunne, and all of them doe vanish; but in the blacke it is least seene, and is also the surest, hauing his ground vpon the blew; so it bee a blew substantiall of Woad or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico, which is the extraction of the Herbe <hi>Glaustum,</hi> or <hi>Anill,</hi> in the East and West Indies like vnto our greene Woad; but the leaues of it are round and not long, howbeit the climate and ground make the maine difference.</p>
                  <p>There was of late yeares, two great controuersies at the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Table: the one concerning the dying of Black-silke,<note place="margin">Dying of Blacke silke.</note> called London Dye; the other concerning the vse of Log-wood, being a false glorious colour.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the London dye of Silke it was prooued, that one pound of 16 ounces was by sophistications of additements augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to 32 ounces, and fortie ounces: which fraud commeth to passe, by reason of the gummy matter or substance whereof the silke was not purged for blacke dye, as it is in colours, whereby it made such an increase in weight. To preuent this abuse, a Corporation of Silke-men were made; and neuerthelesse, forasmuch that a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble increase of 8 ounces, doth looke fairer, and can bee better vsed, there remained a tolleration of this increase in London. The way to find out the fraud was by controlling the weight by measure, which by convulsion becommeth contracted: so that if the silke being purged decreaseth 16 ounces to 13 and 12, will mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately haue afterwards some increase; then this silke being mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured by the yard in Skeanes, and marked with Leads, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to the Dyar, must bee receiued accordingly without such contraction and decrease of length, by the increase of weight, these two controlling each other.</p>
                  <p>The indifferent course therefore, is the golden meane;<note place="margin">Dying by the helpe of Log<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</note> so is it done concerning Log-wood, being good cheape and fit for dying of a faire colour, although vanishing, seruing for the poore people, wearing couse Stuffe, or vsing things of small value: that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the vse of it was prohibited, as well as the importati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet now of late there is a competent quantity admitted to be vsed by Letters Pattent, and Proclamation.</p>

               <p>For some Merchants do negotiate all for Commodities, others all for Money, or Exchanges, or for all three or any of them which yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them most benefit and gaine: and herein is their particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or <hi>Priuatum Commodam,</hi> more respected than the generall good of the common-wealth, whereby corruptible and vnnecessarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are giuen for Staple wares and durable commodities, to the impouerishing of kingdomes and common-weales. And not only is this commutation or exchange abused in kind, but also in the price, paying too deere for the one, and selling the other too good cheape: whereby commeth an ouer-ballancing of Commodities in price and qualitie, and not in quantitie; whereby in effect,<note place="margin">Ouer-ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> Moneys are giuen to boot, and as it were ouer and aboue the reasonable estimation of things; and herein is the course of Exchanges by Bills predominant, and ouer-ruling both the course of Commodities, and Money, as shall be at large demonstrated hereafter.</p>

               <p>The second, as the <hi>Soule</hi> in the Bodie, did infuse life to trafficke, by the means of Equalitie and Equitie, preuenting aduantage between buyers and sellers.</p>
               <p>The third, as the <hi>Spirit</hi> and facultie of the Soule (being seated eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where) corroborateth the vitall Spirit of trafficke, directing and controlling (by iust proportions) the prices and values of Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities and Moneys.</p>
               <p>True it is, that this Spirit and facultie of the Soule, namely the <hi>Exchange for Money,</hi> taketh his originall from the Soule, which giueth life to the bodie of trafficke; that is to say, The exchange for Moneys by Bills of Exchanges, is grounded vpon Moneys, and Moneys were inuented and made by common consent to be the rule and square to set a price vnto all things, and the right and true judges of them; and is therefore called <hi>Publica Mensura,</hi>

But since the manner of Exchange was inuented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene nations and nations, or countrie and countries, Moneys did onely remaine the publicke measure within the realmes or common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales of euerie countrie, betweene man and man, according to the valuation of Princes and States imposed vpon Moneys: and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of Moneys by Bills became <hi>Publica Mensura</hi> betweene vs and forreine nations, and between all nations in the course of commerce,<note place="margin">Exchange for Moneys the publicke mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure betweene nations.</note> according to which Exchangeal Commodities are bought and sold. And albeit that the aboundance or quantitie of Commodities, and the many or few buyers, or the scarcitie of Commodities, causeth
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:14410:38"/>
the prices of Commodities to rise and fall; and likewise that plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Money maketh things deere, and scarcitie of Money maketh them good cheape, as a propertie inherent vnto Money as a true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: yet we must obserue in true order, That both Commodities and Money are Passiue,<note place="margin">Commodities and Mony are things passiue.</note> since th'exchange was inuented, which is only Actiue, and that in countries where all the essentiall parts of trafficke are vsed. But howsoeuer, the Maxime is to be obserued in the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the said ouer-ballancing of Commodities in price and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. <hi>Marcus Cato</hi> therefore saieth aduisedly:

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14410:40"/>
which caused the King to enter into consideration of the aforesaid three Essentiall Parts of Trafficke, namely, Commodities, Money, and Exchange for Money by Bills of Exchange.</p>
               <p>And ingeniously perceiuing, that the vitall spirit of trafficke did consist in the matter of exchange for monyes, because the same is the publike measure betweene Nation and Nations, and that gaine was the radicall moisture of commerce, which had his effectuall power in Exchanges: his Maiestie thought good to call diuers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to the consultation of this businesse (being within their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to heare their opinion how to remedy the said inconuenience.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three manner of Merchants.</note>Whereupon his Highnesse obserued three manner of Merchants: The first (which were the greatest number) were ignorant of the fundamentall reasons of Exchanges, and being carried with the streame, neuer tooke notice of it, but were guided therein by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Brokers of Exchanges, according to the rule of forraine Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, The second sort of Merchants, were those that did altogether practise to make a benefit by Exchanges and Transportations of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and neuer did deale in Commodities at home or beyond the Seas, and these would not confesse that there was any abuse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by exchange. The third sort of Merchants (being the smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest number) were men of wisedome and experience, and yet they found the matter of Exchange to bee a mysterie, vntill examination of the properties thereof, and then (like good Patriots) they tooke a care for the welfare of the Common-wealth. The first sort, he did not regard because of their ignorance: The socond sort he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vnto Vinteners,<note place="margin">Offenders vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to make Lawes.</note> who are not fit to be called to be Assistants in making of Lawes against drunkennesse, and so reiected them: But the third sort hee did imbrace as worthie Counsellors to reforme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses; and some of these were of opinion, that by reason of the Base Money coyned in the latter end of the reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8, al the forrain commodities were sold deerer, which made afterwards the Commodities of the Realme to rise at the Farmers and Tenants hands, and that the same was made deerer through plenty of Money and Bullion,<note place="margin">Inhaunsing of Siluer altereth the price of things.</note> which came from the West Indies; and especially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause an ounce of Siluer was inhaunced by the said King, from fortie pence, to fortie fiue pence, and afterwards in processe of time was valued at threescore pence, and that the operation of the said alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration doth still continue. Others said, that the prizes of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing risen, was of no great moment, because it was by denomination, and not really; for that which was called fortie before, was now ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med threescore, according to the coynes of Siluer valued by the ounce, as aforesaid. But the wiser sort did goe further, and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prizes risen of forraine Commodities, farre more than the prizes of our home Commodities, they did acknowledge, that there was an ouer-ballancing of commodities, and found that the course of Exchange for Moneys was the efficient cause thereof: For they did obserue, that as the elements are ioined by Symbolization, the aire to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14410:40"/>
the fire by warmenesse, the water to the aire by moysture, the earth to the water by coldnesse; So is Exchange ioyned to Monyes, and Monys to Commodities by their proper qualities and effects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it did appeare vnto them;</p>
               <p>First, that our Monie being vndervalued in Exchange, causeth the price of our home Commodities to be abated, and to bee sold better cheape in forraine parts, and is also the cause that our Monyes are exported.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Monyes being transported, taketh away the liuely course of trafficke of our said Commodities, and causeth young Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to runne by Exchanges vpon Billes to maintaine their Trade, paying great Interest for money, which they cannot take vp by their single Bond, as they can doe by Bill, taking vp the same by Exchange without Sureties.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this causeth young Merchants and others to make rash sales of their Commodities beyond the Seas, to pay their Billes of Exchanges, whereby they ouerthrow the Markets of others, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> make them sell better cheape. So on the contrarie, the coynes being ouervalued in exchange, and also inhaunced beyond the Seas, caused the price of forraine Commodities to increase, more than our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Commodities; and our Merchants are compelled (of course) to make returne thereby, because they cannot import those ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued monyes, but to their exceeding great losse. And by exchange they find few Takers, vnlesse it be our young Merchants, which doe consume their estates by Exchanges, and Rechanges. For of the said three Essentiall parts of Trafficke,<note place="margin">Causes of the ouerballance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</note> we haue but the vse of one (as they obserued) which is the buying of forraine Commodities to make returnes, increasing therein the consumption of the said wares, and not our owne monyes remaining hereby plentifull beyond the Seas; the rather for that Bills of debt are (as readie money) passing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man causeth with them a liuely course of Trade, whereby their Commodities are aduanced in price and sale; neither are they compelled to sell them but at their price, because they find money at interest, at fiue and six in the hundreth.</p>
               <p>This plentie of money is daily increased by our Merchants tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Spaine and all others, who doe diuert the Royalls of Spaine from vs, because of the inhaunsing of monyes beyond the Seas, where they haue 25 vpon the hundreth gaine, when with vs they make but 10 ꝑ cent.</p>
               <p>This gaine is practised by exchange, and would otherwise bee but imaginarie, as shall be declared hereafter; whereby we shall find that the said Exchange is still predominant, and ouerruling the Monyes and Commodities.</p>

                     <hi>Summa totalis</hi> of the inhabited parts of the World, six Milliars, six hundreth and twentie three Millions, and seuen tenne thousand Acres of Land, <hi>Vt supra.</hi>

                  <p>THE vse of this description, to know the bignesse of one Countrey compared vnto another Countrey, is, for example: England containeth twentie nine Measures and odde; Bohemia containing seuen Measures and odde, is the fourth part of England, or thereabouts.</p>
                  <p>The seuenteene Prouinces of the Low Countryes, being tenne Measures and odde, is the third part of England, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
                  <p>The Monarchy of Great Brittaine, being fortie foure Measures and odd, is as big as all Italy, and the fiue Ilands of Sicilia, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus, Candia, Corsica, and Sardignia, and is also more populous. And so for all other Countryes; insomuch that England onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining twentie nine of those Measures, or Millions, 568 thousand Acres of ground; if wee deduct the fiue Millions, and 568 thousand Acres for wilde &amp; waste grounds and High-wayes,<note place="margin">One penny an Acre, is one hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds in England.</note> there will remain foure and twentie Millions of Acres, which at one penny an Acre, amounteth to one hundreth thousand pounds, a matter little sensible.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit that the aforesaid Doctors of the Ciuile Law haue declared that there be but three kind of bodies of things, namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Quod continetur vno spiritu, vt homo, lapis &amp;c.</hi> which is contained of one spirit, as man and a stone, or such like.</p>
               <p n="2">2 <hi>Quod ex pluribus inter se, coherentibus constat, vt edificium nauis &amp;c.</hi> which consisteth of many things ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a building, a ship &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Quod ex distantibus constat, vt corpora vno nomine subiecta, veluti popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, legio, grex, &amp;c.</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisteth of distant things, as many bodies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one name, a People, a Legion, a Flock, and the like. Yet this difini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not compleat, concerning the bodie of trafficke and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, consisting of Bodie, Soule, and Spirit, namely Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, Mony, and exchange of Mony by Bills of Exchanges, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, which are to be described in order. And because Commodities, like vnto the Bodie, vpheld the world at the first by way of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and bartering of them according to necessitie and vsefulnesse: Therefore may it bee thought conuenient to set downe in this place, the particular commodities of all Countries, and (of some of them) their values and estimation, by meanes whereof Trafficke and Trade is established and maintained, that thereupon wee may proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p>Verely in the estate of Innocency all things were common; but alas this communitie of things indured but a while, and now by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of our naturall corruption, and pronenesse to wrong one another, there is an absolute necessitie of proprietie and seuerall possession, which is consonant to the Law of God, as well as founded vpon the Law of man, and consent of Nations; it being the voyce of secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darie Nature: This is my house, this is my towne, and this is my seruant, &amp;c. whereby <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum</hi> is distinguished.</p>
               <p>The reuocation of this communion of things, is the nerues and bond of humane Societie, and the mother of labour and diligence. Who would Till the ground if he hoped not to taste of the crop of it? Surely all would be waste and desolate, if men were to plant and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:14410:43"/>
build for euery body, that is nobody. Wee see by experience, that the strongest would depriue others of the vse of things, vnlesse the law did interpose her authoritie, which is two fold, namely <hi>Paterna &amp; Politica</hi> effected by the fathers of families, and magistrates. And herein is no other equalitie to be found concerning things, but a mutuall voluntarie estimation of them according to the vse and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe of the said things. And the prouerbe is true, That goods held in common, are (as it were) no bodies goods, and not manured as they ought to be, whereupon <hi>Plato</hi> in his second Common-wealth (vpon better consideration) did reuoke his former opinion of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of goods, and vsed to say, That no man was a gayner but another became a looser, which had an ouer great regard to the propertie of goods, and if there were no propertie of goods, all trafficke would cease.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, the Equalitie and Equitie in the course of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce must be obserued, to auoid the ouerballancing of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as in the precedent Chapter is mentioned, which requireth a third consideration of an other kind of equalitie. For as we haue noted with <hi>Aristotle,</hi> Riches is either Naturall, or Artificiall.</p>
               <p>The Naturall riches, as Lands, Vines, Forrests, Meddowes, and the like.</p>
               <p>The Artificiall, as Money, Gold, Siluer, Cloth, and all other Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures and houshold Stuffe.</p>
               <p>Now as this Artificiall riches is proceeding of the Naturall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and that both these doe receiue their price and estimation by money: So reason requireth a certaine equalitie betweene them, which wee find to bee defectiue, which is concerning the price of lands.</p>
               <p>To prooue our Assertion, wee can hardly make this inequalitie appeare, albeit wee doe find the want of the treasure transported from vs into the parts beyond the Seas. For it befalleth vnto vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning monyes and wealth, as it doth to a Generall of a Campe of ten thousand supposed armed men, whereof muster being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at seuerall times, and vpon seuerall dayes, all of them are found to bee armed, because they lend their Armour to each other: whereas, if they were all mustred in a day, and at one instant, a great part of them would bee found to want Armour. So the like want of monyes and wealth would be found if rich men were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, for their personall estates vpon any vrgent occasion. And now let vs examine the commodities of all countries, beginning from the East and ending in the West.</p>

As if the Diamond of a Carrat should rise 20 in the hundreth, then all the other sorts accordingly; and so also in the falling of the price by greater quantities.</p>
                  <p>Diamonds of yellow water (which giue lustre extraordinarily by candle-light) are more in request in Germanie and some places in Italie, where the browne Diamonds are also desired. But in England &amp; France they are worth ⅓ part lesse (which is according to the aboue said prices that Diamonds are now worth with vs also.) The Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of a full Carrat being a perfect Table, and yellow, is worth 20 <abbr>ll</abbr> sterling.</p>
                  <p>The pointed Diamonds, which (in regard of their natural propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hauing lesse wast in the cutting) heretofore sold better cheape than the Table Diamonds, are now deerer and more esteemed.</p>

                  <p>Pearles of a Carratt are worth now ten shillings, and the other sorts vnder the same, or aboue it, accordingly. I had 1600 of a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratt, which were sold for 9 <hi>ss</hi> and 900 of two Carrats, sold for 36 shillings, and many faire pendants, whereof no price can be made in certaintie, they must haue the due proportion of a Peare, and be of excellent water.</p>
                  <p>Yellow Pearle, is not worth halfe the price of the East India browne Pearle, albeit they be a little helped to make them whiter, for the Prouerb is true, <hi>Quod natura dedit, nemo tollere potest</hi>; but if they be yellow accidentally, then they will become very faire by the remedie following.</p>
                  <p>Take two ounces of white Argall or Tartar, and one ounce of Mercurie sublimate, and 1 ½ ounce of Allome, put them together into a cleane pipkin or leaded pot, poure vpon it the best <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> you can get, and bind your pearles into a cleane clout, and hang them in the pot, and so let them stand ouer the fire one houre, not touching any part of the pot, and they will be faire and white.</p>
                  <p>If they be great round Pearles they may be scaled, for naturally the Pearle is like vnto an Onyon, scaling one vpon another. I remember that a friend of my acquaintance, called <hi>Mounsieur Hellman</hi> told mee many yeares since, that during the minoritie of <hi>Philip</hi> the third, late King of Spaine, he shewed vnto him two excellent great round Pearles, which he valued at ten thousand ducatts, or three thousand pounds: which the young Prince tooke in his hands, saying, <hi>Bocado por vn Roy</hi> (A morsell for a King) and swallowed them downe one after another. The Merchant made account to receiue money for his Pearles, but hee could not, and was glad within two dayes after to take his Pearles againe, which by the heat of the stomacke were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come yellow; comming to Antuerp, a certaine Iew vndertooke to take off the vpper scale, and so they were exceeding faire againe, but diminished: they were afterwards sold to the great Turke for aboue two thousand pounds starling.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for Orientall and Occidentall Pearles, where note that the weight for Pearles in Seuill, is lesser than the weight of Lisborne by eight in the hundreth: the climate in the East is hotter
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14410:48"/>
than in the West, and the water more faltish, which causeth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of colours.</p>
                  <p>In Scotland are many times found prettie store of Pearles, and the climate being colder, maketh the colour of them to be dimme, albeit I haue seene some very faire, and pendants also. The small Pearle is also very wholesome in medicinable Potions.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of Commutation or Bartring of Commodities.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue compared Commodities vnto the bodie of trafficke, which did vphold the world by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation and Bartring of Commodites before money was deuised to be coined, whereof we are now to intreate. For commutation, barter, or trucke of Commodities was first effected <hi>in specie,</hi> by deliuering one Commoditie for another ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commodious and behoofull vse of man; so that one did deliuer so many measures of Corne for so many measures of Salt, as was agreed vpon; another so many pound of Wooll against so many pound of Pepper, Sugar, or other commodities; an other so many peeces of such a commodity for such a commodity; or so many Hides for one barre of Yron, or so many peeces of Siluer vncoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but weighed and exchanged, as yet is vsed in some places of America, Barbarie and Guynea, and other countries. This may be properly called an exchange of commodities, or rather a permutation of commodities; albeit the Ciuilians, when there is scarcitie of Gold and Siluer in a countrie, and when the commodities in value sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the money paied for them, they do call that a permutation, and denie the same to be an emption by their distinctions; how soeuer, this manner of commutation or barter was made by number, weight and measure of commodities in kind: but moneys being inuented and valued by the publicke authoritie of princes according to their seuerall stampes or coyne, and by common consent made <hi>Publicae Mensura,</hi> or the publicke measure to set a price vpon euerie thing. This commutation, barter, or exchange of commodities for commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, was, and is (since that time) made according to the rule of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whereby euerie man setting a price vnto his commoditie, doth sell and barter the same as he can, with a respect of the necessarie vse or request had of the commoditie, and of the qualitie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the same, being either corruptible commodities, or staple wares more durable, whereby all mettals and minerals came into greater estimation, and the purest was most valued and esteemed, euen in the verie trafficke by commutation when moneys were not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14410:50"/>
coyned, and commodities were dispersed by commerce betweene nations by an interchangeable course, supplying each others occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and necessities, according to the vse of commodities.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Commutatio negotiatiua.</hi>
                  </note>This commutation is called <hi>Negotiatiua,</hi> because things are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted for to sell againe by way of negotiation, which is either by selling or deliuering commodities for commodities <hi>in specie,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said; or by the rule of money in buying and selling the same at a price agreed or concluded vpon betwene the parties contracting for the same: In the estimation whereof we are to haue a due consideration, That riches being naturall and artificiall, and both valued by money, there is required a certaine equalitie in the said estimation, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the consideration betweene this naturall and artificiall ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>And as there are three temporall things for the behoofe of man, namely Food, Houses, and Apparel: so must we account all the things seruing thereunto accordingly, and the scarcitie or plentie of those things also according to the vse of them; hauing alwaies a regard and care not to pay too much for the things seruing for the bellie, (es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially such as in some sort may be spared or forborne) and not to sell too good cheape the things seruing for the backe, or in effect to barter them for superfluous things, alwaies admitting ciuilitie (which albeit that men account that ciuile, which is according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of euerie countrie as the prouerbe is, countries fashion, countries honour:) yet reason must rule herein, with a due consideration of Gods good creatures and gifts, which cannot be done without an vnfatigable industrie, both in discerning the varietie of them, and in obseruing their infinit number and pure creation; in which regard pretious things haue their estimation, so that the same ciuilitie must be reduced to the good of the common-wealth, and for the vphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the same, liuing together in christian societie, giuing so farre place vnto reason, that euerie man may endeauour himselfe for the preseruation of the weale publike, and conceiue generally, that other nations (not indued with so much reason) are alwaies inferiour vnto vs in that regard, euen considering all men alike in an estate of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke gouernment. Who seeth not then that without any cause of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, some men doe wonder at the simplicitie of Brasilians, West-India, and other nations, as they of Barbarie, or Africa, in giuing the good commodities of their countries, yea Gold, Siluer, and pretious things, for Beades, Bels, Kniues, Looking-Glasses, and such toyes and trifles? when wee our selues commit the same, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our staple wares for Tobacco, Orenges, and other corruptible smoaking things, or superfluous commodities bought at deere rates, to the losse of the common-wealth: whereby commeth an ouer-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing of foreine commodities with our home commodities, which draweth away our treasure and readie moneys to the incredible losse and impouerishing of the realme.</p>
               <p>This commutation <hi>negotiatiua</hi> ought to be the studie of Polititians
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14410:50"/>
or States-men, as a principall matter of State for the preseruation and augmentation of the wealth of their Common-weales or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, where they sit to direct the ship of trafficke; as skilfull Pilots obseruing all accidents which happen to the three essentiall parts of trade and commerce alreadie declared, and to be amplified in our description of this customarie Law of Merchants.</p>
               <p>This Studie consisteth in two points, namely in the consideration of the value of the things commuted or bartered betweene coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and countrie, according to their vse; and in the charges of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of those things, and the manufacture of other things exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the same by way of trafficke and commerce.</p>
               <p>Worthie of commendation was the Maior of Carmarthen towne in Wales,<note place="margin">The due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Maior of Carmarthen.</note> who (perceiuing the Spaniards to import Oranges and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and to sell them continually for readie money, and to export the same without buying any of their countrie commodities being Staple wares, and theirs verie corruptible and many times halfe rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) caused a proclamation to be made, That no man (for the space of three daies) should buy any of those Oranges and Lemons: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that time they were all spoiled, and so the Spaniard went home by weeping crosse, and afterwards sold his Oranges better cheape, and bought commodities for his returne.</p>
               <p>Touching the price of manufactures, the labour and charges of workemen is to be considered on either side, and what the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie may be in the wearing or vse thereof, and to what purpose or profit the remainder may be imployed. As for example, If silke Lace be imported, after the wearing it is nothing worth: If Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice Gold and Siluer be imported, there will remaine about the one halfe in Siluer, albeit the same be sold deere vnto vs; which is verie tollerable, if other of our manufactures, or Cloth, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for the same, whereby the people are set on worke to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a common societie. But when Tabacco is imported,<note place="margin">Hinderances by Tabacco &amp;c.</note> and leaueth nothing but smoake, which is not onely bought at deere rates, and doth hinder importation of Bullion or Ryals of Plate; but is also the cause that our home commodities, as Cloth, Bayes, Perpetuanoes, and Sayes, are sold to losse by the buyers of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco; which causeth the price of our commodities to be abated, and the realme to loose aboue fortie thousand pounds yearely by this negotiation of barter: States-men therefore might in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, take some course that euerie man should not make employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Tabacco in Spaine, or beyond the seas, but that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed buyers thereof should make ouer so much money by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change as were needfull for a competent quantitie, to be proued by good and true certificate that the same hath beene performed accordingly.</p>
               <p>On the other side if Venice Gold and Siluer thred, Spangles, and Oes, shall be thought conuenient to be made in England; then (to procure the Siluer in plates cut or vncut to be brought ouer of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14410:51"/>
sterling Standard, or so much in Bullion as may make the quantitie required) may be thought expedient, if (in regard of ciuile reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdome) we will not prohibit the importation of it by course of trafficke.</p>
               <p>But considering that after wearing the same with reputation, it leaueth almost the one halfe of his value. There is no pregnant cause to find so much fault with it, as some men do. The like consideration is to be had for such manufactures, whereof the verie peeces or rags may be vsed to some purpose, as of Linnen to make white paper, of fishers nets to make browne paper, of skins to make glew, of beere leeze to make <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>And here we may not omit how Almightie God by his diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence ruleth many times this negotiating commutation, when the haruest of Corne faileth in one countrie, and is prosperous in another countrie, whereby this trade of barter by the rule of Mony, doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie much augment, and the price of Corne becommeth to be much deerer: Albeit the price be reasonable, considering the Fermer may by the cheapnes thereof be made vnable to pay his rent. And God, who doth euerie thing for the best, sheweth vnto vs how one nation may haue need and occasion to vse the help and meanes of other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and which is more admirable to be noted, God in the permitting of it, may haue some other work in hand to manifest his glorie, or to relieue his children by vnexpected meanes; As the sending of the children of <hi>Iacob</hi> into Aegypt for the want of Corne to maintaine themselues, doth demonstrate vnto vs. The like may be applyed for Wines, Salt, and other commodities for the sustenance of man, which (although they be corruptible commodities) may, contrarie to our former assertion (by this accidentall or casuall extremitie) be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in estimation of the Staple commodities, which are durable, and become valued only by Gold &amp; Siluer, which is the cause that Spaine and Portugall being subiect to haue dearth of Corne, do permit the exportation of Siluer and Gold in returne of the prouenue of it and other victuals,<note place="margin">Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bartered for Corne and Victuals.</note> whereby we find that those countries, by reason of the West-Indian treasure, being from time to time prouided with Siluer and Gold coine, are neuerthelesse most destitute of the same, bartring as it were in effect, their Siluer and Gold for Corne and other proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; and, hauing their countries stored with meere copper Moneys. This treasure passeth from them as if it were conueyed by a channel: and (because of the aboundance of their said Copper moneys) is not so sensible vnto them, as it is vnto other countries which haue not the vse of the like Copper moneys, which is diuers waies to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, especially in the time of wars, when moneys are called to be the sinewes thereof, or <hi>Nervi Bellorum,</hi> which by meere Copper moneys can neuer be vnderstood, howsoeuer necessarie (in some measure) for the commutation of pettie bargaines and contracts, whereof more hereafter in handling the matter of Moneys.</p>
               <p>To make application of this negotiating co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mutation in the price of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14410:51"/>
Commodities, it is to bee prooued by diuers ancient Merchants bookes, that within the age of a man, or seuentie yeares, the price of forraine Commodities with vs is farre more risen than the price of our home Commodities; which by way of Antithesis is worthy the obseruation.</p>
               <p>Redding colour, and other mingled colour Clothes, did cost 9 <abbr>ll</abbr> the Cloth then, when Blacke Veluets were sold at 10 shillings the yeard; and now the said sort of Clothes are sold but for 11 <abbr>ll</abbr> and 12 <abbr>ll</abbr> the Cloth, and Veluets at 26 shillings the yeard.</p>

               <p>Concerning the particular barter or truck with Merchants, euery man doth know who dealeth therein,<note place="margin">Particular barters.</note> that this is done with such dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie, to take aduantage in the price of their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities one against the other, that commonly either the one or the other findeth himself agreeued: For the ouerreaching therein, is accounted an vsuall and ordinarie practise, and the commodities thus bartered are plentifull, and not in request; whereby it commeth to passe, that to haue good commodities (which are vendible at all times) there is part giuen in readie money, or in Billes payable at short dayes of payment; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many Merchants are ouerreached, and can haue no remedie by law nor equitie. Hence the Prouerbe is deriued, <hi>Caueat Emptor</hi>; for it is a buying and selling, implying an aduantage intended by both parties, how soeuer they wil seeme to colour the matter. So that the Prouerbe is not to be vnderstood, vpon all bargaines of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities whereby a man becommeth a loser; and he that dealeth in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter must be very circumspect, and the money giuen in barter cannot be ouerset: Whereupon a principall Merchant of London, made once a barter, in hope to ouerreach another Merchant, and they both being resolued to doe their best indeauour therein, agreed to esteeme and value their commodities at a high rate:<note place="margin">A cunning commutation.</note> but withall the great Merchant, would haue the one moitie (of the somme they should barter for) in readie money, and so the more hee did ouerualue his commoditie (which was cloth) the more money was the other to lay out. The bargaine came to one thousand pounds starling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the partie payed fiue hundreth pounds in readie mony instantly (for all was done in two houres:) and deliuered him also fortie halfe pieces of Lawnes, at a certaine price the first piece, and in euery two or three pieces raising the price, as the manner is in that kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie. The great Merchant had ouerset his commoditie or clothes fiftie vpon the hundreth, and the other Merchant (that could not ouerset his money) had valued his Lawnes at a very high rate of three for one at the least. For all the said fortie halfe pieces of Lawnes

were sold for 120 <abbr>ll</abbr> payable at two yeares day of payment, and by the cloth there was not lost aboue one hundreth pounds. Hereupon long after the said parties fell at variance, the cause was by them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promitted vnto verie sufficient arbitrators, Merchants, and they did approoue and confirme the said Commutation and Barter to bee good, for that the commoditie was Merchantable, and they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauoured to trie their wits to ouerreach each other.

               <p>The Ciuilians (affirming, that probabilitie to proue the estimation of a thing is sufficient, whether it be more or lesse worth) do admit that a man may sell deerer vnto an expert man, than vnto a simple man; and to sell deerer than the thing is worth by common estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is adiudged by them to be alwaies vniust: as also to vse reasons and inducements to sell wares the deerer, neither is the seller to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or expect any thing aboue the price agreed vpon. And intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereof, they make large discourses, which I do admit to handle for the reasons aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Buying and selling, say they, is done two manner of waies, First that the thing be so bought, that all power of pretence be auoided, which is giuing a thing at a certaine price for the thing: and secondly, that the thing sold be as a gift for that price, which in substance may be said to be a plaine, absolute, and lawfull bargaine, sold (as we say) in open market or shop,<note place="margin">Selling in open market or shop.</note> in so much that there be not a curtaine to hide the commoditie so bought and sold: howbeit in all faires and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets in the parts beyond the seas, a Trades-mans shop, and a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ware-house is taken to be publicke and open at the appointed times.</p>
               <p>They haue also determined, that a seller may not demand a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter price for the forbearance of his payment or satisfaction of the thing, but he may well diminish the price, if the buyer do satisfie him the sooner,<note place="margin">Payments by anticipation.</note> and before the time of paiment, by way of anticipation, which neuerthelesse resteth in his power to accept thereof, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the time.

vnexpired, according as they make their agreement of the price of interest.</p>
               <p>To conclude the premisses touching buying and selling, we find, that no man in selling any wares is bound to declare, whether any quantitie of the like wares are to be had or expected when he selleth.</p>

It is also a custome amongst Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, that if a Merchant be indebted vnto another, and thereupon intreateth another merchant to desire the creditor to respit him some time for the paiment of it; if then the said merchant the debtor do not pay accordingly at the time, he shall be taken <hi>pro confesso,</hi> and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

shall be giuen by the Merchants Court for the paiment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, onely vpon proofe made, that he did will another to craue the said respite of time for the paiment. The like is done by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law of England by triall of Iuries of 12 men, vpon proofe made by euidence produced before them, that the debtor did craue day of paiment, so that they will thereupon deliuer their verdict, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and execution may be of course had for the same. But if the promise be not conditionall, then is he an absolute Suretie, and is to pay the same accordingly, as merchants of credit alwaies haue done.</p>

                  <note place="margin">To become a suretie vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</note>A merchant may also be come in the nature of a Suretie vnawares, or vnknown vnto him, as befell vnto a friend of mine not may yeres since at Frankford in Germanie, who during the Mart or Faire, went into a merchants Ware-house to conferre of some businesse with him, where hee found another merchant of his acquaintance to cheapen some parcel of silke wares with the said other merchant, to whom this man (as it seemed) was vnknowne; whereupon the seller of the said silk wares tooke occasion to aske my friend whether he were a good man and of credit, and he answered he was, so the bargaine was made, and goods were deliuered vnto the said merchant the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to the value of 460 <abbr>ll</abbr>, for the which he made a bill obligatorie, payable the next Faire following: at which Faire (the partie not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing) demand was made of my friend to make payment of the said 460 <abbr>ll</abbr>, because the partie was absent, and withall some doubt was made of his sufficiencie; my friend had not so much as remembred that any such question was demanded of him, but the partie did put him in mind of it by circumstances, and would be paied of him, he in defence did alleage it to be <hi>nudum pactum ex quo non oritur actio,</hi> and so not bound to pay the same, as hauing had no consideration for it. The opinion of merchants was demaunded, wherein there was great diuersitie, so that the Ciuile Law was to determine the same; and by the said Law according to the title <hi>de mandato consilij,</hi> he was adiudge to pay the said 460 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and to haue the debtors bill obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie made ouer vnto him,<note place="margin">A caueat for merchants &amp;c.</note> whereof he could neuer recouer one pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, although he did pay the whole debt and dammages, for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie became insoluent.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Considerable promises.</note>Some promises are considerable, according to reason, as if a man vpon a penaltie do promise another not to molest or trouble him; if the other giue him cause of offence to breake the same, he incurreth not the penaltie; and a promise made to do a thing is alwaies vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be for the first time.

For, as is noted, God caused Nature to distribute her benefits, or his blessings to seuerall Climates, of diuers things found in some places, that are not in other places; to make an interchangeable course of the said commodities by way of merchandizing.</p>
               <p>This Reuolution of Trade,<note place="margin">Sundry means for buying and selling.</note> may be illustrated by the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the seuerall meanes, whereby the said buying and selling are effected.</p>

vnto other Merchants, or others, payable at 4, 6, 8, or more months; they presently transferre and set ouer these Billes (so receiued for the payment of their Clothes) vnto other Merchants, and take for them other commodities at such prices as they can agree with the Seller of them, be it Veluets, Silkes, Satins, Fustians, or any other wares or commodities, to make returne of the prouenue of theirs; and so selling those forraine commodities here in England, they presently buy more Clothes, and continue a Reuolution of buying and selling in the course of Trafficke and Commerce, being so (in effect) as may be illustrated by example.</p>
               <p>Suppose A.B. the Clothier selleth to C.D. the Merchant one pack of Clothes,<note place="margin">Example of of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution in Trafficke.</note> for the summe of one hundreth pounds paiable at six mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and doth condition with him to make him a Bill in the name of such a man as hee shall nominate vnto him: A.B. the Clothier buyeth of D.E. the Gentleman, so much Wooll as amounteth to one hundreth pounds, and doth intend to deliuer him the Bill of C. D. the Merchant, in full payment of his Woolls, and to cause the same to be made in his (this Gentlemans) name: But D.E. the said Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, caused him to make the Bill payable to E.G. the Mercer, and the Mercer is contented with the like condition to accept thereof; but he caused the same to be made payable to C. D. the Merchant, of whom hee buyeth his Veluets and Silkes; and so in payment of them, hee deliuered him (by an Intermissiue time) his owne Bill, which hee first should haue made to the Clothier. And herein you are to note, that in the buying by Bills, it may bee made payable to the Clothier, or to the Bearer thereof, and so all the parties are bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers thereof, vnto whom the same is set ouer by Tradition of it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which by a Retrograde examination will appeare; and this is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Rescounter in payment,<note place="margin">Rescounter by Bills of Debt.</note> vsed amongst Merchants beyond the Seas, and seemeth strange vnto all men that are ignorant of this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and yet doe they perceiue a reason for it, and cannot deny the commodiousnesse thereof.</p>
               <p>The Common Law of England, is directly against this course; for they say there can bee no alienation from one man to another of debts; because they are held, <hi>Choses en Action,</hi> and such whereof no propertie can passe by assignement or alienation; and many good Lawyers doe wish as well as Merchants, that there were an Act of Parliament made for the establishing of the like course in England.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue in some measure, in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, declared the Vse and Custome of Merchants beyond the Seas, in the Transferring and setting ouer of Bills Obligatorie, or Billes of Debt, which they giue each to others for the payment of Commodities, bought and sold by way of traffick and trade, it resteth now to speake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more amply. For the sinceritie of plaine dealing hath hitherto beene inuiolable,<note place="margin">The manner of Billes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas.</note> in the making of the said Billes, which euerie man of credit and reputation giueth of his owne hand writing, or made by his seruant, and by him subscribed, without any seale or witnesse thereunto; and is made payable to such a Merchant or person, or to the Bearer of the Bill, at such time or times of payment as is agreed and concluded betweene the parties, either for money or commodities lent or bought, and so declared in the said Bill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forme hereafter expressed.</p>
               <p>This Custome is much practised by the Merchants Aduenturers beyond the Seas at Middleborough, Amsterdam, Antuerp, Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, and other places where they do trade, in manner following, as we haue noted.</p>
               <p>A Merchant, hauing many of these Billes, which he hath receiued for his Clothes sold vnto Drapers (or other Merchants dwelling in seuerall townes and places) will resort vnto a Shop-keeper, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merchant, commonly accompanied with a Mediator or Broker, to buy a good round quantitie of Silke wares,<note place="margin">The setting ouer of Billes of Debt.</note> or any other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie (which is ordinarily sold payable at some dayes of payment ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 4, 6, or more monethes) and hauing agreed vpon the price of the said commoditie, or before; hee maketh the seller acquainted what payment or satisfaction hee will giue him, in Billes of such and such persons, amounting to such a summe, either little more or lesse than the commoditie doth amount vnto; or to take in commoditie so much as the said Billes doe containe, or doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount vnto; and if there bee any remainder due for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, more than the Billes doe amount, the same to bee payed in readie money, or vpon his owne Bill, payable at such a time as they agree betweene them, which often commeth to be a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14410:57"/>
great summe. Heereupon all such Bills as are of knowne persons are soone accepted of, and of the vnknowne persons, either him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that is the Seller, or the Broker, will inquire of their sufficiencie, and then likewise accept of their Bills in paiment; and hauing taken their Bills, (which are made payable to the Bearer, as we haue said) the receiuer of these Bills goeth vnto the parties, and demandeth of them, whether they are contented to pay him those Bills at the time specified therein, according to the manner of merchants for commodities (which if it be within one moneth after, it is accounted to be verie good payment:) The Debtor maketh answere, that he will pay his Bill to the bearer thereof accordingly; for if this man will not ride out (as they say) the time of the payment of the Bills, he may go to another man, and buy other commodities therewith, as if it were with readie money, the time onely considered: nay more, if he will haue readie money for these Bills,<note place="margin">Selling of Bill, Obligatorie.</note> he may sell them to other merchants that are moneyed men, and abating for the interest for the time, and (commonly one moneth ouer) accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rate, as they can agree, and as money is plentifull, they shall haue money at all times to imploy in commodities, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer by exchange, or to pay debts withall, or to carrie home <hi>in specie,</hi> or for any other purpose at their pleasure; which is commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for young merchants hauing small stockes, as also for all men vpon all occasions: for it is properly as money paied by assignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby verie great matters are compassed in the trade of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, the commodities are sooner vented in all places,<note place="margin">General bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits by setting ouer of Bils of Debt.</note> the Custome and Impositions of Princes do increase, the poore and mechanicall people are set on worke, men are better assured in their payments, the counterfeiting of Bills, and differences are preuented; the more commodities there are sold the lesse readie money is transported, and life is infused into trafficke and trade for the generall good. And herein we see and may obserue, That things which be indeed, and things which are not indeed, but taken to be indeed, may produce all one effect; and euerie man is enabled with his owne meanes and credit, to augment com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
               <p>This laudable custome (as I said) is not practised in England; yet sometimes a Merchant Stranger will accept of Bills of Debt in payment for commodities sold with aduantage: But then the Bill is made new againe, and in the Merchant Strangers name; and this is not without some daunger to him that buyeth the commoditie or merchandise for another mans Bill, as Factors may doe for their Masters: for I haue obserued by good experience,<note place="margin">A Law Case about the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ouer of Bills.</note> that a Factor in London, hauing sold for his Master (a Merchant of Antuerpe) some commodities to an English Merchant to the value of seuen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, and taken the Merchants Bills payable at six moneths and six moneths for it: his Master of Antuerpe did appoint him to buy Bayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or these Bills of another Merchant, which he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14410:58"/>
and had the value of 700 <abbr>ll</abbr> deliuered vnto him in Bayes accordingly, and the Bills were to be altered in the other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants name for his Bayes. Shortly after it fell out that the English Merchant became insoluent: But before it was publickely knowne, the Factor brought the Bills altered (according to the agreement) in the Baye Merchants name, who did refuse to accept of them, and said the Factor should pay him. The Bills were tendered with a Scriuener according to their agreement, but still were refused. The time of payment being expired, the Bay Merchant did arrest the said Factor: the matter was tried before the Lord chiefe Iustice of the Kings Bench by a <hi>Nisi prius</hi> in London, by a partie Iurie of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men and Strangers: The verdict was found for the Bay Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and the Factor did paie the money, and had no remedie against his Master. The reason was deliuered by the Iudge, That the Common Law in this case requireth a Release or Acquittance for the payment of the Bayes to be made to the Factor, otherwise he was still bound by the Law to answere for the said Bayes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">To establish this Custome in England.</note>This custome might (with great facilitie) neuerthelesse be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in England, and would be verie beneficiall to the King and the Common-wealth ingenerall: for albeit that the strict Rules of the Law demaundeth a sealing and deliuerie of Deedes, and that the Bill cannon conueniently be made payable to the bearer of it, or be altered in another mans name as abouesaid, neither can it be recouered by a Letter of Attorney, which in England is alwaies reuocable before the fact: Neuerthelesse, if there were a Register kept of the passing and transferring of these Bills from man to man, and by an indorsement thereof also vpon the Bill, it might be done with ease, and the bearer of it should be acknowledged thereby to be the lawfull Attorney in Law; and by these meanes the vndecent Plea of <hi>Non est factum</hi> would be cut off.

The words Currant Money for merchandize, is, because that Merchants for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects tollerate commonly the moneys to go currant at a higher rate in the course of trafficke, than they are valued by publicke authoritie of Kings and Common-weales: And when the Bill mentioneth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, it is taken to be Money at <hi>deposito</hi> or interest; wherein is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, That the interest must be ioyned with the principall summe, without any specification, whereby it may be separated or distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, because the debtor shall not pretend to pay the same at his best opportunitie and pleasure; as may (thereupon) be done for money letten for loane, retaining still the principall in his hands, and paying the interest from time to time, quarterly, or halfe yearely: for it is lawfull and accustomed, that although one hundreth pounds were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp for one whole yeare, after the rate of ten vpon the hundreth; the Debtor or Taker vp of it, may discharge the same at three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, if he will, paying one hundreth and two pounds ten shillings, vnlesse the Bill made for the same be made paiable at a time limited, with a penaltie of a summe of money, called by the Ciuilians <hi>Poena Canonica,</hi> which with vs in England is done vpon a Bond, with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of halfe or double the summe of the principall, wherewith the interest is also ioyned without distinction, which may not exceed the rate of ten vpon the hundreth for the yeare, in the computation whereof, diuers things are to obserued, as we shal declare hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now if a Bill made beyond the seas be done by two, three, or more persons, as hauing bought a commoditie as partners together, or taken vp moneys together at interest, wherein they bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues all as principall Parties or Debtors; yet euerie man is but bound to pay his part.<note place="margin">Subscription of Bills Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.</note> The like is, if one be bound, and two, or more do put their hand and seale, and vnder-write, and seale the said Bill as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals, yet paying their proportionable parts, they shall be cleered by the Ciuile Law, and the custome of Merchants: but if they doe simply subscribe, and say we are Sureties, then they are all bound for the whole, as if the words we or either of vs <hi>in solidum</hi> were expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: which is the cause that in all notariall writings (onely vsed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on questionable matters decided, or to be decided) they do not only bind the parties with these words, but they do also make a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all renuntiations of priuiledges,<note place="margin">Renunciation of Priuiledges, and what they be.</note> and especially of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio diuisionis,</hi> and then it is one for all. <hi>Exceptio ordinis &amp; excus si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis,</hi> is to meddle with the Suerties before the Principall: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Letters of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, for the cessions of goods, Prolongations of paiments, Vintages, or free Martes, all

                  <p>Three Linnen Drapers of London, bought of a Merchant stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger 40 pieces of fine Hollands cloth, amounting to 160 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and gaue their ioynt Bill for the payment of it at six moneths: one of them became insoluent, and being imprisoned, made a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition with the Merchant for eight pounds, and thereupon had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall acquitance made to him onely. Shortly after, the other two Linnen Drapers, being somewhat pressed for the payment, and ingaged for the other, they did plead the other mans generall acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which was but a receit made of the said eight pound, expressing that is was in full of his part; and neuerthelesse vpon triall in Law, it was adiudged to be a sufficient discharge for them all, in nature of a generall acquitance. These obseruations at the Common Law, and such like Booke cases as I haue put downe, I hold to be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for Merchants to know, albeit wee handle the Law-merchant in this Treatise, and not matters of the Common Law. If you take beyond the Seas any Bill Obligatorie for money deliuered vpon two or three liues, or for wagers or layes, which are conditionall,<note place="margin">Bills Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory vpon two or three liues.</note> let the partie be put to prooue: if vpon proofe of liues, make the Bill payable at a day certaine, vnlesse one of the parties were dead: whereby the partie is bound to pay, or else to prooue the decease of the one: on the contrarie, if you make the Bill to be payed, if they be all aliue or liuing, then must you prooue they be liuing. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Abundans Cautela non nocet.</hi> Finally, if a Bill be thirtie yeeres old, and neuer demanded or questioned, it is void by the Ciuile Law, and the Law or Custome of Merchants doth not take any knowledge thereof.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Credit of Merchants is so delicate and tender, that it must bee cared for as the apple of a mans eye: Hence it doth proceed that Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit are had in such reputation, that the giuer of them will be well aduised before hee doe make them; and the partie to whom they are directed, will be carefull to accomplish them, for it doth concerne both their Credits: The giuers Credit of the Letters, will bee had in question of insufficiencie, known to the other that he doth not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish them, or he that doth not performe them may bee thought to be weake and to want meanes to doe the same.<note place="margin">Definition of Letters of Credit.</note> To make Letters of Credit, is properly a Participation of Credit to another, which is performed as followeth. A Merchant doth send his friend or his seruant (either within the Land or beyond the Seas) to buy some commodities, or to take vp money for some purpose, and doth deliuer vnto him an open Letter, directed to another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, requiring him that if his friend such a one, the Bearer of that Letter (being either his friend or seruant) haue occasion to buy commodities, or to take vp monyes to the value of so many hundreths, or so many thousand pounds in that place or thereabouts; that hee will either procure him the same, or passe his promise, Bill, or Bond for it, and hee will prouide him the money, or pay him by exchange, or giue him such satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as hee shall require: the partie to whom this Letter is directed will accordingly doe his endeuour and performe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the other, and keepe the Letter for his assurance or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, and what hee doth thereupon vndertake, is made appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by such Writings or Euidences as hee taketh of the said Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Letter, that thereupon hee may bee well dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all accordingly. But if it should fall out, that for some knowen cause to this partie, he doth not accomplish his request contained in the said Letters of Credit: Then the Bearer of the same keepeth the said Letters, and returneth them vnto the giuer, without any other proceeding;<note place="margin">Protests for the non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Letters of Credit.</note> vnlesse it be in case where this partie is a debtor to him that gaue the Letters of Credit, and then he must take witnesses of it, and with a Scriuenor or Notarie make a Protest against him,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14410:60"/>
protesting to recouer of him (by all lawfull and conuenient meanes) all the damages, charges, and interest, which hee or any other shall sustaine thereby, by reason of the nonperformance of the said Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Credit, and that in time and place as occasion shall serue; which Protest is a sufficient meane amongst Merchants, and before any Iudges of the Ciuile Law, to recouer the same, vpon proofe at all times accordingly. But if the partie to whom these Letters of Credit were directed do make a reasonable answere for his excuse, and requireth the Scriuenor to put downe the same in the Act or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the said Protest; then is the cause considered withall, and the losses and damages may fall vpon another: for if the giuer of the said Letters of Credit, were a debtor to the other that did receiue them, to bee payed by them, either by commodities to bee bought, or monyes to bee taken vp, as aforesaid; then the said Protest may serue the receiuer of the said Letters of Credit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his damages of him that gaue him the same: wherein the Magistrates will haue a great consideration, as a matter whereby the Commerce is interrupted, which is the cause also that men must bee aduised on the other side, not to bee too rash to affirme the goodnesse or sufficiencie of another mans Estate, Credit, or Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, whereby a third man becommeth a loser, losse being the greatest hinderer of Trafficke and Trade. The Ciuilians therefore haue a Title in their Lawes, which is strictly obserued, as you shall vnderstand hereafter.</p>

A Merchant of Antuerp will send his Seruant at Amsterdam to buy him 500 Last of Corne, vpon aduice he hath that Corne is spoiled, or the Haruest faileth in Spaine, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, and other places: and because he is vncertaine what his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant can effect, doubting that other men might haue the like aduice, and preuent him; hee deliuereth Blanke paper by him subscribed, with order to his said Seruant, that hee shall vpon such an occasion, write his Letter vpon the said paper to such a man, his Factor at Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke in the East Countries, to buy for him the quantitie of Corne which he cannot buy at Amsterdam, and shall date the Letter, as if himselfe had written the same.

But in this the confidence may bee as great, as in the making of Billes Obligatory, and yet the aduenture farre inferiour thereunto; for vpon these Blankes, there is an Addition to the name, or a Precedence in words, namely, Your louing friend, <hi>A. B.</hi> &amp;c. which is impertinent, and not to bee vsed in Billes of Debt. Herein we may consider a necessitie to giue Blankes, not only because of the Masters Credit requisite; but also because of the vncertaintie in the finding of the quantitie of Corne which was to be bought.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Letter of Attorney, is an Act publikely done before a Notarie or Scriuenor, whereby one man giueth power and authoritie of himselfe vnto another man, by way of Deputation to doe, execute, and performe for him any lawfull thing, which he himselfe (being the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant) might or may (aswell present, as absent) doe, conclude, and determine in all causes Ciuile and Politike; with power also to Substitute one or more persons to doe the same vnder him, in the said first Constituants name; and to sweare in the soule of him, if cause so require: albeit the said Letters of Attorney doe differ in the manner and forme, as well as in the Substance, which must be obserued. They are called beyond the Seas Procurations, to procure or effect that which a man would haue commonly in an other place, and in matter of Authoritie for Law Causes, they goe one deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But by the Common Law the words are vsed, <hi>Pro forma,</hi> and a Procuration or Letter of Atturney, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocable at all times, vnlesse it bee that the said Letter of Atturney
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:14410:61"/>
do containe a Transport of some thing which is conueyed thereby: As if a man do constitute another for the recouvering of certaine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes for the parties owne proper vse, without account to be rendred for the same, and the said partie hath recouered the said moneys by vertue of it. This Letter of Attorney cannot be reuoked to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the effect being fully performed which was the cause thereof. So beyond the seas, if you make a Letter of Attorney to a Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in Law, to follow a cause for you in Law, although the same be made irreuocable, yet vpon good cause you may reuoke the same, and appoint another to follow the cause: but it is commonly done with leaue of the Court where the cause is consisting or depending, and because the intimations and citations are to be done at such times as the cause may require, the nomination of some place, as it were to chuse a Domicilium must be done,<note place="margin">Procurations with a limited power.</note> but the power may be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. An Attorney may haue authoritie to conuict a man by law for the recouerie of money or goods, and to proceed to execution by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning of the Debtor; yet he shall haue no power to release him out of prison, without further authoritie; so in the receiuing of goods or money, wherein euerie man is to vse his discretion, as the cause may require.</p>
               <p>A Merchant may also make a Letter of Attorney to a Notarie beyond the seas, and thereby to giue him power to make any insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or intimation, or protest, against any other Merchant there, to serue him in all occasions or occurrences concerning the matter in question. For a Procuration is beyond the seas of that validitie, that the partie who hath the same, and is the Procurator, is taken in law as absolute as the Constituant, and many sundrie proceedings may be vsed against him accordingly, by Citations, Intimations, Protests, Recoueries of goods deliuered formerly, and recalled backe againe, or the value thereof vpon any Attachments or Sequestrations, which cannot be done against a mans Factor or Seruant:<note place="margin">A caueat for Procurators.</note> therefore they that haue Procurations are to be carefull of the dispossessing of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of any goods, or moneys receiued, to be cleered by the Law, which happeneth commonly of goods taken vpon the seas, or seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in any Harbour, by vertue of a Letter of Attorney or Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The Ciuilians intreating of Procurations or Constitutions vnder <hi>Titulas Mandati,</hi> haue well obserued,<note place="margin">The originall of <hi>Mandata.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>A.B. willed C.D. his debtor to pay vnto E.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. one hundred pounds which he did owe him, C.D. did not pay the said money, but promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to pay the same. <hi>Queritur</hi> whether C.D. hath performed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or commandement giuen him, and whether he be discharged of the debt; as also whether this order or commission can be reuoked.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14410:62"/>
A.B. owing the like summe to E.F. Herein C.D. hath not performed his commission, which was to pay, and not to promise the payment of the hundreth pounds, and therefore the said Commission might be reuoked, and C.D. was not discharged of the debt, for the matter was entire, and all entire Commissions are reuocable. <hi>Mandatum enim re integra, reuocari potest, &amp; res est integra, &amp; si stipulatio promissioue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenerit cum id non mandauerim.</hi> For if C.D. should breake or become insoluent, E.F. would come to A.B. his debtor, to haue satisfaction for the said money, and C.D. was not discharged of the debt owing vnto A.B. But if E.F. had taken his promise for paiment, then vpon proofe made of it, the case is cleere.</p>
               <p>It is a question also, whether a Procurator hauing commission to receiue moneys which were owing or lent, and to giue an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the same; and receiuing the money without making an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance, haue performed his commission: And the answere is, That he hath not performed the same, because he made no Acquittance, as he was willed to do, <hi>Aliud est enim confessio, aliud numeratio.</hi> Albeit the Acquittance did not concerne the Procurator, but the partie who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paied the money.</p>
               <p>Another case they handle at large, <hi>Bartholomew</hi> did make and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute <hi>Nicholas</hi> to be his Procurator or Agent, in the buying of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, to the value of fiue thousand crownes; and he the Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuant to be answerable for the price and totall summe of fiue thousand crownes: and withall giuing full power and authoritie vnto the said <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that his procuration shall be good and auaileable, during the liues of the honest persons <hi>Gerome, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Angell,</hi> of whom the said Constituant had his Commission, and that they also together and apart <hi>insolidum</hi> should be bound for the performance, and himselfe also. <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Procurator by the commission of <hi>Ierome, Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Angell,</hi> as also of <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> caused by an Instrument (or Act past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Notarie) the said parties to be named in the contract, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bindeth them vnto <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Meuius,</hi> for the commodities bought of them to the value or summe of fiue thousand crownes. But <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi> is not named in the article wherby the other parties are bound in the couenant; whereupon some would conclude, that for want of forme <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was not bound to the payment, although by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the other three he had constituted and made <hi>Nicholas</hi> to be the Procurator.<note place="margin">In Procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the will of the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant is to be regarded.</note> The rule in Law being, <hi>Quod vna determinatio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciens plura determinabilia, aqualiter terminare debet.</hi> And herein is the intention and will of all the contractors more to be regarded than the conceit of words, which causeth Merchants to be accounted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillors, and to lose much of their credit and reputation.</p>
               <p>It is also a custome amongst Merchants, that if the Master (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Procurator hath exceeded his Commission) be silent, the same is taken for a consent; the rather because Procurations (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly running in generall words, whereby Factors are directed) do comprehend all things which (of course) are to be done touching
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:14410:62"/>
moneys or paiment of exchanges for moneys.</p>
               <p>The question therefore to know whether a Procurator (hauing commission to sell commodities, or to let them to hire at a price) hath authoritie to receiue the money or hire, may be thought friuolus: for the buyer in matter of sale of commodities in market ouert, hath no regard to the Procurations or Commissions giuen to the seller of the said commodities.</p>
               <p>The like may be vnderstood in this question following, Whether a Merchant (selling Cloth vnto an Abbot to cloath his Friers or Monkes) shall not be satisfied and payed for his cloth, although the Abbot did diuert and imploy the same afterwards to another vse? For the vse is no matter to be regarded by the Merchant, but the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Cloth. If a man buying Paper for the printing of a booke, doth not print the booke, and selleth the Paper vnto another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that is no cause but he must pay for the Paper, whereof no man ought to make doubt.</p>
               <p>If a Merchant maketh a Procurator,<note place="margin">Doubts in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curations by whom to be proued &amp;c.</note> or by letters giueth credit to negotiate some businesse with another Merchant; if this Merchant do take exception to the procuration and letters, and maketh doubt whether the partie that brought the same be the right man: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curator is not bound to make any further proofe; but the partie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting against him is to make good his assertion, and to proue the same by the Law and Custome of Merchants.</p>
               <p>Another question is moued, whether a Merchant that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to receiue a summe of money, and to pay the same vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and besides to pay the interest due vnto the partie to whom he paied that money, is bound to proue what interest he payed, and to whom he paied that interest or vse money: it seemeth <hi>Prima fronte,</hi> that the Merchant is bound to name the partie to whom he paied the said vse money; and yet there is doubt made whether he should pay it without he were compelled thereunto as a thing vnlawfull; and therefore the Commission or Order the Merchant had, is not to be contradicted, but must be allowed without any other proofe, for this question is so resolued by the Ciuilians, and where the proofe is not needfull, there the nomination of the persons to whom it was paied is to no purpose, according to the rule <hi>Qui non tenetur probare, non tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nominare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is also worthie the obseruation,<note place="margin">Commissions subiect to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators.</note> that generally all Ciuilians do concur in opinion, That when Merchants by their Letters or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions vse these or the like words, <hi>Let all things bee done as shall bee thought most expedient or conuenient,</hi> that the said Commissions or Directions are to be left to the interpretation of Arbitrators when any question ariseth; which is also in many more questions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Merchants noted in most of their Law bookes: hereof we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend (God willing) to intreat more amply in the next chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Factors and Seruants, and the Commissions giuen them, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ordinarie rule of Procurations in things compleat and not
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:14410:63"/>
effected, is vnderstood to end with the death of the Master or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that giueth such procurations, albeit there are many excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for a Procuration may be made to endure after his death,<note place="margin">Procurations to continue after death &amp;c.</note> which kind of Procurations the Florentines and other nations confirme by their last wills &amp; testaments, which neuertheles are to be vnderstood that the state of an heire be not impaired thereby, wherein the Law interposeth her authoritie. And for a generall rule in all perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and absolute Procurations or Commissions, it must be knowne that the like authoritie is vsed to preuent many inconueniencies, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a vigilant care that equitie be maintained.</p>
               <p>And that all Merchants or Procurators for Merchants, are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the lawfull Commissions giuen them, and meanes thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to being prouided, or else to answere the damages which the parties shall receiue by the default thereof.

Factors therefore must bee very carefull, to follow the Commissions giuen them very orderly and punctually; and because Merchants are not able to prescribe euerie thing, so exactly vnto their Factors as is conuenient, it behooueth them to make good choice of the persons which they doe imploy, for their welfare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon Trafficke; otherwise, the Factor groweth rich and the Merchant poore, because his gaine of Factoridge is certaine, howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the successe of Merchants imployment doth prooue.

                  <p>IF a Factor do sell at one time vnto one man seuerall parcells of commodities or goods belonging to diuers mens accounts, to be paied iointly in one or more paiments, without any distinction made by the buyer for what parcels he payeth any summe in part of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the said debt, weekely or monethly, as shop-keepers do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then is the said Factor to make a proportionable distribution of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys so receiued vpon euerie mans account,<note place="margin">Commodities bought and sold.</note> according to the summe that euerie mans parcell did amount vnto, vntill all be paied: and if any losse doth happen, or that all be not paied, the said losse is to be distributed vpon euerie mans account accordingly.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do sell afterwards more goods to the said man, or any other who is alreadie indebted for other commodities formerly bought, as aforesaid, bee it for his owne account, or other mens ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, and in the <hi>Interim</hi> receiue some more monyes in part of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and account between them; then is the said Factor to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the said monyes as before, vntil the said old and precedent debt be first payed, vnlesse there were cause of controuersie for them, or that the payment were indorsed vpon the Bill made for the later goods sold vnto that man: for that Bill may bee transferred or set ouer vnto another man, and so is not hee the receiuer of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but the other man.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor doe sell goods to another man payable at time for his owne account, and rcieveth the money for the same at the time of payment, and in the meane time letteth other mens monyes remaine in that mans hands vnpayed, for goods by him formerly sold; this Factor is to be answerable for that money vnto those other men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee should neuer recover one penny of it. For hee cannot (without fraud) beare with the non-payment of other mens monies
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14410:64"/>
after they be due, and procure the payment of his owne money, to another mans losse and preiudice.</p>
                  <p>In like case, if a Factor doe sell vnto a man certaine goods of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans account, either by it selfe or amongst other parcells, and this Factor giueth not aduice to the owner or proprietarie of the sale of the said goods, but afterwards (hauing had more dealings with that man in selling of goods and receiuing of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes) this man becommeth insoluent; The Factor is to make good that debt for the said goods so sold, because hee gaue no aduice to the owner of the sale of the said goods at conuenient time, euen as if he had sold those goods vnto a man contrarie to the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion giuen vnto him; for the Salarie of Factoridge bindeth him thereunto.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor by order or Commission of a Merchant, doe buy any Commodities aboue the price limited vnto him by the said Merchant, or that they bee not of that sort, goodnesse, or kind, as he is willed to doe: This Factor is to keepe the same for his owne account, and the Merchant may disclaime the buying of them. The like hee may doe, if the Factor (hauing bought a commoditie according to his Commission) doe ship the same for another place than he hath Commission to doe.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor doe sell a commoditie vnder the price limited vnto him; he is to make good the losse or difference of the price, vnlesse he can giue a sufficient reason of his doing so: wherein hee is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the disposition of the Merchant for whom hee dealeth, as is before noted.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor buy commodities according to his Commission, and afterwards the price of them riseth, and thereupon (fraudulently) hee ladeth them for another place, contrarie to his Commission, to take the benefit thereof: in this case the Merchant shall recouer damages against the Factor by the Custome of Merchants, vpon proofe made thereof.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor, by the aduice of a Merchant, doe buy a commoditie for that Merchants account, with the said Merchants mony, or by his credit; and the Factor giueth no aduice of the buying of it to the said Merchant, but doth sell the same againe for his owne bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and gaine: the Merchant shall recouer this benefit of the said Factor, by the Office of Prior and Consulls, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of Merchants, and shall be moreouer amerced for his fraud.</p>
                  <p>If the Factor do sell another mans commoditie to a man discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited, who cannot vsually (as before) buy commodities at the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie price as other men, and it falleth out that this man breaketh; the Factor shall pay for the said goods, as shall be thought they were worth, vnlesse hee can prooue that hee was ignorant of the parties weake estate and credit, or that hee sold him goods of his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count also, which argueth plaine dealing, or that hee had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the other man to deale for him, as if it were for his
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:14410:65"/>
owne proper goods, as hath beene declared. And yet in this case hee cannot barter any of the said commodities for other commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,<note place="margin">Batter.</note> but hee must haue expresse commission and order for it from the Merchant; neither can hee transferre or set ouer any Bills Obligatorie in nature before declared:<note place="margin">Bills of Debt.</note> For albeit this manner of Commissions giuen to Factors is very large, yet it containeth cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine restrictions and limitations, in euery Merchants vnderstanding.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor shall by a false Entrie in the Custome house, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnawares or of purpose,<note place="margin">Customes.</note> conceale part of the Custome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent or priuitie of the Merchant, whereby the goods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come forfeited to the Prince; the said Factor shall beare the losse of them, and answere the value thereof vnto the Merchant, as they did cost, if it be for goods to be transported; or as they might haue been sold, if it be for goods to be imported.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor or Merchant, doe colour the goods of Merchant Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in paying but English Customes, (although he did beare the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture of the Seas for the said goods) he runneth into a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and forfeiteth all his goods vnto the King, and his bodie to perpetuall imprisonment.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor, by a Letter of aduice, or by an Inuoyce of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the Merchant sendeth, doe make a short entrie into the Custome house, the goods not entred shall be lost, but the Factor cannot be charged with the same.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor make returne vnto a Merchant for the prouenue of his commodities sold,<note place="margin">Prohibited commodities.</note> in prohibited goods which may not be exported, and haue no Commission from the Merchant to doe the same; hee shall beare the losse of those goods, if they be seized vpon for the King, or taken as forfeited: But if it be vpon commodities to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, the Factor is in no fault; howbeit hee ought to giue aduice vnto the Merchant, what commodities are forbidden to bee impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or exported, according to the pleasure of Princes, which are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute gouernours in their Hauens, Harbours, Ports, or Creekes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Monyes.</note>If a Factor commit any vnlawfull Act, by the direction of the Merchant, be it for the transportation of Gold or Siluer into the parts beyond the Seas, or otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if it happen thereupon that the same bee taken, the Merchant beareth the losse: and yet the Factor is subiect to pay treble damages by the Law, if it be followed within the yeare; or may bee fined for the same in the Starcham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although it be many yeares after.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor doe pay money for a Merchant (without Commission) to another man, it is at his apperill to answere for it. And if hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer other mens money at interest, and take more than the tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Statute (which is ten in the hundreth by the yeare) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the said Statute against Vsurie taketh hold of him, and the money is lost; the said Factor is to be charged therewith, and to make good the money vnto the Merchant.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor (hauing receiued other mens goods or monyes into his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:14410:65"/>
custodie) be robbed of the said goods and moneys, he is to beare the losse,<note place="margin">Lost goods.</note> and to make good the same to the Merchant: But not in case where the vnmercifull Elements of Fire and Water shall destroy the said goods or moneys, or where a Towne is sacked or pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; which is alwaies to bee borne by the owner or proprietarie of the same.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor buy a commoditie,<note place="margin">Damnified Commodities.</note> which afterwards becommeth dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by some accident or casualtie, whereby the Merchant (for whose account he bought the same) becommeth a looser; that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is not to be charged with any part of the losse: But if the commodities were damnified before, then he is to beare some part of the losse, although it happened to be knowne afterwards. A Factor bought for a Merchant of Amsterdam one hundreth tunnes of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomes, which came from Ciuita Vecchia, laden with some Candia Oyle, whereof some part was spilled vpon the said Allome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same being mingled together, was sold and transported to Amsterdam, and there sold to the dyers of Harlem, Amsterdam, and Roterdam; who vsing the same, found their cloth stained in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers places; (for where the oyle touched, there the colour could not take) so that they became great loosers, as appeared by diuers testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials. The Factor did thereupon demaund reparation of damages of him who sold him the allome; and the Merchant did the like of the Factor, for there was aboue 300 <abbr>ll</abbr> lost: whereupon the matter was much debated amongst Merchants both here and beyond the seas, and they did deliuer their Parecer or opinions in writing,<note place="margin">The Parecer of Merchants.</note> and being found that the Factor had knowledge that some oyle had bin spilled vpon the allome, and neuertheles bought the same, he was adiudged by the sentence of Merchants, to pay the one halfe of the said losse, and the other halfe was borne betweene the dyers and the Merchant of Amsterdam: and he that sold the allomes, was cleered and fully paied; so that in these cases the circumstances and accidents are to be considered.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do receiue money for other mens accounts,<note place="margin">Losse by money.</note> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards are decried, or some losse doth happen by exchanging the same, be it vpon Copper moneys, or light Gold taken for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandises sold; euerie man is to beare that losse proportionably according to his summe, and the Factor is to sustaine no damage thereby, vnlesse it were for false coine by him receiued, which he is bound to know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Letters of Credit.</note>If a Factor bee required by a Merchants Letter of Credit, to giue credit vnto others, hee must looke verie precisely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the same accordingly; which Letters of Credit are either ample, or restrained to certaine conditions and limitation of time, place, persons, summes, and many other circumstances: if they bee ample, then is it dangerous for the giuer of the said Letters of Credit, and may also procure a losse to fall vpon the Factor; wherein consideration must bee had both wayes. Suppose A. B.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:14410:66"/>
of London, writeth his Letter vnto C. D. of Antuerp in these words; <hi>If E. F. of Amsterdam, or any other of my friends there, draw by exchange vpon you any Summes of money; it may please you to follow his and my friends order: I will be your warrant for all, and haue a care that all shall be accomplished orderly.</hi> C.D. of Antuerp the Factor in this case,<note place="margin">Exchange and Rechange.</note> doth accept from time to time many Billes of Exchanges, and payed them accordingly, and taketh vp the mony (by the direction of E.F. of Amsterdam) for Spaine and other places; and so continueth the same for a long time, by way of rechange from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vpon the said credit of A.B. of London. At last this Factor. C.D. becommeth suspitious, because of this long continuance of mony by exchange and rechange, and writeth vnto the said A.B. of London, to know whether he is contented to continue his former credit by him giuen to E. F. of Amsterdam? A. B. continueth the same, but with a limitation to a certaine summe,<note place="margin">Limitation of Letters of Credit.</note> not knowing what summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney the said C.D. was engaged for the said E.F. of Amsterdam; for C.D. gaue him no notice of it at that time: hereupon it falleth out, that E.F. of Amsterdam beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth insoluent, and being much indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto C.D. the Factor of Antuerpe; this Factor requireth his sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction at the hands of A.B. of London, according to the former Letter of Credit. A.B. doth answere, That he had restrained and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the said Credit to a certaine summe, which indeed did cut off all former matters, seeing C.D. gaue him no notice of the moneys ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and A.B. was onely to answere for the money which was taken vp by the second Letter of Credit, according to the summe limited, otherwise A. B. had beene cleered of all. But if C.D. did continue those monyes by exchange and rechange, vpon the credit of A. B, and the Factor (with whom hee had correspondence) doth become insoluent, and thereby C.D. the Factor is damnified and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the monyes running by exchange, or is bound to pay the same: This Factor is to be saued harmelesse by A. B. because hee tooke vp or caused to be taken vp,<note place="margin">The Efficient Cause alwaies to be regarded</note> the said monyes originally: So that his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit was the Efficient Cause of it, and the Factor is to bee regarded herein, in all reason.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor doe accept Billes of Exchanges of a Merchant, with order to Rechange the same againe vpon him, or to take it vp by exchange for another place or places, where he the said Factor shall find it to be for the most benefit of the Merchant: if this Factor take vp the same according to his best skill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, although it be found contrarie to the Merchants intention, the Factor is not to be charged, and the Merchant is to saue him harmelesse for the principall, with exchange, rechange, and all charges of factoridge.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do make ouer money for another mans account by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change vnto another man or Merchant, before he haue notice that this Merchant is broken, and the Bills of Exchange are not due: this Factor hath authoritie to countermaund the payment of this money,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:14410:66"/>
although the partie (vpon whom the Bill of Exchange is directed) had accepted the same. And if the said partie should pay the same before it was due, he is to repaie the same againe to the said Factor, as hauing paied it in his owne wrong, contrarie to the custome of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in exchanges.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do fraight a ship for some voyage to be made,<note place="margin">Fraighting of ships.</note> going and comming, for a Merchants account, and by his Commission or order, wherof a charter partie of fraightment is made by Indenture between him and the Master of the ship; this Factor is liable for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof, and to pay the fraight and all things accordingly. But if the ship be only fraighted outwards, and the Factor ladeth the same with some goods, then these goods are lyable for the fraight, and the Master can demaund nothing of the Factor by the charterpartie, but must looke to be paied by the partie that receiueth the goods, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Bill of lading; whereby it is conditioned,<note place="margin">Bills of lading.</note> that the fraight shall be paied vpon the receit of the said goods. And so is it also if a ship be fraighted to go to diuers parts, as it were bound from one place to another, and to be free in the last place of his discharge: for the Master must still haue an eye to be secured by goods, vnlesse there were an expresse Condition made in the charterpartie, to the contrarie, or that the ship were fraighted by the Great for a certaine summe of money to be paied by an agreement.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do fraight a ship for another man, or for his owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and when it commeth to the place appointed to vnlade, there are no goods to relade the same, or there wanteth money for the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof; if the Master doe not stay out all his daies of demou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer agreed vpon by the charterpartie of fraightment,<note place="margin">Protest for not lading.</note> and make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against the partie (that he was consigned vnto) to giue him his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within that time, but commeth away before that time be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, and although he maketh a protest, for that he is not laden: yet the Factor is to pay him no fraight at all, vnlesse (for the fraight out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) it were conditioned by the charterpartie. But if the Master do stay out his time, then the Factor is to answere the fraight, although the Master had laden his ship with Salt for his owne account: for if the said ship had bin laden only with Salt by the Merchant, which (it may be) would not pay halfe the fraight, yet the Factor or Merchant may at their pleasure abandon the same to the Master for his fraight,<note place="margin">Goods to be abandoned for the fraight.</note> and the Master can demaund no more of the Factor by the charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partie. But if the Master do take in Salt, and ladeth his ship by his owne meanes, before the daies of demourer are expired, and that by some condition made with the Factor, he may claime fraight; then the Factor is to haue the benefit of the Salt in defalcation of the said fraight.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do fraight a ship for a Merchant, and afterwards the said ship is taken to serue the king for some few daies, within the time agreed vpon for the lading; and hereupon the Merchant disclaimeth the fraighting of the said ship, albeit the Factor did proceede to lade
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:14410:67"/>
the same: In this case the Factor is not to beare any losse; but what damage shall be adiudged to the Master, the Merchant is to saue the Factor harmelesse of it.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor do hire a ship by the moneth for another Merchant, or for his owne account, and ladeth the same being readie to depart, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the king maketh a generall Embargo or restraint vpon all ships for a time; the Master cannot demaund any fraight of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for and during the said time of arrest. And if the ship be vnladen againe, and employed in the kings seruice, the Factor is free of all agreements or couenants with the Master.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Money giuen for fraighting.</note>If a Factor do receiue a summe of money of the owners of a ship, in consideration that he fraighteth the said ship for a voyage, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to repay the said money at the returne of the said voyage: if the said Factor haue fraighted this ship for another mans account, this Merchant is to haue the benefit of this money during the time; and if the Factor conceale the same, he is to repaire the damage thereof, which is to be considered both for the interest, and aduenture of the seas, for the said owners beare the same: and it is supposed that the Merchant would haue assured so much the lesse, or (by imploying that money towards the lading of the ship) he should disburse to much money lesse to make the said voyage, and it may be thought, that in regard of that money, the fraight is made the greater, whereof the said owners of the ship haue had a consideration by disbursing the same.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Assurance.</note>If a Factor be required to make assurance for a Merchant vpon a ship or goods laden for a certaine voyage, and haue moneys in his hands to pay for the <hi>Premio</hi> or the price of assurance; and this Factor doth neglect the same, and giueth no notice of it to the Merchant, who might haue made assurance in another place; and the said ship or goods do perish at the seas: this Factor is to answere the damage, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he can giue some sufficient reason for the non-performance of the said order or Commission.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Composition made without order.</note>If a Factor hauing made assurance vpon goods laden, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are taken by the enemie, maketh any composition with the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers for the same, without order or Commission for it; he is to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the whole assurance to the Merchant. A Merchant caused a ship to be fraighted and laden with commodities for Constantinople by a Factor of London, himselfe dwelling at Antuerpe, and being a subiect to the king of Spaine in the late warres, caused 2000 <abbr>ll</abbr> to be assured at London vpon the said goods; the ship and goods was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Gallies of Sicilia and brought to Palermo, where it was proued that the goods did appertaine to the King of Spaine his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects; but that there was 2000 <abbr>ll</abbr> assured at London by English Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, (their enemies in those daies) pretending thereupon to take the said goods for forfeited, or so much of them as should amount to the summe so assured. Hereupon the Assurers (hauing intimation from the Factor of it) desired to make some composition to auoid
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:14410:67"/>
that danger, whereby the goods also might bee sooner cleered, and the possession obtained for the owner and proprietarie thereof, which was the Merchant of Antuerp, wherein expedition was required: The Factor (in regard of the said expedition) did not stay to receiue an answere from the Merchant what hee should doe, but maketh a composition with the assurors, for 60 pound for the hundreth pound, to be payed instantly. The goods were afterwards all reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, whereof so much as had beene assured, was formerly relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished to the assurors, for the Merchant would not condescend to make any composition with the assurors: So that the Factor did beare the aduenture to lose 2000 <abbr>ll</abbr>, for some 1200 <abbr>ll</abbr> which hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, if the goods had not beene recouered; and therefore the said Factor tooke to himselfe the benefit of this composition, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the experienced Merchants.</p>
                  <p>If a Factor by errour of account doe wrong vnto a Merchant,<note place="margin">Accounts.</note> hee is to amend and to make good the same, not onely for the principall, but also with the interest for the time. So on the contrarie, if a Factor for his owne wrong, haue forgotten to charge the Merchants account, with some parcells payed out for him, or made ouer by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; the Merchant is to answere for it with interest for the time. In these precedent obseruations, are comprised all other cases of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences which may happen betweene Factors and Merchants.</p>

For as the roundnesse of the Globe of the world is compounded of the Waters and the Earth: So this worke of the Law-merchant cannot be compleat, without the Sea Lawes; so called (Lawes) because they are written and knowne; for without Nauigation, Commerce is of small moment, so that the Land affaires shall be intermixed with Sea-faring matters accordingly.</p>
               <p>Some doe attribute the first making of Sea Lawes, to the Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciaus and Carthaginians, because <hi>Plinie</hi> doth ascribe the Art of Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

vnto them. But by the most ancient Records, the Beginning must be from the inhabitants of the Island of Rhodes,<note place="margin">Rhodian Law.</note> scituated within the Mediterranean Sea, who were most famous for shipping and sayling, (as <hi>Strabo</hi> hath written) and surpassing all Nations in knowledge of equitie in Maritime causes: and the Mediterranean Sea was for aboue one thousand yeares onely ruled by their Law, called the Rhodian Law, although augmented with some additions of the Romanes. At last (as some haue recorded) when all sorts of Lawes, by the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and lacerating of the Romane Empire were in a manner buried, the Rulers of Rome in the yeare 1075 made new Sea Lawes and Statutes, and so did euery chiefe Seafaring Towne vpon the said Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Coast, adding thereunto other ordinances. So did they of Marseilles, in the yeare 1162; Genoa in the yeare 1186; they of Peloponessus called Morea, in the yeare 1200; the Venetians, in the yeare 1262; <hi>Constantine</hi> 1270; <hi>Iames</hi> King of Arragon the said yeare; <hi>Peter</hi> King of Arragon 1340; and they of Barselona 1434: Which Lawes are collected and extant vntill this day.

               <p>Therefore to preuent appellations, present execution and restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goods is vsed in causes of spoyle, vpon caution first found by the spoyled, to satisfie the condemnation to the Iudge, if there bee iust cause found of appellation;<note place="margin">Witnesses in causes Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</note> and to this end also it is permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that witnesses of the same Ship may be examined, although the aduerse partie bee not called thereunto, Merchants and Marriners sayling together in one Ship, may beare witnesse each to other, and Marriners against the Master when they are free and out of his command.</p>
               <p>The plaintife is to find suerties to pay costs and damages, if he doe faile in his proofe; and the defendant is to be put in caution to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the sentence, <hi>Iudicio cisti &amp; iudicatum solui.</hi>

               <head>CAHP. XIX. Of Buying and Selling of Commodities by Contracts.</head>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE buying and selling of commodities by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, may bee distinguished three manner of wayes, namely, Regall, Notariall, and Verball.</p>
               <p>The Regall contracts, are made betweene Kings and Princes and Merchants, which caused the Kings of Portugall to be called, Royall Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. For whereas the Venetians had the trade for Spices and other commodities of the East Indies;<note place="margin">Regall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, called by the Ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Solemne.</note> the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalls vpon the discouerie of those parts by Nauigation, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue the Venetians of that trade, as (by the reuolutions of time) other Nations haue almost compassed that trade of Spices, and taken the same from the Portugalls. The Kings of Portugall had alwayes the one moitie of the Pepper by way of contract, and for that they would contract againe with the Germaines, or other principall Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of other Nations and of their owne, to deliuer the same vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a price agreed, vpon the arriuall of the Carrackes at Lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, according vnto which it was sold againe with reputation to other Merchants, and dispersed into diuers countries; and so was it also done for Cloues and Mace, and sometimes for Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and the payments were made by assignation in the Bankes of Madrill, Lyons and Bizanson, and sometimes at Florence and other places; hereupon was the Contraction-house at Lixborne erected and named accordingly, where the said Spices and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities are brought and sold againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:14410:69"/>Such are the contracts which the King of Spaine doth make with Merchants for the prouision of Corne for his townes in Africa vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the coasts of Barbarie, as Ceuta, Mosegam, Tangere, and other places, the paiment whereof hath beene made againe by Pepper vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some especiall contract, and the Merchants haue thereupon also made other contracts with Merchants of the Low-countries to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them that Pepper at Amsterdam, and to take Corne in paiment: But the case is since altered by the incorporating of the East-India trade.</p>
               <p>Such were the contracts made by the French king <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, with the great Merchants of Italie, called <hi>Le graund partie,</hi> for Salt, which they by authoritie did ingrosse for the king, and brought also from other countries by sole permission, causing euerie house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in all France to take a proportion yearely, or to pay for it whether they had occasion to vse it or not, which was an Italian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention; and for this they paied by contract vnto the king six hundred thousand pounds sterling (being two millions of French Crownes) yearely.</p>
               <p>Such were the contracts which Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of blessed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, made with Merchants of London, for the prouision of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and apparrell for the souldiours in Ireland during the late warres with the Earle Tirone, which did amount to verie great summes of money, insomuch that the seuerall contracts for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell came to ninetie sixe thousand suits of apparrell, as I haue seene by the Records and Accounts extant in his maiesties Court of Exchequer. All these and such like contracts are made by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions granted for that purpose to some great officers of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who haue thereby authoritie to contract for the same with Merchants or others.</p>
               <p>Notariall contracts haue partly dependance vpon the same,<note place="margin">Notariall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts called Publicke.</note> for when those Merchants (which haue contracted with Kings or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) are to prouide sodenly those things which they haue contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for, or to dispose of the commodities which they haue bought or ingrossed into their hands: Then they deale with other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants either to prouide them of the said commodities, or to sell them such as they haue bought: and these contracts are made by publicke Acts and Instruments before Notaries, to the end that all things agreed vpon on either side may be duely accomplished: and in these great contracts beyond the seas, the paiments are (the most part for great summes) made in Bankes also, because of the commodiousnesse of it, as you shall note hereafter. Besides this, many Merchants doe make contracts, and passe them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise before Notaries, or Scriueners, because that things contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for may require time to effect them. As for example, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant aduenturer selleth vnto a Merchant of Middleborough two or three hundreth Clothes of knowne markes (whereby the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is also knowne) at a certaine price, the packe of ten Clothes,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:14410:70"/>
to be deliuered at Middleborough from time to time during the space of six moneths, and the Middleborough Merchant doth agree that (for the payment of these Clothes) he will send to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant aduenturer Linnen cloth, and diuers other commodities to be sold in London to pay himselfe as aforesaid, which commodities are also sent from time to time within the compasse of the said time of six moneths, and the reckoning between them shall run according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: hereupon a contract is made in writing before a Notarie publick, and therein diuers conditions are to be specified and obserued.<note place="margin">Conditions of a Merchants Contract.</note> First it is agreed, that concerning the price of the Clothes sold, amounting to such a summe sterling money called lawfull money of England, there shall be giuen for euerie twentie shillings or pound sterling so many shillings and pence as they shall agree, according to the price of exchange amongst Merchants, and these are shillings and pence Flemish money, whereof there is 35 or 36 shillings, or 35 shillings and six pence, or 36 shillings and eight pence giuen or allowed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count betweene them for twentie shillings sterling, and so after the rate for so many hundreth pounds or thousand pounds as the Clothes may amount vnto. Secondly it is agreed, that the Merchant aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer shall beare the aduenture of his Clothes, and deliuer them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his aduenture, charge, and daunger of the seas, with all casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vnto the Middleborough Merchant within the towne or ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of the Merchant there; and likewise that the Middleborough Merchant shall beare the aduenture of his Linnen Cloth, and other commodities, answere the Kings Customes, and all charges inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent vpon the said commodities, vntill they bee freely taken vp into the Merchant aduenturers ware-house here. Thirdly, it is agreed betweene them (these forreine commodities being sold paiable at times of paiment) that if any bad debts should be made thereby, either the Middleborough Merchant is to beare the losse thereof, or else the Merchant aduenturer doth take the hazard and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it vpon him, for the consideration or allowance of double factoridge, or two vpon the hundreth. Fourthly, it is agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, that if the paiment of the commodities of the Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough Merchant be not made within the time of sixe moneths, according as the Clothes were sold; then the Merchant aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is to haue allowance for the money by him not receiued within the time after the rate of tenne vpon the hundreth for the yeare. Lastly, (because the Merchant aduenturer taketh paines in the selling of the Merchandise and Commodities of the Middleborough Merchant to pay himselfe) it is also agreed vpon, that the Merchant aduenturer shall haue allowance of factoridge for it, after the rate of two <hi>pro Cent.</hi> which hee should haue giuen vnto another Factor to sell the same for him. This is the substance of a Merchants Contract, wherein it seemeth all things haue beene well considered and agreed vpon; yet the principall matter for good and sure dealing is omitted,<note place="margin">Defectiue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</note> which is not onely to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14410:70"/>
couenant that the Middleborough Merchant shall send him good and merchantable wares or commodities to make money of, or to sell to good Customers that will make him good payment, but especially, that the Merchant aduenturer shall not be compelled to send him more clothes than the value of the commodities receiued shall amount vnto from time to time. And further, if he do not send him within the time the quantitie of commodities requisite to pay him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for so many Clothes; The said Middleborough Merchant shall pay him the damages sustained by the imploiment of his money in Clothes, or a certaine summe of money agreed vpon betweene them for the non-performance thereof.</p>
               <p>In like manner a London Merchant doth contract with a Merchant stranger here, and buyeth of him a certaine commoditie, whereof the goodnesse is commonly knowne by the marke, or otherwise by the <hi>Fabrica</hi> or making, as Veluets, Sattin, Silkes, Fustians, and other commodities to be here deliuered vnto him by such a day, or within so many moneths, at a price agreed vpon betweene them, with the manner of paiment, and other conditions agreed also; hereupon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise passeth a Notariall Contract which is performed accordingly. But put the case, That the price of the said Veluets and Silkes by some accident or occasion doth fall, and the London Merchant doth repent himselfe of his bargaine and contract, and now some of the said forraine commodities are come from beyond the seas, and arriued within the riuer of Thames, whereupon the Merchant stranger giueth notice vnto him of it, and the London Merchant seemeth vnwilling to receiue the said commodities, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained either by a Scriuener or with witnesses to offer vnto him the said commodities according to their contract:<note place="margin">Tendering of commodities sold by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</note> here note that this offer or tender so made is of no validitie or effect in Law; for vntill the Kings Custome is paied for the said goods, and that you haue receiued them into your power or custodie, you can make no lawfull offer of them. Moreouer, if you haue paied the Kings Custome for them, and haue them in your custodie and power, and do make tender of them before the time; yet the Law is not satisfied herein, but you must tender them also vpon the last day of deliuerie, because the damages to be giuen vnto you by Law must take a certaine ground vpon the limitation of time, and not vpon casualties; for it might fall out, that the price of the said com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities should rise within that time, and you might sell them for a greater gaine, and by that time of the last day of your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie they might be fallen againe in price, and you might haue proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another parcell for the same, so that both by the Common law and the Law Merchant you are to make your tender vpon the verie day by a Scriuener, or with competent witnesses, wherof I haue seene sufficient triall in Law. And according to these two examples, you may judge and consider of all other the like contracts wee call Notariall.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Verball con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts called Priuate.</note>Verball contracts are made betweene partie and partie, or by meanes of Brokers or Mediators, and that onely by word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out writing. Such are the daily buying and selling of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties either for readie money, or payable at some daies of payment, wherein the mediation of a Broker is most necessarie: For as it would be troublesome to vse Scriueners in euerie bargaine; so is it commodious to vse the meanes of Brokers, the commodities are not onely bought and sold with more credit and reputation, but all controuersies which doe arise by misaduenture or otherwise are sooner determined, and a sworne Broker is taken as a double witnesse, if he doe produce his booke, with a <hi>Memorandum</hi> of the bargaine, as the same was agreed betweene both parties, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many variences are reconciled, and differences (like to fall out) are preuented.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</note>I had almost forgotten the most memorable contracts that euer were, whereby the Philosophers <hi>Elixar</hi> or stone is found, turning Leade, Paper, and Inke into Gold and Siluer, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Popes for their Crusadoes or Bulls, whereof there are certaine contractors, who for a certaine summe of money yearely to be paied, doe receiue authoritie to disperse the said Pardons or Bulls into the West-Indies, Perou, <hi>Noua Espagnia,</hi> and all those quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the world, and euerie resonable soule must haue one of them yearely, and that this is the most beneficiall contract I proue thus.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1591 Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus</hi> caused two ships to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den out of Spaine for the West-Indies as aforesaid, with some 100 Buts of Sackes, 1400 little Chests containing each of them three ordinarie small Barrells of Quicke-siluer weighing 50 <abbr>ll</abbr> the peece, to refine the Siluer withall in the said Indies: and moreouer with a great number of Packes of the Printed Bulls and Pardons graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that time, to make prouision against the Heretickes; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch that the great <hi>Armada</hi> of the yeare 1588, had so much exhausted the treasure of Spaine.

This courtly Merchant (falling in communication with an Italian knight, who had been a Merchant) did conclude with the said knight to make a partable voyage betweene them, and to send those Bulls into the West-Indies, and accordingly a ship was fraighted and laden with the said Bulls and some other commodities, and did perform the said voyage to the Indies: but no sooner arriued, the Popes Contractor for that commoditie did seise vpon all the said Bulls, and caused an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to be giuen against them, that they were infected, hauing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:14410:71"/>
beene taken by Heretickes; it was alleaged that they were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously saued, but lost they were and confiscated, and so couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was well rewarded. But returning to prooue this beneficiall Contract,<note place="margin">The Pope his Merchandize.</note> I was at the time of the taking of the said Bulls willed by authoritie, to make and estimate what the lading of these two ships might cost, and what they might haue beene worth in the West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, according to the rate of euery Bull, taxed at two Royalls of plate, and some foure and some eight Royalls according to their limitation, euery one being but one sheet of paper; and by compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation the lading did not cost fiftie thousand pounds, and would haue yeelded aboue six hundreth thousand pounds: for these contracts are feruent and full of deuotion, containing also a commandement that their beds should bee sold, rather than any one should bee without a Bull, for the safetie of the soule was to bee preferred before the health and ease of the bodie.</p>
               <p>Now before we intreat of extrauagant Contracts in the buying and selling of commodities in some places, it will not be impertinent to note the obseruations and opinions of Ciuilians concerning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Contracts, which they haue distinguished to be Solemne, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like or Priuate, as in the Marginall notes is before declared, to the end all controuersies may bee auoided in the said Merchants Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</p>

A Merchant doth deliuer some money vnto another Merchant, to be imployed by him in commodities, or to bee put forth to vse for both their benefit and profit, without any limitation of time agreed vpon betweene them; the question is, when this Merchant that did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this money may call for it againe; wherein most Ciuilians are of opinion, that the same cannot bee demanded before the yeare expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which seemeth the more reasonable, if the Law will not allow vnto the other partie, a losse sustained thereby by fire, water, or any other casualtie, vnlesse hee doe declare and manifest the same within the yeare. Neuerthelesse if this money were deliuered to one that maketh a continuall gaine by money, as some Gold-smiths doe, by taking the same for two, three, or more dayes, and allowing benefit for it: then it may seeme reasonable, that the money may be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at all times vpon warning giuen for the time, without which, no man may be supposed to be so carelesse in the deliuerie of his or other mens money by a Verball contract, as the said Ciuilians haue surmised.</p>
               <p>Againe, suppose this money were deliuered to a father and his sonne ioyntly, whether the same shal be redemanded of the father and of the sonne by equall portion halfe and halfe, or of them both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:14410:72"/>
Hereupon they are of opinion, if the father did receiue the money, and that the sonne be vnder the gouernement of the father, then the father is to answere for all: But if the sonne doe (as it were) gouerne the father, because hee is old; then the sonne is to answere for the money. Now the Law-merchant obligeth them both to answere for the said money, vnlesse the sonne were vnder yeares. But this question may be thought extrauagant, for contracts are commonly Notariall in this case, and betweene parteners,<note place="margin">Notariall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts surest.</note> and where one parte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bindeth another, it is onely to bee vnderstood to continue the time of their partenership; whereas to become bound each to other for so much as shall be found due, is dangerous and full of cauillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that (as before is remembred) euery thing is to bee plainely expressed, but especially to be carefully obserued between parteners. For the Stocke also betweene parteners by contract to continue in trade, is to be without diminution or any other imployment to bee made, during the said copartenership, which is limited therefore for a time and not by voyages or employments; the charges on both sides to be limited: but hereof more vpon the title of Parteners or Companies.</p>
               <p>To make these Notariall contracts more authenticke and sure, when due regard is had of reciprocall actions, to auoid <hi>Nudum Pactum,</hi> the Bonds made by each partie to other in a summe of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the performance thereof, are to be preferred before the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a penaltie contained in the contract, albeit that these Bonds being put in suit, causeth the other partie to flie into the Chancerie; but the Merchants Courts proceed herein with more expedition.</p>
               <p>There are also certaine Merchants contracts, which (in regard of the conditions) are called Extrauagants,<note place="margin">Extrauagan contracts.</note> because the manner either of buying or selling of commodities, and the payment made for the same, is rare and but vsed in some places, which neuerthelesse are made in writing by Notariall contract, or by the Brokers Booke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, whereof I thinke fit to make a Chapter apart, touching the commodities sold by Brokers, as hereafter may appeare.</p>
               <p>A Merchant in Spaine dealing for the West Indies, <hi>Noua Espagnia, Terra firma,</hi> or Peru and other places in America, will buy a round quantitie of Germanie commodities or manufactures made there, and in the Low Countries, either Yronmongers wares, as Hatchets, Axes, Kniues, Bells, Beads, Needles, Basons, Candlestickes, Counters, Lockes, Nayles, and diuers sorts of commodities; and he is made acquainted by the Inuoice or Cargasson of those goods what they did cost in the places from whence they came, where the Merchant owner of the said wares, hath augmented his price in the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voice, and so the Spanish Merchant doth make him an offer of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Maluidies for euerie pounds Flemish, or Hamborough money,<note place="margin">Conditions to be obserued in them.</note> or for euerie Dollor or other coyne whereby the same was bought, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the partie by his obseruation is able to iudge of the value thereof, by his often buying of the like: but the payment is agreed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14410:73"/>
vpon to bee made sometime after the returne of the West-Indies Fleet, that is to say, When most Ships going outwards shall returne againe into Spaine, but whether the buyer of those goods doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any returne of the prouenue of the said goods or not, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not materiall to the seller of the goods, for he beareth no aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of bad Factors, euill pay-masters, or other accidents; but must be payed at the time agreed vpon, according to the ordinarie Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome thereof, vnlesse it were agreed that he should beare the aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Seas for a summe in certaintie in nature of assurance, or vpon some vnexpected alteration, which might happen in the said assurance, which is another contract, as hereafter more amply will appeare in his proper place.</p>
               <p>Another Merchant selling by contract, some commodities to be deliuered at the returne of the said West Indies Fleet, <hi>Posito</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine quantitie of Cutcheneale, as the price shall be broken in Spaine vpon the arriuall of the maine Partida; this Merchant commonly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a summe of mony before hand, whereof he alloweth interest for the time, or else he abateth a certaine allowance in the price of the Cutcheneale lesse than the price, which by authoritie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent amongst Merchants is made, that is to say, If the best sort called Misteca be set at 40 Ducatts the Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if the price of Cutche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neale be high or low, the interest of his money formerly disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (by the said abatement) must needes bee accordingly: So that the best aduantage is to take the interest after a rate certaine, and the price of the Cutcheneale, as it shall and may f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Bankers haue found the same by experience, by dealing with the Kings of Spaine and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall, when they make Partidos with them to furnish them mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes in their occasions, by making them to pay exchanges and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes for it after a great rate.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Banke is properly a collection of all the readie money of some Kingdome,<note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Banke.</note> Common-wealth, or Prouince, as also of a particular Citie or Towne, into the hands of some persons licensed and established thereunto by publicke authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of some King, Prince, or Commonwealth, erected with great solemnitie in the view of all the people and inhabitants of that Citie, Common-wealth, or Kingdome, with an intimation thereof made diuers times, to be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a day in the open market place, where a scaffold is purposely erected, with an ostentation of great store of money of Gold and Siluer, supposed to belong to these persons or Bankers so established; which is vnto them an attractiue power to persuade and allure the common people to bring their moneys into these Bankers hands, where at all times they may command it, and haue it againe at their owne pleasure, with allowing them onely a small matter of fiue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euerie thousand ducats or crownes, when any man will retire or draw his money into his owne hands againe: which although it be but in twentie yeares, yet during all that time, they are to haue no more; so that these persons or Bankers do become (as it were) the generall Seruants or Cashiers of that Prouince, Citie, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>These Bankers, as they haue their Companies, Factors, or corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence in the chiefe places of trade in Europe, so must they also keepe account with euerie man, of whom they haue receiued any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney into their Banke, out of which number, no man of that iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is almost exempted; but generally all men are desirous to please them, and to bring their readie money into their Banke, as also such money as they haue in foreine parts. In regard whereof, these Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do giue them great credit; for if any man haue occasion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow in merchandise or to pay in money 3 or foure thousand ducats, and haue but one thousand ducats in the Banke, the Bankers will pay it for him more or lesse, as the partie is well knowne or credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:14410:74"/>
without taking any gaine for it, although it be for 3, 4, 6, or more monethes.</p>
               <p>This seemeth to be a great commoditie (as no doubt it is to men in particular) but being well considered of, it will be found a small friendship, and no more in effect, than if a man did participate the light of his candle to another mans candle: for what is this credit? or what are the paiments of the Banks, but almost or rather altogether imaginarie? As for example,<note place="margin">The maner of the Bankers paiments.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> hath two thousand ducats in Banke, <hi>Iohn</hi> hath three thousand, and <hi>William</hi> foure thousand, and so consequently others more or lesse. <hi>Peter</hi> hath occasion to pay vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> one thousand ducats, he goeth to the Bankers at the appointed houres, (which are certaine both in the forenoone and afternoone) and requireth them to pay one thousand ducats vnto <hi>Iohn</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they presently make <hi>Peter</hi> debtor for one thousand ducats, and <hi>Iohn</hi> creditor for the same summe: so that <hi>Peter</hi> hauing assigned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Iohn</hi> one thousand ducats, hath now no more but one thousand ducats in Banke, where he had two thousand before, and <hi>Iohn</hi> hath foure thousand ducats in the same Banke, where he had but three thousand before. And so in the same manner of assignation, <hi>Iohn</hi> doth pay vnto <hi>William,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> vnto others, without that any money is touched, but remaineth still in the Bankers hand, which within a short time after the erection of the Banke, amounteth vnto many millions: and by their industrie they doe incorporate the same, which may easily be vnderstood, if we do but consider, what the readie money and wealth of London would come vnto, if it were gathered into one mans hands, much more if a great deale of riches of other countries were added thereunto, as these Bankers can cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly compasse by the course of the exchange for moneys, the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing whereof, is caused by their motion from time to time as in our Treatise of Exchanges is declared.</p>
               <p>But some will say or demaund, Cannot a man haue any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die money out of the Bankers hands, if he haue occasion to vse it? Yes that he can: but before he haue it, they will be so bold, as to know for what purpose he demaundeth the same, or what he will doe with it. If it be to pay any man withall, they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies doe that for him, as hauing account almost with all men; for hee is accounted to be of no credit, that hath not any money in Banke.</p>
               <p>If he do demaund it for to make ouer by exchange in some other countrie, they will also serue his turne in giuing him Bills of Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for any place wheresoeuer, because they haue their companies or correspondence in euerie place.</p>
               <p>If he do demaund it for his charges and expences, it will be paied him forthwith, because it is but a small summe, and in the end the money commeth into their hands againe.</p>
               <p>If they pay out money to any man, that hauing money in Banke will bestow the same in purchase of lands, they will still haue an
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14410:74"/>
eye to haue it againe in Banke one way or other, at the second and third hand; so that they once being possessed of moneys, they will hardly be dispossessed, and their paiments are in effect all by assignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and imaginarie.</p>
               <p>And if they haue any money in Banke belonging vnto Widowes and Orphanes, or any other person that hath no occasion to vse the same, they will allow them interest after foure or fiue vpon the hundreth in the yeare, at the most, and that vpon especiall favour; for euerie man seeketh to please them, as in matter where <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum priuatum</hi> beareth the rule; for they can easily please men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, in giuing them some credit of that great credit which they haue obtained in generall.</p>
               <p>The money then remaining in the Bankers hands, is imployed by them to other vses and purposes.</p>
               <p>First, they doe deale with great Princes and Potentates,<note place="margin">The Bankers trade.</note> that haue need of money for the maintenance of their warres, as the Geneuoises and Germanes did with the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth during the warres in Germanie, and as the Florentines and others haue done with <hi>Phillip</hi> the second king of Spaine, and also with his sonne <hi>Phillip</hi> the third late raigning, causing him to pay 20, 25, 30, and more in the hundreth, by way of exchange and rechange, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to happen accidentally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ingrosse thereby diuers commodities into their hands: and lastly, they carrie thereby a predominance in ruling the course of exchanges for all places, where it pleaseth them: by reason whereof the citie of Amsterdam (to countermine them) haue in the yeare 1608, also erected a verie great Banke,<note place="margin">The beginning of the Banke at Amsterdam.</note> for the which the said citie hath vndertaken to answere, whereby they are alwaies sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with money, as appeareth, that the same is plentifully to be had at interest at six and seuen in the hundreth by the yeare, and some at fiue and vnder. This custome is now so setled there, that it is as effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall as any law.</p>
               <p>Of the breaking of some of these Bankes,<note place="margin">Bankrupt.</note> is the name Bankrupt deriued: for when Princes do not accomplish with them, then they cannot hold out, vnlesse they haue great estates of their owne. <hi>Philip</hi> the second king of Spaine, in the yeare 1596, was constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue <hi>Facultad Reall,</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">A Facultie Royall, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</note> A Power or Facultie Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or a Protection vnto the Bankes of Madrill, and all their asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates for foure yeares; commaunding that all those that had dealt with them in matter of Exchange, Interest, Contracts, Letters of Credit, or any manner of wayes publickely or secret, and with all their knowne or vnknowne partners, should not be compelled to pay any money to their creditors vntill the yeare 1600: but in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim</hi> they should at euerie 6 moneths receiue interest for their mony after the rate of seuen <hi>pro centum,</hi> for the yeare; and if any man could not forbeare his mony, he was to deliuer the fourth part more in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die money, and so accounted together with the interest due at seuen
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:14410:75"/>
vpon the hundreth, the two thirds of all was to be paied him, and the other third was to continue during his life, with allowance of the said interest; and this was to be obserued in the kingdomes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile, Arragon, Portugall, and the Low-countries, as also in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Naples, Sicilia, and the State of Milan, and finally in all kingdomes and dominions vnder him, (for so are the words) and in all his warlike forces by sea and by land. This did bring the Bankes in great discredit, and the West-India trade was much interrupted by it, and so continued during the said king his life time; and after his decease, moneys haue not beene plentifull in Spaine, insomuch, that in the yeare 1608, his sonne <hi>Philip</hi> the third did giue the like Facultie Royall to all men that were to pay money at the returne of the West-Indies fleet for one yeare, paying but 3 <hi>pro cent.</hi> to their creditors for the forbearance.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto we haue beene buying and dealing in commodities, and now it will be time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance our commerce or trafficke, and to fraight Ships for the purpose to transport ouer commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities. No Ship should be fraighted without a Charterpartie, meaning a Charter or Couenant betweene two parties, the Master and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: and the Bills of lading do declare what goods are laden,<note place="margin">Bills of lading.</note> and bindeth the Master to deliuer them well conditioned to the place of discharge, according to the contents of the Charterpartie; bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe, his ship, tackle, and furniture of it, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof. Of these Bills of lading, there is commonly three Bills of one tenor made of the whole ships lading, or of many particular parcells of goods, if there be many laders; and the marks of the goods must therin be expressed, and of whom receiued, and to whom to be deliuered. These Bills of lading are commonly to be had in print in all places, and in seuerall languages. One of them is inclosed in the letters written by the same Ship, another Bill is sent ouer land to the Factor or partie to whom the goods are consigned,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14410:75"/>
the third remaineth with the Merchant, for his testimony against the Master, if there were any occasion or loose dealing; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially it is kept for to serue in case of losse, to recouer the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of the goods of the assurors that haue vndertaken to beare the aduenture with you, whereof wee shall intreat in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters.</p>
               <p>The persons that are in a Ship may bee thus in order, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they differ in names in many languages, yet they are all one in effect. The Master of the Ship, the Pilot, the Masters mate, the Ship-wright or Carpenter, the Boats-man, the Purser, the Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, the Cooke, and the Ships boy. All the rest are vnder the name Marriners, all these are distinguished in hires and fees in all Countries.</p>
               <p>The Master therefore doth couenant by the Charter-partie,<note place="margin">Charter-party</note> to find a sufficient Pilot, and all other the foresaid Officers and Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to prouide Shiptycht, Masts, Sayles, Roapes, Tewes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, Ship-boat; with fire, water, salt, and all things necessarie, at his owne expences. And this Charter-partie so made on the Masters part, doth commonly declare that it is and all things therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to the Law of <hi>Oleron</hi>; according to which Law,<note place="margin">Law of <hi>Oleron.</hi>
                  </note> if there bee no writing made, and but an earnest giuen, then the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant if he repent, loseth his earnest; but the Master if hee repent, loseth the double of the earnest.</p>
               <p>Againe, if the Ship bee not readie at the day appointed in the Charter-partie to goe to Sea, the Merchant may not onely free himselfe of her, except hee hold his peace and discharge her not (for then by his silence he seemeth to consent,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Qui Tacet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentive videtur.</hi>
                  </note>) but also shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer charges, interests, and damages, except the Master shew some excuse of some pregnant occasion or mischance, which could not bee auoyded, and then he loseth onely his fraight, because he hath not deserued it. But if the fault be in the Merchant, he shall pay the Master his damages, or according to the Rhodian Law,<note place="margin">Rhodian Law.</note> shall entertain the Ship and Company ten dayes, and if then he stay longer shall pay the fraight of all accordingly; and further shall answere for all hurt and damages happening by fire, water, or otherwise af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time appointed. It is true, that the Rhodian Law char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the Merchant in this case but with halfe the fraight, and the Master with the whole fraight if he faile: Albeit that the Romanes inflict the paine of the whole fraight vpon the Merchant, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if hee take out his owne goods againe, for then is the fraight thought to bee deserued.</p>
               <p>But if the Ship in her Voyage become vnable, without the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters fault, or that the Master or Ship bee arrested by some au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of Magistrates in her way; the Master may either mend his Ship, or fraight another. But in case the Merchant agree not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then the Master shall at least recouer his fraight, so farre as hee hath deserued it. For otherwise, except the Merchant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14410:76"/>
or necessitie constraine the Master to put the goods into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Ship worse than his owne; the Master is heerein bound to all losses and damages, except that both the Ships perish that voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and that no fault nor fraud bee found in the Master.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Admiraltie Cases.</note>In the yeare 1587, the like matter was in question with fiue Ships comming backe without their lading, from Ligorne and Ciuita Vecchia into England, whereof my selfe was one of the Merchants that had fraighted them, and did intend to receiue lading there in Allome: But the Gallyes of <hi>Don Andrea Doria</hi> intending to surprise those Ships (the Grand Armada being preparing in Spaine) they came all of them away without their lading; some two of these Ships had lyen out all their time conditioned by their Charter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partie, to take in their lading, and the Masters had Notariall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests against the Factors that they should haue laden them. These were by the Law of Admiraltie adiudged to haue deserued their whole fraight. Two other ships hauing not staied there their abiding dayes, nor made any protest as aforesaid, could not be found to haue deserued any fraight at all, although they were laden outward bound. The fifth Ship had a condition or prouiso in her Charterpartie, That if it should happen that in her comming backe out of the Straits, shee should be taken or cast away; neuerthelesse the fraight outwards (which was accounted halfe) should bee payed,<note place="margin">Condition maketh Law.</note> and that halfe was adiudged vnto the Master, and no more, hauing not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there his appointed time. And if this prouiso had not beene, he could not haue recouered any thing; for when Ships are fraighted going and comming, there is nothing due for fraight vntill the whole Voyage bee performed. So that if shee perish, or bee taken in the comming home, all is lost and nothing due vnto her for any fraight outwards, whereof I haue also had experience by another Ship.</p>
               <p>It is also accounted for a fault, if the Master put forth the Ship to Sea, either without a skilfull Pilot, or without sufficient furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and necessaries, according to the ordinarie clauses of the Charter-parties, or (as in the precedent case) that the other Ship in which the goods were last put in, bee not sufficient, or that the Master doe in an vnlikely time put foorth to Sea.</p>
               <p>The Emperors <hi>Gratian, Theodosius,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> in times past did expresly forbid that no man should aduenture vpon the Seas, from Nouember till Aprill, <hi>Sed Tempora mutantur, &amp; nos mutamur in illis.</hi> Alwayes it is a great fault by the Law, to put to sayle out of any Port in stormie and tempestuous weather.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> if a Master set forth his Ship for to take in a certaine charge or lading, and then takes in any more, especially of other men, hee is to lose all his whole fraight; for by other mens lading hee may endanger the Merchants goods diuers wayes. And in such a case, when goods by stormes are cast ouer-boord, it shal not be made good by contribution or aueridge,<note place="margin">Aueridge.</note> but by the Masters owne purse: For if

hee ouerburthen the Ship aboue the true marke of lading, hee is to pay a fine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> if a ship do enter into any other Port or Harbour, than she was fraighted for, against the Masters will, as by storme or some force, then the goods shall be transported to the Port conditioned, on the Masters charges; but this must be tried by the Masters oath, and of two of his Mariners, or else the Master may be in further danger.</p>
               <p>If any man compell the Master to ouer-burthen Ship or Boat, he may therefore bee accused criminally, and pay the damages happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> if a Merchant put in more goods into a Ship than was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned, then may the Master take what fraight hee please. By the Romane Law it is imputed for a fault to the Master, if hee direct his course by wayes either dangerous, thorough Pirats, enemies, or other euill aduentures. Also if hee doe carrie the Flag of other Nations and not his owne, and thereby incurre any losse or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: For as Packes, Pipes, and all goods, should bee marked with the proper markes of the Merchant to whom they apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: So should Ships bee discerned one from another by their owne Flag.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:14410:77"/>If the like ship be fraighted for two hundred tunnes or therabouts, this addition (<hi>or thereabouts</hi>) is within fiue tunnes commonly taken and vnderstood, as the moitie of the number ten, whereof the whole number is compounded.</p>
                  <p>If the like ship be fraighted by the great, and the burden of it is not expressed in the contract, yet the summe certaine agreed vpon is to be paied without any cauillation.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 If it do not appeare how the agreement was made, but that there is a certain summe agreed vpon; then that agreement being an entire thing, is to be performed, although some died: the reason is, because there was no fault in the master, and therefore the rule of <hi>Re integra</hi> remaineth good: and if a woman be carried ouer and be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of a child in the voyage, yet there is nothing to be paied for the passage of the child which she carieth in her armes.</p>
                  <p>There is an ancient question, Whether a Master of a ship who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to place another in his ship, and to expose him in a certaine place, can demaund any recompence for the same, he neuer hauing placed the partie there; but the partie came into the ship, and so went ouer: wherein they consider the difference betweene liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and rational, or things dead and insensible: and diuers other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which I omit, for it may well bee compared to the disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>de Lana Caprina,</hi> whether the haire of the Bucke be wooll or haire, which putteth me in mind of a prettie tale, which for varietie of theame, I here bestow vpon merrie conceited mariners.</p>

                  <p>A Merchant fraighted a ship with all his furniture by the moneth, and putteth into her the Master and Mariners, and victualled the same at his charges, and maketh a charterpartie with the owner, promising to pay for the vse of the shippe and furniture twentie pound euerie moneth at her returne into the riuer of Thames, and so ladeth in her for the Straits,<note place="margin">Equitie in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faring causes much to be regarded.</note> and to go from Port to Port in seuerall places with merchandise,: and after two yeares, or thereabouts, hauing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken her lading in Barbarie, commeth for London, and by storme and tempest the ship was cast away neere Douer, and the goods were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; hereupon the Merchant denied to pay the fraight monethly to be reckoned, because the ship did not arriue in the riuer of Thames, according to the words in the charterpartie. Herein the owner was much wronged: for the money is due monethly, and the place is named onely to signifie the time when the money was due to be paied; for the ship deserueth wages like vnto a labourer, or like a mariner which serueth by the moneth, who is to be payed for the time he hath serued, although he dies before the voyage be ended, as we find daily that the East-Indies companie payeth to their wiues or friends, <hi>The labourer is worthie of his hire.</hi> The ship is not fraigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the great, to run that aduenture, which is noted before, neither was she wanting her furniture of Cables, Anchors, Sailes, Ropes, or any thing whereby she was disabled to performe the voyage, and might be the cause of the casting away: for if it were so, then there
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14410:78"/>
were great cause giuen to denie the payment of the fraight. Againe, where it was alleaged, that the said owner hath made assurance vpon the ship, for more than the same was worth, and did thereby recouer of the Assurors a benefit towards his losse, this did not concerne the Merchant, but the Assurors: and if the assurance were orderly made, the said Assurors haue paied the same duely, that is to say, If the pollicie or writing of assurance did declare, That the owner did value his ship in such a summe; whereof hereafter you may read in the proper place, intreating of the nature of Assurances. A Merchant valued one barrell of Saffroh at 1000 <abbr>ll</abbr>, hauing priuately put so much in Gold in the same, the Gold was taken, but the Saffron was deliuered, and the Assurors did pay for the Gold. And the like is for Pearles or other things so valued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Item,</hi> when Coffers, Packes, or Pipes, and other marked commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or goods are deliuered close packed or sealed, and afterwards shall be receiued open and loose, the master is to be charged for it, vntill a due triall, and that consideration thereof be had; he must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so answere for the harme which Rats do in the ship to any merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise for want of a Cat.</p>
                  <p>The Merchant on the other side, is to be bound by the said char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpartie to pay the fraight of the goods by him laden, either by the Last, Tunne, or by the Packe and Fardel, according to the agreement; accounting for a Last, Tunne, or other thing, after the rate of a Tunne lading, wherein pesterable wares which take a great deale of roome are excepted, and must be agreed for, and the goods laden are liable for the paiment of the fraight. The Merchant likewise doth coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to pay Pilotage, if a Pilot be vsed to bring the ship into the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor; also primage, and petilodmanidge to the master for the vse of his Cables to discharge the goods,<note place="margin">Pilotage.

               <p>The Master is lyable for all damages sustained by bad Hookes, Ropes, Blockes, or Lines, if the Mariners doe giue notice of it, and they shall beare their parts in the damage, and so is he also to answere any dammage happening by vnreasonable stowing or breaking of goods, and therein he and his companie may be put to their oath.</p>

Yea in case any num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Mariners would conspire, and force the Master to passe to any other Port than to the which he was fraighted, they may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused criminally and punished, as for a capitall crime.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:14410:80"/>And yet if a rebellious Mariner repent in time, and offer amends for a simple rebellion, and the Master notwithstanding refuse, he may follow the Ship and obtaine his hire.</p>
               <p>Mariners ought each one to helpe and assist others on the Seas, or else he that refuseth loseth his hire, and the oath of his fellowes shall be a proofe against him.</p>
               <p>Mariners in a strange Port, should not leaue the Ship without the Masters licence, or fastning her with foure ropes, or else the losse fals vpon them. They are also to attend the Ship vntill shee be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ballasted new, and the Tackle taken downe. And if a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner during the time of her discharge and lading, labour not with the rest of the companie, but goeth idle, and absents himselfe, hee shall pay a fine to the rest of the companie <hi>pro rata.</hi> In a strange Countrey, the one halfe of the company at the least, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine on shipboord, and the rest who goe on land should keepe so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie and abstaine from suspected places, or else should be punished in bodie and purse: like as he who absents himselfe when the Ship is readie to sayle, yea if he giue out himselfe worthier than he is in his calling, hee shall lose his hire, halfe to the Admirall, and the other halfe to the Master. But this especially ought to be executed against an vnworthy Pilot. The Mariner also forfeits his hire, if the Ship breake in any part, and hee helpe not with all his diligence to saue the goods.</p>
               <p>If it chance otherwise than well with the Master, the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are then holden to bring backe the Ship to the Port, from whence shee was fraighted, without delay, except it bee otherwise prouided.</p>
               <p>A Mariner may carrie as much meat out of the Ship, as hee may eat at a meale, but no drinke.</p>
               <p>A Mariner may keepe either his portage in his owne hands, or put forth the same for fraight, and yet the Ship shall not stay vpon the lading of his portage: so that in case the Ship be fully laden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the goods for his portage bee brought in, hee shall onely haue the fraight of so much goods.</p>
               <p>If a Ship passe further than the Mariner was hired, his hire should be accordingly augmented, except hee be hired <hi>a Mareages, mais non a deniers,</hi> as the French man speakes, or by the moneth for all the yeare.</p>
               <p>If a Mariner runne away with his hire vndeserued, hee deserues the Gallowes.</p>
               <p>If a Mariner be hired for a simple Mariner, and afterwards in the voyage findes hiring, to be a Pilot or a Master, he may passe, restoring his former hire; and so it is if he marrie.</p>
               <p>Mariners are not onely to discharge and deliuer goods out of the Ship, but also if no Porters or Carriers bee in those parts, to carrie the same themselues for such hire as other workemen should haue had therefore.</p>
               <p>If it happen a Ship to be prised for debt, or otherwise to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:14410:81"/>
yet the Mariners hire is to be payed, and if she prosper, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their pay in the same money that the fraight is payed with.</p>
               <p>Lastly, a Mariner should neither be arrested, nor taken forth of a Ship making readie to sayle, for any debt, but onely his hire and as much other goods as hee hath in the Ship may be arrested for it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of the debt, and the Master to bee answerable for all; because the Ship is compared to a mans dwelling house, which is his sure refuge by the Law, except it be for a sworne debt, or a penaltie to the King through some crime.</p>

               <p>This Custome comming to the knowledge of the inhabitants of Oleron was recorded, and by them set downe for a Law, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be obserued through all the Sea-coast Townes of France, and yet was first vsed in England, and after vs imitated by the Antuerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and all other Nations there inhabiting when that Citie did flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish. And whereas here in London,<note place="margin">Lombard-street, then the Exchange of Merchants.</note> the meeting amongst Merchants was in Lombard-street in London, as aforesaid (so called, because certaine Italians out of Lombardie kept there a Pawne-house or
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14410:81"/>
Lombard, long before the Royal Exchange was builded by sir <hi>Thomas Gresham</hi> knight) all the policies or writings of Assurances which then were, and now yet are made, do make mention, That it shall be in all things concerning the said Assurances, as was accustomed to be done in Lombard Street in London; which is imitated also in other places of the Low-countries. These Assurances are made in the said Office in the West end of the said Royall Exchange in London, which are of seuerall natures, as followeth, and at diuers and seuerall rates. The Commissioners for the said Assurances are chosen yearely (or at the least some of them) in the beginning of euerie yeare; And at Roan, at the time when the Merchants of all nations chuse their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and Consulls. The chiefe authoritie with vs doth rest in the Lord Maior of London, confirmed by an Act of Parliament in the later time of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (as you may vnderstand by the manner of proceedings for Assurances) for the obtaining whereof, I haue sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times attended the committees of the said parliament, by whose meanes the same was enacted, not without some difficultie: because there was many suits in law by action of Assumpsit before that time, vpon matte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The nature of Assurances.</head>
                  <p>THe nature of Assurances are either vpon goods laden or to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den outwards in such a ship, bound from such a place to such a place. As for example, from London to Saint Lucar vpon Perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anoes or Corne, vntill it be laied on shoare at Siuill, which aduenture is as well in the small ships, lighters, or boats, whereby it is carried vp to the citie of Siuill vntill landing of it, as it was in the ship whereby the said Perpetuanoes or Corne was transported from London to Sain Lucar; and any damage either totally or in part, is to be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Assurors accordingly, and <hi>pro rata</hi> that euerie man hath subscribed in the policie or writing of Assurance, as by the said com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners for Assurances shall be set downe.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made vpon goods laden or to be laden home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in such a ship vnder such a marke, the masters name, and any other circumstances wherby the said goods or commodities may be knowne to be the same that are assured; as laden, or to be laden, by such a man, in such a place, about such a time, &amp;c. which if it be in any ship that was fraighted outwards, may be better specified, or if it be by letters of aduice, it may be described accordingly, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture may also run from the time that the said goods (<hi>posito</hi> oyles of Vtrera) were laden into any Vessell, Lighter, or Boat, to come downe the riuer to Sain Lucar to be laden in such a ship, or any ship (neither naming the ship nor master) vnto the citie of London,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14410:82"/>
and the said Oyles there laied on land. But to declare that the Pipes are marked with such a marke, to be laden by such a man, doth much strengthen the said Assurance, to auoid cauillations, doubts, or controuersies.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made vpon goods laden in a ship for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, which ship is fraighted going and comming; as for Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, or any places in the Mediterranean seas, bound to go into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ports to discharge part of the lading in one place, and the rest in another place; and then to lade againe homewards in such another place: and all this Assurance is one entire Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, vntill the ship be returned home, and the goods safely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued on land.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made vpon goods to be sent or laden from one place to another, and vpon the returne of the prouenue thereof; as from Lixborne to Brasile, and backe againe to Lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne; or from Saint Lucar to the West-Indies, Santo domingo, Perou, or any other places, and so backe againe; or from Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall to the East-Indies, and in like manner to Lixborne againe. All which Assurances are verie daungerous, because a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue aduice when the voyages are performed; and it hath fallen out, that the Assurors haue borne two aduentures for one, the ship making two voyages vnknowne to the Assurors, dwelling in remote places.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made vpon the Ship or Shippes Tackle, Furniture, and Keele of the Shippes, so called because all is to be bound to the Assurors, and likewise the Assurors are liable and bound to answere for the whole Ship, as also for Cables, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and any Furniture, or part of the same, which is also dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and much subiect to Aueridges and other casualties, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be vpon a Shippe that cannot drinke of all waters, whereunto diuers men may lay claime; or for some act perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by her in times past, whereby the same may bee called in question, which is the cause that the price of assurance vpon Ships is almost double.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made vpon goods and merchandises sent by land from one place to another, by the Conductors or Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Venice, Frankford, or any other places, wherein the goods commonly are declared, and the marke also: and this manner of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance is especially performed by the Conductors, who take for the charges a certaine allowance for euerie pound weight that the goods do weigh, and moreouer 2, 3, or 4 vpon the hundreth pounds in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue that the said goods are esteemed to be worth: and he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a sufficient gard of souldiors to conuey the same by land and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to the places intended, which neuerthelesse by a stronger power haue many times been taken by the Freebooters.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made vpon the liues of men, for diuers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, some because their estate is meerely for terme of life, and if
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14410:82"/>
they haue children or friends to leaue some part of their estate vnto, they value their life at so many hundreth pounds for one or more yeares, and cause that value to be assured at fiue, sixe, ten or more for euerie hundreth pounds, and if he do depart this life within that time, the Assurors pay the money; as it happened of late, that one being ingaged for sir <hi>Richard Martin</hi> Knight, Master of the Mint, caused 300 <abbr>ll</abbr> to bee assured vpon the life of the said sir <hi>Richard,</hi> being some 90 yeares of age, and therefore gaue twentie and fiue <hi>pro centum</hi> to the Assurors: The auncient knight dyed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the yeare, and the said Assurors did pay the money. Also one master <hi>Kiddermaster</hi> hauing bought an office of the sixe Clerkes of the Chauncerie, and taken vp money of others, caused for their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance for many yeares together 2000 <abbr>ll</abbr> to be assured vpon his life after foure and fiue in the hundreth, vntill he had paied that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; which is verie commodious.</p>
                  <p>Likewise a traueller vndertaking a voiage to Ierusalem or Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, deliuering out money payable at his returne, will prouidently assure a summe of money vpon his life, either to secure some men that do furnish him with money to performe his voyage, and to put forth the greater summe, or to leaue some meanes vnto his friends, if he should die and neuer returne. So that this office is most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in all humane actions, and men cannot inuent or imagine any thing, but the value of it may be assured, as you may iudge by the former examples. And herein must be noted, that Assurors are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fitly compared vnto Orphanes, because they may endure much wrong, but cannot commit any; for they are to be ordered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by the Commissioners sentence, and must performe the same; to which end the Lord Maior of London (for the time being) hath authoritie to commit them to prison, if in case they do not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the same within a time limited, vntill they do it.</p>
                  <p>Other Assurances are made, and these are the most dangerous of all, because they are made vpon ships and goods, lost or not lost; which is not onely in regard that a ship knowne to be departed, doth not arriue in many moneths after to the appointed place of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge: but also if any newes doe come that the ship and goods is cast away, neuerthelesse if the Assurance be made with the wordes (lost or not lost) the Assurors beare the aduenture of it, vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>esse it can be proued that the partie who caused the Assurance to be made, did see the ship when it was cast away, in this case it is a fraud: as the fraudulent dealing of him that had a rotten ship,<note place="margin">Fraudulent Assurances.</note> and caused assurance to be made vpon her, and caused the same to perish or sinke at the seas, to make the Assurors to pay for his rotten ship which could not be sold by him.</p>
                  <p>In the case of Assurances of lost or not lost, I remember that in the yeare 1583, there was a rich Carracke called the Saint Peter, (comming from the East-Indies for Lixborne) missing a long time, and there was assurance made vpon her in Antuerpe, Roan, and other
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14410:83"/>
places, at 30 <hi>pro centum.</hi> Within three yeares after, there came or did arriue at Lixborne a smaller ship richly laden, which was made of the other ship which was cast on shoare in a certaine Island, and thereupon certaine controuersies did arise betweene the owners of the goods and the Assurors, as also the master and mariners. At last it was adiudged at Lixborne by the sea-law, that the master and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners should haue one third part, and that the Assurors should come in for so much as they had <hi>pro rata</hi> assured, all charges deducted; the ship to be the owners of the former Carracke: with the like conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as aforesaid.</p>

                  <hi>Of the Seas, men of Warre, Fire, Enemies, Pirats, Rouers, Theeues, Iettezons, Letters of Mart, and Couenants, Arrest, Restraints and Detainements of Kings and Princes, and of all other persons,

Barratrie of the Master and Mariners, and of all other Perills, Losses and Misfortunes whatsoeuer they be, and howsoeuer they shall happen or come, to the hurt and detriment of the Goods and Merchandises, or any part or parcell thereof, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, the Policie of assurance saith, That such a man (of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or qualitie soeuer he be) caused himselfe to be assured from such a place to such a place, vpon goods or, &amp;c. laden or to be laden, in the good Ship called the Dragon, or &amp;c. of the burthen of so many Tunnes, whereof A.B. is Master for such a voyage, and to beare the aduentures abouesaid. If the person whose name is vsed in the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, be in time of warre taken to be no friend to the State, there is a danger to pay the said assurance; if (after the subscription of the assurour) the goods should bee arrested and be made forfeited to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the same to the Prince, albeit this was by the late Queene <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> contradicted in the point of honour, as it pleased her of a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and noble disposition to say in a case concerning the Portugalls, subiects to her aduersarie, <hi>Phillip</hi> the second King of Spaine. For in the yeare 1589, a great Ship being taken by certaine men of warre of London, and brought into Plimmouth laden with Pepper, Sugar, and other commodities at Lixborne, to bee deliuered at Venice; it pleased the Lords of her Highnesse most honourable priuie Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell to deliuer vnto me all the Letters, Bills of lading, and Inuoyces which were found in the said Ship (being written in six or seuen seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall languages) to the end I should make true report of the contents of them, to know to whom properly the said goods did appertaine: in doing whereof I found that a great part of the said goods did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Venetians, as also to the Florentines, with whom the said Queene had no quarrell; but that the said goods were assured at Lixborne by the Portugall Merchants. Hereupon there was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to make them good prize, and the matter was long debated, and at last resolued that the parties should haue restitution of their goods, the rather for that the Portugalls were great losers many wayes: which was done accordingly.</p>
               <p>The losses which ordinarily, according to the seasons of the yeare happen vpon the Seas are knowne: the like is, more or lesse, with men of warre, enemies, Pirats, Rouers and theeues,<note place="margin">L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As fraudulent assurances and the losse of stolne goods within shipboord, doth not concern the assurors: so likewise the fault of the Pilot is to bee considered on their behalfe, by the Lawes of <hi>Oleron,</hi> after that the Pilot hath brought the Ship in sure harbour, hee is no further bound or lyable: for then the Master is to see to her bed and her lying, and beare all the rest of her burthen, charge, and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14410:84"/>
danger. So that if before she come into the Port or some safetie, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shee or goods perish or bee spoyled,<note place="margin">Lawes against vnskilfull Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots.</note> the Pilot makes good the same; yea if his fault or ignorance bee so grosse, that the companie sees any manifest and present wracke to all thereby, then may they lead him to the Hatches and strike off his head.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if without apparant danger, some of the skilfullest Mariners deeme that a Pilot is not so skilfull, as hee maketh boast or profession of, then shall he both lose his hire, and double the same to the Admirall and Master, or else (by the Law of Denmarke) passe thrice vnder the Ships Keele. And also if a Pilot hired for a voyage bee not readie against the day, hee shall not onely pay the Master and Merchants damage or stay; but also the fraight that is lost thereby, except sickenesse or some very lawfull excuse qualifie the same.</p>
               <p>The like consideration must be had in the contribution made to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Pirats; for if ship or goods be redeemed from a Pirat, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution must be made by all, because the redemption is made for the safetie of all.<note place="margin">Contribution for Pirats.</note> But if the Pirat be once master of all, and yet take but some speciall goods, whether from Ship or Merchant, and not as a contentation for sparing of the rest: in this case because the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is not assured thereby but freely spared, no contribution is to bee made for the taken goods, to charge any assuror with any part thereof; For oftentimes Pirats take but things at pleasure and not of mind to spoyle. But now adayes commonly it is taken and supposed otherwise, howbeit beyond the Seas the loser of the goods so taken, beareth his owne losse vnlesse it bee assured. It was so iudged by a packe of Stockings taken (out of a ship of Amsterdam bound for Sanlucar) by the Moores of Barbarie, in the yeare 1589, and the assurors payed accordingly, who had assured onely vpon that Packe: whereas if it had bin cast into an Aueridge to make all the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surors of that Ship contributarie, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aid assurors had beene much eased.<note place="margin">Contribution for spoyled goods.</note> And it is therefore to be obserued, and the Law of <hi>Oleron</hi> is, If by the losing of any cast goods, or vpon any needfull occasion the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining goods be spoyled, either with wet or otherwise, a contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall bee made proportionable for so much as they are made worse.</p>
               <p>Againe, if it be needfull to lighten a Ship, for her easier entrie into the harbour or channell,<note place="margin">Contribution for lightening</note> two parts of the losse fall vpon the goods, and the third part vpon the Ship, vnlesse the Ship is more worth than the lading, and that the charge of goods bee not the cause of her inabilitie to enter, but some bad qualitie proceeding of the Ship it selfe, or that otherwayes it be prouided in the Charter-party, that the goods shall bee fully deliuered at the Port couenanted and appointed for them. Condition makes law, which concerneth the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surors also to looke vnto. In which case it is also to bee obserued, That if by occasion of lightening, the goods which are in the Boat or Lighter perish, the Ship and the goods remaining on shipboord shall make good the said losse. But on the contrarie, if the Ship and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:14410:84"/>
goods remaining perish, after the Lighter is once safe, no contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall be set vpon the goods in the Lighter, because it is a certaine rule, That goods are lyable onely to contribution, when ship and goods come safe to the Port.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> contribution should be for the Pilots fee,<note place="margin">Contribution for Pilots.</note> that hath brought the Ship into an vnknowne Port for her safegard, as also to raise her off ground, when the fault is not in the Master.</p>
               <p>So is it when two Ships rush and crosse one ouer another, and the company sweare, that it lay not in their power to stay the same, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution must bee made for the repairation of both their losses; but not so if one of them perish, for which an Action may be brought against the negligent Master or Mariner, who did make her loose. And therefore, if such a chance doe happen in the day time by a Ship vnder sayle, against a Ship riding at Anchor; then the Master of that sayling Ship, shall make good the damage and hurt of the other, to the vttermost: and the like shall bee done, if in the night the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ship doe put forth fire and light, or make any crying to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warne the other.</p>
               <p>It also appertaineth to this Argument; If some sort of goods, as Salt, or Corne, be laid on heap by diuers parteners in one Ship, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction, and that the Master deliuer to any of them their due measure, and before the rest receiue their measures, the remaining Salt or Corne washes or loses; he that had the hap to bee first ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, enioyes it fully without any contribution to the parteners;<note place="margin">First come, first serued.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when these goods were put into the Ship, it was deliuered to the Master, <hi>Tanquam in creditum,</hi> and so hee is become owner, as of money lent, which men are not bound to redeliuer in the selfe same pieces, but in value or such like coyne, except there bee some condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion past to the contrarie. And albeit this is not to be imputed vnto the Master as a fault, yet if hee that receiueth a losse thereby, will bring in this as an Aueridge, and charge the assurors with contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is vniust, for the reason aforesaid; and the Master must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie deliuer to one man before another. And therefore in the next Chapter wee will set downe the manner of execution for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions, otherwise called Aueridges.</p>
               <p>Concerning the danger and aduenture of Letters of Mart,<note place="margin">Letters of Mart.</note> or Contremart, <hi>Siue ius Reprisaliarum,</hi> or Letters of Marque, euery one knoweth that men hauing these Commissions or Letters from their Prince, are very vigilant in all places to surprize Merchants Ships and goods; for in this, one extremitie doth inforce another extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, when a man is oppressed with robberie; spoyles, and violence on the Seas, by men (falsly professing friends) in such sort, that no petition, intercession, or trauell, can procure a mans right, but that the subiect of one Prince hath open deniall of iustice, or restitution of goods cannot be had at the hands of a subiect of another Prince, nor of the Prince himselfe, who should suppresse iniuries and wrongs: Then (because such vniust dealing doe import iust cause of hostilitie
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14410:85"/>
and warfare) may these Letters of Mart bee procured, to the end men may haue restitution or recompence of their losses, especially, because these proceedings seeme to denounce a warre without any Proclamation, shewing vnto other Nations the like distastfull fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours as they shew vnto vs, which are allowed to bee done by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, Reasons, and also by Statute Law in Scotland, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in England: The assurors therefore cannot bee fauoured herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Detainment of Princes.</note>The next is <hi>Arrests, Restraints, and detainements of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of all other Persons</hi> happening both in time of warre and peace, committed by the publike authoritie of Princes, as also by priuate persons, both wayes dangerous.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Priuiledged Ships.</note>There are in all Countries Priuiledged Ships and Boates, seruing the Countrey or the Prince, which haue great Prerogatiues, and are free of Impost and Customes, and not subiect to arrests; therefore the assurors are not to care for them, for they are to serue the Prince: and all Ships are subiect to this seruice vpon command, and if they refuse, their Ships are forfeited by the Sea-lawes: therefore in these cases the fauour of the Admirall is alwayes required. It is an ordinarie matter in Spaine and Portugall, to make an Embargo vpon all Ships, at the departure of the West-India Fleet, or the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rackes for the East-Indies; and many times vpon other occasions, whereby Merchants Ships being laden are much hindered, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it bee with Wines, Oyles, Raisons, and such like perishable wares. Now if the owner of the goods, shall thinke that his wares doe perish, lying two or three moneths laden, or if it be Corne that may become hote and spoyled; hee may renounce these goods or wares to the assurors, and thereby bring a great losse vpon them. Yet neuerthelesse he shall not need to abandon the goods, for by the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie of assurance it is alwayes prouided, That in case of any misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, it is lawfull for him,<note place="margin">A Prouiso in the Policies of assurance.</note> his Factor or Assignes, or his Seruants, or any of them, to sue, labour and trauell for in and about the defence, safegard, or recouerie of the goods, and any part thereof. And that the assurors shall contribute, each according to the rate and quantitie of the summe by him assured. So that albeit, that it doe fall out that the goods be not vtterly lost when the Ship is cast away, the assured must recouer his whole money; because hee hath authoritie by the Policie of assurance to recouer them, or any part of them, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and he is afterwards to yeeld an account thereof, for so much as doth concerne euery man ratably: otherwise the assured should bee discouraged, if by those meanes he should make his assurance intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and subiect to all cauilations, and to the interruption of so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and laudable a Custome, as the matter of assurance is. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as in the matter in hand, wee haue a care for the assurors, that they should not bee deceiued by those that cause assurances to bee made: so on the other side, we would auoid to minister any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:14410:85"/>
be left to the Commissioners determination, who are (or should bee at the least) best able to examine the premisses.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the <hi>Arrests</hi> of particular persons,<note place="margin">Arrests vpon Ships.</note> vpon Ship or goods, the assured can make no renunciation to charge the Assurors with any losse either in the totall or part, because vpon caution giuen to answere the law, the ship or goods arrested are instantly cleered in all places, either heere or beyond the seas, where the arrests are made, wherein the iurisdiction of all courts for sea-faring causes are verie carefull to see expedition vsed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barratrie of the Master and Mariners</hi> can hardly be auoided,<note place="margin">Barratrie of the Master.</note> but by a prouident care to know them, or at the least the Master of the ship whereupon the assurance is made. And if he be a carefull man, the danger of fire aboue mentioned, will be the lesse; for the ship-boyes must be looked vnto euerie night and day. And in this case let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so consider the Assurors; for it hath oftentimes happened, that by a candle vnaduisedly vsed by the boyes, or otherwise before the ships were vnladen, they haue bin set on fire and burned to the verie keele, with all the goods in them, and the Assurors haue pated the summes of money by them assured: neuerthelesse herein the Assurors might haue beene wronged, although they beare the aduenture vntill the goods be landed; for it commeth to passe many times, that whole ships ladings are sold on ship-boord and neuer discharged, because they should auoid the paiment of Customes and Imposts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they will breake no bulke, but depart for some other place. <hi>viz.</hi> Ships laden with Gascoyne Wines do come from Middleborough to London, which haue beene bought by the great, and either the seller of the Wines doth beare the aduenture of the seas, or the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. So euerie yeare there are diuers ships which come from Norway laden with Deale-boords, Plankes, Masts, and the like commodities, which being entred into the riuer of Thames for two or more daies, will depart againe for Spaine, or some places in the Straits, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they haue made their bargaine with the Merchant: in like manner diuers other ships laden with other commodities, vpon the like bargaines and contracts, will make further voyages, and not discharge in the place were it was first intended and named in the policie of Assurance. Now if after such a bargaine made, the ship and goods (either by fire, or any other misfortune) do perish, the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surors are not to answere for that losse, notwithstanding the generall words (<hi>And of all other Perills, Losses and Misfortunes whatsoeuer they be, and howsoeuer they shall happen or come, to the hurt and detriment of the Goods and Merchandises, or any part or parcell thereof</hi>) contained in the policie of Assurance as aforesaid. I hold it also conuenient to aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise the Assurors of a case of mine owne experience: In the yeare 1589 I caused the ship of <hi>Monsieur Gourdan</hi> gouernour of Calais, to be fraighted for Lixborne, and to returne backe againe to Calais or London: <note place="margin">A case to be considered in Assurances.</note> the said ship (being arriued at Lixborne) was laden with Sugars, Pepper, and other commodities to returne for London;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:14410:86"/>
whereupon I caused six thousand French crownes to be assured at Roan. It happened that the said ship was cast away vpon the coast of France, in comming homewards, and all the goods were vtterly lost; whereupon intimation being made to the Assurors, I sent to the Commissioners of assurances at Roan, all my proofe concerning the lading of the said ship, hoping to recouer the money assured; but vpon examination of the Bills of lading, declaring truely the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and quantitie of the goods, my factor of Lixborne (considering the dangerous time of warre, and my dwelling in London) left the place of her discharge in Blanke, and by letters ouerland gaue me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, which was made apparant to the said Commissioners; yet neuerthelesse (after the examination of the sea-lawes and customes, and the Paracer had of all experienced Merchants) it was sentenced against me, and the Assurors were cleered, and made onely a resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the money receiued by them for their <hi>Premio,</hi> and yet of that they did abate one halfe or <hi>medio por ciento,</hi> as it were tenne shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings for euerie hundreth pound for their subscribing to the policie of Assurance, to my verie great losse.</p>
               <p>To this purpose doth appertaine another propertie of Assurances, which happeneth, when Merchants cause a greater summe to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured than the goods are worth or amount vnto when they are laden into any ship which is expected home wards, making account that their Factors will send them greater returnes than they do: in this case the Custome is,<note place="margin">A rare custome in Assurances.</note> that those Assurors that haue last subscribed to the policie of Assurance, beare not any aduenture at all, and must make restitution of the <hi>Premium</hi> by them receiued, abating one halfe in the hundreth for their subscription, as in the case aforesaid, and this is duely obserued; and so a Law not obserued is inferior to a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome well obserued.</p>
               <p>To conclude the point of policies of Assurances, let vs note, that of necessitie it is required as a consideration precedent, that the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surors must acknowledge themselues to be satisfied of the <hi>Premium</hi> of Assurance, at the hands of the assured, or any other who doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to pay them: which beyond the seas is commonly payed within six moneths, because that Merchants assuring each to other, may rescounter their <hi>Premios,</hi> in the accounts kept thereof betweene them; for herein is vsed great trust and confidence betweene them: and this appeareth also by euerie mans vnderwriting in the said poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Assurance, in these words, I <hi>A. B.</hi> am content with this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance (which God preserue) for the summe of one hundreth pounds. London this 10 of August 1620, &amp;c. according to the summe and time.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>auing intreated of Contributions or Aueridges in regard of Assurors, now it behoueth vs somewhat to speake of the manner how this is executed and performed; by some called Scot and Lot.</p>
               <p>In the case of casting of goods in tempestious weather, for preseruation of life and goods, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is to consult with the mariners, and if they consent not, yet the master may cast some goods, if the storme continue: but if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant be present, let him begin to cast, saith the law of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and next the mariners, who if they unbesill any part to their owne vse of that which should be cast, are to answere the double.</p>
               <p>When the master shall come on land, he must (with the most part of his companie) sweare that he did cast the said goods, for no other cause, but for the safetie of ship, goods and lines, which are to be cast into an Aueridge or Contribution vpon ship &amp; goods, whether they be burdensome or of small volume, as mony, Iewels or such like, not being weightie; things vpon a mans bodie, victualls, and such like excepted.</p>
               <p>But here ariseth a question, Whether goods laden aboue the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope, or forbidden goods to be transported, shall be answered by Contribution? Sure if such goods happen to be the cause of any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger or damage, the master shall beare the losse, and also criminally be prosecuted. But if goods vnaduisedly (without consent of the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner) be cast out on the suddaine, the owner may vpon his conscience esteeme them to the verie value, because the companie (by their rash proceeding) hath lost the priuiledge they had to esteeme and appraise the said goods.</p>
               <p>Also any ships geare or apparrell lost by storme, is not within Aue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge, and accounted like vnto a workeman breaking or spoyling his tooles, or ordinarie instruments. The like is for goods cast, which were brought within ship-boord, without the master or his pursers knowledge.</p>
               <p>In the rating of goods by way of Contribution, this order is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, If they chance to be cast before halfe the voyage performed, then they are to be esteemed at the price they cost; if after, then at the price as the rest, or the like shall be sold at the place of discharge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:14410:87"/>The person (whose goods haue beene cast) is to be carefull to haue the same estimated before the ship doe discharge, and to deale with the master for that purpose. For the law doth intend that the goods deliuered vnto him, are not only as a pawne or pledge for his fraight, but also bound to answere all such Contributions and Aueridges that may happen; and therefore the master may put his helping hand thereunto, vntill satisfaction be made, albeit that commonly the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of other mens goods are not allowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Three sorts or manner of goods token vpon the sea.</note>Herein let vs now consider of things taken vpon the sea, which are of three sorts: the first we haue alreadie noted to be goods taken by Letters of Mart by, <hi>ius represaliarum</hi>; the second are taken from Pirats or sea Rouers; and the third from professed enemies. Touching that which is taken from Pirats, seeing they be goods which they haue wrongfully taken from others, whether they be found in their owne or their successors possession; these are esteemed to be a iust prise or prey to any taker of them, so that account be made of them to the Admirall. And in case where the taker doth find the goods of his friend or countrieman with the Pirat, it is reasonable that restitution be made, vpon good consideration of the charges and danger sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned concerning the same.</p>
               <p>If a ship or goods be taken from a professed enemie, it is to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in according to the authoritie whereby it was taken. But if goods be taken by a professed enemie, and afterwards the said goods are taken againe from him, and the true owner doth claime them, it ought to be restored to the owner; for the law taketh these goods to be as receiued and not taken, yet with good recompence for them.</p>
               <p>But when such goods become a lawfull prise to the taker, then the Admirall is to haue his tenth part) according to the offer which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> made vnto God, of the spoyle which he tooke of the fine kings) and the remainder of the goods so taken, is to be proportionably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided betweene the takers, or according to the composition former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made. In these cases there is alwaies a fauourable consideration to be had: which is the cause, that if two forreine nations be at warre, and the one take a ship from the other, and bring her into a port or road within the bounds of a neuterall nation, alike friend to both; then may the Admirall of that nation ordaine that ship to be restored to her owner, and the persons captiue to their former libertie, euen as if she had beene brought backe to her owne port or countrie againe.

               <p n="4">4 To know by the Map or Sea-cardes, the distance of the place or countrey where the Ship is to sayle, and the dangers of knowne rockes and sands.</p>
               <p n="5">5 To haue a regard what winde must serue, and the true season of the yeare, which maketh a difference in the price of assurance; as for example, an East or North-east winde driueth from the land for Spaine, which is lesse dangerous, and receiuing six or seuen <hi>pro ciento,</hi> when a Westerne, or North-west, or South-west (driuing from thence vpon the land) is to giue seuen or eight <hi>pro ciento:</hi> in Winter two in the hundreth more than in Summer, vnlesse it be by calmes in places dangerous, as now in the Straights for the Turkish Pirats and without it, the Moores of Barbarie, or other theeues.

               <p n="9">9 To know what Ordnance and Munition the Ship is prouided withall, and not to assure vpon the bottome of the Ship, but with good aduice.</p>
               <p n="10">10 If you assure vpon any particular goods marked, to know whether they bee laden in the bottome of the Ship, and there is danger of wetting and spoiling; if aboue in the Ship, there is danger of Pirats, or of casting ouerboord; about the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is best.</p>
               <p n="11">11 To bee aduised not to assure, beyond the limitation of your knowledge by the meanes of others, or from Lixborne to Brazell, or from Venice to Tripoly, or such like voyages, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you cannot conueniently haue notice from time to time.</p>

And if the assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red doth thinke conuenient, either for that hee hath almost assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the value of his goods, or that hee would haue the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the assurors, when there is hope of recouerie of any part thereof, or any other cause which may mooue him: then I say,<note place="margin">Renunciation of goods.</note> the party assured may make renunciation of all the goods to the assurors, and hee shall come in as an assuror, for so much as shall appeare that he hath himselfe borne aduenture of; and the assurors are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributaries to the charges of the pursuit, and they may ioyntly argee therein and appoint their seruants, or other persons to follow the same; and this renunciation is also recorded in the said Office accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But if afterwardes it shall bee found, that the assured hath made assurance or caused himselfe to bee assured, for more than the goods laden for his account did cost; then the last assurors which haue subscribed to the Policie, shall enioy the benefit thereof, as hath beene declared. For by the Custome of Assurances it is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that to auoid cauilations, euery Assuror shall be bound <hi>ipso facto</hi> to the said Assurance, hauing a respect to the augmentation of trafficke and commerce, according to the Maxime, It is better to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a mischiefe than an inconuenience; the mischiefe being attributed to one or some particular persons, and the inconuenience to the whole Common-wealth in generall.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the partie assured doth procure his testimonialls, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14410:89"/>
or any other euidences concerning the said losse, declaring the manner and place, the cause, with all circumstances, either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations in the said Office of Assurances, or in the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miraltie, with all such other proofe as by letters and all other meanes hee can attaine vnto:<note place="margin">Proofe of the Assurors.</note> all which hee hath readie, or bringeth into the Office, together with the Charterpartie of fraightment, if hee haue the same; the Policie of Assurance, the Bill of Lading, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voice of the goods, the Factors Letter of lading, wherein the Bill was inclosed, or any other Letters made for the declaration and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of all the matter in question: which are all examined by the Commissioners for Assurances, at seuerall appointed dayes for hearing, procured by the assured; at which times all the assurors are warned to appeare, and record is made also of their meetings and ☞ proceedings. And heerein is to bee obserued, that it may many times happen, that the assured hath caused some assurance to bee made in some other place vpon the said goods also: Therefore the Commissioners (if it bee by the assurors required) may examine the assured thereupon by oath, and then deale therein as they find cause, according to the Custome of Assurances.</p>
               <p>To abbreuiate the questions which the Ciuilians haue made, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this argument of Assurances, writing <hi>De assicurationibus,</hi> I haue thought good to let euery Merchant vnderstand, that obseruing the forme of the policie of Assurances, with the obseruation before declared, all the said questions will bee preuented, and to proue the same by Demonstratiue Reasons vpon euery question alleaged, as followeth.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>An abridgement of Questions of Assurances.</head>
                  <p n="1">1 WHether an assurance made vpon a Ship named, is to be vnderstood of the ship or of the goods laden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or vpon both?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answere,</hi> When the name of the ship is expressed according to the said policie of Assurance made vpon the very Keele of the ship of such a burthen, there is no man endued with reason, that will attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this Assurance to extend to the goods laden in the same, much lesse to both, when the Ship is onely named and no goods at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Whether an Assurance made vpon one thousand Hides, laden in such a ship, from such a place, to such a place be good, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the seuerall sorts of Hides laden therein?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> In all policies of Assurances the words runne Generall vpon the principall wares, and all other commodities or goods laden, or to be laden by such a man, for the account of him or any other; and so this (Generall) includeth all particular things, which when assurance is made vpon them are named and specified, as heereafter is also declared.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Whether vpon vncertaine things to bee laden, the assurance bee good?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:14410:89"/>
                     <hi>A.</hi> When assurances are made vpon goods laden, or to bee laden, as aforesaid; the said assurance must needes bee of validitie, for the word Goods and Merchandises comprehendeth all vncertaine things vendible: and if it were some particular thing, it is alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Whether an assurance made vpon one Sacke of Wooll bee good, when there is many Sackes of Woolles in the same Ship?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The question is preuented by the Custome of Assurances, which is, that an assurance made vpon any particular goods, must bee declared by the particular marke of the goods belonging to such an owner, or any other; and if there be more of the said marke, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber therefore is added: and if the number were alike, the weight may distinguish the same; whereby the one Sack being throwne ouer boord for safegard of the ship and goods, may bee cast into a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; or being taken by Pirats, the assurors are to pay for it: so this question is friuolous, as many other are, and breedeth but contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to imbibe Merchants braines with them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The like is when the assurance is made vpon commodities or goods without name, or not naming the number, weight, or measure, but expressing the marke of all goods laden or to bee laden, as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Whether the assuror is to haue his <hi>Premio</hi> or Salarie, vpon a conditionall assurance, or not?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> There is no conditionall assurance made, but with exception of some aduentures not to bee borne by the assuror; which are not comprized in the policie of assurance, and therefore the <hi>Premio</hi> is due to the assuror.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Whether an assurance made is to bee vnderstood of the first voyage which the ship doth make after the assurance is made, and the ship appointed for lading?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This is to be vnderstood alwayes of the first voyage, vnlesse there were a declaration of a second voyage in the policie of assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and therefore I haue noted a caueat for assurors to bee carefull how they cause other men to assure for them in remote places, not to make them lyable to two voyages for one assurance, nor to be subiect to a second voyage when the first is performed, but to be vigilant in their actions.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Whether an assurance made for the tempest of the Seas, bee also to be vnderstood for Theeues or Robbers vpon the Seas?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The generall and ordinarie policie of assurance, containing all aduentures, sheweth, that the assuror is to beare the aduenture of both these; and if it were otherwise in particular, it must bee decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: So that this distinction is vaine.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The like may be said to the question, Whether an assurance made by stipulation, be a contract or not? or whether it be couentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or conditionall? wherein this distinction is of no moment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Whether an assuror (hauing payed the Merchant for goods
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14410:90"/>
lost by him assured, may afterwards, if the goods were found againe or recouered) restore the goods to the Merchant, and call for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (which he paied) backe againe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It appeareth plainely by all policies of Assurance, That the Assuror doth condescend that the Merchant shall haue full power and authoritie by himselfe or his Factors and Seruants, to sue for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie of the goods, and that the Assurors shall contribute to the charges <hi>pro rata</hi> of their summes by them assured respectiuely: but the Merchant is not therefore hindered to recouer the money of the Assurors, neither can one particular Assuror haue all the goods; for the Merchant relinquishing the goods to the Assuror, reserueth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies his part therein which he hath not assured, which he detaineth in nature of an Assuror, so that the Assuror hath not conuenient meanes to performe the contents of the question; neuerthelesse, if the Merchant will, hee may buy the goods so recouered of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surors, as they can agree; but then is the question altered, and not the same.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Whether an Assuror is to answere any hurt or damage done to the goods by Mice, Rats, or any other vermine, especially moaths?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> By the policie of Assurance that Assuror is to answere for all damages, detriment, or hurt which shall happen to the goods after his vnderwriting: but if he can proue the hurt or damage was before done in the ware-house or other place, he is not bound to answere the same.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Whether goods lost in the ship boat, being vnladen out of the ship, or being to be laden into the ship, shall be answered by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surors, or what may be laied to the charge of the Assurors by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This question consisteth of two points: the answere to the first is plaine, according to the policies of Assurances, where it is specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the aduenture shall begin vpon the goods laden in any Boat, Vessell, or Crayer to be laied aboard of such a Ship, or being dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of the Ship, the aduenture to continue till the goods be safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly landed: but to the second, the answere is not so plaine, because it dependeth vpon the sea-law, and must be considered accordingly. For as we haue noted in the chapter of Contributions, if by occasion of lightening, the goods which are put into the Boat or Lighter perish, the ship and remaining goods in the ship shall answere for the same: but on the contrarie, if the ship and remaining goods perish after the Boat or Lighter is once safe, no contribution shall be on the goods in the Lighter; for the law is, That the goods shall onely be lyable to contributions, when ship and goods are safely arriued to their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded port of discharge: according to this rule is the Assuror to answer for contributions <hi>pro rata</hi> of the summe by him assured.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Whether assurance made for pirats, is to be vnderstood also for theeues which by night steale the goods from the ship?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> The answere is so euident, that both the one and the other is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:14410:90"/>
comprised in the Assurance, as there needeth no other explanation.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 Whether an Assurance made at one time vpon goods to be bought and intended to be laden, and afterwards found not to be bought at the same time, but at another time, doth bind the Assurors to pay the losse?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> This question is worthie the consideration, and doth meerely consist in the obseruation of time, &amp; not in the buying of the goods, although it be so propounded; for the time maketh great difference in the assurance, as I haue noted before. Goods laden in the Summer are not in aduenture comparable to the Winter when stormes and tempests do arise, and therefore are not the Assurors to be made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to this assurance; for the custome herein is cleere and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring with the Law of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and therefore not comprised in the tenor of the policies of Assurances, which is the cause also that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are to haue a speciall regard to the Masters of ships whether they be vicious or diligent: for the loue of women and wine maketh them to loose the oportunitie of time; so that by contrarie windes their voyage is retarded, and which was to be made in Summer fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out to bee in Winter, subiect to eminent daungers and losses, whereunto the Assurors become liable, as is declared, whether it be by accident, misfortune, casualtie, rare successes and negligences of Masters and Mariners vnlooked for and happening in strange manner sodenly.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Whether an Assuror be liable to the aduenture of goods ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from one ship into another?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> Sometimes in policies of Assurances it happeneth that vpon some especiall consideration, this clause forbidding the transferring of goods is inserted, because in time of hostilitie or warres betweene princes, it might fall out to be vnladen in such ships of those conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding princes, whereby the aduenture would be farre greater. But according to the vsuall Assurances which are made generally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any exception, the Assuror is liable thereunto: for it is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that the Master of a ship without some good and accidentall cause, would not put the goods from one ship into another, but would deliuer them (according to the charterpartie) at the appointed place, which is the cause that (when assurance is made vpon some particular goods laden in such a ship, vnder such a marke) the Policie maketh mention of the goods laden to be transported and deliuered to such a place by the ship, or by any other ship or vessell vntill they bee safely landed, so that in all these and the like the condition maketh the law.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 Now there is a question, Whether an Assuror is answereable to the assurance of goods to beare the aduenture if no goods were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, or but part of the goods?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> If a man do bind or oblige a thing to be found in such a place, and it is not found there; euerie man knoweth that the said thing tied to a locall place cannot be bound thereby, because it is a bodie
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:14410:91"/>
named without substance, and not <hi>in Rerum natura,</hi> and there would be vnderstood a priuation without being, and where there is not <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria &amp; forma,</hi> first, there can be no priuation: but if part of the goods were laden, then the Assurors are liable for so much as that part of goods did cost or amount vnto: albeit that in this (as I haue touched before) custome is preferred aboue law;<note place="margin">Custome to be aboue law in this particular</note> for the ciuile law (if there be many Assurors in a ship vpon the goods laden therein) maketh all the Assurors liable <hi>pro rata,</hi> as they haue assured according to the said part of goods laden, if a losse do happen: or if there be cause to restore the <hi>Premio</hi> or sallarie of assurance in part. But the custome of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances doth impose the losse vpon those Assurors which did first vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwrite, and the later vnderwriters of the Assurors do not beare any part of the losse, but must make restitution of the <hi>Premio,</hi> and reserue onely one halfe vpon the hundreth pounds, or 10 <hi>ss</hi> for their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing in the policie of Assurance, as is obserued. The Ciuillians therefore haue noted, That in Assurances the customes of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawes, and vse amongst Merchants is chiefely to be regarded and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, if a ship bound for a certaine port (being at sea) be driuen backe to the same from whence it departed, and by tempest be cast away, the Assurors are to aunswere the damage of the goods laden therein, for so much as they did assure, as they do in other casu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties. Assurors therefore are rightly exempted by the Diuines and Canonists to be no manner of waies vsurors, taking a benefit by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The matter of losse being well examined and made plaine, the Commissioners then with a mature deliberation do set downe their determination and sentence, That the Assurors shall pay euerie one the mony by him assured; and if thereupon any one do denie to make payment accordingly, then (vpon certificate to the Lord Maior of London, and some of the said Commissioners made of his refusall) they haue by act of Parliament (as aforesaid) authoritie to commit the said Assuror to prison, there to remaine vntill he doe pay or satisfie the said sentence or finall decree, which no man of any credit will incurre. And thus is this laudable custome established in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and beyond the seas they are compelled by the Magistrates to performe the like ordinances or sentences pronounced in the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Assurances.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Merchant or the assured, together with the assurors, have great cause of encouragement to looke after the goods of a Shipwrecke, for there is no forfeiture of the said goods; but with all humanitie euerie man is bound to aid them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and whosoeuer steales any such goods, hee shall pay fourefold to the owner thereof, if hee bee pursued within a yeare and a day, and as much to the Prince or Admirall: wherein the Sea-law is so strict, that the stealing of a nayle or the value thereof, maketh the party guiltie to the rest of the goods; so that by the ordinance of the Emperor <hi>Antonius,</hi> The theese or rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of such goods should bee beaten, and banished for three yeares; or if hee were of base condition, scourged to the Gallies. For he that will not helpe such distressed men, shall bee counted as a murtherer: and therefore may no man hinder Ships to tye their ropes, or lay their anchors on land. And therefore did <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Emperour or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, That all men hauing possessions on the coasts, should attend carefully vpon such chances, otherwise they to be answerable for all things missing by stealth or robberie.</p>
               <p>If no man in due time claime such a wrecke, then it belongeth to the Prince or Admirall: and any action for Shipwrecke must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be commenced within a yeare and a day.</p>
               <p>Wherein also is to be noted, That if the Ship onely perish and the goods bee saued, then the goods shall pay the tenth, or the fifth, as the difficultie of the sauing thereof shall require. For Gold, Siluer, Silke, and the like things of easie transportation, should pay lesse than goods of greater weight and burthensome for carriage, as being in greater danger, except the Master carry in his Ship to a place where hee should not, and then is the Merchant free of the Masters losse. Now of things found vpon the Seas, or within the flood-mark, these are of three sorts, either found on the streame floating, and then are called Floatson; or found on the Sea bottome,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Floatson. Lagon.</hi>
                  </note> and drawne vp from it, and then called Lagon; or found on land, but within the Sea-flood, or cast forth there by storme and the water, and then are called Ietson.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ietson.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:14410:92"/>Concerning Floatson and Ietson, whether things be cast vp by Shipwrecke, or else left or lost through casting in stormes, the finders thereof (as some Lawyers are of opinion) should doe therewith as with other goods found vpon land, that is, to proclaime the same to be forthcomming to the true owner, because the loser remaineth still proprietarie of them: and if no man claime the same, the finder to keepe the same to himselfe. But by the Rhodian Law, the finder hath one fifth part for the sauing. And in France by the Admiraltie of Rochell, they allow <hi>Pour le Droict de sauuage</hi> one third part, which my selfe haue allowed of eightie pipes of Oyle, and twentie two Butts of Sackes, which became Floatson out of a Ship of Diepe, called the Desire, which did perish neere the Island of <hi>Saint Martin de Rea,</hi> not farre from Oleron, in the yeare 1589, the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth late deceased being then but King of Nauarre. So hath a Diuer for drowned goods,<note place="margin">Allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ee to Diuers in the Seas.</note> one third part vpon eight Cubits deepe, and vpon fifteene Cubits hee hath halfe, and vpon one Cubit but a tenth; which of late yeares was accordingly allowed in some part of Ireland, for drawing vp some Ordnance of the Ships, which of the Spanish Armada did perish vpon the coast, <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. But by the Custome now vsed, euerie man of some qualitie will claime all as his owne, if it commeth vpon his land, contrarie to the Law of Oleron, which giues it to the finder.</p>
               <p>If Ships or Boats are found on the Sea, or vpon the coast, without any liuing creature therein, and no man claiming the same within a yeare and a day; then the halfe is allowed to the finder, and the other halfe to the Prince. But of late yeares all is left to the arbitrement of the Admiralls, to consider the finder or taker with some portion for his trauells, charges, and danger. And if the finder conceale such goods, whether Anchor, Timber, Iewels, dead men with money or Iewels about them, hee not onely loseth his part, but also shall bee fined at the will and pleasure of the Admirall.</p>
               <p>If Whales, or Regall Fishes, Ships or Boats without liuing thing in them, be driuen by force of winde and waues onely to any coast or land, then all and wholly doth appertaine to the Admirall. But in the yeare 1617, a great Whale being found on the coast in Suffolke, where Sir <hi>Robert Lloyd</hi> Knight was Admirall for the late Queene <hi>Anne,</hi> his Maiesties Consort, for her lands there; he took not the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit hereof, as hee might haue done, but the said Queene had the same.</p>
               <p>In like manner, a <hi>Deo dando</hi> or Deodant appertaineth to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall, that is to say, The thing (whether Ship or Boat) that caused the death of a man, or whereby a man did perish vnawares.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point, let vs remember that in causes of spoile, it is sufficient by the Lawes of England, for the spoiled to prooue his goods by his marke, and the Shipwrecke may not only be proued by the persons liuing, but also by the persons who were present at the preparation of their voyage, euen their owne parents and children, if none of the Ship (broken) be aliue.</p>

               <p>And first it is generally obserued and accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That if Owners of a ship newly builded or bought betweene them, shall fall out and be at variance, the said ship shall bee imployed and make one voyage first,<note place="margin">Law of Oleron.</note> vpon their common charges and aduenture, before any of the parteners bee heard to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and discharge their part. And after that, if they cannot agree, he who desires to be free, is to offer to the rest his part, and to set the same vpon a price, as he will either hold or sell; which if hee will not doe, and yet refuseth to set the ship forth with the rest of the Owners or Parteners, then may they rigge the said ship at their owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and also vpon the aduenture of the refuser, so farre as his part doth extend, without any account to bee made vnto him of any part of the profit at her returne. But they are onely bound to him to bring her home safe, or the value of his part to bee answerable for, and that iustly; because ships were made and inuented in common for the vse of all men, euen of them that dwell in the Mountaines, as on the Sea coasts, and ordained for sayling and not to lie idle and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupied. But if the persons, who haue most part of the ship, refuse to abide in Partenership with him who hath a small part, that neither hee can sell his part at a price, without great losse, nor is yet able for want of meanes to attaine or buy their parts; then are they all bound to put the ship to an appraisement, and so to dispose of her by sale, or setting of her forth on a voyage, accordingly; by meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their discord may be ended and the ship not spoyled. And if for want of buyers in that place, the poore partener can neither auoid the oppression of the richer, nor yet the rich satisfie the poore man, which may also be wilfull, then may the Iudge of the Admiraltie, or the ordinarie Iudge deale and decree the same, as hee may doe <hi>in omnibus alijs bonae fidei actionibus:</hi> And consider of all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:14410:93"/>
of the persons, of the matter of their difference, and of their motiues; that thereupon he may administer Iustice in giuing euerie man his due right.</p>
               <p>In cases where Owners doe agree, and voyages are vndertaken, there the Master of the ship is placed by the Owners,<note place="margin">A Master pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Owners.</note> and they ought to make good the Masters fact and deed; so that the Master may lay his action vpon any one of the Owners: but the rest of the Owners shall <hi>pro rata</hi> of their portions be contributarie thereunto, except the handling of the Ship be so seuerally diuided amongst them, or that the Master haue not his Power and Commission of them all; or that the Master hath bound himselfe aboue his Commission, as if he haue taken vp money to mend the ship, when as he needs it not, or that hee haue no Commission at all: in which case the lender committeth an ouersight, and hath no remedie but against the Master. But if there were cause of mending the ship, and the Master should spend the same another way; the Owner is to satisfie the Creditor notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. And aboue all things money lent for victualls to the ships company should be payed and preferred before all other debts.</p>
               <p>If a Merchant contracting with a Mariner, that is not a Master, be therein ouerseene, he must content himselfe, for he can haue no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Owners, except for a fault done by a Mariner which hath beene hired and put in by the Owners.</p>
               <p>Againe, albeit that by the Sea-lawes, the Owners may not pursue any persons obliged to the Master; yet are they permitted to pursue vpon the Masters contract, as if they had beene principall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors. Because herein they doe represent and vndertake the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Master, and these priuiledges are granted to the Owners, for the good of the Common-wealth, and augmentation of trafficke.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse the Master is not bound to render an account of all to the Owners, as for passengers which are found vnable to pay; and so are not Owners bound to answere for the Masters negligence. But it is very conuenient if the Owners bee in place, that the Master doe not let the ship to fraight, or vndertake any voyage, without the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, knowledge, and aduice of the Owners, or of some of them, to the end many things may bee aduised by them, whereof the Master was ignorant.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He name Bottommarie is deriued by the Hollanders from the Keele or Bottome of a ship, vpon the paralel whereof, the Rudder of a ship doth gouerne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the same: and the money so taken vp by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the ship, is commonly done vpon great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, when moneys must be had in forreine countries to performe a voyage; for the vse payed for the same is verie great, at 30, 40, and 50 <hi>pro cent.</hi> without consideration of time, but within so many daies after the voyage ended.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween interest money and Bottommarie.</note> This Money is called <hi>Pecunia traiectitia,</hi> because that vpon the lenders danger and aduenture it is carried beyond or ouer the seas: so that if the ship perish, or that all be spoyled, the lender doth lose the money. But on the contrarie, money letten at interest is deliuered on the perill of the borrower; so that the profit of this is meerely the price of the simple loane, called <hi>Vsura:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Locatio,</hi> or hire</note> but the profit of the other is a reward for the danger and aduenture of the sea, which the lender taketh vpon him during the loane, which is to be vnderstood vntill a certaine day after the voyage ended; therefore if the money miscarrie, either before the voyage begin, or after the terme appointed for the full loane, then the perill pertaineth to the borrower thereof, and not to the lender. I meane of perills proceeding by storme, violence, spoyle, or such like occasions which cannot be eschewed by any diligence of the borrower. Therefore if the borrower employ that mony vpon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and that the said commodities become forfeited for non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paiment of Custome, the lender shall be cleere of any damage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. It is also to be noted, That money lent at maritime interest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard, but vpon securitie, should pay no profit, otherwise than the money lent at interest, because the securitie is giuen ouer and aboue for the lenders assurance. Againe, suppose it were money not entred in the pursers booke, and yet lent for the need of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie within the ship during the voyage, if before the day appointed for the payment, ship-wrecke, or spoile happen, then should the losse come in contribution betweene them; because if that money had beene lying by the lender still vnlent, it had beene in common daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with the rest: but if the time appointed were past with the perils
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:14410:94"/>
aforesaid, then shall the borrower pay that money so borrowed, free from all contribution.</p>
               <p>Further in case the borrower detaines any such money lent as aforesaid, beyond the time appointed for the repaying, he shall at his returne not onely pay the profit agreed vpon before the voyage, but also augment the same according to the longer time, and shall pay the profit of that first condition accordingly.</p>
               <p>Some Merchants there are, that will deliuer money in nature of <hi>Vsura Maritima,</hi> ioyning the vse money and danger of the seas, either vpon the ships or goods all in one consideration, and so take 25 or 30 vpon the hundreth, at the returne of such a ship from such a voyage; wherein they haue an eye to the person that taketh vp the money, making account to be better assured by a vigilant eye vpon a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants trafficke, whom they must trust (if they will make benefit of their moneys) rather than to deliuer their money vnto another of whose dealing they cannot giue so good a iudgement.<note place="margin">Combination of interest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, They know that such a Merchant doth deale for Turkie, and that in knowne ships trafficking that way, the deliuerer of money go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto him and maketh an offer to lend him 1000 <abbr>ll</abbr> for a voyage to be made (with Kersies and Tinne) to Tripoli, and that he wil beare the aduenture of that money during all the voyage, which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth is commonly performed within the yeare: for (saieth he) you know that I am an Assuror, and you do vse to assure your goods, and to increase your trade you take vp moneys at vse of others in smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler summes; it may therefore be verie commodious for vs both to include the price of assurance, and the vse money together, and so with the returne you shall be prouided to pay me againe, if God do prosper the ship and make homewards speedily, if not, I can demand nothing of you, and must be contented to beare the losse with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Hereupon a contract is made, ten in the hundreth is accounted for the vse money,<note place="margin">Contract of interest and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance iointly</note> and tenne in the hundreth for the aduenture of the goods outwards, and another ten in the hundreth for the aduenture of the returne homewards: in conclusion, there is 30 <hi>pro Ceinto</hi>; So that vpon the returne of the said ship he is to haue 1300 <abbr>ll</abbr> within such a time as they commonly agree, be it one or two moneths after. This is a good bargaine for the lender, howsoeuer the borrower of the money may speed; for the lender hath not to do with the sale of the goods, nor with the returne of them: but he will be sure that (at the returne of the ship) he may haue his money payed him, not onely by the prouenue of the Kersies and Tinne which was bought with the thousand pounds he lent, but also with the returne of all other goods which the borrower did lade more in the said ship for Tripoli, as aforesaid, and in like manner for other places.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXII. Of Shipping and Nauigation.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Nder the name <hi>Nauis</hi> is all kind of shipping vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and <hi>Nauigium</hi> is a generall word many times vsed for Nauigation. So that it is not of any moment to describe the diuersitie of ships, as Carracks, Galleons, Galeasses, Galleys, Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taureis, ships of Warre, Flyboats, Busses, and all other kind of ships and vessells: But that we may vnderstand the sea lawes and customes obserued therein, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the law Merchant, as also those things which properly may concerne ships, as followeth.</p>
               <p>All ships being made for failing, are to be prepared accordingly, both for goodnesse and sit timber, and conuenient building; as for the placing of the Rudder of the ship vpon the right paralell of the keele of the ship,<note place="margin">The Paralell of Equalities.</note> for therein consisteth a maine point for swift sayling, which is found to be a great defect in many ships partly new built and repaired: for new timber and old, mixt together, doth neuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure long, especially if the ship be not repaired in time before she be much decayed, which often commeth to passe, when the owners of it cannot agree therein. The law therefore is commendable, That if the most part of the owners, or those that haue the greatest interest and part therein, cause the same to be repaired, that he who proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not his money for his part within foure months after, shall lose his part to the other owners, if he refuse to be conformable with the rest, or with his partner in the said ship, who did disburse the same; and moreouer he is to pay the consideration of the money also, for the time that the same was laied out.</p>
               <p>Some make a question, Whether a ship so amended &amp; repaired shal be taken to be the same? But it is cleere, that so long as the keele of the ship remaineth, it is still the same ship, and not to be called ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ship; so is it alwaies belonging vnto the owners of the ship, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had fabricated &amp; amended the same with another mans timber: for the selling of a ship is not a sufficient course to alienate the same; but the quiet possession thereof must be deliuered vpon the sale made. And although the sale be made, and the possession of a ship deliuered, if neuerthelesse it afterwards shall appeare that
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14410:95"/>
some haue committed piracie with the same, the party who lost his goods, may lay an action to the ship in place conuenient. Hence the prouerbe ariseth,<note place="margin">A ship which cannot drinke of all waters.</note> That such a ship cannot drinke of all waters. Albeit this law is not generall, no more than a ship driuen by tempest into a Harbour or Port, is subiect to pay custome there; albeit some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the same, although no bulke be broken, which seemeth to be vnreasonable. A contract therefore taketh his strength from the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties contracting, and the place where it is made, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes thereof. It is therefore also dangerous to fraight vnknowne ships, which may be subiect to other mens actions, and that in many places, where wind and weather may command them to enter; for ships are properly reputed amongst moueables, <hi>Quia non sunt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mobilia.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Of ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights.</note>Here the ship-wrights or builders of ships are an especiall sort of persons to be considered and respected, called by the Grecians <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pegi,</hi> who are subiect to the iurisdiction of the Admiraltie, and to render an account of their skill and knowledge in the building of ships to make the frame thereof comely and strong, tith and durable, or else pay the penaltie to be imposed vpon them for all costs and damages: therefore they are to prouide good materialls, and refuse to take bad stuffe, as Aller, Beech trees, and such like spungie timber for salt water; whereunto Merchants must haue a speciall regard, and looke that no greene timber be put in the worke, but such good Oake as hath beene cut downe either at the wane of the Moone, and in the deepe of Winter, or at such times as experience proueth wood to be most sollid and durable: for being cut in other seasons and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, it becommeth open to receiue the water, and consequently the aire, which is the cause of putrefaction in all things vegitable.</p>

               <p>This excellent art of Nauigation is now so much practised and knowne, that the voyages heretofore performed by sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> knight, and after him by master <hi>Candish,</hi> sayling round about the globe of the earth in lesse than three yeres time, is become no matter of admiration; and may be done in far shorter time, as dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth proue.</p>
               <p>Maruellous is that naturall propertie of the Magnes, called the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:14410:99"/>
Loadstone, or Adamant stone,<note place="margin">Of the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Compasse.</note> whereby the needle of the Compasse being touched, immediately turneth to some one certaine point of the heauens, and after sundry motions hither and thither, findeth rest onely in one place and point. And albeit this point in seuerall Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons be different, yet in any one Horizon it remaineth permanent; and therefore it plainely appeareth, that the same proceedeth of some constant permanent cause naturall, and not of any vncertaine cause accidentall; but what this cause should bee, is hitherto vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne. The most probable and best allowed, is the point Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, which should be of such vertue as to draw the needle touched, alwayes towards the same point; affirming that there is a great rocke of Magnes stone, distant from the Pole certaine grades. I haue of late yeares seene a Magnes stone (which the partie said to haue had from a rocke in Sweathland) which weighed not much more than one pound, and such was the Attractiue power of it, that thereby an Anchor of thirtie pound weight was drawne vp, as my selfe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others haue made triall of; howsoeuer, this Mathematicall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son following, is worthy the consideration of a good iudgement.</p>
               <p>As the Axis of the earth, notwithstanding all other motions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth (as it were) immoueable; and yet in respect of the Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call forme of the earth in euery seuerall Horizon maketh a line Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridionall, by reason of the Section made in the superficies of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizons, by Meridians, hauing all that Axis as their common Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: So may it also come to passe of the line of the needle, and his variation, the needle being alwaies permanent in one plaine superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, according to the seuerall Section of the plaine wherein it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth, and the Horizon there may continually bee made, in euerie plaine new variations: For a fimile, as in a paire of ballance of equal weight, there is a certaine motion too and fro, before they find their true place of rest (the same being onely in the leuell of the Horizon) which commeth to passe by the Attractiue Center of the earth; who drawing vnto him either weight with like fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce, finding the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance like also, compelleth them to rest in the superficies, like distant from that Attractiue Center: so in the needle, being a bodie indued with two seuerall properties, the one of Grauitie, and the other of Leuitie, which being equally peized, forceth him to abide in the Horizon; the other being Magneticall and receiued by the touch, causeth him to rest alway in that one Meridian to the Magnes appropriate, it thereby commeth to passe, that after sundrie ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this way and that way, it onely settleth in the common Section of this peculiar Meridian and Horizon. So that euen as in Dialls, the line of the stile onely accordeth and concurreth with the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian line, in such as are void of declination (but in all such plaines as are declinatorie, the line of the Stile varieth from the Meridian line, and the same Angle of variation also altereth as well in respect of inclination as declination) so it may be supposed this variation of the Compasse to be nothing else but the Angle comprehended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:14410:100"/>
the Meridian line, and the common Section of the Magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Meridian to the Horizon, in the Horizonceall plaine; and this Angle to bee alwayes exactly equall to the Angle contained of the Meridian line, and line of the Stile, the Longitude of the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned, accounted from the Magneticall Meridian, being equall to the declination of the Dialls plaine superficies, making computation from South to East circularly, and the Latitude of the place equall to the complement of the inclination of the same superficies Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall, wherein euery man at his pleasure may iudge with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, if hee haue tasted but of the first principles of the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matikes or Cosmography. And hauing made mention of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiue Center, I call to memorie a conference, which in the yeare 1606 (being in Yorkeshire about the Allome Mines, and certaine Lead Mines in Richmondshire) passed betweene the Archbishop of Yorke Doctor <hi>Matthew,</hi> and my selfe, in presence of <hi>Ralph</hi> Lord Eure, with whom I went to Yorke to congratulate the said Archbishop newly come to that See, which was concerning the Center of the earth, which hee said was vnknowne vnto him what to coniecture of it; whereupon we entred into a large discourse, insomuch that from the lowest Center, wee did clime and ascend to the highest Climate by imaginarie conceits (for so is all the studie of the Circle of the Zodiacke,<note place="margin">Experience of former ages, doth confirme this imaginary Circle of the Zodiacke.</note> and the appropriation of the twelue Signes therein:) and after many reasons of the earths stabilitie, against the Pithagorians and <hi>Copernicus</hi> doctrine of Mobilitie (that is to say, Whether the Heauens moue, and the earth resteth immoueable, or the earth moue, and the great Orbe of Stars be permanent mentioned before) we did find all this to be imaginarie, and in that consideration and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee did discend to the lower Center againe; and thereupon conclude, That whereas the Center is taken to be as a point of a great Circle, and so all weightie things falling thereunto, it may as well be a great Circle whereupon all other Orbes runne in circumference circularly: Seeing that the earth and waters together make the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Globe as aforesaid, and all weightie things may bee inclining to that Circle. But this matter being not concerning Nauigation, let vs returne againe to our obseruations, That the maine Ocean Seas are common to all Nations as the passages are on the Land, to bee naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated for trafficke and commerce, yet no one man can trafficke with any Nation without their consent.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Art of Nauigation, Mariners haue one great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, that is, the want of exact rules to know the Longitude, or Arkes Itinerall, East and West, without the which they can neither truely giue the place or scituation of any Coast, Harbour, Rode or towne; nor in sayling discerne how the place they sayle vnto beareth from them, or how farre it is distant: whereby they are inforced long before they come to any Coast, all night to strike sayle, not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes than if they were vpon it, thereby losing the benefit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous windes, in sch sort sometimes, that whereas keeping a true
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14410:100"/>
course, they might haue beene quietly at road, they are by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and aduerse tempests carried farre off, and so not without great charge to the Owner, paine to the Companie, and perill to their Ship are enforced to waste their time; which of late yeares by some new Chartes and Instruments is in some part amended, albeit the said Chartes are still described with straight Meridian lines running equidistant or parallel, which is erronious: and they suppose that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon any of their points of the Compasse, they should passe in the circumference of a great Circle, and therefore in the plaine Cardes describe those windes with straight lines, which is another abuse. For the Ship steming the North and the South, onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth her course in a great Circle East or West shee describeth a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel, and being stirred on any other meane point shee delineateth in her course a Curue or Helicall line, neither straight nor circular, but mixt of both: which supposition being well obserued, betweene two different Angles of variation,<note place="margin">A very rare obseruation respecting the Latitude.</note> and conferred with some such third Angle of a Curue line, euery degrees sayling or thereabouts, will shorten their course of sayling, that (with like wind and weather) they shall performe that in twentie foure houres, wherein they spend aboue three or foure dayes, and many times the voyage is thereby lost and ouerthrowne. As I made Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> Knight to take notice of, in the yeare 1587, and after that more sensibly to Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> Knight.</p>

Queene <hi>Marie</hi> being maried with King <hi>Philip</hi> the second of Spaine (vnder whom all the seuenteene Low Prouinces were vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) granted a lease vnto the said King for the fishing of his subiects in the North parts of Ireland, for one and twentie yeares, for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fine, and paying one thousand pound yearely into the Treasurie of Ireland, and <hi>Edward Fitton</hi> knight then Treasurer.

               <p>To this distinction of dominion of the Seas,<note place="margin">Inuention of the Porteullis.</note> I call to memorie the proceedings of that victorious King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, who during the time that Calice was vnder the Crowne of England (as it hath beene full 211 yeares) vsed the inuention of the signe of the Portcullis; signifying the power of locking vp of the narrow Seas betweene Douer and Calice, which was thought conuenient to bee vsed vpon the coyne made for the East-Indies, at the beginning of that trade, being peeces of the value of eight Royalls of Spaine, whereof there was coyned in the Tower of London for a triall (in Ianuarie 1600) some six thousand pounds, which could not be made currant there, because the Spanish peeces of eight Royalls, had beene before that time counterfeited by other nations, which made the East-Indians to doubt of our coyne, although without cause. This noble King <hi>Henrie</hi> (hauing procured the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth to meet with the French King) went ouer in person with a great power to besiege the towne of Bulloigne in France, and when he saw that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors Tent or Pauillion was made with the two pillars of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the inscription <hi>Plus vltra</hi>: and likewise the French Kings Tent with the three Flower deluces, and the title of <hi>Primus Christianorum Rex,</hi> He caused an Archer to be made vpon his Pauillion with Bow and Arrowes, and his inscription was <hi>Cui adherio praeest,</hi> declaring

thereby his present strength whereby hee did qualifie those warres, and peace was made between the Emperor and the said French King, it being true that the state of a Prince doth as much consist by reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as by strength.</p>
               <p>Our Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames,</hi> hath also beene mindfull of his right of distinct dominion; for the great blessings which almightie God hath allotted to the Kingdomes of Great Brittaine, Ireland, and the Isles adiacent vnder his Maiesties Dominions, is so visible to all the world, as that thereby they are rauished with admiration. For albeit that the earthly blessings are produced in seasonable times: yet the blessings of the Seas are directed and pointed at by the finger of God at infallible seasons, causing those watrie creatures to offer themselues for our sustenance, and for the generall good of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in places certaine, within his Maiesties Seas, Streames and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and not into the maine where fishing cannot bee effected. Whereupon his Maiestie before his comming into England, did let the fishing of Scotland to the Hollanders for fifteene yeares, it being agreed by more ancient Treaties betweene them, that the fishing then agreed vpon should be eightie miles from the Coast, to the end the Scoles of Herrings should not bee interrupted. His Maiestie in the fourth yeare of his Raigne of Great Brittaine, made a Graunt to one <hi>Collyns</hi> of Couentrie for twentie one yeres for the fishing in some parts of Ireland:<note place="margin">Graunts made for fishing.</note> and the like Graunts haue beene made for the Isles of Garnesey and Iarnesey, according to the Common Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">By the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</note> which (in this point concerning his Maiesties right of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) is very copious, the handling whereof I leaue to the learned and judicious of the said Law.</p>
               <p>In the seuenth yeare of his Maiesties said raigne, his Highnesse caused a Proclamation to be made, concerning his Dominion of fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which being compendious and substantiall, I thought conuenient here to be inserted <hi>Verbatim.</hi>

Whereby not onely diuers of Our Coasts Townes are much decayed, but the number of Marriners daily diminished; which is a matter of great consequence to Our estate, considering how much the strength thereof consisteth in the power of Shipping, and the vse of Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:14410:104"/>
hereditarie Kingdome or Kingdomes, whereunto those Seas are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and appertaining.</p>
               <p>It is not a Dominion obtained by an electiue Kingdome, as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Hungarie, and others; neither is it had by any first discouerie, wherein the Pope must be a mediatour, as <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixth was between the King of Castile and Portugal, vpon the discouery of the East and West-Indies, by drawing a line vpon the Globe from the Island of the Canaries, to make the diuision betweene them: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it like to the Whale fishing in Greeneland, where some vpon their discouerie tooke neither possession, much lesse had any occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which maketh the stronger right: Neither is it by gift or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, as some Italian Princes in the Mediterranean Seas, which doe neuerthelesse inioy both freedome and benefit thereby; but it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted and indisputable as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Argument,<note place="margin">The best mark of distinct do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions vpon the Seas.</note> the distinct dominion of a bordering Prince vpon the Seas, is best seene by the Tribute or Taxe which hee taketh vpon fishing ships, whereof we haue many presidents.</p>
               <p>In Russia many leagues from the Maine, Fishermen doe pay great taxes to the Emperour of Russia, and in most places none but his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects are permitted to fish, and the Hollanders doe giue him the tenth fish.</p>
               <p>The King of Denmarke taketh great tribute, both at Wardhouse and the Sound.</p>
               <p>The Kings of Sweathen haue done the like, which is now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by the King of Denmarke, for Norway. The Duke of Medina Sidonia taketh for Tunyne.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of England, tooke six pence for euery Tun in his time, which by inhauncing of the money is now 18 pence.</p>
               <p>All the bordering Princes of Italy, doe take tribute of the fish taken within the Mediterranean Seas, for their seuerall Territories.</p>
               <p>In Lappia, Fishermen doe pay monyes in the Sound for passage to fetch it, ouer and aboue the tenth fish.</p>
               <p>The Earle of Orkney taketh the tenth fish, for the Isles of Orcades vnder his iurisdiction: as the Fishermen doe to the Lords of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in the West parts of England, for Pilchards, Hake and Conger.</p>
               <p>The States of the vnited Low Countries, doe take an Imposition vpon fish taken within the Seas and Streames of other Princes, as also neere their Coast, and their subiects trafficking with the Russians, as <hi>Haunce Noblett, Haunce Van stracle, Robert Englegraue</hi> and others, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pay the tenth fish vnto the Emperour of Russia.</p>
               <p>All which is requisite for Merchants to know, to preuent troubles or losses, for the pretence of ignorance doth not excuse, as our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Kingstone vpon Hull haue found to their exceeding losse heretofore.</p>

               <p>In Russia, Denmarke and Sweathen,<note place="margin">Rigorous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.</note> the Custome and Ordinances is; if a Merchant doe not declare all his commodities, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth or exporteth, but concealeth some part of them; all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of that kind, are forfeited to the Prince, and hee shall find but small fauour to redeeme them.</p>
               <p>In Spaine, and other Dominions of the King of Spaine, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities concealed, are onely forfeited, vnlesse they bee prohibited and vnlawfull goods.</p>
               <p>In England, Scotland, and Ireland is the like, and onely the goods concealed are forfeited, and may be had againe vpon reasonable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; for the Statute Law giueth authoritie to the Officer who maketh the seizure, that vpon licence sued forth to compound, hee may doe it safely for his part, which is the one moitie; and for the other moity which is the Kings, Merchants are graciously dealt wich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by the Iudges or Barons of the Kings Exchequer,<note place="margin">Abuse of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</note> or others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto authorised: Insomuch that it hath happened that some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:14410:105"/>
relying vpon this fauourable dealing, haue aduentured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their commodities vnto the forfeiture thereof, being commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities which pay much Custome and Imposition: as Cambrickes, Lawnes, Tabacco, Cutcheneale, Venice gold Threed, and other things, because they were (in a manner) assured to make composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder the summe which they were to pay for Custome and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</p>
               <p>In France and Germany is the like for concealed commodities, which are not declared in the Custome-house; and Iewels, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, and Pearles are freed of Custome. And so was it in England, vntill of late yeares, since the Customes were taken to farme, and yet they pay but three <hi>pro cent.</hi> of the value of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praisement,<note place="margin">Strict orders for Customes at London, &amp;c.</note> to bee rated by the Officers of the Custome-house at London. But if any Merchant or Ieweller bring ouer any Iewells or precious Stones and Pearles, he is to declare them to the Officers or Waiters of the place where hee landeth, otherwise they will bee seized (by water or land) as forfeited to the King; wherein more strict dealing hath beene vsed of late, since the King hath letten to farme his moitie of the Seizures. So that first of all the Custome of concealed goods must be payed, before any composition bee made, next the composition being made, then may the Informer bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed withall. And no commodities can bee deliuered vpon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie to the owner, as formerly by the Law was accustomed to be done; but they must remaine in some sufficient custodie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the matter bee tried by Law, or compounded by agreement. But prohibited commodities (as Allome and other things) by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents and Proclamation, the possession may be had, vpon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie to bee giuen to answere the value thereof, according to the appraisement made of them. And these commodities (if the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the ship doe not declare them, vpon his entrie made in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome-house, vpon his oath) are also subiect to the forfeiture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they come consigned vnto a Merchant or Factor vnawares, by another Merchant that knew not that such commodities were prohibited to bee imported. The like is it for a Merchant shipping out vnlawfull wares: but heerein hee may haue intelligence by the Customer, before hee doe lay them vpon the water to bee shipped. Againe, if a Merchant carrie money by water downe to Grauesend, with an intention to bestow the same in Bayes at Sandwich, or in other commodities at Canturburie: hee is first to declare the same in the Searchers Office, or else the money is lost, and three times the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, vpon information. For no money of Gold or Siluer, or any forrein Coyne or Plate brought into the Kingdome, can be transported; only for Passengers expences, some foure or fiue pounds may be carried out. But for commodities brought in, which haue payed Custome, the same may bee shipped out againe by Cocket, without paying any more Custome and Imposition; so it bee done vpon good Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate, that it is the same commoditie, and that the propertie
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14410:105"/>
thereof is not altered; and this must be done within sixe moneths af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their importation.</p>
               <p>All Merchants ships being laden,<note place="margin">Permitted to breake bulke at Tilburie-hope.</note> haue alwaies (time out of mind) beene permitted to breake bulke below, or at Tilburie-Hope, and to pay no Custome, but for the goods they brought vp, or landed in England, and not for the goods which they did transport in the said ship, or in any other vessell or ship: which priuiledge and certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Merchants Custome ought to be seriously obserued, better than it hath beene of late. And of this and other obseruations Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Factors are to giue notice to their friends and Masters, to the end they do not incur any danger,<note place="margin">To enter goods vpon sight.</note> which (to auoid in some sort) is effected by entring the goods vpon sight of the Customers view, by opening of them.</p>
               <p>In Barbarie and other places, where the Customes are paied in kind or <hi>Species,</hi> if any part bee concealed and not entered, that onely will be forfeited; and yet the losse is greater, because they will make choice of the best: as for example, Suppose a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant doth enter diuers sorts of Linnen-cloth, and concealeth some pieces, the Officers will take both the tenth piece for the Custome, and all the concealed pieces of the best and finest sorts, to your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great losse.</p>
               <p>In the Low-countries and Germanie, as also in most places of Italie and Turkie, you shall onely forfeit the goods concealed, and bee permitted to compound for them as you can agree, wherein the circumstances in some places will be considered, and the manner how the error grew, or whether it were done with a set purpose.</p>
               <p>There are also in diuerse places allowances made (as in England) vpon Wines in regarde of lecage of tenne or fifteene vpon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, or else all the Buts and Pipes are to be filled vp,<note place="margin">Allowances made vpon Customes and Impositions.</note> and so to pay accordingly; wherein the time of the voyage, foule weather, and other accidents are to be considered, to make your composition thereafter.</p>
               <p>Vpon Clothes to be shipped out,<note place="margin">Allowance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Clothes.</note> there is allowance made of the tenth Cloth for a wrapper, which payeth no Custome: and so of all other woollen Commodities, which pay after the rate; as three Northeren Kersies for a Cloth, foure Deuonshire Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, two single Dozens, one double Dozen, six Cardinals, Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whites, Statutes, Stockbridges, Straites, and Tauistockes, foure Cornish Dozens, Pennystones vnfriezed, Island Dozens, and Northeren Plaines for one Cloth; two Bridgewaters, Cornish and Deuonshire double Dozens, Florentines, Northren Dozens single, and pennystones for a Cloth, to be vnderstood for a short Cloth coloured or white of twentie and foure yards long, waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 60 <abbr>ll</abbr> vntill 64 <abbr>ll</abbr>, whereof English Custome was a Noble, and the Merchant Straunger thirteene shillings and foure pence, whereunto is added the auncient Custome heretofore paied by the Merchants of the Steele-yard or Haunce-townes being 14 pence, so

together 14 <hi>ss</hi> 6 d a Cloth, besides the ouerlength of 3 d ¼ the yard;<note place="margin">The pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Custome of Cloth.</note> which is of late comprised in the new Imposition of the pretermitted Custome for waighing of Clothes, at two pence the pound, so that a short Cloth paied in times past a noble, and now tenne shillings, besides the ouer-length, according to the weight, after the said rate of two pence for the pound: all which the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant stranger payeth double.</p>
               <p>Also whereas of late yeares, since the Customes were letten to farme, all Commodities, as Sugars, Spices, Raisons of the sunne, and others are weighed, and thereupon the Tarra for the Caske or Chest is to bee allowed,<note place="margin">Allowance for Tarra or Cask.</note> and so the Custome is payed. There ought good allowance to be made for the said Tarra, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commodities being vnladed, and hauing taken the moisture of the seas, increaseth the weight of their Caske; so that Merchants pay many times Custome for that which they haue not, by the strict dealing of Officers contrarie to equitie and justice, if they doe not warily looke to their affaires, wherein the Officers may also be excused.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude touching Customes, we must consider what they may amount vnto vpon the hundreth: according to which, Merchants are to cast vp their accounts for benefit and losse, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Custome.</note>The Custome in England (called <hi>Parva Custuma)</hi> was three pence vpon euerie pound, that the commodities are rated in the Custome Booke, which is paid by Merchants strangers, now altered paying 6 d.</p>

               <p>Hereupon they conclude, That all Wagers laid must be for honest

               <p>A Wager laied vpon the death of a priuate person, is disallowed; but not for the contracting of any supposed or expected marriage, which is lawfull.</p>
               <p>All Wagers laied in lawfull games are allowable; but in prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted games cannot be recouered by the Ciuile law. So Wagers made by lookers on vpon other mens games are disallowed, which is the cause that Stipulations are made, putting the pawne or money downe, which is called, to stake downe: and if it be vpon an vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full game, then the lookers on are subiect to punishment, as well as the gamesters.</p>
               <p>A Wager laid who shall eate or drinke most, is vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>If a Gamester or a Merchant playing, receiue twentie and promise to giue fiftie for it the next day playing, the Conuention is good.</p>
               <p>A Merchant laying a Wager to giue tenne for one if such a ship ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue within a limited time, within such a Port or Hauen, is good in law.</p>
               <p>A Wager is laied vpon the arriuall of a ship in the port of Lix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and a certaine summe of money promised thereupon: it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, that the said ship is a Galeon; so deniall is made to pay the money. The Law did determine the money should be paied, because the word Ship is a generall name, although it be called by diuers names, As a Notarie is called a Tabellion, Scriuenor, or a publike seruant.</p>
               <p>A Wager vpon a sonne or a daughter to be borne, is good in law; and if it be a Hermophrodite of both sexes, then iudgement is giuen according as the naturall inclination shal be found to be more mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line or feminine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ambiguitie, or Equiuocation in Wagers.</note>And in all Wagers wherein ambiguitie or equiuocation doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, there must be a naturall moderation in the construction of them; for an euill custome loseth her name, and becommeth vsurpation, as is before declared.</p>

               </p>
               <p>If one lay a Wager to run with another, and afterwards doth refuse
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14410:107"/>
to runne, hee may be compelled thereunto, or the stake is lost; for hee committeth no deceit, which preuenteth a fraud.

               </p>
               <p>Wagers between Merchants are many times more done for sport and recreation than for gaine: for ouer great wagers are against good manners, and may concerne a Merchant much in reputation and credit, more than the playing for great summes of money, which many times Merchants doe vse, with the obseruation of a conuenient time, and as the Prouerbe is, With good fortune, otherwise the end of it is dangerous; for as nature produced all things in due time, so is moderation required in all actions.</p>

               <p>Euery Merchant is to set downe his marke vpon his Bookes of account, wherewith his commodities are marked.<note place="margin">Merchants markes to be set vpon their bookes of accounts.</note> And in like manner, If a Company or Societie of Merchants doe agree vpon a marke, the same is to bee set vpon the Bookes of that Societie: and if that Company doe dissolue, the said marke may remaine with the most ancient of that partnership, by the Custome of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; whereof the Ciuile Law and the Law of Admiraltie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth notice in their judicature, and especially the Merchants Courts of Consulate. And if the marke of one of the partenership bee vsed for all, the same vpon dissolution of that partenership is to returne to the said partie; and no man is to vse another Merchants marke,

without especiall leaue had and obtained of the partie whose marke it is. For euen as Merchants doe saile betweene the two dangerous rockes of Scylla and Charibdis in their course of trafficke, when Princes are at variance: So is the danger to vse another Merchants marke without leaue; because the partie owner of the said marke is to defend the said goods, if they bee taken, or to countenance the persuers of the sute in Law for them,<note place="margin">Danger to vse another mans marke, &amp;c.</note> as farre as they in reason may require, otherwise the said goods may bee lost as soone as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. For as Ships are knowne by their Flags, and so taken to bee at the Seas; so are Merchants goods marked with another mans marke, to bee that mans goods, although it were not, and will bee so adiudged in the Courts of any Admirall of the Seas; experience hath prooued the same by two notable examples, worthy the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1586 or thereabouts, <hi>Robert</hi> Lord Dudley Earle of Leicester was an Aduenturer for Barbary, where hee sent some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities by way of commerce, vnto a certaine Factor (that did deale for diuers other Merchants) there to be sold for his account, and to make returne vnto him of the prouenue thereof in Sugar and other commodities. The Factor hauing sold some of the said goods (considering the number of men of warre, which were then at the Seas, and the greatnesse of the said Earle) thought good, that all the Chests of Sugar and other commodities which he sent home to all his Masters in a certaine ship,<note place="margin">The Beare and Ragged staffe.</note> should bee marked with the Earle of Leicesters marke, albeit the least part did appertaine vnto him; the rather for that the most part of his goods were yet vnsold in Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The ship arriuing within the Riuer of Thames, no sooner were the Letters deliuered, but the Earle laid claime to all the said goods, pretending the same to be his because of his marke: hereupon the Ciuilians were of his side for the point of Law, and the Merchants were compelled to make their best compositions with him, as they could agree; and the Earle lost nothing thereby howsoeuer they sped.</p>
               <p>In the yeare 1597 one <hi>Iohn de Bassadonna,</hi> the sonne of one of the Magnificoes of Venice, then resident in London, had a certaine ship which was fraighted for Lixborne, and so to goe for Venice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Master thereof was bound by a Charterpartie of fraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in both places to take in all such commodities and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandises as the Merchant should lade or cause the said ship to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den withal, and to be discharged at Venice with the vsuall conditions of Sea-lawes.<note place="margin">The Venetian Flag.</note> This ship bearing the Venetian Flag of the Lyon of S.Marke, was well receiued and welcome at Lixborn, and euery man was willing to lade therein his goods for Venice: neuerthelesse some Portugalls considering the dangerous times of warre, did borrow the name of Italians and their markes also, and caused their goods to bee laden as appertaining to the said Italians, and made the Bills of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and their Letters accordingly; other Portugals were not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14410:108"/>
but did lade their goods in their owne names: whereupon the Master of the ship (being sure of the one, and suspicious of the other) resolued to come (with all the said goods) first for England, to take aduice whether this were a lawfull prize or not, and being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued at Plimmouth, sent vp to know the Lords of the Councell their pleasure. So the matter came in question with the said <hi>Bassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donna,</hi> and was referred to the Iudge of the Admiraltie, and diuers Ciuilians, where the matter of the Flag was much respected in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Seignorie of Venice, as matter of State; and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall goods laden and marked in the name of Italians, were adiudged cleere by the Law. But the other goods laden and marked with their owne markes, were taken for good prize. So that it behooueth all Merchants to be carefull what marke they vse, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXXIX. Of the Buying and Selling of Commodities by Brokers, and by the Candle.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is an old Prouerbe, and very true, that betweene <hi>What will you buy? and what will you sell?</hi> there is twentie in the hundreth differing in the price: which is the cause that all Nations doe more affect to sell their commodities with reputation by meanes of Brokers, than we doe; for that which seemeth to be gotten thereby, is more than double lost another way. Besides, that by that course many differences are preuented, which might arise betweene man and man, in their Bargaines or Verball contracts: for the testimony of a sworne Broker and his booke together, is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to end the same. And moreouer it is many times a cause that Factors and Seruants deale more faithfully for their Masters in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or selling of all commodities, or in monyes by exchange, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their euidence is extant against them. Therefore no Broker should be admitted vnlesse hee were sworne, and vpon <hi>Affidauit</hi> or Certificate made by some principall Merchants, of his sufficiencie and behauiour, and to put sureties for his true and good demeanour amongst Merchants, according to the Custome of London. For albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it that the common saying is, <hi>That a craftie Merchant needeth no Broker:</hi> yet it may much concerne the Common-wealth, when too much
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:14410:109"/>
hunting after forraine commodities may increase the price of them, and offering our home commodities to sale,<note place="margin">Bills of Entries in the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome-house.</note> may bee an occasion of vnderselling them to the generall losse comparatiuely considered, wherein (I thinke) the Billes of Entries made so generally common, by the copies deliuered to shopkeepers and others, are to be regarded. For no sooner are the goods entred in the Custome-bookes, but the copie of it is deliuered abroad for euerie man to runne vpon them.</p>
               <p>The Venetians therefore haue an Office, called <hi>Messacaria,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting only of Brokers, which deale betweene man and man aduisedly; and in Spaine they are of such estimation, that they ride on horse-backe vpon their foot-clothes, and hauing the Inuoyces of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods, they will deale for great matters at a time, against the lading of the Fleet for Noua Espagna and the Islands of the West-Indies, to be payed partly readie money, and partly at the returne of the said Fleet; and then afterwardes let you vnderstand their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant: and many times they are of that meanes and credit, that for a small matter they will be bound to make the debts good, if the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant should faile, whereupon (as the Custome is to haue one vpon the hundreth) they will condition but double Brocadge, or lesse. Our Brokers of London take but two pence vpon the pound (which is lesse then one ꝑ <hi>cent.</hi>) for the sale of commodities, and to hinder one another they will take lesse; which amongst Merchants beyond the Seas, is taken to be a disorder, for they are inclined to make the Brokers good gainers. The like is done in the Faires of Frankford, where many Brokers doe resort twice in the yeare, and they keepe account of all the bargaines that they make betwene the forraine Merchants, that come thither to make their payments most by res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and assignation, after the manner of Bankers: For the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities sold in one Mart, are commonly payable the next Mart, being betweene fiue and sixe moneths time one after another; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these Brokers are very necessarie members and instruments also to transferre Merchants Bills Obligatorie for other commodities, or to make payments thereby. The duties of the Alcaualla in Spaine, are taken vpon that consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Selling by the Candle.</note>The selling of commodities by the Candle, is an ancient Custome beyond the Seas, only for such goods, rents vpon houses or lands, or the houses also which require a suddaine sale, after they haue beene one yeare and one day denounced by publication that they are to bee sold; to the end that if any man will lay any claime thereunto, they may come in within that time. And these sales are made vpon Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes in accustomed places by publike authoritie, for the better war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Buyer, the manner of it is thus: There is a waxen Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or a piece of it, set vp lighted in some place easie to be seene, and the standers by are required to make an offer for such goods, or such a house; which being made, another will offer more, as they doe in outcryes, hauing still a regard to the burning Candle: declaration is made how the payment must bee, so that hee who maketh the last
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:14410:109"/>
offer (vpon the going out of the Candle) hath the bargaine. If it doe fall o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, that there is confusion of voyces of the offers made, whereby it cannot bee discerned who made the last offer, and the standers by do differ in their iudgement of it, then the Candle is set vp againe by those that are in authoritie, and in like manner it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined accordingly.</p>
               <p>The Merchants of the East-India companie do imitate the same, and after publike notice giuen in writing vpon the Royall Exchange in London, That such a day, such and such commodities will be sold at such a place, Merchants and others (knowing the great parcels of Pepper, Indico, and other commodities of Silkes, Calicoes, and such like) will ioyne together to buy the same in seuerall companies, and so buy the same by the Candle, as aforesaid, although it were a parcell of one hundreth thousand pounds. The time for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is foure times six moneths, which is fifteene moneths in one payment, according to which (if you will pay all or part of it in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die money by way of Anticipation) you shall haue vse allowed you accordingly, after the rate of ten vpon the hundreth. But their good orders require a more larger declaration.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XL. Of buying of commodities by Condition, termed <hi>Capiticus,</hi> and of selling things vpon Casualties.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He buying of commodities vpon Condition is termed by the Ciuilians <hi>Capiticus, a capiendo,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to refuse or take vpon a penaltie; or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vpon a casuall Condition. Which bargains are much vsed in the Low-countries, as also in France, especially at Roan and Calice, where my selfe haue made money of Corne and Salt: and this bargaining is most proper for such and the like commodities, the price whereof doth quickly rise or fall, and are also commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous when a mans money is not so readie, to buy much, and to make a great imployment with little money, which happeneth vpon some soden aduice many times vnexpected, whereupon men are verie hot either to buy or sell: which is much vsed in Flanders in buying of Herrings before they be catched, by <hi>(stelle gelt)</hi> as they call it, that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:14410:110"/>
is by a summe of money agreed vpon to be paied, if the partie doe repent himselfe of the bargaine, wherein he taketh a time of one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth or two to be aduised according to the occasions and probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the successe.</p>
               <p>To disburse or offer fiftie pounds vpon fiftie Last of Herrings with six weekes respit vpon the condition after twentie pound were equal nineteene and twentie one, and without respit of time presently to say to be deliuered at three moneths, the fiftie Last at twenty pound amounteth to 1000 <abbr>ll</abbr>, you aduance the interest, warehouse-hire, charges, lackage, besides the commoditie that you haue bought with the money a bargaine of fiftie Last, when it would pay but 2 ½ Last, vpon condition to take or leaue.</p>
               <p>One hundreth pounds deliuered out to pay the first yeare one pound, the second yeare two pounds, increasing euerie yeare one pound, amounteth in fifteene yeares to 128 pounds, in twentie yeares 210 <abbr>ll</abbr>, to the 20 adde one, multiplie with ½ of 1 to 20 is 10, and so of all other augmenting, be it of 1, 2, 6, 8, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Conditions are diuers: The certainetie of the money which you do aduenture to losse, being well considered of, may turne you to gain, especially in places bordering vpon the seas or riuers, to serue the In-land people, as Calice, Dunkerke, for Flanders, Henault, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thois, and other prouinces. The like might be practised in many coast townes of England. But strangers are more addicted to make casuall bargaines for buying of commodities.</p>
               <p>For selling of commodities vpon casualties, therein are we more frequent, especially of things not vendible at all times, to sell them payable vpon the returne of such a voyage from Venice, Turkie, or other places, or vpon the decease of such a man or woman, or at a marriage day, or the first, second, or third child, either male or female. In all which sellings, money and wares may be ioyned together. But in deliuering money with wares at interest, the contract is vsurious by the law. (<g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>)</p>

               <head>CHAP. XLI. Of diuiding of Commodities by Lots.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ll extreames being vicious, hath giuen me cause to write this exorbitant chapter, concerning the diuision by Lots, because there are men in this age so precise (by some called Puritanes) that they can be well contented to buy a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in companie with their neighbours, when their owne meanes and credit cannot compasse the same; but afterwards to diuide those goods (by the Lot) between them, they are verie scrupulous, and hold it a prophane action, and they are (as they say) bound vnto it of necessitie, or else to take that which their partners do giue vnto them, and so let them cast the Lot amongst them, and what remaineth vpon equall diuision, they will rather accept of, than that any Lot should be cast for them: yet they will more fauour the Lot than the casting of the dice, or the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring by strawes. To these weake stomakes thus troubled with a <hi>Nausea,</hi> I would not minister any Cordials, Electuaries, or Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to rid them of that distemperate humour; but a plaine vomit is fittest, the Moone being in <hi>Aries</hi> or <hi>Capricorne,</hi> which must be thus preparéd.</p>
               <p>As in Gods Church there neuer wanted true religion reuealed from God himselfe, so amongst heathen, and all nations, there neuer wanted meanes to acknowledge a soueraigne power; which caused them to deuise a certaine shadow of religion, by worshipping their imaginarie gods with a kind of diuine seruice: the contemplation and vse whereof, they did esteeme to be the highest degree of felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or <hi>summum bonum,</hi> in so much that (euen in their blindnesse) they did attribute the successe of all things to proceed from aboue, vsing (for to attaine to the knowledge of the diuine pleasure) diuers means of Diuinations, Imprecations, Oracles, and casting of Lots, because they wanted the illumination of the most glorious and transparent Sunne of the word of God, whereby we are taught to obey the knowne will of God, and to reuerence (with admiration) his secret will not declared vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Diuinations and imprecations being not accompanied with visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14410:111"/>
and sensible apparitions, caused all Oracles to be in greater vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: as that of <hi>Dodona,</hi> where <hi>Iupiter</hi> answered, striking the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons with a siluer wand: That of <hi>Iupiter Hammon</hi> in the confines of Aegypt: That of <hi>Delphos,</hi> where an old woman answered in Greeke verse: That of <hi>Latona,</hi> and that of <hi>Motenzuma</hi> in America, and others. All which ceased, when and where the Sunne beames of the word of God did disperce the mistie clouds of darknesse, and then all was abrogated, and onely the casting and drawing of Lots did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as a custome of great antiquitie amongst all nations, recorded not onely by prophane Historiographers, but also by diuine Prophets and Euangelists. To which purpose we may obserue two especial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the holie Scripture.</p>

               <p>But least these men should obiect, That the aforesaid examples are actions of the Heathens, and but mentioned in the holy Scripture; we pray them to remember, That the children of Israel had no other meanes propounded vnto them, to obtaine victorie against their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by remouing the offence of the interdict or forbidden goods,<note place="margin">

of Monarchie: So to conclude, all Nations doe continue the vse of Drawing or Casting of Lots in all occasions. Wherefore, I hope, these precise men will bee hereafter more resolute to accept of their part (of Indico in Barrels, Sugar in Chests, and Pepper in Bags, marked and numbered according to the goodnes) by the Lot drawne or cast, and expect Gods blessings, according to the saying of the Wise-man, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch as in Italy and Germany, diuers commodities and manufactures are dispersed, distributed, and in a maner vented, by the meanes of Lottaries which are continually extant, in publike markets and other places; I cannot omit to speake hereof, as a matter apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Merchants.</p>
               <p>There are two manner of Lotaries, namely, Standing Lotaries, and Running Lotaries; the first limitted for a continuance of time to bee drawne at the end thereof, without intermission by day and night; the latter to bee drawne daily and at all conuenient houres, when the parties will put in their money, and haue the Lot drawne instantly. To which end in many places of Germany, there are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Shops and Stales, where diuers sorts of manufactures are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be sold, and to euery Lot there is a Prize appointed to answere the said Lot; whereby a man hath alwayes some thing for his money, and many times a Prize of good value. Being therein like vnto the Tree of Fortune,<note place="margin">The Tree of Fortune.</note> which is painted with blind Fortune sitting in the middle part of the Tree, and all manner of men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, standing or lying ouer the said Tree, doe receiue somewhat fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from it; to the one a purse full of money, to the other a halter; to the one a golden chaine, and to the other a cutting knife: and to be briefe, to some good, and to some other euill things, as is seene in all wordly affaires.</p>
               <p>Standing Lotaries, are stately and magnificent, consisting of Siluer, Plate, Chaines of Gold, Iewells, Cabinets, Hangings, Pictures, and other precious and curious things, fit for honourable persons, and others of qualitie. Albeit all men are admitted to aduenture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, which is the cause the Lots are commonly made of twelue pence or two shillings, the number whereof maketh a compleat Lotarie, fit to be drawne when the same is full, which must bee done by gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the money in continuance of a certaine time limitted, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The Running Lotaries are of Plate, Chaines of Gold, and other things, whereof the price is (in a manner) certaine, as also of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys: and for that they are instantly drawne, and men willing to know their present fortune (as they terme it,) euerie one is inclined, that the money which they draw, they will venture againe in hope of a better, whereby their Lotaries are sooner filled. Both these sorts of Lotaries haue a Table wherein the Prizes are declared, which are valued by publike authoritie to preuent deceit and fraud, which in great Standing Lotaries is more likely to bee practised.</p>
               <p>

Likewise all the Blankes and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes, with the like suruay of Sworne-men, are put into the like close Basket, after examination of the Prizes registred in the said Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which being all of one fashion and bignesse, are publikely vpon a Stage mixt, tossed, and tumbled in certaines sheets of Canuas, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be put in the said Basket; and between the said two Baskets sitteth the Drawer, putting both his armes at one instant seuerally in euery Basket, deliuering the Bills of the names or poesies with the right hand, and the Blankes and Prizes with the left hand, to certaine Sworne-men, which doe read the contents thereof openly to all the standers by; which Drawers or persons do change for certain hours, (for they continue both night and day vntill all be drawne out, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out stirring of the Baskets.) Othersome doe herein obserue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine houres daily, and vpon euerie discontinuance, they seale the said Baskets vnder two or three Seales from time to time, procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all Prizes by the sound of the Trumpet, and stringing some blew papers in the Files made of the Blankes and names: and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes euerie day drawne, are the next day to bee seene in print, with the assistance of Officers appointed to see good orders obserued in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace, vpon all occasions of fallings out, which might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen amongst the vnruly multitude of mechanicall people. The Prizes are many to auoid discontent, which the reading of many names and answeres in Blanke prouoketh. And commonly they do not exceed in number aboue thirtie or fortie for one; and so the least prize being but tenne shillings, is proportionably three or foure to one in value or in readie money. All the Prizes haue a priuie marke or number knowne onely to some few persons, to preuent the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting of euill disposed persons or officers, which are hereby easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discouered.

And this being a vendition, may not be omitted to bee noted in this Booke, concerning all manner of buyings and sellings; the rather, for that the aduenturer in Lota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries incurreth lesse danger, than Merchants doe in the course of Trade, especially in Assurances, when they doe aduenture one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth pounds for three or foure pounds from London to Barbarie, whereas for one Lot of twelue pence, he hath a possibilitie to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted vnto him two or three hundreth pounds.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ssociations are twofold, the one is done by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authoritie of Princes or States, vpon Graunts made by Letters Patents, which are properly called Societies; as the Companie of Merchant Aduenturers,<note place="margin">Societie of the Merchants Aduenturers.</note> which are of 400 yeares standing or thereabouts, reckoning from the yeare 1248; when the said Merchants ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained priuiledges of <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of Brabant, and were called the Brotherhood of Saint <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> of Cantur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burie, which were confirmed by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fifth, <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixth, <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the third, and King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth; who gaue them the name of Merchants Aduenturers: after him also confirmed by King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, Queene <hi>Marie,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and lastly, by our Soueraigne Lord King <hi>Iames</hi>; not without many enemies and oppositions, and most especially of late, taxing them to be Monopolizers, and vnprofitable to the common-wealth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all our Clothes were not dressed and dyed in England. Whereupon their Patent was for a time suspended, but afterwardes confirmed again vnto them by his Maiesties ample Proclamation. As this Societie is of ancient estimation, so is their gouernement verie commendable, and preserueth the amitie and entercourse betweene the Realme and other neighbour Princes and States, venting the best commodities of the Kingdome; yet so, that euerie man selleth freely at his pleasure without any combination or limitation, to the great honour and seruice of the State, wherein they may daily see and obserue more and more, as is heeretofore declared.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Societies of East-Indies, Virginia, &amp;c.</note>The East-India Merchants are also a Societie, but their aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers runne all into maine Stockes, and is gouerned and carried all ioyntly vpon benefit or losse. This Company beganne in the yeare 1599. So the Merchants of Turkie are a Societie. Also the Virginia and Barmuda Merchants, and diuers others, are Societies incorporated by his Maiesties Letters Patents, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:14410:113"/>The other Association is done by and betweene Merchants of their owne authoritie,<note place="margin">Partnership by Contract.</note> ioyning themselues together for to deale and trade either for yeares or voyages; and this is properly called Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership, where one man doth aduenture a thousand pounds, another fiue hundreth pounds, another three hundreth pounds, and another foure hundreth pounds, more or lesse, as they agree amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, to make a stocke, euerie man to haue his profit, or to beare losses and aduenture according to their seuerall stockes, in one or many voyages, for one or more yeares; besides the moneyes taken vp at vse to trade withall, proportionably according to the rates of their stocks by parts and portions, to be diuided into so many parts as they agree: wherein the conditions be diuers, which must be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued truely, and the accounts accordingly; otherwise all will run into a Laborinth and confusion. And by the common Law one partner cannot proceed against another, and in Chauncerie the suits may be prolonged for the life of a man, vnlesse the Law-Merchant be better vnderstood; and the Auditors Office be enabled to end these busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses with breuitie and expedition.</p>
               <p>There is another branch of this maner of partnership,<note place="margin">Partnership by imployment.</note> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, when Factors beyond the seas (dealing for diuers Merchants) will sometimes make imployment of seuerall mens money in one kind of commoditie to be diuided amongst them. Here one may become a partner vnawares and vnknowne, as of late I know the like did happen in a great bargaine of Tabacco, whereupon all the partners (being seuen in number) are fallen out, and diuers of them are in law. This course (althoug vsed) is verie dangerous, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they vse many Factors. One Merchant sendeth commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities to his Factor to be sold in Spaine, and giueth order that by that meanes he shall prouide money for his part of the imployment of Tabacco to be made: another Merchant, he sendeth a Letter of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of a friend of his, that so much money shall be taken vp by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for Antuerpe or London, as shall be needfull for his part: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Merchant he causeth so much money to be made ouer to his Factor by exchange <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>om Antuerpe, as will furnish for his part. Two other Merchants dwelling in Spaine doe furnish their parts there themselues. And amongst them all, they admit in Spaine one Factor dwelling there to buy the Tabacco, and he hath a part with them, but findeth the meanes to disburse no money for his part, because he buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the said parcell of Tabacco (amounting to some twelue thousand ducats) and conditioned to pay a good part of it at six or more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. And the seuenth Merchant, he prouideth not any money, and neuerles wil haue his part, because he gaue order to his Factor to take it vp by exchange for London vpon him, promising that he would pay the same here. Hereupon the bargaine and imployment of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco is made, the goods receiued and sent ouer to London, where it is diuidedly deliuered to some of the said partners to be sold (with one and others priuitie) for the generall account of them all, to be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14410:114"/>
made vp amongst them to cleere the said account, and euerie man to haue his part of the benefit and profit, and likewise to beare such los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as may decrease their profit, according to equitie and conscience. <hi>Interim</hi> it happened, that the Factor who bought the said Tabacco, dyed insoluent, who did not only leaue his own part vnpaid, but a far greater summe, which the other two partners were faine to pay, being bound for it, in all amounting to 1300 <abbr>ll</abbr> sterling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Now the question is, How this losse shall be borne amongst them? The first Merchant, he saieth, I did send commodities, and by the prouenue thereof my part was payed by him that dyed, and that dependeth vpon accounts to be cleered betweene him and the partie deceased: the second Merchant, he sayeth, My part was paied in readie mony in Spaine, taken vp by a Letter of Credit, and I am to beare no part of the losse: and so saith the third Merchant, that made ouer his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by exchaunge from Antuerpe: the two partners dwelling in Spaine, they say, That they haue not onely paied their parts of the Tabacco, but also the 1300 <abbr>ll</abbr> which were owing to the Merchant that sold the Tabacco, and therefore they demaund much money due vnto them, and that resteth also vpon account betweene the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie deceased and them and others. The partie deceased (being decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) hath few to vndertake the administration of the estate: and the seuenth Merchant is contented to beare his part of the losse, so he may come in for his part of the gaine, and saith, That if the money had beene taken vpon him by exchange, hee would haue paied the same. But howsoeuer, he is able to proue that he had prouision suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to pay his part, in the hands of some of the partners there; and for as much as he hath borne the aduenture of the seas of his part of the Tabacco, he claimeth his part of the gaine; for if all had beene cast away at the seas, it is certaine the rest of the partners would haue made him to beare the losse of his part. And thus they are all in a Dilemma, and hauing some of them bonds, others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and some but accounts and papers, they know not how to make an end; and such as haue more than their owne, are remisse enough to procure an end. I haue thought good to set downe this Case, because men of vnderstanding may iudge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ow it is possible that the common Law (by the strict and peremptorie proceeding of it) can determine the same without the Law-Merchant, not knowing the Custome of Merchants, being also impossible to direct a Iurie of twelue men in the premisses, wherein I am now an Arbitrator my selfe.</p>

                  <p>All these are done by publicke authoritie of Princes and States, by Letters Patents granted for terme of yeares:<note place="margin">Engrossing.</note> but Engrossing is done by priuate persons of their owne authoritie, which is commendable, to keepe commodities in reputation to maintaine a trade thereby: as when men of meanes do engrosse and buy vp a commoditie, and for reasonable gaine they sell the same againe to shop-keepers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailers; this is much vsed amongst Merchants of all nations: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise when aboundance of a commoditie doth so much abate the price of it, that Merchants do become losers and discouraged, then the trafficke and trade is thereby ouerthrowne, to the generall hurt of the common-wealth. In which respect it is better to pay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more for commodities, than to haue them altogether ouer cheape, especially for commodities seruing for the backe,<note place="margin">Forestalling or Forestallers called by the Ciuilians <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danary.</hi>
                     </note> and not for the bellie, which diuers times by Forestallers become deere. Against which kind of people (Regrators and others) there are verie good lawes made, which the magistrates are to see obserued: and in France and Scotland, the Admirals of the seas haue an absolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to looke vnto this inconuenience.</p>
                  <p>The gouernment of Norenborough in Germanie is much to bee commended, not only for the prouident care to preuent Forestallers,<note place="margin">Commendable Engrossing.</note> but also for the engrossing or incorporating of all manufactures into their own hands to set the poore people continually on worke, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues causing the said manufactures to be sold at such reasonable rates, as none can make or prouide better cheape than they do, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aboundance is bought and sent for the West-Indies and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the mechanicall people are verie much cherished by them, and all Artists are welcome vnto them, which maketh their citie popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.

                  <p>The Ciuilians haue made the Latin word <hi>Monopolium,</hi> borrowed from the Greek, to be lesse vnderstood, because of their many difini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therof, which made me to treat of Associations, Monopolies, Engrossings, and Forestallings, as hauing affinitie one with another, and to describe them in diuided manner, as also to note their cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as followeth.

And as this is done many times by one Merchant, for one kind of commoditie (bee it Corne, Salt, Oyle, Woolles, and the like:) So may it bee done by a Societie of Merchants continually, vnder the colour of authoritie. Albeit that there be no combination to limit any certaine prices, for the sale of commodities in the particular of one Merchant or more Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants agreed together to buy vp a commoditie, it may bee called a forestalling.

                  <head>Definition of a Monopoly.</head>
                  <p>THe truest definition of a Monopoly therefore is, A kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in buying, selling, changing, or bartering, vsurped by a few, and sometimes, but by one person, and forestalled from all others to his or their priuate gaine, and to the hurt and detriment of other men; whereby of course or by authoritie, the libertie of Trade is restrained from others, whereby the Monopolist is inabled to set a price of commodities at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>A Merchant of London, hauing sent a great Ship to Zante, to lade Corrints and Wines, being there arriued; another Merchant there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting, vpon knowledge hereof, caused all the Corrints to bee bought vp, to preuent the said Merchant, and to compell him to buy the said Corrints of him at deare rates, to lade the said Ship, which made the Factor (appointed to lade the said Ship) at his wits end: But being ingenuous hee deuised a course to disappoint the said fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stalling Merchant, and caused Bills to be set vp in all publike places, to giue notice that the said Ship was come, to take in Merchants goods for her lading, and to returne for London: which being vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by him, brought him into a secondarie, and to set all the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Zante on worke, to helpe him to sell the said Corrints againe, whereby he became a loser. In this and the like cases the said Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to haue a care of preuention; otherwise it is the part of the Prince to looke vnto it with a politicke eye, vpon complaint to bee made, as of late yeares hath been done (when the French Merchants
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:14410:115"/>
did striue to bring new Wines first to the Market, thereby inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the price of Wines in France:) it was ordered and commanded by Proclamation, That no Wines growing in France, should be sold or put to sale, before the first of December, to bee obserued euerie yeare.</p>
                  <p>The like was done heretofore by our Merchants trading Spaine, in the buying of Rotta Raisons by an order amongst them, That none should bee sold by them before the last of October: which being knowne to Merchant Strangers, made them to preoccupie the Market (they not being bound to their orders;) so that this is to be done more properly by the Kings Proclamation.</p>
                  <p>Here I call to mind my former obseruation of that royall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie Tinne, which aboue one hundreth yeares since,<note place="margin">Preemption of Tinne.</note> was sold for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shillings the hundreth, when the best Veluet was sold for ten shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the yeard: how Merchants trading Turkie found fault with his Maiesties preemption of the said Tin, and caused the same to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, to keepe the price thereof at fiftie fiue shillings the hundreth, and (bringing in Corints, Leuant Wines, Spices, and Indico, at deere rates, as they sold them) vsed all meanes to suppresse the rising thereof: which being considered of by forraine Nations, caused them to vse meanes to incorporate or ingrosse the same, whereby that commoditie came to be of more estimation and request; where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pon the said Preemption was reestablished, which hath increased the stocke of the Kingdome since that time aboue six hundreth thousand pounds, being risen to double the price, and yet but proportionable to the price of Veluets and other commodities. On the contrarie, another commoditie Minerall, namely Copperas, which was sold heretofore (when there was Letters Patents for the sole making thereof) for 10 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and 12 <abbr>ll</abbr> the Tunne, whereof a great trade might haue beene made for other Countries: hath beene so ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by worke-men vnderselling one another, and for want of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly carriage, that the same is sold vnder 3 <abbr>ll</abbr> the Tunne, and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a meere drug out of request, by the abundance made and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly vented, bartered or exchanged. France yeelding aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Salt, although one yeare more than another, suffereth not the commoditie to bee ouermuch vilified. For albeit that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects within the Realme doe not care how good cheap they buy the natiue commodities, because of their owne benefit; yet the Prince ought to haue a care to reduce them into trade, with a respect of the forraine commodities brought into his Kingdome. So that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those Letters Patents or priuiledges graunted by them, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of new inuentions are necessarie: but also some directions to Companies or Societies, are (in policie) verie requisite.<note place="margin">Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for new inuentions.</note> Vertue in a Common-wealth ought as well, and rather (in some respects) to be more rewarded, than Vice to bee punished by cutting off the malefactors.</p>
                  <p>This is agreeable to the Common Law of the Realme, and the

fundamentall Lawes of all Nations: granting the Proiectors or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentors, priuiledges for twentie one or more yeares, which some men without distinction of Monopolies, would haue abridged to 14, 11, or 7 yeares, wherein the thing it selfe ought to make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, vpon good considerations, and not to measure all things alike. For example, the Graunt made for the sole importation of Spanish Tabacco,<note place="margin">The Farme of Tabacco.</note> doth gaine and saue the Kingdome many thousand pounds yearely: for Bayes, Sayes, Perpetuanoes, and the like commodities, which these two yeares haue beene sold in Spaine, with fifteene vpon the hundreth losse, to procure money to buy the said Tabacco, are now sold to so much benefit, besides the aduancement of the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Virginia and the Bermudas. But this is not proper to bee done for other commodities that are not of that nature, neither of commodities to be exported, wherein such and the like considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is to be had.</p>
                  <p>The generall intention of all Graunts by Letters Patents for Manufactures, hath a relation to set the people on worke, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the inuenter of the Art or Science, and that things may (in some measure) be better cheape to the subiects. What shall we say then, of those Graunts which make the commoditie good cheap to forraine Nations, and dearer to the subiects? Surely this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without some great abuse.</p>
                  <p>If a Keelne for the drying of Malt for all the Kingdome ouer, were inuented to bee done with Pit-coale, better cheape than with Wood fire, and more pleasing, without the sent of smoake; and that this Keelne or Keelns were placed in conuenient places, for all mens accesse, whereby they should saue much charges, and haue their Mault better cheape: if heereupon Letters Patents were granted to reward the Proiector, no man of iudgement will call this a Monopoly, nor any part thereof, although the publike libertie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth thereby to be restrained. For take it another way, and you shall find it rather to be a common distribution than a restraint whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it bringeth a generall good and commoditie to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
                  <p>The Statutes of the Kingdome restraining from the exercise of sundrie Crafts all such as haue not serued an Apprentishood vnto the Art which they would exercise, doe it to no other end but that those Arts might bee brought to better perfection, and the things made, might be good and seruiceable for those that buy and vse them.</p>
                  <p>Some men are well contented, if a prohibition or restraint of a commoditie be done by Act of Parliament, and they will no manner of wayes haue called the same to be a Monopoly, although it be so in effect, when a Societie of priuate Merchants haue a priuiledge to themselues onely to sell certaine commodities, or to import them, and all other subiects are excluded, although they were neither the discouerers or first inuenters thereof. But if it be done by the Kings
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14410:116"/>
Prerogatiue, then they take it to be a kind of Monopoly. So that, if it be by a dispensation vpon a Penall Law, they make the same que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable; wherein neuerthelesse the Princes wisedome is to rule for the good of the Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>Others would haue all things at large in the course of trafficke, and that there should be no Societies or Corporations of Merchants for any places of trade; but that by way of partenership, Merchants might associate themselues to make or enterprise some voyages, or in sending of commodities in copartnership, without regard had that innouations are dangerous, where the trade hath beene carried al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes by Companies or Societies, whereof some are of great anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie. This is more considerable in the gouernements of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies (and especially in Islands) than in State or popular gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the ouerballancing of forraine commodities is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected; neither the oueraboundant inhabitation of strangers, which augmenteth their Customes and Impositions laid at pleasure vpon their commodities; as a principall matter whereby they subsist.</p>
                  <p>Others make a difference betweene Companies or Associations, dealing in a ioynt Stocke, or apart; affirming the negotiation of a ioynt Stocke to be within the compasse of a Monopoly: Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would be contented to tollerate the same, for the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment outwards. But for the returnes homewards, they would haue a diuision in kind, or <hi>species</hi> of the commodities which they receiue; which is contrarie to the manner of the Portugalls, whose experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath made apparant vnto vs, that they haue for many yeares sold their Spices and other East-India commodities, with good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reputation for their benefit.</p>
                  <p>And in this course they vse many times other mens names,<note place="margin">Merchants vsing each others name.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Custome of Merchants; as they doe also manage other mens affaires in their owne names: but this is done with the priuitie of the partie whose name is borrowed, and thought worthy to bee trusted, otherwise it may prooue verie dangerous, especially in time of warre.</p>
                  <p>Touching forestalling of Corne or other commodities in Markets, it is (as I haue said) prouided for by Lawes; neuerthelesse the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilians haue noted, That by the Municipall Lawes of all Countries, it is not prohibited for any man to make his prouision of Corne, or other victualls for one whole yeare, and vpon changing of mind, to sell the same againe to profit.

Vpon consideration whereof some rich Citizens that haue great houses, and many Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers or Ware-houses and to let them at greater rents; haue beene contented to lend money vpon the goods brought into their Sellers and Ware-houses, paying after the rate of tenne in the hundreth for the yeare, and when they sell their goods they must pay them the said money: for they do trust Bayard in the Stable. In which regard the houses of Commerce are very necessary, and other such houses that are spacious to receiue great quantities of commodities, where the Customes and Impositions are only paied by the sale of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and you may borrow more money for little or no conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at all: and heereby doth a Merchant inlarge his trade, and young Merchants (hauing small Stockes) find great ease and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie.

                  <p>THe scituation of this House of Commutations or Commerce, would be verie commodious vpon the Tower hill, to be made of free stone; the proportion almost square, according to the said Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterlings house at Antuerpe, leauing a faire street on euerie side: the fore part thereof towards the riuer of Thames, and the water to be brought before it, by cutting in the docke below the Tower wharfe, so as two ships of ordinarie burthen might at one time come in to discharge at the Cranes to be made there for the purpose.</p>
                  <p>The drinesse of the ground is very fit to make great Cellars, in the middest a stately Court, and all the lower part of this house double Ware-houses for commodities of great Bulke, and ouer that Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries answerable to the lower part, set vpon stately Columes, full of Ware-houses for small wares of value: and so for a third Storie, and double Garrets for corne and such like commodities, reseruing some faire roomes for the entertainement of great personages (comming from beyond the seas) to feast them onely; also with a magnificent Turret, great Gates, and places with ballances and beames to weigh all sorts of commodities.</p>
                  <p>The earth of the Cellars would serue to raise the hither part of the ditches of the Tower to make them deeper, and part of the ground leuell, fit for goodly walkes; and for the scouring of the docke or entrance, a Mill might be made to grind mineralls, and other things.</p>

                  <p>When the clothiers shall haue this commodiousnesse, they will increase their trade, and set more people on worke to make good clothes, according to the statute, which will be more vendible in other places beyond the seas, to the generall aduancement of traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke, his maiesties Customes and Impositions, and all other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancies thereupon.</p>
                  <p>No man is compelled to bring his commodities to this House, but allured thereunto by the commodiousnesse and benefits thereof, because of the ease of Ware-house roome and Cellaridge at easier rates, the commoditie of sale or barter, the forbearing to pay Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and Imposts for a time, the taking vp of moneys to serue his turne, and the goods better assured than in other places.</p>

So likewise is it in the discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Commissioners to admit any creditor to come in, where the partie was suretie for another, if that partie be likewise decayed. For it is vsuall for interest money, that two or three are bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the collaterall Bonds which they giue each to other to saue harmelesse are to be considered, both by the said commissioners and the creditors.</p>
               <p>It is also prouided by the said Statute, That whosoeuer shall bee found to haue voluntarily yeelded to any arrest, or his bodie to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and so remaineth in prison, for, and during the time of sixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, thinking by that imprisonment to free his goods, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his creditors; against him may the said Commission bee sued forth and executed accordingly, for hee is to bee taken for a Banke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt according to the said Statute; and if the partie bee at libertie, against whom the said Statute of Bankerupt is taken out, the said Commissioners may (if they see cause) commit him to prison, and giue him some allowance for his maintenance. And of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there is a Register appointed, by his Maiesties Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents vnder the Great Seale of England to record the same, vntill the Lord Chanceller doe dissolue the said Commission by a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas.</hi>

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14410:120"/>
substance of things, by decrease and euaporation of boyling ouer the fire, otherwise called disturbers or consumers of other mens goods in the course of trafficke. Neuerthelesse they doe obserue great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions betweene these persons, as in the Treatise, <hi>De Decoctoribus,</hi> made by <hi>Benuenuto Straccha,</hi> appeareth. And the Definition of Bankerupts is three manner of waies distinguished:</p>
               <p>First, When a man becommeth insoluent, by losing his goods and other mens, by fortune, mischance, and casualtie, which man is not taken to be infamous by the Law, indeauouring to make satisfaction as he can.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When a man by wasting, spoyling, and viciously giuen, consumeth his owne and other mens goods, and hee by the Law is infamous.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When a man is decayed, partly by wasting and spoyling of his owne and other mens goods, and partly by misfortune, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; and this man is taken to be infamous, if he be vicious.</p>
               <p>Hereunto I may adde the fourth, and most vile person, who inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching himselfe with other mens goods, breaketh without iust cause, and onely of purpose to deceiue men, according to the aforesaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Roan. Albeit I am of opinion, that the said Ciuilians haue left them out of the number to bee criminally punished, as theeues to the Common-wealth, by the magistrats or princes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as the Banker of Florence was; who breaking for many millions of ducats, made a suddaine and deceitfull composition with his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors for the one halfe, and did pay them in readie money: which being vnderstood by the great Duke, hee caused his processe to bee made instantly, and thereupon hee was executed also accordingly; which was good iustice, and is to be done by the Magistrates, and not by the creditors.<note place="margin">Punishments of Bankrupts.</note> As of late yeares one of Genoa in Italy did vnto a debtor of his, whom he knew went about to deceiue him for great summes of money; whereupon hee caused a Chayre to be made, and called the partie to his house and intreated him to sit therein, which being made with certaine engines, did suddenly so gripe and claspe in his said debtor, that hee was compelled to pay him, or it might haue cost him his life. True it is, that in Russia a man hath leaue to beat, or to haue his debtor beaten vpon the hinder parts of the legs, if he cannot pay, and therewith is he discharged; which is not so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell as to keepe him alwayes in prison, and make him to indure a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering death, wherein the vndoing of wiues and children are made partakers vniustly.</p>
               <p>Concerning fraudulent dealers the Law is, That by making Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they shall not bee relieued, and may bee apprehended in the Church: whereas a free-man cannot bee arrested or taken in the Church, but may be vnto him a place of refuge.</p>
               <p>If hee bee found a fraudulent man by his bookes of account, then any bargaine or sale made two or three dayes before his breaking, by goods sold good cheape, may bee recalled and auoyded; and in like
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14410:121"/>
manner, if he pay one man after his breaking, the same may be taken to be done in fraud of all the other creditors, and may be recalled for the generalitie. So goods bought by him before breaking, if they be found <hi>in esse,</hi> may be claimed by the Seller to his particular vse and payment againe.</p>
               <p>All coniectures of fraud may bee augmented and aggrauated against the fraudulent man, according to the saying, <hi>Semel inuentum decies factum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man do breake in partnership, the partnership is <hi>ipso facto</hi> dissolued by law: but the credit of the other remaineth, paying the debts of the partnership.</p>
               <p>Also any commission giuen by him (for the partnership) is void in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly: howbeit, if a Factor by ignorance of his breaking, haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed his commission to be followed; that which is done doth bind the Master, and shall excuse the Factor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Suspitious Debtors.</note>A debtor suspected by others, may be touched before moneys be due, and the creditor may attach some of his goods or pawns: which is the cause that the writ of <hi>Latitat</hi> out of the Kings Bench court may be serued vpon them to find sureties for their apparance (at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of the writ) before the Iudges of the said court. But the lawes in diuers countries do verie much differ in the proceedings and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these fraudulent men.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A question for suretiship.</note>Here ariseth a question, Whether a Suretie can pretend to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, if the Creditors haue made or agreed with the Principal for a longer time of payment, and the Principall breaketh? The answer is, That if he knew of the new agreement of the said partie for a longer time, he is liable thereunto; otherwise being bound as a Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for a time limited, he ought to be cleered at that time, or to make suit or demand to haue his satisfaction of the Principall, as also of the Suretie, which being neglected, doth in equitie discharge the said Suretie: the reason is, because if the Suretie do break at or before the time of the payment, the Creditor may demaund another Suretie in that mans place which is broken, wherein the law is verie indifferent. And this is the cause that diuers Lord Chauncellours of England (for moneys taken vp at interest vpon bonds) were of opinion, That when the said moneys are continued or prolonged at interest, the bonds should be renewed, and the counter-bonds also, and not to leaue the old bonds for many yeares to be vncancelled; for it doth oftentimes happen vpon occasion of absence of some of the parties, that a new bond is sometimes sealed, and the old not taken in, which breedeth contention; for the new bond being made, the old is void, and yet may be vncancelled, and also put in suit by some executor or administrator ignorant of the other new bond taken for the same, and paied long before: Albeit herein it seemeth, there is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son not to make new bonds; howsoeuer diligent care must be had herein both by the parties and Scriueners which make the bonds.</p>
               <p>Concerning agreements to be made between Bankrupts and their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14410:121"/>
Creditors, there is a question made, That if Creditors do agree with their Debtors for some part of their debts,<note place="margin">Agreements to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and his Credi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ors.</note> because of the Debtors losses and misfortunes, Whether, when the parties being become rich againe may reuoke their agreement? And the law hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined this question, That if vpon the agreement, there be an Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance made by the Creditor, then the same agrement is absolute and cannot be reuoked, vnlesse the Acquittance were conditionall.</p>
               <p>The greatest number, or the greater summe of the Creditors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed with the Debtor, are bound to be conformable with the other, and to do the like with the helpe of authoritie, not onely by the Ciuile law, but also by the Merchants Court of Prior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, which authoritie is alreadie noted before to bee in the Lord Chauncellor. But the difference is great betweene the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Creditors, or the greater summe: for a man may haue an infinite number of small Creditors, or few Creditors for verie great summes by him owing; so that the greater number should ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the greater summes. It is therefore thought conuenient to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the greater summes, which neuer the lesse doth not hinder the smaller number to proceed vpon goods appertaining to the partie, if they can find them, if by the said authoritie the whole estate of the Decoctor be not managed:<note place="margin">Bills of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in Chancerie.</note> wherupon the Bills of conformitie were of late yeares vsed in the Chauncerie, which by the Parlement <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1621 are made void, because of diuers great abuses committed in thedefence of Bankrupts, who to shelter themselues from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of the Common-lawes, did preferre their Bills of complaint in Chauncerie, which was in the nature of a Protection, and the parties broken, became to be releeued for easie compositions with their Creditors, albeit at charges another way extraordinarie.</p>
               <p>Now concerning fugitiue persons (being indebted) if they be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, they are taken <hi>pro confesso</hi> to be Decoctors or Bankrupts,<note place="margin">Fugitiue Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</note> for they in substance by their absence denie to giue a reason of their los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to their Creditors, which they ought to do, if by fortune they are to haue good and fauourable dealing, if it shall appeare (that by los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and not by wastfull or lewd behauiour) they came behind hand, whereby the Creditors are induced to diuide in some measure the parties goods amongst them, as they may by the law and custome of Merchants.</p>
               <p>The statute (made in the 34 yeare of King <hi>Henrie</hi> 8) hath well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided against these fugitiue persons,<note place="margin">Proclamation against fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</note> that a Proclamation shall be made against them, That if they doe not returne within three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after they shall haue notice of it (which by <hi>Affidauit</hi> must be certified) to present themselues in some conuenient place to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that then they shall be proceeded against, as if they were contemners of the lawes of the realme. And in the meane time (by order from the Lords of the priuie Councell, who haue authoritie to grant a warrant for the Proclamation) all such reuenues of lands or goods to be sequestred, and afterwards to be sold as cause shall
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14410:122"/>
require for the paiment of the Creditors, which execution hath late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beene practised against diuers, but lyeth onely against the kings subiects, but not against strangers, nor other persons which are not Merchants or trades-men.</p>
               <p>All meanes of strict proceeding are to be vsed against those fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Merchants, as also other Decoctors, and against them that do giue them any aide or assistance, which is not tollerated by the law: for he that will helpe them because he may the sooner recouer of him his owne payment, may be conuicted of fraud by the law, when it is found out and discouered; besides that, the other Creditors may call that mony backe againe to be distributed amongst them. And the <hi>Dictio,</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing so often inculcated that important argument, whereby true Merchants are to be carefull, That trafficke and commerce may be profitable as well to the common-wealth, as to themselues; we may not omit to intreate of Manufactures, as an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter to the customarie Law of Merchants, considering the aboundance of materials and stuffe which the realms of England, Scotland, and Ireland doe affoord,<note place="margin">Idlenesse the root of all euill.</note> whereby the people may be set on worke to auoid idlenesse (which is the root of all euill) most dangerous in countries which are populous.</p>
               <p>Experience demonstrateth vnto vs, how many other nations (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing not stuffes of their owne, but from others) do neuerthelesse set their people on worke vpon the stuffe and materialls of other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, making and dispersing the same into a large trade. Therefore it is conuenient to incourage all men to reward new inuentions with some priuiledges for a time, and not for euer,<note place="margin">New inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded.</note> to auoid the course of Monopolie, and to make the benefit to the common-wealth more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, which maketh men painefull by the radicall moisture of gaine, whereof Merahants are to haue a consideration so to reward the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers and handy-crafts-mens labours, that they may liue by their worke, according to the Dutch Prouerbe, which themselues vse so frequently, <hi>Leuen ende laeten leuen,</hi> To liue and to let others liue. This is to be regarded also by states-men,<note place="margin">Liue and let liue.</note> forbearing to impose ouer great Customes to be paied vpon commodities, whereby the people is set on worke both vpon goods imported and exported. It is therefore prohibited in France, that tallow be brought in, but not candles; old shoes, but not cobled; paper, but not cards, and the like; much more for richer wares, as silkes, cotton-wools, and linnen &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The commodities which are not made at all, or but in small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie in England, and may be practised, are manie, as Buckrams, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie, Bustians, Cambrickes, Canuas, Cables, Babies, cloth of Gold and Siluer, Damaske, Diaper, Mather, Paper, and diuers other things; all which may bee made in time, <hi>Quia nemo nascitur artifex.</hi> And herein is to be considered, That all other nations being carefull
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:14410:123"/>
to maintaine manufactures, cannot but take an offence, if any other nation will endeauour to doe all, and to exclude others, which extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie enforceth another;<note place="margin">One extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie enforceth another.</note> as we haue found by the enterprise of the late new companie, for dressing and dying of all the white clothes in England, which caused other nations to make clothes of their owne by the woolls of other nations. For (as hath beene noted) it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to that common entercourse and mutuall course of commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, whereof some countries are destitute, and other countries do abound, thereby supplying the barrennesse of the one, with the superfluities of the other, maintaining a friendly correspondence and familiaritie.</p>
               <p>The Impresa, <hi>Sceptra foeuent.

                  <note place="margin">To vndersell commodities is verie dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note>The striuing of making commodities, and to vndersel one another, are dangerous, and preiudiciall to both parties: for by their contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they hinder each other, and bring commodities to be lesse estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This is a matter of great consequence for statesmen to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into their serious consideration; for as the Spaniard saieth, <hi>Quien todo lo quiere, todo lo pierde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Setting the fishing trade apart (which causeth all sorts of poore to imploy their hands, though they want legs) let me recommend vnto you,<note place="margin">Bogging of Peate and Turfe.</note> the making and bogging of Peate and Turfe, the rather for the want of wood, which England is like to haue in progresse of time, the woods being much decayed and inhaunced in price, and Peate and Turfe may bee made seruiceable to supplie the vses of wood, and set an infinite number of people on worke. As the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Yron, and all other mettalls made in fowndries and fineries: the boiling of mineralls, as Allome, Salt-peeter, Copperas, and the like, the burning of Brickes and Tyles, the making of Glasse, the refining of Sugar; besides the common vse for brewing, baking, dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other professions, and euerie man consuming wood more or lesse in his house, besides sea-coale.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Commodities by the bogging of Turfe.</note>And here I cannot omit to say something of the commodities which wil redound hereby to the commonwealth, namely all boggie wast grounds and quagmires (vnprofitable and dangerous for feeding of cattle and deere) shall be conuerted to profitable vses, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Peate and Turfe, and (in time) with the oft dreaning of the waters, turne to firme ground and fish-ponds. It will preuent the oft drowning of deere and cattell, venturing for some grasse grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in bogs and quagmires, whereby also many of them become rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by drinking the vnwholesome red waters thereof. All the said grounds wil be safer and pleasing for hunting and planting of woods, and the fish-ponds may be planted round about with Osiers &amp; hazel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:14410:123"/>
for hoopes, with diuers other profitable meanes, as in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: for the said turffe is to bee made according to their manner, auoiding the sulphurous smell, by two yeares drying of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their vse, and then they will in time bee vsed by most men which now find the said turffe to bee offensiue, as they did in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning when sea-coales came to bee vsed in priuate mens houses: if this had beene followed, the bogging of turffe had beene alreadie pleasing and profitable.</p>
               <p>Next let vs somewhat digresse from Manufacture, to Apifacture,<note place="margin">Apifacture of Hony &amp; Wax.</note> (and with <hi>Salomon</hi> the wise, send the sluggard to imitate the paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and laborious Bees) for the increase of Hony and Waxe in England, Scotland and Ireland, and others of his Maiesties domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: and let mans helpe succour this Apifacture, if it may be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as followeth.</p>
               <p>The meanes to increase Hony and Wax, doth properly consist in the preferuation of Bees, and the making of conuenient Skepes or Bee-hyues after a new inuention: Namely, you may make your Skepes either with Straw or Wicker of two sorts,<note place="margin">The Beehyue of two pieces.</note> and to bee of two pieces, to take off at the crowne or neere the midst of the Hyue; that when they haue gathered and filled vp their house, and that the roome is scant within then take away the vpper halfe and clap on a boord, or the bottome, or head of a pitch Barrell or tarre Barrell, or the like hauing pitch on it, casting Mault meale, or Beane meale vpon the same; and then daube it well with clay about the skirts, and setting on with your clay mixt with some salt; and when you haue thus done, then raise it vp below with so many wreythes, as you tooke aboue for the gelding of your Hyues before, which is verie needfull to make the greater plentie and increase. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your Skepes in this manner, the Hony may bee taken at all times; but especially, when you doe perceiue by the lifting vp of your Skepes, that your Bees are well prouided for the Winters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, and that there bee plentie of food yet to gather, then cappe them. Take a strong wyer, make it flat, and cut your combes in two, and then haue a parchment in readinesse to follow the wyer, to keepe a sunder the wax from cleauing, laying on your boord with pitch and meale, as aforesaid.

And at this day in Rome and many other places in Italy, if a man shall be found to liue idle and want meanes, offer is made vnto him to draw a lot for a summe of money, be it 30 40, 60, or a 100 ducats (as he may be reputed) to haue that money, or to become an Officer in their Gallies, where other malefactors are confined to serue.<note place="margin">Three Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stumes or the world.</note> For vnlesse the three Impostumes of the world, namely, Warres, Famine, and Pestilence, doe purge that great Bodie; all Kingdomes and Countries become very populous, and men can hardly liue in quiet, or without danger. Merchants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeking to discouer new countries, are much to bee commended and cherished, and their Customes are to be obserued as a Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, which hitherto haue beene herein kept vnuiolated.</p>
               <p>The vnfatigable industrie to make a compleat Plantation in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, and the Island of Bermudus,<note place="margin">Plantation of Virginia and the Bermudus.</note> (which hath beene verie charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) might haue beene farre better, if honest housholders and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of some abilitie hath beene induced thereunto by benefit and profit at the beginning, and meere poore people and vagabonds had not beene admitted but afterwards. This inducement should haue wrought in their Idea, an imaginarie common-wealth, and ought to haue beene done in this manner following.</p>
               <p>Make choice of some honest Shoemakers likely to try aduentures and to inrich themselues, know of them how many paire of Shoes they make yearely, whereby they liue and their families, although victualls be deare. Then let them know, that foure or fiue times so many shall be taken from them, and Leather bee deliuered them, if they will goe and inhabite in Virginia, where they shall haue houses and lands for themselues and their heires for euer, and their worke
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14410:125"/>
shall be taken from them, and they shal be duely paied, and that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number onely shall haue this priuiledge for certaine yeares, and none others to be admitted, albeit the number of people doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; wherby they may be sure of a certain beneficial liuing. And no doubt they wil aduenture that little they haue to inrich their means and estate, and persuade their wiues and seruants to go with them, who may succeed them vpon other good conditions. The like is to be done with Taylors, Bakers, Brewers, and other handicraftes-men, and (so conceauing a common-wealth within themselues) wil resolue and encourage many that are of some meanes to accompanie others of smaller means, whereby the base minded will be brought to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so painefull and industrious in time, and the charge of the vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers will be lesse, and more commodious to prouide the voyages with facilitie.</p>
               <p>The like was to be put in practise by the Hollanders, in the Island of saint <hi>Thomas</hi> vnder the line: but the extreamitie of the heate of that Climate did bring a disorder, and the attempt was giuen ouer. It is more like to be established in other places: for albeit the warres in Europe will diminish the people, yet most countries are populous.</p>
               <p>Politicians although they are much mistaken in the number of parishes of seuerall kingdomes, yet are they not in the number of the persons or inhabitants.</p>
               <p>France containing by late estimation about 27400 parishes,<note place="margin">What people in France in numbers &amp;c.</note> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in 44 hundreth thousand families, of fiue persons to a familie (where in England six persons are accounted to be in a familie) is 22 millions of persons.</p>
               <p>England containing 9725 parishes, 52 shires, and 26 cities, is esteemed in 28 hundreth thousand families of six persons, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth 16 millions, and 800 thousand persons.</p>
               <p>Scotland containing aboue 4000 parishes, is esteemed to haue about 1500 thousand persons or families of six persons, is nine milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of persons.</p>
               <p>Ireland containing 5500 parishes, was esteemed not to containe the two third parts of Scotland, which is now much increased.</p>
               <p>The prouince of Flanders (one of the 17 Netherlands) esteemed to containe 140 thousand families, of fiue persons, is 700 thousand persons, which is more than the kingdome of Denmarke being ten times more spacious.</p>
               <p>Now omitting to speake of other countries,<note place="margin">Too populous is dangerous in Monarchies</note> let vs obserue that in all popular gouernments, be it an Aristocracie, or Democracie, the meanes to make countries populous is thought reasonable, which in Monarchies is held to be dangerous. The concourse of people cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the greater consumpsion of all things, and the reuenues are great by Impositions, and it giueth life to trafficke and commerce.</p>
               <p>The Plantation of Vlster (one of the foure Prouinces of Ireland) is now verie great, and the meanes to set the people on worke are to be taken in hand, which may be done by a Corporation of English

               <p>And here I remember a good obseruation heretofore made touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdome of Ireland, Why the same was not brought vnto perfect obedience to their soueraigne these 400 year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hey kept their cattle, liuing by the milke of the cow, without husbandrie or tillage; there they increased and multiplyed vnto infinit numbers by promiscuous generation among themselues; there they made their assemblies and conspiracies without discouerie; but they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the weaknesse of the English dwelling in the open plaines, and thereupon made their fallies and retraits with great aduantage. Whereas on the other side, if the English had builded their castles and townes in those places of fastnes, &amp; had driuen the Irish into the plaines and open countries, where they might haue had an eye and obseruation vpon them, the Irish had beene easily kept in order, and in short time reclaimed from their wildnesse, and would haue vsed tillage, and by dwelling together in towneships learned mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall Arts and Sciences. This discourse may seeme strange to the Law of Merchants: but when Merchants vndertake Plantations (as we see they do) no man will hold the same to be impertinent.</p>

either of Turkes or Moores; and according to this maner of life (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they want Yron and Guns) they haue not need of any thing. But they abound with many excellent commodities, whereof the Spaniards will in time make vse, especially if they be more assured of Gold there to be found, as in part they are of Siluer and Pearles; for these are the three most pretious darlings that lie and are cherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in the bosome of Nature. To say nothing of Spices and Drugs whereof they abound, with many other commodities, by the said Captaine declared.</p>
               <p>And here we may not omit to remember, That it is not enough to discouer countries, and leaue them without plantation, or at the least neglect the vse of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Merchants do giue ouer their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises: But it is the part of Princes to see plantations made,<note place="margin">True causes to make planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> for two maine reasons, That is, to conuert the inhabitants or neighbours to Christianitie; and, to the end such temporal blessings may be enioyed as the land and seas do affoord: most requisit to be done in the Island of New found-land, bordering vpon the coast of America, from which it is diuided by the sea, so far distant as England is from the neerest part of Fraunce, and lyeth betweene 46 and 53 degrees North latitude, as Captaine <hi>Richard Whitbourne</hi> hath verie well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in his discouerie, affirming the spaciousnesse thereof to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as Ireland: and therein he hath noted many disorderly cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses committed by some Traders and fishing Merchants, in setting forth to the New-found-land, which are worthie the obseruation and knowledge of Merchants, because that the like errors may not be committed in other voyages, which by this good aduice may be preuented or reformed.</p>
               <p>It is well knowne, saieth he,<note place="margin">Worthie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations for plantation for the fishing trade.</note> That they which aduenture to New-found-land a fishing, beginne to dresse and prouide their ships readie commonly in the moneths of December, Ianuarie, and Februarie, and are readie to set forth at sea in those voyages neere the end of Februarie, being commonly the fowlest time in the yeare: and thus they do, striuing to be there first in a Harbour to obtaine the name of Admirall that yeare, and so to haue the chiefest place to make their fish on, where they may do it with greatest ease, and haue the choice of diuers necessaries in the Harbors. And thus by their hasting thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, oftentimes there comes not only dangers to themselues, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so great mischiefe and losses to many others which arriue there after the first, as it may by that which followes truely appeare.</p>
               <p>For by the hasting forth (as now they vse) they greatly endanger themselues, being many times beaten with rough and stormie windes, and oftentimes they are thereby forced to returne backe with great losse both of mens liues and goods, as it is well knowne; so that to get the superioritie to arriue there first in an Harbour, they will beare such an ouerprest saile, and in so desperate a maner, as there are no true vnderstanding sea-men that vse the like to any place of the world. For albeit when the fogs are thicke, and the nights darke,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14410:127"/>
that sometimes they cannot discerne the length of three ships in the way before them, and the yee often threatning much perill vnto them; yet on runnes the ship amaine so fast as po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sibly she may, when commonly most part of the companie are fast a sleepe, euen with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hazard of their liues. Thus many times both ships and men haue beene cast away suddenly, to the vtter vndoing of many aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers and families.</p>
               <p>And also this vntimely setting forth consumeth a great quantitie of victualls that might be saued to better purpose, and it forceth them to carrie and recarrie many more men in euerie ship (euerie voyage) than they need, if they once take a fitter course.</p>
               <p>Such Stages and Houses that the first arriuers find standing in any Harbors (wherein men set diuers necessaries, and also salt their fish) some men haue vsed to pull downe, or taken their pleasures of them: by which vnfit disorders of some first arriuers there yearely, those which arriue after them are sometimes twentie daies and more, to prouide boords and timber to fit their boats for fishing, and other necessarie roomes to salt and drie their fish on, whereby much time is lost, and victualls consumed to no purpose, and thereby also the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of the after-commers are often greatly hindered and prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to the generall hurt of the common-wealth: and the mariners themselues which commit those great abuses are thereby also much wronged, as themselues may conceiue.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if such as henceforth aduenture to that countrie, take some better course in that trade of fishing than heretofore they haue vsed, they shall find the greater safetie of their aduentures, and much good thereby.<note place="margin">Penefits arising by reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> For whereas heretofore they haue vsed to make rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die their ships to saile in those voyages in such vnseasonable time of the yeare, whereby they often receiue such hinderances and losses, they need not then to go in the said voyage vntill the fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth day of March, which is a fit time of the yeare to put forth to sea from our coast to that countrie, the Winter stormes beginning then to cease: and then any such ship which carries in her thirtie men in euerie voyage, may well leaue six men there behind them, or more all the Winter season, vntill the ships returne to them againe; and these six mens victuals will be saued and serue to better vse, and thereby also cut off that moneths setting forth in those voyages so soone in the yeare as now men vse to do; and then the victualls for that moneth (which is so vainely, and with such great danger consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) may well maintaine those men which are left in the countrie all the Winter season, till the ships returne to them againe, with a verie small addition to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Couenient priuiledges to be granted.</note>And it may be thought reasonable, That men which will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to settle people in New-found-land, shall haue this priuiledge, that in case he leaue there a fifth person (of such as he carries thither in his fishing voyage) to inhabite, whereby those men so left might keepe a certaine place continually for their fishing and drying of it,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14410:127"/>
whensoeuer their Ship arriueth thither: then would all such as leaue people there, build strong and necessarie roomes for all purposes, and then in some necessarie houses and roomes they may put their fish when it is dryed, which fish now standeth after such time it is dryed, vntill it is shipped (which is commonly aboue two moneths) in great heapes packt vp vncouered in all the heat and raine that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, whereby great aboundance of good fish is spoiled yearely, and cast away for want of such necessary rooms. And for the want of such fit houses some mens voyages haue beene ouerthrowne; and then a meane place to make fish on wil be made more commodious than the best place is now, that men so dangerously and desperately runne for euerie yeare.</p>
               <p>And thus euerie mans fishing Pinnaces may bee preserued in such perfect readinesse, against his Ship shall yearely arriue there againe; which Pinnaces are now often lost, and sometimes torne in pieces by the first arriuers there, very disorderly: and if such Pinnaces, Stages, and Houses may bee maintained and kept in such readinesse yearely, it would bee the most pleasant, profitable and commodious trade of fishing that is at this time in any part of the world.</p>
               <p>For then euerie Ships companie might fall to fishing the verie next or second day after their arriuall, whereas now it is twentie dayes before they are fitted; and then such Ships should not need so soone to hast away from England by one moneth, at the least mens liues might be thereby much the better saued, lesse victualls wasted, and many dangers preuented. And so euerie Ship in euerie such voyage, may gaine quickely one hundred pounds, that vsually carrie in her but twentie men more than now they doe, by leauing of foure men there of twentie. And as the proportion before named holds, for leauing sixe men in New-found-land of thirtie; so the allowing of men to be made proportionably fro euerie Ship,<note place="margin">An easie way for plantation.</note> will soone raise many people to be settled in euerie harbour where our Nation vseth to fish, and in other harbours in other Countries in like manner, some Ships by this course may then quickely gaine two hundred pound, and some 300 <abbr>ll</abbr> and more, according to their greatnesse, more than they doe yearely now; and those men so left will manure land for Corne, saw boords, and fit timber to bee transported from thence, and search out for diuers commodities in the countrie, which as yet lie vndiscouered: and by such meanes the land will bee in little time fitly peopled with diuers poore handycrafts men, that may bee so commodiously carried thither with their wiues: and that no man else should appropriate to himselfe any such certaine place, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie for his fishing voyage, except hee will in such manner settle a fifth part of his companie there to liue. And then such aduenturers thither will carefully prouide yearely for such as they leaue there, not onely for bread and victualls, but likewise for all necessarie tooles fit for any kind of husbandrie. And the charge thereof will yearely repay it selfe with the benefit of their labours that

               <p>By this meanes will shipping increase, men be imployed, and two voyages may be made yearely, and much victuall saued: for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of victuall to maintaine sixe men to carrie them and recar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them outwards and homewards, is sixe Hogsheads of Beere, and sixe hundred weight of Bread, besides Beefe and other prouision: which men as they sayle too and fro (as now they vse) doe little good or any seruice at all, but pester the Ship in which they are, with their Bread, Beere, Water, Wood, Victuall, Fish, Chests, and diuers other trumperies that euery such sixe men doe cumber the Ship withall yearely from thence, which men are to be accounted vnnecessary persons returning yearely from thence.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Ome men may wonder, and not without iust cause, That this most important argument of Fishing hath not beene handled hitherto. But in truth my meaning was not to haue touched the same, because of the neglect of it in the Kingdomes of Great Brittaine, and Ireland, where the same is abandoned vnto other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: howbeit vpon better consideration (calling many things to mind) I found that it would haue beene a great error to passe ouer the same with silence, and to omit the Customes of Merchants therein, as the fundamentall cause of the trafficke and trade of diuers Nations, whose great wealth hath proceeded from the same. For it hath pleased almightie God, to extend his blessings herein, more than in all other things created: For when God said to the earth, <hi>Let it bring forth Trees and Plants:</hi>

This ought to stirre vs vp to establish the fishing trade, especially for Herrings, Cod, and Ling, which tooke his originall from vs: for it is not much aboue one hundreth yeares since that one <hi>Violet Stephens,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Originall of the fishing Trade.</note> and other discontented Fishmongers departed the Realme of England, and went into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to the Towne of Enchusen, where they procured the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to fish for them in the seas, streames, and dominions of Great
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14410:129"/>
Brittaine: which inhabitants (vpon the decease of the said English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) tooke the whole trade to themselues, which afterwards hath beene disperced into many other Townes, whereby the trade is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, that Holland and Zealand haue aboue 2000 Busses or Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ships, which doe make ordinarily two or three voyages yearely, albeit their countrey is remote from our Seas; and England, Scotland and Ireland haue the fishing (as it were) at their doores. And such is the blessing of almightie God, that aboue sixe hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Lasts of fish are taken yearely in the dominions of the King of Great Brittaine onely, ommitting the quantitie of fish taken in Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke Seas, Russia, New-found-land, Spaine, Italy, and other dominions.</p>
               <p>And here I am to make a little abridgement of the collection of one <hi>Tobias Gentleman,</hi> a Fisher-man, who made a Treatise touching the same, intituled <hi>Englands way to win wealth, and to imploy Ships and Mariners,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">That fishing is lawfull, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> proouing first, The lawfulnesse of it by his Maiesties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of Great Brittaine; secondly, How feasible it is for them by the exemplarie actions of other Nations, that haue nothing growing in their owne land for that vse, but are constrained to fetch all out of other countries; lastly, That the trade of fishing is profitable, by the successe seene with the Hollanders being rich and opulent, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their long warres, and which themselues doe call to be their chiefest trade and principall Gold-mine, whereby many thousands of their people of trades and occupations are set on worke, maintained, and doe prosper,<note place="margin">Proclamation of the States of the vnited Prouinces.</note> as may bee seene by their Proclamation annexed to the said Treatise.</p>
               <p>Hereupon hee sheweth, That about Mid-may they make readie their Busses, and Fisher-fleetes, and by the first of Iune (their Stile) they are seene to sayle out of the Mase, Texell, and the Vly, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand sayle together for to catch Herrings in the North Seas, being most of them ships of 120, or 100 tunnes, and the other 60 tunnes or thereabouts; hauing in them 24 men, and some 16, and 20 in euery ship; &amp; they continue their course North-west and by North, vntill they arriue at the Isle of Shotland,<note place="margin">The scituation of Shotland Isle.</note> which is the dominion of the king of great Brittaine, and the greatest Island of the Orcades, &amp; lyeth in the height of 60 degrees of Northerly latitude. And by the 14 day of Iune (which is by their law a time limited to lay their nets) they begin to fish, &amp; do neuer leaue the skoales of herrings, but come along amongst them, following 500 miles in length, lading their ships twice or thrice before they come to Yarmouth, sending them away by the Merchants ships that send them victuals, barrels, and more salt and nets if they need any; which ships are called Yagers, that is to say Hunters or Doggerbotes, and these ships docarry them, and sell them in the East countries, some to Riga and Reuell, some to the Narue, Russia,<note place="margin">Places to sell Herrings.</note> Stockholme, and all Poland, Prussia, Pomerland, Lituania, Statin, Lubek, and Denmarke; returning Hemp, Flax, Cordage, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Iron, Corne, Soapashes, Wax, Wainscot, Clapboord, Pitch, Tar,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14410:129"/>
Deales, Hoopes, and other commodities, with plentie of money; and for France, they send for Burdeaux, Rochell, Nantes, Morliaix, and San Mallous, Cane in Normandie, Roan, Paris, Amiens, and all Picardie, and Calice, with the Low-countries of the Archduke of Austria, reconciled with the king of Spaine, returning other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and moneys for the prouenue of their fish. For by their laws all those<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Herrings that they do catch in Yarnmouth seas, from Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholomew tide vntill saint Andrew (which are rope-sicke) they may not bring home into Holland; and these they sell vnto Yarnmouth men for readie money.</p>
               <p>Their fishing for Cod and Lings continually is done with smaller ships (of 40 tun burden) called Pinkes and Welboats, and all this is done with so good order and prouision,<note place="margin">Good orders in the fishing trade.</note> that by night and day all is supplyed, and fish taken off instantly. And of mine owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, they are so constant in their fishing, that they are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to haue one good yeare for fishing in seuen yeares. All fishermen are prouided for, and their wiues at home cannot want; for in their care, they may be compared to <hi>Ioseph</hi> in Aegypt, prouiding for the time of famine.</p>
               <p>They haue besides all this (continually in the season) another fleete of Fisher-men (called Flyboats) which are in number some two hundreth or more, and these be at the North-East of Shot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, hauing small boats with them, called Cobles, and by meanes of them Lings are taken in great aboundance, which they do not barrell, but splet and salt them in the ships bulke. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of fresh Fish, and other prettie obseruations of the said <hi>Tobias Gentleman,</hi> let vs note the commodious fisher-townes of England, as Colchester, Harwich, Orford, Alborough, Donwich,<note place="margin">Commodious towns for fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> Walders<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wike, Sould, Yarnmouth, Blackney, Wels, Linne, Boston, and Hull by him named; whereunto I may adde Scarborough, Hartlepole, Whitby, Marske, Stockton, Gysborough, New-Castle, and other places in the North. And it is to be much admired, that this trade hath been so long neglected: howbeit some are of opinion, That it would hinder much to the trade of cloth, if fishing were entertained, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the returne of our commodities, and that the priuiledges granted to diuers societies (as the Merchants Aduenturers, East-land,<note place="margin">The first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to the fishing trade.</note> and Russia Merchants) should be infringed therby, and so both trades cannot subsist together.</p>
               <p>Others say,<note place="margin">The second obiection.</note> That other nations are more painefull and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than we can be, and haue more skill in the cutting, packing, and salting of the Fish; and which is more, they can send away their Fish (and pay no fraight) by their ships going (otherwise) emptie for corne and salt; for they pay but foure shillings for a Last, which is drinking mony. And the Hamborgers hauing heretofore imitated the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to fish with Buffes for Herrings after 5 or 6 yeares triall, haue beene compelled to abandon the fishing, and suffer their ships to lie by the rotting, because they found a losse, and that the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14410:130"/>
Hollander did out sell them, hauing the better and cheaper fish; and the like would befall England, as some haue alreadie found.</p>
               <p>To these two obiections, The one being Domesticke, and the other Forraine, I make this answere; which is referred to the iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answere to the first.</note>That the trade of cloth should be hindered by the fishing trade, is not probable, being a distinct commoditie which serueth for the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and the other for the backe, and both are sold by vs and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in one more places, and we both make our returnes home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by commodities, money and exchange for moneys by Bills, so that the difference of the persons maketh not any sollid argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for if we returne commodities for commodities, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne moneys, we may returne both the one and the other, hauing meanes more than sufficient to maintaine the trades, considering the great summes of money deliuered at interest, although the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>in specie</hi> be wanting, which by these meanes would be supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And concerning the priuiledges graunted to seuerall socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it will bee easie to reconcile them by good orders to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the fishing trade; wherein all men of seuerall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies may participate, and the generall good is alwaies to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the particular, and that societie which is against the common good ought not to bee admitted or continued for any priuate respect.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answere.</note>To the second obiection, That other nations are more painefull and industrious, and haue more skill in the cutting, salting, and pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of fish, and pay no fraight for the transportation of their fish: Suppose it be so as you say for the present, yet you cannot denie but that the same may be amended by vse and custome, seeing our people can endure all climates and hardinesse as well as others, and by good orders and gaine may be allured to vndertake labour and pains, when want breedeth industrie, and gaine is like a second life.</p>
               <p>The managing to make fish more merchantable and vendible, may be learned of others in time, and for wages men will be procured that shall teach others; we know that the prouerbe is true, <hi>omne principi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um graue.</hi> The like may bee said touching the fraight of shipping, which in processe of time may be had in the same manner, if the coast Townes of England were made and appropriated to bee the Ware-houses or Megasins for the grosse commodities of those countries where the Herrings are sold: For the scituation of England is farre more commodious to send away the said commodities for all other countries, and in diuers places at all times and seasons of the yeare, when their countries are frozen for many moneths together, or want many times winde and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to performe their voyages, which was the cause that the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgers could not conueniently continue their fishing trade, as is alledged.</p>
               <p>Hauing answered sufficiently (as I hope) the two maine obiections
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14410:130"/>
against the fishing trade, let vs now examine the benefit of it, by the calculation made by the said gentleman. Now to shew truely, saith he, what the charge of a Busse will be, with all her furniture, as Masts,<note place="margin">The whole charge of a Busse.</note> Sailes, Anchors, Cables, and with all her fishers implements and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances at the first prouided all new, is a great charge, she being betweene 30 and 40 Last, will cost fiue hundreth pounds, and may continue 20 yeares with small cost and reparations: but the ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He hath noted moreouer, that besides the Hollanders, the French men of Picardie haue also a hundreth saile of fishermen onely for Herrings, on his maiesties seas euerie yeare in the Summer season, and they be almost like vnto Busses, but they haue not any gagers to come vnto them: but they do lade themselues, and returne home twice euerie yeare, and find great profit by their making of two voyages yearely.</p>
               <p>And hereupon he concludeth with an exhortation to all noble,<note place="margin">Exhortation for the fishing trade.</note> worshipfull, and wealthie subiects, to put too their aduenturing and helping hands for the speedie launching and floating forward of this great good common-wealth businesse, for the strengthning of his maiesties dominions with two principall pillars, which is, with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of coine brought in for fish and Herrings from forraine nations,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14410:131"/>
and also for the increasing of mariners against all forreine inuasions, and for the bettering of trades, and setting of thousands of poore and idle people on worke.</p>
               <p>But now returning to the lawfulnesse of fishing, wherein we are to obserue, That albeit hunting, hawking, and fishing be of one kind, as subiect to a like law and libertie, because that any wild beast, fowle or fish being once taken by any man, commonly it becommeth his owne proper by the law of nations; yet there is a difference between these three: and although hunting and hawking be almost euerie where lawfull, yet fishing is forbidden in other mens ponds, stankes, and lakes, as comparable vnto theft.</p>

            <p>Let vs now speake of the properties of Moneys in the course of Trafficke, and make the effects thereof apparant.<note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The first propertie is, That plentie of Money maketh generally all things deere, and scarcitie of Money maketh generally things good cheape: whereas particularly commodities are also deere or good cheape, according to plentie or scarcitie of the commodities them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and the vse of them. Money then (as the Bloud in the bodie) containeth the Soule which infuseth life; for if Money be wanting, Trafficke doth decrease, although commodities be aboundant and good cheape: and on the contrarie, if Moneys be plentifull, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce increaseth, although commodities be scarce, and the price thereof is thereby more aduanced. Nay by Money a trade is made for the imployment of it both at home and abroad: For those coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries (where things are good cheape) are destitute of trade, and want Moneys; and although things for the bellie are good cheape, there is lesse benefit to be made by Merchants.</p>
            <p>According to plentie or scarcitie of Money then, generally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities become deere or good cheape, and so it came to passe of late yeares, that euerie thing is inhaunced in price by the aboundance of Bullion and Moneys (which came from the West-Indies into Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope) which like vnto an Ocean,<note place="margin">The Ocean of Moneys.</note> hath diuided her course into seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell branches through all countries, and the Money it selfe being alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by valuation as aforesaid, caused the measure to be made lesser, whereby the number did increase to make vp the tale, being aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by denomination from twentie to sixtie, or of those latter yeares from fortie to sixtie.</p>
            <p>So that plentie of Money concurring herein made euerie thing deerer, and especially the forreine commodities, as we haue noted before, which caused some men to be of opinion, That our Moneys should be more inhaunced (as it were) striuing therein to exceed other nations, wherein they are farre from the marke,<note place="margin">Alteration of M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ney alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the price of things.</note> for if that were done, not onely all the forreine commodities would be deerer, but also our home commodities, howbeit onely in name. The like
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:14410:135"/>
would happen, if Moneys were (by allay of Copper) imbased, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience hath proued in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, and of latter yeares in the realme of Ireland: so that we see the Prouerbe to be true, <hi>That the vnknowne disease putteth out the Physitians eye.</hi> The plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Money required, must be, not with a consideration that we haue (or may seeme to haue) more moneys than in times past, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the present great quantitie and aboundance of Moneyes now found in all countries, which (in effect) haue more proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable part thereof than England hath. Neither was Money more plentifull when an ounce of Siluer was valued but twentie pence, (iudging of Money as we do of Commodities, either deere or good cheape according to the price) for Money must be still the measure, and ouerruleth the course of Commodities: Howbeit Exchange of Moneys, is predominant ouer Commodities and Moneys, as shall be declared hereafter.</p>
            <p>The second propertie of Money (proceeding from the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Vsurie deuised thereupon,<note place="margin">The operation of Money by the rate of Vsurie.</note> whereby the measure is ingrossed and also falsified) is, That the rate of Vsurie is become the measure whereby all men trade, purchase, build, plant, or any other waies bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; and consequently all things depending vpon the premisses, are ruled and gouerned accordingly, as in the Chapter of Vsurie Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticke is declared, to the decrease of Trafficke and Trade.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Moneys will haue substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all value really</note>The last propertie of Money is, to haue an internall value in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whereupon the Exchanges of Money are grounded; in so much that in countries where the transportation of Money is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, and Merchants Strangers and others are commaunded to make their returnes in Commodities, or by Exchange; if the Moneys be base, or of Copper, the value in Exchange will be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, to the vtter ouerthrow of all Commerce; for Moneys will haue substantiall value.</p>

                  </note> Booke of <hi>Moses</hi> of Creation and Generation, they would not haue ascribed the guiding and conducting of all naturall things to the two Leaders, namely the Starres, and Nature. Hence it procedeth, that amongst vegitable things (which haue a Being and Life) they reckon all mettalls, which haue their beginning from Sulphur and Mercury, <hi>Tanquam ex patre &amp; matre</hi>; which meeting and concurring together in the veines of the earth, doe ingender through the heat and qualitie of the Climate by an assiduall concoction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the earth wherein they meet, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either good and pure, or stinking and corrupt) produceth the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of the mettalls of Gold, Siluer, Copper, Tin, Lead, and Yron, in their seuerall natures: and hereupon they haue assigned them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their distinct Planets, to bee beneuolent or maleuolent;<note place="margin">The Planets of Metalls</note> as Lead vnder <hi>Saturne,</hi> Tinne vnder <hi>Iupiter,</hi> Yron vnder <hi>Mars,</hi> Gold vnder <hi>Sol,</hi> Copper vnder <hi>Venus,</hi> Quickesiluer vnder <hi>Mercury,</hi> and Siluer vnder <hi>Luna.</hi> So Mercury or Quickesiluer is one of the seuen mettals, which being volatile and by his volubilitie running with euery one, is in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as they are, either good or euill.

Tin vnder the beneuolent Planet <hi>Iupiter</hi>; experience hath proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto vs, that Tin is the poyson of all mettalls. Sulphur is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which they say is of two colours, being white and corrupt in the Siluer, which therefore falleth away; but red and pure in the Gold, and therefore permanent.</p>
               <p>These diuersities of mettalls being come to passe by accidentall causes, is the cause that Art (being Natures Ape by imitation) hath endeuoured to performe that wherein Nature was hindered. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>Facilius est distruere Accidentale, quam Essentiale,</hi> So that the Accidentall being destroyed, the Essentiall remaineth, which should be pure. But this cannot bee done without proiection of the Elixar or Quintescense vpon mettalls. Hence proceedeth the studie of all the Philosophers to make their miraculous Stone, which (I confesse) is very pleasant, and full of expectation, when a man seeth the true and perfect transmutation of mettalls;<note place="margin">Transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mettalls.</note> Lead and Yron into Copper; the Ore of Lead into Quickesiluer or <hi>Mercurie,</hi> with a small charge to a very great profit, as it hath beene made for me, vntill the make<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To returne to our Philosophers, concerning the Essence of Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls, they haue beene transcendend in the knowledge thereof, for they shew the generation of Sulphur and <hi>Mercurie</hi> in this manner.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. Of Mines Royall.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Mines called Royall are only of Gold, Siluer, and Copper, of which three mettalls Princes made choice to make their moneys of, simple or mixed, as shall be hereafter declared. But for as much as Siluer is found in the lead Mines, and that the siluer Mines haue their Ores mixt with hard lead also, it happeneth many times, that there are great questions about these Mines, when Princes will claime their interest in some lead Mines, because they are rich in sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: as of late yeares betweene Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Earle of Northumberland, as you may read in Master <hi>Plowdens</hi> Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Booke Cases, where it was adiudged, That if a Mine be found richer in siluer of more value within the Ore, than of lead, all char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the working of both mettalls being fully paied; the Prince may claime the same to be a Mine Royal: wherein must be had great aduisement, some Ore in one place being richer than other Ore in another place of the same Mine, whereof we may handle in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place of other Mines.</p>
               <p>Beginning therefore with Gold, the most precious mettall,<note place="margin">Gold Mines.</note> let vs obserue, That the same is found in hills, riuers, and in the earth, but not mixt in Ore, as Siluer, Copper, and other mettals. That which is found in the riuers is the finest, as containing lesse corruption, and is all of one goodnes otherwise. There is Mayden-gold, so called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was neuer in the fire. Naturally all Gold hath a little Siluer
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:14410:138"/>
in it, as also some Copper, and comming out of the ground it is soft, and doth harden by the ayre. Such Gold as hath no need to be refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but may be vsed according to his finesse in workes, or to make money, is called <hi>Aurum obrison</hi>: such was the Gold which sir <hi>Beuis Bulmer</hi> knight brought out of Scotland, found in the sands of the riuers neere vnto the Gold Mines of Crayford-moore,<note place="margin">Crayford Moore in Scotland.</note> which was aboue twentie and two Carrats fine, and better than the French crowne Gold. I saw some eighteene ounces of it which was in big graines, some like pease found out by the Sheepheards, by whose meanes that place hath beene discouered in the latter time of queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Some other Gold hath beene found out also in Scotland within a white sparre, wherin it groweth, neere the superficies of the earth, &amp; runneth into smal veyns like pins, fit to be refined by quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siluer from the sparre, because it is as pure Gold as any found in Africa or Barbarie, which we call Angell Gold, holding but halfe a graine of Allay. I haue seene the like sparre of Gold which was found in England in countie of Lincolne at Brickell hill neere Spilsbie by Lincolne.<note place="margin">Brickell Hill in England.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But neither this place or any other are lookt into for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hereafter declared, being right worthie to be regarded with a curious eye, and an industrious vnderstanding; and consequently many other, whereof this Monarchie of Great Brittaine is rarely blessed, and especially in Scotland where much barren ground is: for God in his diuine wisdome doth counteruaile the said barrennesse of the soile, with the riches contained within the bowels of the earth, as in fertile ground with the Corne and fruits growing vpon the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies thereof:<note place="margin">An obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to find out any Mines.</note> which may serue vs for an obseruation, especially where we find riuers of water running about the hillie places in dales, which the Spaniards did so much regard in the West-Indies, seeking after Mines, that in all places where they found not the same, they presently gaue ouer the search after them.</p>
               <p>Gold doth come out of many countries, as out of the mountaines in Bohemia, riuers of Pannonia in Hungarie, out of the kingdome of Sweaden; but it is all exhausted. There was wont to come out of Spaine of the riuers and mountaines aboue twentie thousand pound weight yearely, which is worth aboue eight hundreth thousand pounds sterling; but there is none found now. In the Island of Santo Domingo all is exhausted also; and so will it be in Perou, and the West-Indies: it is more like to continue in Africa and Barbarie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the climate,<note place="margin">Cold climates haue aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Gold.</note> albeit that Hungarie in Pannonia lyeth vnder fiftie and three degrees, and is a colder climate than ours, and neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse hath yeelded aboundance of Gold since the yeare 1527, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the yere 1568, as by a certaine record appeareth, which was kept thereof. The King of Spaine was wont to haue from Castle de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na (vpon the coast of Africa) aboue eightie thousand pounds worth euerie yeare, which is now almost decreased to the one halfe: and all along that coast, the Hollanders and the French Merchants com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:14410:138"/>
of the small quantitie now extant, or there to be found, to make returne of their commodities (Hides and Waxe not being so plentifull as in times past.) Turkie is hindered also to haue such quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Gold as in times past came out of Persia vnto them.</p>
               <p>Of the Gold of Ophir,<note place="margin">Gold of Ophir</note> we heare but a discourse of old obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That <hi>Salomon</hi> had the Gold from that place to beautifie the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ierusalem, and his pallace. This is held to be the Island of Sumatra or Taprobana, being the greatest of all the Orientall Islands,<note place="margin">The scituation of Sumatra.</note> and is diuided from the firme land of Malacca by a strait and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous sea, by reason of many Islands and Cliffes that are within it. It lyeth vnder nine degrees on the South-side of the Line, which no doubt is verie rich of Mines of Gold, Siluer, and Copper. The Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers did touch there in their first voyage they made for the East-Indies, where the Inhabitants make excellent Brasse Peeces, and are opulent in all things. But I neuer haue yet heard of any Gold brought from thence, neither from the Island of Iaua Maior, which lyeth right ouer the Island of Sumatra, on the South-side of the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall Line, which may be, hereafter shal appeare; for out of all doubt, mens treasures are hourded vp in Gold in many places. It is recorded that <hi>Dauid</hi> left in Gold (besides Siluer) 180 millions sterling, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the calculation: But <hi>Salomon</hi> left behind him but one tenth part of that, namely eighteene millions.</p>
               <p>Siluer is alwaies found more aboundantly,<note place="margin">Siluer Mines.</note> because of the number of Siluer Mines found in diuers countries, and for that all Leade Mines containe some Siluer, especially the poore Lead Mines, the Ore whereof yeeldeth but small quantitie of Lead, either 25 or 30 <abbr>ll</abbr> weight in one hundreth of Ore; and that Siluer containeth likewise some Gold, found sometimes to be three or foure ounces in one hundreth pound weight, besides the Copper in the Siluer Ore.</p>
               <p>The Siluer Mines of Hungarie and Bohemia, as also Sweaden, are drawne out, but do continue in Germanie (in many places) which haue properly the Siluer Ore of the Celestiall colour with fine grains glistring like little staires. In Saxonie the Mines are richer: so are the Mines of the Seuerstall Mountaines,<note place="margin">Seuerstall Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Mines.</note> which haue continually yeelded six or eight thousand pound weight a yere, but are wrought vpon at leasure.</p>
               <p>The Mines in the West-Indies are the principall in quantitie of poore Ore, where manie hands make light worke. For the King of Spaine doth diuide his grounds by proportion to his subiects to worke for him, allowing them money and Quicke-siluer to seperate the siluer from the drossie substance, and they must pay him againe in Siluer after a certaine rate; and were it not for the quantitie of Ore, the Siluer would be verie little. For I am assured by the informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one <hi>Don Rodrigo de Cordua</hi> of the house of Toledo, a knight who had liued in the West-Indies many yeares, and attended the great Mine of Potosie,<note place="margin">Potosie Mine of Siluer in the West-Indies.</note> That the Ore thereof containeth not aboue 1 ½ ounce of Siluer in a hundreth: the like was affirmed by a Portugall
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14410:139"/>
called <hi>Antonio Diaz,</hi> who had dwelt thirtie and two yeares in the said West-Indies. I was interpreter betweene our soueraigne Lord <hi>Iames,</hi> and the said <hi>Antonio,</hi> when he made the triall of the Siluer Ore of Scotland in the Tower of London with Quick-siluer before the King, and did informe his Maiestie hereof; as also that the best Siluer Mine that euer was wrought vpon in the West-Indies, did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aboue eight ounces in one hundreth weight. The Mines in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie are farre richer:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Charles</hi> Mine in Misnia.</note> some containe thirtie and fortie ounces, that is to say, by the mixt mettall Ore, taking of it disquisitiuely, or here and there: for the blossome of Siluer appearing in some braunches is fine or better than sterling, which therfore doth not proportionate the goodnesse of the Mine; whereof more hereafter. Now leauing the Mines of the Earle of Mansfield, and others that are in Tiroll and other places of Germanie, we must not forget to giue the due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation vnto the noble Duke of Brownswicke, that to his losse did maintaine the Siluer Mine of the Wild-man,<note place="margin">Mines in the Duke of Browneswikes countrie.</note> or Sauage, in his countrie, onely to set the people on worke, being indeed but a Mine of course Lead, whereof he had great store, heretofore, six hundreth weight of Ore making but one hundreth of Lead, and that hundreth of Lead hath but 1 ½ ounce of Siluer, whereof his Dollers are made; expressing the same by the Inscription (which may verie well be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by many, for their Posie) <hi>Alijs inseruiendo consumor,</hi> As the candle doth, which by consumption of it selfe, doth giue light vnto others. The stampe of those Dollers is a sauage man, holding a burning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in one hand, and the trunke of a tree in the other hand, and the Emperors Armes on the other side.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Siluer Mines of Great Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note>I cannot therefore without griefe discourse of the Siluer Mines of this Monarchie of Great Brittaine, and heartily lament to see them lie dead and buried in obliuion, because I haue heretofore sought to aduance the working of them: for it is now about foureteene yeares since I caused diuers workemen to come out of Saxonie, Brownswike and other places in Germanie at my great charges, to the number of seuenteene persons, some for the Siluer Mines in the Bishopricke of Duresme,<note place="margin">Richmond<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shire</note> others for the Lead Mines in Richmondshire in the county of Yorke, some for the Allome workes there also, and some for the making of Steele in Wales, wherein the noble Lord <hi>Eure</hi> deceased, and certaine London Merchants had vndertaken to proceed with me. The action being applauded by a great personage then in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and now deceased, who promised all the fauour that he could do: but he had some other priuat designs herein, as he had also in the Siluer Ore of Scotland, whereof we are now to intreate: in so much, that the actions of these two Lords were like vnto <hi>Phaetons</hi> horses, for all was set into a combustion, and the poore men went begging homewards, to our exceeding great losse of the benefits in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, our Mines being richer than those of the West-Indies, wherof I haue made (and caused to be made) many trialls, of aboue twentie seuerall sorts of Siluer Ores. The two Mines of Muggleswike and
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14410:139"/>
Wardall at Duresme containe sixe and eight ounces of siluer in the hundreth, which being fallen in,<note place="margin">Siluer Mines at Duresme.</note> may with a reasonable charge bee brought in working, according to the information which I tooke of the inhabitants there, at which time I did intend to goe further into Lancashire to Slaithborne Mine,<note place="margin">Slaithborne Mine in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cashire.</note> holding aboue foure ounces of sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the hundreth: but being in the Winter time, and the weather very foule I was diuerted, not without discontent, because it is the countrey where my ancestors and parents were borne.</p>
               <p>The Siluer Mine at Combmartin in Cornewall,<note place="margin">Combmartin in Cornewall.</note> holdeth tenne ounces in the hundreth, where Sir <hi>Beuis Bulmer</hi> did worke for a time, which is deepe and ouerflowne with water; but there are diuers branches of that Mine running many miles off spread into the earth, and within these two years some Ore was sent me from Barnestaple of a branch of that Mine,<note place="margin">Mines of siluer by Barnestaple</note> lying within one foot and a halfe of the superficies, which vpon diuers trialls of one pound weight at once, holdeth by computation aboue ten ounces of Siluer, but little Lead; for euery pound did produce aboue two penny weight in Siluer, and is not difficult in the melting. The partie in whose ground it is found will not haue it touched nor medled with, fearing his grounds shall be spoiled, and the Mine taken from him, which is knowen aboue halfe a mile of one foot broad. Howsoeuer I thought good to remember this for our posteritie, for there may come a time that industrious men shall be more regarded.</p>
               <p>It were also iniurious,<note place="margin">Siluer Mines of Scotland.</note> if I should not remember the Siluer Mines of Scotland, especially that Mine which lyeth in the grounds of Sir <hi>Thomas Hamilton</hi> Knight, Lord Aduocate of Scotland, within eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene miles of Edenborough towards the sea side, discouered in the yeare 1607, by meanes of a Collier, as I am informed. In the report of the goodnesse of this Mine hath beene very great diuersitie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they found the Ore of seuerall veynes, as wee haue noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for the blossome of Siluer Ore,<note place="margin">A singular good obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> or the small veynes cannot giue true direction of the richnesse of the Mine, which is the cause that the Spaniards in the West-Indies, hauing found any veyne of a Mine, they will pursue the same towards the East and seeke to find out (as it were) the Trunke or Body of the Tree, which they call <hi>Beta,</hi> saying <hi>Es menester siempre buscar la Beta de la mina,</hi> Wee must alwayes seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the bodie of the Mine; which may bee sometimes three or foure foot broad, when the veynes are like an arme or finger: and according to the triall made thereof they giue their iudgement, not by the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of the subtile assay, but by some good quantitie, and increasing their said trialls by some additements fit for the nature of the met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Ore, as they iudge the same to be. For all diseases cannot be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with one remedie in all persons, although the disease be alike; so may it bee said of those that make trialls of the Ores of mettalls, for some trialls did report 80 pound of Siluer in one hundreth weight, others 60 <abbr>ll</abbr>, 40 <abbr>ll</abbr>, 35 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and 20 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and then it fell into ounces, which was more reasonable and naturall, as I informed then some Priuie
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:14410:140"/>
Councellor,<note place="margin">Triall of one tun of Ore by Sir <hi>Beuis Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
                  </note> and the said Sir <hi>Beuis Bulmer,</hi> whereupon it pleased his Maiestie, and the Lords of the Right honourable Priuie Councell, to appoint tenne Tunnes of the said Siluer Ore to bee brought into the Tower of London, whereof one Tunne of twentie hundreth weight was indifferently taken and calcined or grinded together, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto were two Tuns of Lead added and commixed, and afterwardes molten by a continuall fire and hand-blast of foure men, according as I haue noted in writing. And there was a cake of siluer remaining weighing 17 ½ ounces, and the extraction out of the Lead was some foure or fiue ounces more; so that it was reported to bee 22 ounces in the hundreth weight of Ore, but the charge was great.</p>
               <p>There was also another triall made by <hi>William Beale,</hi> with a farre lesser quantitie of Lead, and roasting the Ore; and by Master <hi>Broad</hi> and others, as Master <hi>Russell,</hi> who refined the same with the flag of Lead; others by Lead Ore to saue charges, and they all found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 22 ounces of siluer in the hundreth weight of Ore. And so did Sir <hi>Richard Martin</hi> Knight, Master worker of his Maiesties Mint, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceased, who deliuered vnto mee at times 20 pound weight of the said Ore, grinded, shaddered and washed, which I did send be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the seas vnto an expert Mint-master, and withall a particular of the manner of trialls which euery man had made here; as also of the triall made by the Portugall with Quickesiluer, who found 23 or 24 ounces; his answere was, That vpon his first triall hee found 42 oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; of the other lesse, and that the ore was easie to be wrought (but not by the meanes that all those men had vsed) and with lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>le char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and that the manner to refine with Quickesiluer, was good for poore Mines of two or three ounces, where the Ore had little or no Lead;<note place="margin">Colour of the Ore of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> and that the commixture of the Mine was very brittle, and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettall, and so did all the other Refiners affirme. For the said Ore doth looke betweene white and blew for the most part, and is like the Bell mettall found in good quantitie about Bristoll, which is vsed to make some kind of Alkemie beyond the seas, and this must bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laied to qualifie the brittlenesse with some minerall, of all which I haue made a record in my Booke of Collections.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Siluer Ore.</note>In the moneth of August 1608, there came two ships before the Tower of London from Scotland, laden with some 400 barrels of this siluer Ore, in weight some hundreth tuns lading, which were there landed &amp; deliuered vnto the Lord <hi>Knyuet,</hi> Warden of the Kings Mint, whereof 20 tunnes was taken promiscuously and grinded, and afterwards also distributed vnto diuers Refiners and others, and the triall of master <hi>Broad</hi> was best, who found 28 ounces in the hundreth of Ore. Of this quantitie Sir <hi>Richard Martin</hi> had three tuns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of some was sent to my friend beyond the seas: <hi>Interim,</hi> these trialls and conclusions so differing brought the said Ore (together with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceedings) into some disgrace, whereupon (according vnto commission giuen mee) I made an offer to buy the 80 tunnes remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Tower, to a great personage, to giue it for 24 pound the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14410:140"/>
tun, to be transported to my friend into Holland paying readie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: time was taken to giue me an answere, and then difficultie was made, for that treasure was not to be exported, vnlesse by returning the quantitie of siluer by weight; heereupon conclusion was made to bring in so much Bullion of siluer or royalls of plate. But when all came to all, with running vp and downe, and further offering to deale for greater quantities, and to take it in Scotland I was put off with this consideration, That it was a dishonour to England, not to haue men of as good experience as any were beyond the seas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Kings losse was 2000 <abbr>ll</abbr>; for his Highnesse gaue the same afterwards vnto <hi>Iames Achinson</hi> his Grauer of the Mint heereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who brought the same to nothing, being vnskilfull of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of it. And thus are good matters marred in the handling,<note place="margin">Good matters marr'd in the handling.</note> and workes brought at a stay or hindered, as I haue before set downe. There are many rich Mines in Scotland, if wee compare them to the West-India Mines; and in Wales,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Plus Pencer que dire.</hi>
                  </note> where the Lead Mines are poore, they containe the more siluer of 1 ½, two and three oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the hundreth of the Ore, which will not yeeld aboue 40 or 44 <abbr>ll</abbr> weight of Lead, and the Ore of the Mine which holdeth three ounces, containeth but 25 pound of Lead. The Mines most knowne are those in Cardiganshire in Wales, where master <hi>Hugh Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> of London Gold-smith, hath bestowed very great charges, as he did in bringing the water-workes to the Citie of London; so he bringeth now siluer to the Tower to bee minted: the Ore being foure ounces in the hundreth, or 80 ounces in the tun, and the lesse in Lead; for the richer the Ore is in Lead, the poorer it is in siluer. So one hundreth of the best Ore of Lead will make neere 70 <abbr>ll</abbr> of Lead, and holdeth but 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ounce of siluer, not worth the charges of refining, as we shall declare.</p>
               <p>The Lead Mines in Ireland, doe containe more siluer than these Mines of Darbieshire, and Somersetshire, called Peake and Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disse Lead.</p>
               <p>The Saxons, which were procured to come into England, had no more, no not so much experience as our refiners of London, for by sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Lead, they found lesser quantitie of siluer, and so all was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ouer.</p>
               <p>The third sort of Mines Royall, are the Copper Mines,<note place="margin">Copper Mines</note> which are found also in diuers Countreys, which are not so plentifull in Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garie (where the best is) as in times past; but are very aboundant in Sweaden, howbeit that it is very meane and inferiour in goodnesse. There are also Copper Mines in Germany, and the Duke of Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swickes countrey: as also certaine naturall Copperas waters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they cast from time to time great quantitie of old Yron, which within sixe weekes or two moneths doth transmute into Copper.<note place="margin">Naturall wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Coppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</note> England hath diuers Copper Mines: at Keaswike neere Scotland are made some fortie tunnes yearely by certaine Germanes there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting, it containeth some Gold. Some Mines of Copper Ore
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14410:141"/>
are found in Yorkeshire: and albeit the charge of making one tunne of Copper be commonly 30 <abbr>ll</abbr>, yet if seuen tunne of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Ore make one tunne of Copper, it may yeeld good benefit; for whereas 22 fires haue beene vsed, it is brought to 12. I haue seene excellent Copper Ore of some Mines in Staffordshire in the hands of master <hi>Stonewell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Staffordshire Copper Mines</note> which absolutely is the best Ore that euer was found in England, hee doth assure mee of great store of Ore. It is lamentable that such workes should lye dead for want of vndertakers, which indeed are discouraged by the great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: In mine opinion the charge of a tunne of Copper of this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ore will be made for 15 <abbr>ll</abbr>. There are also good Copper Mines in the West parts of England, where I haue seene good Ore in diuers places, which must be roasted to destroy the Antimonie, Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke, and other corruptions which are in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The working of copper Ore, by Allome and Copperas wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note>A certaine Nobleman now deceased, was imbarked in those West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne Mines, which were promised to be wrought by imbibition of Allome and Copperas water, and the Ore after digestion with raine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, would make of six tuns one of Copper: hereupon (for 300 <abbr>ll</abbr> by him disbursed) he was offered 1800 <abbr>ll</abbr>. It pleased his Lordship to take my aduice, and to conclude the bargain; for when I did calculate the charge of grinding and roasting of the ore, the making of the great quantitie of Allome water and Copperas, the consumption of yron plates decreasing in weight, with all the tubs and vtensills, the long time of imbibition, and consequently workemens wages, I found the charge to exceed, and that the course of ordinary melting was to be preferred: and so experience hath since proued the same, to the great losse of the vndertakers. For when workes are clogged with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensiue charges in the beginning, it choketh the benefit euer after, as we shall presently declare. Seeing that profit is the radicall moisture of such and the like actions, his Maiestie hath beene graciously plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to incorporate a Companie of worthy persons,<note place="margin">The Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

But there is none of that Companie that doth aduance any works, that I can learne.

               <p>Scotland and Ireland haue many Leade Mines, containing also Siluer.</p>
               <p>The Leade Mines of England are scituated in diuers places of the kingdome, but most in Darbishire in the hills of Peake, Somer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setshire, and Wales.</p>
               <p>There is great difference in the Ore, as hath beene noted. There are also many Lead Mines in Richmondshire vnder the countie of Yorke, where I went to view them, <hi>anno</hi> 1606, about Arkendale, and the new Forest, hauing prepared a long Yron boare of eighteene foot
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:14410:142"/>
long for that purpose,<note place="margin">Description of many Leade Mines in York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</note> and there I did obserue within the compasse of ten miles, that the scituation of Arkendale i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> betwixt two hills, the one lying North called Windike, and the other South-West cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Moldersey, adioyning vnto another hill called Pouncy, lying West from Moldersey, all belonging vnto the King, and by lease vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sir <hi>Iohn Maillorie</hi> knight.</p>
               <p>There are also adioyning vnto it certaine other hills where lead Mines are, as Swailedale, where my lord <hi>Wharton</hi> hath his workes, also Readhurst, Cocka, and Fellind being East from Wyndecke. The Mines of Arkendale haue neuer been wrought to any purpose. There is but three smelting cottages which do feed vpon the poore people and inhabitants thereabouts, which at their leasure seeke for Lead Ore vpon sufferance, and bring the same to the melting places, where they fell the same for 20 or 24 <hi>ss</hi> the load, giuing to the owners three or foure parts in ten, as they can agree, and one tenth to the Parson or Vicar of the Parish or Chappell.</p>
               <p>A loade of Ore with them is as much as foure or fiue horses can conueniently carrie, which by computation is some ten hundreth weight, and is also deliuered by a measure called Load; foure of these Loads will make a Fother of Lead of twentie hundreth, their weight being 120 <abbr>ll</abbr> to the hundreth London weight; so one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth of Lead Ore maketh but 30 <abbr>ll</abbr> of Lead: which commeth to passe for that their manner of melting is by foot-blast and small fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces with wood and charcoale,<note place="margin">Foolish maner of melting.</note> casting the Ore of Lead betweene them in small peeces, and so still augmenting their melting, which can yeeld but little, the heat of the fire being choaked with the fewel and drosse of the Lead; whereas flame is the greatest meane of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of all mettaline Ores, which require furnaces to be made accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, where thirtie six or fortie hundreth may be molten together, they melting three or foure hundreth.</p>
               <p>There is no wood to be had, but within two miles, but sea coale and good peate is neere hand, which may serue better cheape; for they reckon 7 or 8 <hi>ss</hi> for the charge of a fother for the melting. The Lead being cast into small Piggs of somewhat more than one hundreth weight, are brought on horse-backe through Richmond to Burroughbridge, being about thirtie miles distant, and are conuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by water to Yorke for 2 <hi>ss</hi> the hundreth, and from Yorke to Hull for other two shillings; so that a Fother of Lead with all charges will not stand in three pounds: and there is a neerer way by Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton on the sea-side (about twentie and fiue miles) which will lessen the said charges.</p>
               <p>Now we are come to Yron mines,<note place="margin">Yron Mines.</note> whereof almost all countries in Europe are prouided, which do much differ in goodnesse, yet may be vsed according to the seuerall workes whereunto it is imployed; as the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>England hath great store of Yron Mines, for by computation there are aboue eight hundreth furnaces. The melting of it by flaming sea
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:14410:143"/>
coale or Scots coale, saueth a great deale of charges. There are late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found more Yron Mines in Fraunce, which Yron being made into bars, is transported into Guinea, Binea, and other parts vpon the coasts of Africa, where it hath continually beene in great estimation, and now becommeth so aboundant, that their profit is but small of those voyages; and so it falleth out at this present for the price of Leade.</p>
               <p>The Yron stone in Wales is found to differ from the Steele stone, by meanes whereof a Germane made good Steele in barres,<note place="margin">Steele stone.</note> and also Gad Steele. But the patent of sir <hi>Baesell Brooke</hi> for the making of Steele did hinder the proceedings therein: and Germane Steele is best, vntill of late that a Frenchman (shewing the imperfection of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Steele) caused his maiestie to make void the said patent, and to grant another for the making of perfect Steele, surpassing in goodnes the Steele of all countries.</p>
               <p>So we find, that our Yron is best for the casting of Ordnance, and that the Sweaden cast Yron Peeces are brittle, and commonly one in seuen will not abide the triall; and of late the broken peeces of ours are made seruiceable for Yron in bars to be cast againe.</p>

               <p>Afterwards about the yeare 1604, one master <hi>Atherton</hi> beganne to practise the making of Allomes in Yorkeshire, about Gisborough, with whom one master <hi>Bourchier,</hi> now Sir <hi>Iohn Bourchier</hi> Knight, did ioyne to bring it to some perfection (in hope whereof, and at the sute of the said Sir <hi>Iohn</hi>) the King in the fourth yeare of his raigne, granted certaine conditionall Letters Patents, to the Lord <hi>Sheffield</hi> President of the North, Sir <hi>Thomas Challoner,</hi> Sir <hi>Dauid Fowles</hi> Knights, and the said master <hi>Bourchier,</hi> for twentie one yeares, for the sole making of Allomes in Yorkeshire onely, where (in building of seuen houses and the vtensills for working and charges,<note place="margin">Aboue Black<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Hillip</hi> the second, late King of Spaine, perceiuing that many blind Bayards were ouerbold to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the working of his Mines of Siluer in the West-Indies: and yet considering on the one side, that without authoritie and priuiledge they could not bee incouraged thereunto; and on the other side (hauing obtained the same for certaine allotted grounds vnto them) they did hinder other men, and themselues proceeded not; did very adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly make all his Letters Patents (as wee call them) conditionall with a Prouiso,<note place="margin">A good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiso in Lettets Patents for Mines.</note> That if the Patentees did not proceed in the workes, or discontinue the worke for two yeares, the Patent was void of course, and vpon Certificate made of it, the King made new Grants vnto others. If our King were pleased to doe so, many Grants or Leases made by the Companie of the Mines Royall would be made void, and other men would be incouraged to trie their fortunes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>
               <p>The next consideration concerning Mines, Mettaline and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall is, That the workes in the beginning be not choaked or suffocated with extreame charges and expences, which doth discourage the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker and all others, whereby the works are giuen ouer, or meanes are deuised to charge Princes Coffers with them. For it is true, That things doe prosper best when they are vnderpropped by authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it selfe; which to doe in the beginning were more profitable, than when the charges and expences haue ouerburthened them. For preuention whereof, I made a contract for the Lead Mines in the North parts, which being imitated shall cut off all such charges as commonly the parties doe runne into in the working of Mines, vpon the conceited benefit which draweth more violently than the Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant stone. For as the Portugall <hi>Antonio Diaz</hi> told the King, <hi>Todos los mineros son Ricos, porque quando no lo tienen en sustansia, tienen lo enel animo:</hi> All Miners are rich, for when they haue it not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, they haue it in the Mind. The obseruation alreadie noted, concerning the running waters about Mines, must not be forgotten.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:14410:144"/>
The Contract before mentioned was in this manner:<note place="margin">A profitable Contract.</note> The Mine to bee wrought, and the Ore to be diuided into fiue parts: The owner of the ground or the lessee, to haue one part of the Ore shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and washed readie to be molten, and hee to redeliuer the same in the nature and qualitie aforesaid, and to be paied for it euery 3 mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, paying for euery load twentie shillings. The workemen in like manner to haue another fifth part, and to bee paied accordingly euery weeke.

               <p>Such is the qualitie of fine Gold (by reason of the equall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the foure Elements therein,<note place="margin">The qualities of Gold.</note> that none is predominant ouer the other) that the fire doth not consume it, being also hot and drie of nature, neither is it subiect to any other Element, for there is no rust or scurfe that doth diminish the goodnesse, or wasteth the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; it doth abide the fretting and liquors of salt and vinegre with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out damage, which weareth any other thing; it needs no fire to be made Gold, as other mettals do, for it is gold as soone as it is found; it draweth without wooll, as it were wooll; it is easily spread in leaues of maruellous thinnesse; you may adorne or guild any other mettall with it; it is not inferiour for making of any vessells; in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it resembleth the Celestiall bodies; it defileth not the thing it toucheth, as Siluer and other mettals; it is not stinking in smell; the spirit of it can by art be extracted, and the bodie (being as red earth) can neuer be moulten without the spirit be againe added thereunto,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween naturall and artificiall Gold.</note> as it were infusing life: and lastly, it is medicinable and maketh glad the heart of man, which artificiall Gold doth not, neither is it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosiue as this Gold is, so that a scratch of it will hardly be healed.</p>
               <p>But for our purpose of moneys (being soft, and onely hardened by the ayre, deafe in sound, and ponderous in weight) it requireth to make Crowne Gold fit for moneys and workes to haue some allay of Siluer and Copper mixt, which is 1/12 part: howbeit, that moneys are also made of fine gold, wherein (for obseruation sake) we ascribe halfe a graine of allay in twentie and foure Carrats. It hath also by reason of his hot and drie qualitie a propertie, That filling a cup with wine to the brim, yet you may put ten or fifteene peeces of Gold coyned into it by little and little, without spilling, as it were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and clasping the liquid qualitie of the wine.</p>
               <p>It is held for certaine, that the Salamanders wooll,<note place="margin">Soda bariglia, or Massacote.</note> and <hi>Alumen Plumosum</hi> are not subiect to fire, yet are they subiect to corruption.</p>
               <p>The stuffe called Soda Bariglia, or Massacote whereof Glasses are made (which stuffe is burnt of certain sea weeds, as we know &amp; daily may see in the Glasse-houses) is not subiect to fire, but altogether to the ayre: But Gold is permanent. Here now ariseth a question, How it was possible that <hi>Archimedes</hi> Geometricall triall (so much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Antiquitie) can be sure, seeing Gold hath that attractiue power to retaine so manie peeces of it in a cup of wine?

               <p>But to resolue the question, we must note the diuersitie of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which were meere contraries; for the one had an intention to spill, and the other to keepe it from spilling, whereas also between the operation of wine and water there may be a difference in this triall.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning the nature and qualitie of fine Gold, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Lead commeth neerest for ponderositie of weight, bignesse of volume, and deafenesse of sound, as fittest for protection.</p>
               <p>The nature and qualitie of Siluer is like vnto the Moone,<note place="margin">The qualitie of Siluer.</note> that is, cold and moist; the Sulphure of it white and corrupt, and falling away, as you may see by drawing lines vpon a paper.

The first moneys,<note place="margin">Sicle is halfe an ounce of Siluer.</note> or the Sicles of the Hebrewes was pure siluer weighing halfe an ounce, which was deliuered by weight, and cannot properly be called money, for there was no print vpon it: and being allayed with Copper it hath a smel,<note place="margin">The qualitie of Copper.</note> for the Sulphure and Antimonie of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (being red and corrupt) hath a strong smell, which may (by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it) be sooner discerned by rubbing: and howsoeuer there are many blanchers for Copper, the best of them all in time will appeare in his colour, being not throughly fixed. The nature of Copper is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:14410:146"/>
also cold and moist, and being commixed and augmented with the Calamine stone and lead maketh the yellow brasse,<note place="margin">Yellow Brasse.</note> and increaseth the volume from eleuen to fifteene, whereas (as wee haue said before) betweene Siluer and Copper, it is but eleuen to thirteene, which causeth the counterfeiters to be encouraged, notwithstanding the smell and rednes of the colour:<note place="margin">Allay of Gold.</note> therefore in the allay of crowne Gold, the Mint-masters in Fraunce and England, do take halfe Siluer, and halfe Copper, which maketh the higher colour of Gold. But in the Low-countries and Germany they take three parts Siluer and one part Copper, which maketh the difference betweene the colour of their crowne and ours, and is the reason that our Gold will sooner weare away than theirs.</p>
               <p>We haue alreadie declared the true deriuation of moneys, called by the Romanes <hi>Pecunia,</hi> of <hi>Pecus pecudis,</hi> not <hi>Pecus pecoris</hi>; for they coyning first Copper moneys (and as it should seeme, the wealth of man consisting most in cattell, as in the time of <hi>Iob</hi>) caused Oxen, Sheepe, and the like cattell to bee stamped vpon their coynes of meere Copper, whereof their Exchequer was called <hi>Aerarium,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Proportion which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Siluer and Copper.</note> being then in greater estimation: for the proportion or value in the time of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> was ten of Copper to one of Siluer, and ten of Siluer to one of Gold, which now by the aboundance of Copper is much altered, notwithstanding the Copper moneys vsed in all countries in some reasonable measure. But in Spaine, being (as it were vnto vs) the fountaine of Siluer and Gold, there it is vsed immoderately:<note place="margin">Copper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of Spaine and Portugall.</note> for they haue so many millions of Copper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in foure and eight Maluedies and otherwise, and in Portugall of Vintenis, Patacois of so many Reas, that the halfe Ryall (which is our three pence) is onely of Siluer, and all moneys vnder it are meere Copper, without any mixture of Siluer. This quantitie is almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, for it is not many yeres since during the Kings raign of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the third, that certaine Italians (finding fault that his Octauos and Quartillos were too big) gaue the King sixe millions of Ducats to coyne them at halfe the weight, within a time limited, and as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as they could vtter within that time; <hi>Necessitas non habet legem,</hi> is true in some respects.</p>
               <p>The Venetians also coyne meere Copper moneys,<note place="margin">Copper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of the Venetians.</note> they haue Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sini which are valued at two Quatrini, and three Quatrini are one halfe pennie sterling; for six Quatrini are one pennie. Bagatini they haue also, whereof foure make one Quatrini, and twentie and foure Bagatini make one pennie sterling by calculation.</p>
               <p>In France they haue Mailles, petit Deniers, Deniers, Doubles,<note place="margin">Of Fraunce.</note> and Liarts, &amp; in times past, most of these had some Siluer in them: but vpon due consideration (that it was so much Siluer wasted, because the charges of refining did surmount the value, and that these moneys did serue for the commutation of pettie things and trifles) they haue saued that Siluer.<note place="margin">Of Germanie.</note> The like they haue done of all the small moneys in Germanie: but they cause them to be Alkimed like Siluer, which is

And he reported our Siluer to be eleuen ounces and foure pennie weight fine by the true proportion of the pound weight, which is to be taken accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the whole ingot, weighing some fortie pound weight; so that euerie pound of it did containe eleuen ounces foure pennie weight of fine Siluer, and sixteene pennie weight of Copper, making together twelue ounces for the pound, Troy weight: and so is finesse knowne by weight, and is properly fine Siluer as aforesaid.

These graines are also diuided in twentie foure Garobes or Primes, and the Primes in twentie foure Seconds, and the Seconds in 24 Tercies or Malloquen, which is superfluous; notwithstanding all the said weights and diuisions (to make assayes) they vse another weight,<note place="margin">Assay weight.</note> which euery man maketh ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his fancie: but most commonly they will diuide the marke in twelue deniers or pence, and the penny into twentie foure graines, and then graines subdiuided of paper, making ⅛ 1/10 and 1/32 part of a graine, which concurreth neerest with our assay weight; for if one pound of siluer doe containe 1/12 part copper, they call this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen deniers fine, as we say eleuen ounces fine.</p>
               <p>For the gold likewise they doe vse the same weight, accounting for euery denier or penny weight two carrats; so twentie foure car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats for twelue deniers or ounces, and consequently eleuen deniers is twentie two carrats, &amp;c. So the gold marke is twentie foure carrats,<note place="margin">Gold marke.

               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:14410:152"/>They vse also a manner of speech to say, Twelue shillings to the marke pound,<note place="margin">Marke pound.</note> euerie shilling twelue pence, and euery penny twentie foure graines, is 3456 graines in the marke; all which is done to make the knowledge of these things intricate. In like manner for the sheiring of their moneys,<note place="margin">Sheire monies</note> they will for euery peece make a penny, as if there be made seuentie eight peeces out of a marke, they will say it ☞holdeth sixe shillings and sixe pence in the sheire, or for 62 peeces fiue shillings two pence, and so obscure things to take aduantage vpon others. For the Mint-masters of the Low Countreys and Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, are verie experienced in Mint matters, and the assayes being made vpon the graines, may deceiue much if (by triall) the calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be not rightly made; and if the said Mint-masters were not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, yet the Generalls, which follow the Prince or State, doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but studie these things alwaies: therefore let vs obserue more particulars of their proceedings as followeth.</p>
               <p>In the making of coynes of gold and siluer, they will vse many times to make peeces of fine gold and courser gold; as the Emperiall Royall and the halfe Royall, the one twentie three carrats 3 ½ grains, and the other but eighteene carrats, or the Flanders Crowne of 22 carrats. In Germanie the ducat and the gold guildren, which for workes being mixed are seruiceable, admitting by conniuence the melting of the moneys, rather than for want of it Bullion should not be brought to their Mints, therefore they also take little for the coynage, because it should sooner come vnto them than vnto other Minters, where the coynage or seignoriage is great: and albeit the same bee but small, yet will they find meanes to make other Princes to pay the same,<note place="margin">Moneys made for transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and cause moneys to be made for transportation, especially for the East countreys to buy corne to bring the same vnto their Magazins, whereby trade is increased, and Spaine and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall supplieth the same, by suffering moneys to bee also transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the returne of corne, whereby Customes doe also augment. The Box for moneys is kept vnder three seuerall keyes or lockes, by the Warden, Mint-master, and Comptroller; wherein the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den taketh of euery Iourney of worke, one, two, or more peeces, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his instruction, to make the last triall by before the Lords or Estates. The Mint-masters haue some remedies allowed them for the making of moneys, either for being too feeble and vnder the Standard,<note place="margin">Remedies for Mint-masters.</note> or for being better and aboue Standard. And heereupon they alwayes worke by commixing it accordingly, whereof they haue an absolute power, wherewith neither the Warden nor the Comptroller are to meddle: for Princes and States will not be vpon vncertaineties with the Mint-master, for he must beare all casualties vpon their remedies; with certaine cautions, That if it be aboue the said remedies, and feebler one halfe penny weight, he payeth double; and for the double of that, quadruple; and if it be aboue that, hee is subiect ouer and aboue to punishment.</p>
               <p>When the triall of the Box is made, if there be quantitie of coyne
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:14410:152"/>
to auoid the multiplicitie of assayes, motion is made to the Master, whether by one marke indifferently taken of euerie <hi>species</hi> of coyne, hee will be concluded for the whole quantitie of the worke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto condiscending, the markes are weighed out accordingly, and the peeces are told, and the assay is thereupon made,<note place="margin">Priuie marke of moneys.</note> and the totall worke is reported to be accordingly. The like is done in England, obseruing the works by the priuie marke of the Rose, Mallet, Crosse or any other, which is recorded in the Exchequer vpon the said trials of the pixes.</p>
               <p>The Assay-masters receiuing Bullion of ten or eleuen ounces fine, make their assayes with fiue parts of Lead, if it be of sixe or seuen ounces they will take eight parts of Lead, if three or foure ounces,<note place="margin">Lead for the triall of Siluer Assayes.</note> then fifteene parts of Lead, and if vnder they will take twentie parts of Lead: But this Lead is first to be purged, because all Lead holdeth some little Siluer and Gold as hath been noted.

               <p>In the melting of Gold,<note place="margin">Obseruations for melting of Gold.</note> obserue to melt the same first before you put your Siluer allay vnto it, and let the finest Gold lye vpwards in the crusible or pot, to haue lesse wast and better mixing, for the finest Gold is heauiest and seeketh the center; let no wind come to your melting pot or crusible for feare of breaking, and take fine Siluer for your allay, wherein there is neither Lead, nor Brasse, or Laten, which maketh your Gold brittle and bringeth a losse to make the same malliable, albeit to make it tough is no charge. For take but an old shoo, and cut the same into small peeces, and put the same into your crusible, and stop it vp with a couer, let it stand vpon the fire, &amp; it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the eagrenesse of Brasse: Euen as a hot browne loafe of bread cut asunder and clapt ouer the bom-hole of a hogshead of wine (tasting of the caske) will cure the same of his fowle taste.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the weight and finesse of Moneys, and their seuerall Standards.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now twentie yeares compleate since <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Knyuet,</hi> sir <hi>Richard Martin,</hi> and diuers other Knights and Aldermen of the citie of London, and master <hi>Iohn Williams</hi> his maiesties Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smith, and my selfe were in Commission, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of the Mint affaires of the Tower of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and of the causes of the transportation of the moneyes of the realme, and of conuenient remedies to preuent the same. The causes were obserued to besix, whereof the Weight was the first; next the Finesse of our standard; then the Valuation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, and therein the proportion betweene Gold and Siluer; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the abuse of Exchange for moneys by bills, wherein all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer were included: for we all did set downe, that the difference of Weight, Finesse, Valuation, and Disproportion aforesaid,<note place="margin">According to our certificate.</note> were not of themselues true causes of Exportation, if there were betwixt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and countrie a due course holden in the exchange of money; but that due course not being obserued, then they might accidentally becauses. And this course was the cause of the ouerballancing of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine commodities, increased by the immoderate vse of them, and neglect to set the people on worke; so that the remedie was wholly found to consist in reforming the abuse of Exchange, whereof I haue handled at large in the third part of this booke for Exchanges.</p>
               <p>Hereupon conferring the pound weight Troy of 12 ounces with the marke weight of eight ounces, admitting one marke and a halfe for the said pound, we found, with France full three pennie weight, ours to be heauier, and the Low-countries and Germanie 2 ½ pennie weight or thereabouts, with Scotland foure pennie weight and nine graines, and alwaies heauier than any other.</p>
               <p>This agreeth with an instruction declared in an old Booke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mint matters in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3, where it is demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, What benefit it would be to the King and realme,<note place="margin">Ouer heauines of the weight Troy.</note> if the Troy weight of this realme, and the Troy weight of Fraunce, Flaunders, Spaine, and Almayne, and of other realmes and countries were of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:14410:154"/>
equall weight and size? For as much as other countries keep one size and weight, whereas the Troy weight of England is heauier in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie eight ounces by halfe a quarter of an ounce. It is answered, that the Merchant that brings in bullion doth loose so much, and the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation is made what it was for euerie hundreth weight both for gold and siluer, and it followeth there. Wherefore this is one great cause that so little bullion comes into the realme, and therefore may it please the King to deuise some weight that should be correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the weight of other realmes, and call it by some other name than by the Troy weight.</p>
               <p>And it is there thought meet, that (for information of Merchants and others) a Kalender should be made and published,<note place="margin">A Mint Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</note> to shew how much euerie pound weight, ounce, and pennie weight is worth, that the true valuation of Gold and Siluer may be thereby perfectly knowne, wherby Merchants and other persons shall giue honour and praise to the King and his Councell for Equitie and Iustice shewed in the Mint.</p>
               <p>There hath been vsed from the beginning (in the Mint) both Troy and Tower weight,<note place="margin">Tower weight.</note> each of them containing twelue ounces in the pound weight, sauing that the Troy weight is heauier by sixteen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie weight vpon the pound weight: by which Troy weight the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants bought their gold and siluer abroad, and by the same did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it to the Kings mint, receiuing in counterpeaze but tower weight for Troy, which was the Princes Prerogatiue, gayning thereby full three quarters of an ounce in the exchanges of each pound weight conuerted into moneys, besides the gaine of coynage, which did rise to a great reuenue, making of thirtie pound weight Troyes, thirtie and two pound weight Towers; which is now out of vse, and the Troy weight is onely vsed,<note place="margin">Subdiuision of the pound weight Troy.</note> containing twelue ounces, euerie ounce twentie penie weight, euerie penie weight twentie and foure grains, and euery grain twenty mites, euery mite twenty and foure droicts, euerie droict twentie periods, euerie period twentie and foure blanks, although superfluous (but in the diuision of the subtile assay) which in Scotland are all diuided by twentie and foure, from the denier wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they reckon twentie and foure to the pound Troy, so twentie and foure graines, Primes, Seconds, Thirds, and Fourths all by twentie and foure. And for the marke and pound weight of other countries I do refer the reader to the fourth chapter of weights and measures of the first part of this booke.</p>
               <p>Concerning the pound weight for finesse and allay, let vs note that these two make properly the pound weight, as being distinguished therein: for if it be one pound of fine siluer, it weigheth 12 ounces, and it is likewise 12 ounces fine:<note place="margin">Diuision of the pound Troy in finesse.</note> but if there be 2 ounces of copper in that pound, then is there but 10 ounces of siluer, and so called 10 ounces fine, and so if there be 10 ounces 16 pennie weight of siluer, and so called in finesse, then is there one ounce foure pennie weight in copper; and so for all other finesses accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:14410:154"/>The like is for the Gold, whereof the said pound is diuided into twelue ounces, or twentie and foure carrats, being two carrats for one ounce, and euerie carrat is diuided with vs into foure graines, and finesse accordingly.</p>
               <p>From this generall weight of the pound,<note place="margin">Generall weight. Special weight</note> is deriued the speciall weight of the peece according to the standard, wherein (after that the commixture is made for finesse) the peeces must concur in value, and thereby is the speciall weight knowne of the peece, whereby the monyers cut their peeces,<note place="margin">The Sheire.</note> it being the direction for the sheire vnto them, which peeces they cut by their weight deliuered them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: and herein they are to vse good and exact sizing, to preuent the culling of moneys for the transporter, or the gold-smiths for melting them for to conuert into plate.</p>
               <p>Concerning the finesse of the moneys of other countries, with their weight and number of peeces in the Marke of eight ounces, (which I haue reduced to the pound Troy of twelue ounces) I haue here made a plain declaration as followeth, to instruct all Merchants and Gold-smiths therein, for the common good; obseruing that some men (not ouer wise in Mint affaires) perceiuing the Marke to be diuided into 24 carrats for gold,<note place="margin">What 36 car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats fine is.</note> and that one Marke and a halfe are taken to the pound of 12 ounces, they haue done the like for finesse, and (vnaduisedly) termed gold thirtie and six carrats fine, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant of the generall obseruation.</p>
               <p>Touching the seuerall standards of money in other countries (as you may see by the contents of the said declaration, whereby a man shall many times receiue coynes of aboue twentie standards in one hundreth pounds) it is the onely fallacie in exchange that can bee, whereby no merchant is able to know whether hee haue the true value of the summe to be paied him: but he is carried with the streame of valuation and tolleration of money to goe currant, as in the next Chapter shall be declared; and all men commonly haue a regard to the great moneys vsed in euerie countrie, making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that other smaller moneys haue their true valuation thereafter.</p>

For if it bee appointed to make a Standard peece of tenne ounces fine, they will take certaine ounces of fine Siluer and Copper proportionable thereunto, and melt them together, and being made into a plate of Siluer, diuide the same into three equall parts to be deliuered, one to the King, another to the Warden, and the third to the Mint-master; and hereof are As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayes made both of this peece and the moneys, and so compared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

                  <hi>viz.</hi> by inhauncing the price of the coyne, by Proclamation; second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by embeasiling the standard of money by allay; and thirdly, by altering the proportion betweene Gold and Siluer.</p>
               <p>The Merchants Valuation is also effected three manner of waies,<note place="margin">Merchants valuation.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> by the price of Exchange for moneys rising and falling from time to time; by the tolleration of the coynes at a higher rate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them; and by the combination with Mint-masters, inhance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price of the Marke of Gold and Siluer. Of all these in order briefely.</p>
               <p>The Kings Valuation is deriued or drawne from the verie peece or peeces made out of the pound weight of twelue ounces, or the marke of eight ounces, which the Romans did call <hi>Nummus à nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando,</hi> to tell or reckon by.

               <p>But beyond the seas there hath been great inhancing, both for the coynes of siluer and gold, as wel in Fraunce as in the Low-countries, and Germanie, to Englands incredible losse, as is at large declared in our <note n="*" place="margin">The Canker of Englands Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</note> Treatise of Exchange.

               <p>
                  <hi>Graftons</hi> Chronicle doth record that all was to no purpose, for the inhauncing might on both sides haue run <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Afterwards in the two and twentieth yeare of his raigne, finding that Merchants did transport still the moneys, or made them ouer by exchange, and made no imployment vpon the commodities of the realme; he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a Proclamation to be made according to an old statute 14 <hi>Richard</hi> 2,<note place="margin">Statute of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.</note> That no person should make any exchange contrarie to the true meaning thereof, vpon paine to be taken the Kings mortall enemie, and to forfeit all that he might forfeit.</p>
               <p>Hereupon it fell out, that lawlesse necessitie did run to the other extreame of imbasing the moneys by allay, whereby all things came to be out of order. For base money maketh euerie thing deere,<note place="margin">Base moneys.</note> and ouerthroweth the course of exchange betweene Merchants, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth much counterfeit money to be made to buy the commodities of the realme, and to destroy the good moneys, like vnto the seuen leane Kine of <hi>Pharaoth</hi> which deuoured the seuen fat Kine in a short time: as appeared of late within the realm of Ireland, which is more dangerous in those kingdomes where their moneys are of a rich stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, whereby many commotions happen,<note place="margin">Commotions about base money.</note> as in Fraunce during the raigne of <hi>Philip le Bell.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> the fourth King of Aragon, did for this cause confiscate the Islands of Maiorca and Minorca, now king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in the Mediterranean sea, whereas the policie of those nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which do vse seuerall standards of moneys, doth preuent the same, because that promiscuously they make and coine moneys of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall standards according to the occasion, which is worthie the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation:
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14410:163"/>
☞and as all extreames are vicious and defectiue, so doth it befall those countries which will haue no base money at all, and are made a prey vnto other nations by the exchange for moneys, which must be maintained withall, as I haue made and shall make more apparant.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proportion betweene gold and siluer.</note>The third effect or alteration of the Kings Valuation of money is the Proportion betweene gold and siluer, being in most countries twelue to one, that is to say, one pound of siluer for one ounce of gold wherein there is more operation than most men do imagine. For you cannot aduance or inhance the one, but you abate and diminish the other, for they ballance vpon this paralell. And whereas Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by continuance of eleuen to one hath beene a great looser of gold; so now by aduancing the same not onely to twelue to one, but to 13 ⅕ for one, there hath followed a verie great losse of our siluer which is ouer much abated, as may appeare if we do but consider that the French Crowne of sixe shillings was answered with six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in siluer, and is now full seuen shillings and foure pence; and our six shillings in siluer are the verie same: for twelue ounces of Crown gold of twentie and two carrats at 3 <abbr>ll</abbr> 6 <hi>ss</hi> maketh 39 <abbr>ll</abbr> 12 <hi>ss,</hi> and 108 French Crownes the which are made out of the pound weight of twelue ounces at seuen shillings foure pence, maketh also 39 <abbr>ll</abbr> 12 <hi>ss.</hi> Hereupon to equalize the siluer vnto gold againe will breed a generall inhauncing of things within the realme, for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the measure of moneys causeth the denomination to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in number to make vp the tale, which requireth great proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.<note place="margin">Exchange fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauncing of gold in the Low-countries</note> For we find that other nations perceiuing our gold to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced, haue abated the price of exchange, (according to which the prices of commodities are ruled) so that the same goeth at thirtie and foure shillings six pence, or thirtie and fiue shillings Flemish for our twentie shillings sterling, whereas before they did allow and reckon thirtie seuen shillings and six pence or thereabouts, which is aboue our inhauncing of ten <hi>pro cent.</hi> and ought to be almost thirtie eight shillings, whereof our Mint men c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n take no notice, much lesse our Goldsmiths and Merchants, which either are ignorant, or wise in their owne conceits; and it is a hard matter to find in one man that which belongeth to the professions of many, and when it is found to imbrace it; for wisdome draweth backe, where blind Byard is audatious.</p>
               <p>For mine owne part, although it were to be wished (which is not to be hoped) that we were of the Scithians mind, who contemned siluer and gold as much as other men do admire the same: yet see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing money is by the iudgement of the wisest so necessarie to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, that it seemeth to be the Sinowes of peace, and (as it were) the Life and Breath of warfare; I could not (if I were a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuer with <hi>Licurgus</hi>) banish gold and siluer as the causes of much euil, and bring in yron in place, vnlesse I might be persuaded as he was) of such good successe against vnrighteous dealings as issued thereby, but
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:14410:163"/>
rather vse the pretious mettalls so conueniently as I might, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie the defect with baser coyne, whereunto these chiefe mettals of gold and siluer cannot serue without great losse and inconuenience: Or else I would by the course of exchange for moneys, preuent all and abound with moneys and bullion, hauing such Staple commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to procure the same withall, whereof other nations are destitute. Let vs now therefore enter into consideration of the Merchants Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation in exchange,<note place="margin">Merchants va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.</note> which we haue noted to be predominant and ouerruling the Kings Valuation. For if the King do value a peece of sterling siluer weighing about foure pennie weight at twelue pence, it wil be currant so within the realm. But Merchants in exchange wil value the same at 11 ½ pence, and commonly at eleuen pence, and so it will be transported <hi>in specie</hi> by a low exchange, and the commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the realme will be sold accordingly, as you may vnderstand by the declaration of exchanges in our third part of this booke hereafter.</p>
               <p>This Valuation of Merchants hath two handmaides beyond the seas, which do aduance the forreine coyne in price, as we do by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change abate the same. For Merchants when they haue occasion to vse any species of coynes for transportation (as Dollers for the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries to buy corne, or Royalls of plate for the East-Indies, or French Crownes for Fraunce) will giue one, two or three Styuers or Soulz vpon a peece to haue the same, whereby other Merchants buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commodities, will condition to make their paiment in such coynes accordingly;<note place="margin">Currant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise.</note> and so it goeth from man to man by tolleration which is called Currant money in merchandise, or Permission mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, whereby the same are inhaunced two or three vpon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth at the least. This inconuenience seemeth to be remedilesse, as the Placcart of the Estates of the vnited Prouinces declareth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1594.</note> albeit the course of it is beneficiall vnto them, and in regard of them may well be called Permission money. For when they will not breake the coyne of other nations (as the manner is in all Mints) then it is either valued rather aboue the value, which contenteth the said nations, and so is permitted to passe betweene man and man, which draweth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys vnto them which doth not endure long.<note place="margin">Valuation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise with Mint masters.</note> For the last and third effect of Merchants Valuation between the Mint-masters (who loue to be doing) and the said Merchants commeth in place, either by aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the price of the said forreine coyne by Proclamation to auoid their hands of it, or to gather vp coynes before they be inhanced, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding the benefit between them &amp; the Financiers, who are Officers of their Treasurie, which is done with great dexteritie euerie way; in so much, that when it seemeth they will not haue forreine coyne, and to that end they vnderualue the same; then haue they their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changers or Brokers to gather vp those moneys to be brought to their Mint, where they will giue secretly a benefit, and helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by the sheire, which cannot be done without priuate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: So that all things duely considered, there is nothing but the rule
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14410:164"/>
of exchange to preuent and moderate all these inconueniences, which (to make men beleeue) is to vndertake <hi>Hercules</hi> Labours; for herein doth the motion consist, and <hi>Motus maior expellit minorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching the Proportion betweene gold and siluer in valuation; albeit some are of opinion, That the same is not much materiall in the course of trafficke, yet experience hath shewed vnto vs, that the contrarie must be beleeued before their conceits: And whereas they haue made obseruation vpon my former assertion to this purpose, That Spaine holdeth the Proportion of twelue to one, and Portugall holdeth but ten to one; they doe not marke the reason added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, which is, That betweene those Kingdomes there are no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to establish any trafficke. So that exportation of siluer for gold,<note place="margin">Permutation of Moneyes.</note> or gold for siluer, is but a permutation betweene them without any profit: But England and other Countreys affoording meanes to import aboundance of forraine commodities, and gold being with vs in greater estimation than heretofore (being but of late yeares ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced from eleuen to twelue for one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An.</hi> 1611.</note> that is to say, From eleuen ounces of siluer to twelue ounces of siluer, for one ounce of gold) was continually transported in returne of the said forraine commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the exchange not answering the true value of the gold: so that now when our gold is yet more aduanced, the siluer is thereby more abated in price, giuing 13 ⅕ for one: and therefore no maruell that gold is imported vnto vs, and siluer is exported, there being a gaine of aboue tenne and twelue <hi>pro cent.</hi> And this losse of siluer farre exceedeth the gold in value, because in quantitie there is in the world 500 of siluer to one of gold:<note place="margin">Siluer is 500 to one in quantitie, by weight extant.</note> and if any siluer by accident be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it is exported againe for the East-Indies and other places, they giuing more for it than the price of our Mint; for gaine is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of all.</p>

                  <p>In France the marke of gold valued at seuentie foure Crownes, and the siluer at 6 ⅓ Crownes, maketh the proportion 11 11/19 parts, but valuing the French Crowne at three Frankes, is eleuen to one.</p>

                  <p>THat the manner of popular gouernments in their Proclamations, Placcarts, Edicts, and Ordinances doth much differ from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations which are made in Monarchies where Magistrates and Iudges are of greater reputation and dignitie, according to their roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Parlements.</p>
                  <p>That in the yeare 1594, all mints stood still for one whole yeare to preuent the inhauncing of coyne betweene man and man: and the said States did declare, that it was not in their power to reforme the same, so long as the seuenteen Netherlands were diuided; euery one claiming as absolute authority as the other, as members of one bodie. And that now they haue deuised a course to make their Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons effectuall within the vnited Prouinces, to their great benefit, if we will consider the nature of the former valuation of coynes made by Princes and Merchants, with their seuerall branches, which by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie are made inconstant. And Germanie, Fraunce, and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries haue not as yet taken any course in their moneys, answerable thereunto.</p>
                  <p>That the Lyon Doller, and the great golden Royal of the said vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prouinces are valued and made the standard peeces of all the gold and siluer coynes made currant by this Proclamation. And that all other coynes of what Kingdomes or States soeuer are made bulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not to be currant within the said Prouinces.</p>
                  <p>That siluer coynes shall be weighed as well as the gold, whereby a more certaintie may be made in the calculation of the Par for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, the rather for that their species are far lesse in number, and the proportion betweene gold and siluer can be better descerned; yet without the rule of exchanges by bills, stil great aduantages may be taken by one nation against another.</p>
                  <p>That the scope of this Proclamation is to set their Mints on worke by abolishing all the seuerall coynes of gold and siluer of all king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes not valued or made currant thereby,<note place="margin">The coyning of moneys is a marke of soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14410:170"/>
ought to be increased also 1/9 part, which for 10 stiuers would be 11 sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and 1/9 part, whereas the same is inhanced but to ten stiuers &amp; one halfe, and no more. The difference in exchange (according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation) being in the one after the rate of 35 of their shillings, for our 20 shillings, and in the other aboue 37 shillings in the maine standard coyne, and much more in the smaller coynes; whereof more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after concerning Exchanges.</p>
                  <p>The like consideration is to be had for the valuation of moneys of other countries, whereby authoritie will rule their owne, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of other Nations, but by equalitie and equitie, which no N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And by these meanes there is a new foundation laid downe for moneys in the said seuenteene Low Prouinces, where heretofore they alwayes had the <hi>Phillip</hi> Doller of tenne ounces fine, and the Emperors Royall of gold of 23 carrats 3 ½ graines fine for their standard peeces. <hi>Qui vadit plane vadit sane,</hi> taketh not alwaies place.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, that the Mints of certaine Lords are called Hedge Mints, which are not vnder their commaund,<note place="margin">Hedge Mints.</note> as Batenborg, Heall, Bargen, Vianen, Gronswelt, Rechein, Geuarden, Stenwart, and others, may follow their own course in the coyning of moneys, and by the means of commerce alter all these ordinances. For in the said yere of 1586 all the said forfeitures and penalties were far greater, and the melting downe of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her coyne was prohibited vpon paine of death and goods; yet all was neglected, and came into dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order by the commaund of Gaine, which being taken away by a true course of exchange, is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to make the effects to cease, and all other meanes are fallacies, and to be abused &amp;c.

               <p>According to the definition then of biting Vsurie, we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in this discourse, after that we haue briefely declared the Laws and Prohibitions against Vsurie, wherein wee must begin with the holie Scripture, obseruing these places.</p>

                  <hi>Bernard</hi> saieth, That the Vsuror is a theefe in law, because the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile Law telleth him before hand what it is that he must rob from others, as who should say, such Lawes as permit Vsurors are lawfull theeueries.<note place="margin">Canon Law.</note> Hereupon the Canonists haue made Vsurors to be defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med persons: and if any man make (by his last Will and Testament) any goods vnto them, the Testament may be broken, neither are they to communicate with Christians, or to enter into their congregation to offer any oblation; and when they are dead, they should not be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in Christian buriall, and if they be, the doers thereof are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>

                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his Politickes sayeth, That such money as bringeth forth money through Vsurie, is an ougly beast that bringeth forth monsters, from time to time, such as are not in nature.</p>
               <p>The Romanes being in their most flourishing estate, made a law by their twelue Tables, that no man should put forth money vpon Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, but after one in the hundreth, called <hi>Faenus vnciarium,</hi> whereas before that time, rich men might take at their pleasure. Afterwards it was ordained at the intreating of the Tribunes to take an ounce and a halfe, and that was thirtie shillings in one hundreth pounds: after that it came to foure in the hundreth, called Triens: and last of all to six in the hundreth, called Semissis.

Wherefore <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Caesar</hi> to remedie this euill, and that no Vsurie should be vsed, he caused a maruellous masse of money to be laied in banke, to the summe of two millions and an halfe of Crownes, being fiue hundred

And <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Tacitus</hi> (a renowmed Writer) saith, The canker of Vsurie is an old venimous sore, and the chiefest head and cause of rebellion and variance in Countreys and Common-weales; and therefore it was altogether banished in the old time, when least corruption of life ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared amongst men. <hi>Lucullus</hi> so hated the excessiue dealings of the Vsurers, that wheras all Asia was ouerwhelmed with Vsurie, he clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the same vtterly from all Vsurers. And so did <hi>Cato</hi> in Cicilia.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Emperours.</note> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other Emperors did restraine the couetousnesse of Vsurers from time to time: And the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth (of late yeares) at an assembly at Augusta in Germanie, did conclude with the assent of the whole Empire, That no manner of contract that had any fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with Vsurie should be allowed; but rather that all Vsurie should be auoided for euer, and be neuer more vsed, and if any were found to haue made any such contract, the same man to forfeit to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate or ordinarie Iudge, the fourth part of his principall summe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> the Philosopher warneth among other things,<note place="margin">Philosophers, and Orators.</note> in his fifth Booke of Lawes, That no bodie whatsoeuer hee bee, that will beare the face of an honest man, doe let out his money for Vsurie or gaine.

               <p>So did diuers Law-makers banish Vsurie,<note place="margin">Law-giuers.</note> and vtterly suppresse the same; as <hi>Licurgus</hi> in Sparta amongst the Lacedemonians, <hi>Amasis</hi> in Egypt, <hi>Solon</hi> in Athens, <hi>Sergius Galba</hi> in Africa, being gouernour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> and diuers others.

                  </note> whereby our Sauiour Christ was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, deliuering the Virgin (which did signifie the sinfull soules of Christians) from the Dragon, or Deuils power. So by the person of Saint <hi>George</hi> is vnderstood the Kings authoritie, armed with the right armour of Christians, who with the sword of the Spirit of Gods most holy Word, explained and corroborated with seuerall other Lawes, signified by the Pybald horse whereon hee was mounted, did destroy the Dragon (Vsurie) hauing two wings to aduance himselfe, being <hi>Vsura palliata,</hi> and <hi>Vsura explicata,</hi> and his inconstant taile <hi>Cambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>; the Virgin or Kings daughter (being treasure and moneys) to be deuoured by his meanes and forraine nations. The allegorie whereof requireth a due consideration, and would in plaine termes be distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to diuers. This Dragon bringeth inequalitie in a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by the meanes of his tayle, wherein lieth his greatest strength, making the expences thereof to surmount the reuenues. In the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of which disease, those would be thought to be verie foolish Physicians, that by their medicine should cast the Bodie Politike of a Common-wealth into a more dangerous sickenesse. Wherefore as the wounds of this Dragon (Vsurie) are inueterated, so must hee bee dealt withall by degrees and lenitie, admitting him for the time (as most States and Gouerments doe) as a necessarie euill, in regard of trafficke and trade;<note place="margin">A necessarie euill.</note> albeit that many Vsurers are like vnto Iewes, who thinke it lawfull for them to take any forfeiture, bee it neuer so vnequall and vniust, any morgage, any pawne, nothing is amisse for them; they are not afraid of that wenne which wee call <hi>Anatokis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> that is, Vsurie vpon Vsurie: no, they dread not to take tenne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hundreth if it were for a weeke.</p>
               <p>The pretence of the Iewes is because we are strangers, as if wee were all Canaanites, or some of the seuen Nations which were as well to bee opprest by Vsurie, as to bee rooted out by <hi>Iosuah:</hi> but these men cannot alleage any thing in their defence, but greedie lucre.

               <head>CHAP. XI. Of Vsurie Politike, and Moneys deliuered at Interest.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the precedent Chapter you may perceiue what Lawes and prohibitions are made against Vsurie: and neuerthelesse the practise of it is most vsuall in many Kingdomes and Common-weales, and the Lawes are also made accordingly; for this sinne is rather in the conscience, than in the act, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no penaltie imposed vpon it by Gods Law. True it is that the Statute Law of England doth tollerate tenne vpon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, and so doe some other Lawes twelue and more: But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and not the rigour thereof, is to bee weighed for the cleering of iustice; and the preamble of the said Statute Law in the narratiue part saith, That whereas Vsurie is against all Diuine and Humane Lawes, yet tenne vpon the hundreth is tollerated to be taken for the yeare, which by way of forfeiture in the nature of a punishment may be sued for by the Law: but if there bee neuer so little taken aboue the said rate of tenne vpon the hundreth for the yeare, the principle is lost and treble damages.</p>
               <p>The word Vsurie was not so odious in times past, as it is now ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the abuse of Vsurie Politike,<note place="margin">Threefold Vsurie.</note> no more than it is in Vsurie Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, and Vsurie Spirituall: and my meaning is not to maintaine Vsurie Politike in all respects, contrarie to the opinion of Diuines that haue the Word of God for their warrant; but the ouer-precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therin may breed a great inconuenience to the Common-wealth. The Law of God did not punish theft by death, but onely by resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and as <hi>Cato</hi> saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cato de Rustica.</hi>
                  </note> When a theefe was punished to pay the double of that he had taken, the Vsurer was alwayes condemned to pay foure times the value. The Lawes therefore are made according to the alterations of times, nature, condition, and disposition of the people, and simply to say that any thing taken aboue the principall is Vsurie, is wonderfull strict, vnlesse you take the word Vsurie to bee Biting, because the same is neuer hurtfull but where it biteth; and the matter of conscience consisteth in the not getting of your debtor, and not in the taking of much or little interest: The Vsurie is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therefore to take but two or three vpon the hundreth of one that maketh no benefit of the money, than to take tenne or twelue vpon
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14410:173"/>
the hundreth of a Merchant, who maketh a greater gaine thereby, according to the holy Scripture, <hi>Pecunia non potest parere alienas negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri miserias; fratrem non mor debis, non munera super innocentem,</hi> which was the cause that by the Lawes of the Romanes, he that took Vsurie of the poore was more punished than he that tooke, nay than he that did steale from the rich: for no man is bound by law or otherwise admonished to lend money vnto those that haue no need of it; and there is on the other side a conscience to be vsed, if a man haue gotten well by another mans money, and doth pay the same againe without any interest or profit.</p>
               <p>Also in case of interest taken it is considerable, That if I doe lend money to him that hath neede, and can afterwards prooue that for want of that money I haue sustained great losse, or if my debtor doe breake day with me when I looke to haue it at the time appointed, and so am endangered to my neighbour for my necessarie payments, it is great reason that my debtor beare my losse, rather than I should sustaine harme or danger for my good will. And this is defined to be a gaine to be taken,<note place="margin">Vsurie, <hi>ex dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no habito,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper.</note> 
                  <hi>ex damno habito,</hi> and it being so, is improperly called Interest, in defence of Vsurie. In like manner, if a shop-keeper lend money freely to his neighbour till such a day, hauing then occasion to vse it at some Faire to lay it out in wares, if hee breake touch, the shop-keeper may in iustice take the benefit for his money, losing the profit which he should haue had by the wares which he was hindred to buy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ex lucro cessante.</hi>
                  </note> and this is taken for <hi>lucro cessante:</hi> But in neither of these was an intention to deliuer money at Interest.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, That it is better for them to deliuer their money by exchange, and that therein they are lesse to be euill thought on, than by dealing vpon Vsurie: But this difference consisteth onely in the name; for they haue both an intention of gaine vpon money, and doe beare an aduenture for the losse of their moneys: whereas the one is bound to receiue but tenne vpon the hundreth at the most,<note place="margin">Difference of gaine by Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note> and the other doth expect fifteene or twentie vpon the hundreth at the least, onely in regard hee doth beare an aduenture to lose by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change (which is verie seldome:) but still the intention remaineth, which should be the surest guide of conscience to take away all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit pretences.</p>
               <p>The Venetians and others allow no Interest at all, but approue the benefit and course of exchange, although it be aboue Interest.</p>
               <p>By the aforesaid rules, Vsurie is weighed straightly in regard of Charitie, albeit it may fall out otherwise that the borrower hath sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; therefore in such cases circumstances are to be considered, and then iudgement to be giuen accordingly. If I deale with a Merchant that maketh gaine of my money with his trade and commerce, and is well able to pay mee againe, being chiefly inriched by my meanes; why should not I in reason haue part of his benefit and aduantage, when by my goods hee is growne rich? Suppose foure men are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parteners, two doe disburse large summes of money, and the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14410:173"/>
other imploy their labour and industrie to make (by lawfull trade) a great benefit thereby, is it not reason that the other two (although they were idle at home) should haue part of the benefit? You will say, you hold this reasonable, for it is not Vsurie at all: but these two men take tenne in the hundreth for their money; nay, then you reply and say, It is Vsurie, although the other two had gotten thirtie in the hundreth by it: How can this be a biting Vsurie?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obiection. Answere.</hi>
                  </note> But they haue not borne the aduenture of the Seas, but conditioned a certaintie; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere is, That they haue not onely borne the aduenture of the Seas, but many other casualties besides, and in trusting them that had no meanes of their owne: Well therefore say you, I will not deliuer my money but to rich men; herein you shew no charitie, and may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued too, for you know not what money a man hath in his purse; so that your conscience is stil the surest guide to direct you with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the loadstone doth the variation of the Pole. So much for particular persons.</p>
               <p>Now comming to examine what the Kings of England haue done concerning Vsurie, wee find that both before the Conquest and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Vsurie hath beene banished by some Kings, and by some other Kings it hath beene tollerated, according to the times and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edgar</hi> before the Conquest, did vtterly forbid all Vsurie;<note place="margin">Bankers sent out of the Realme.</note> so did King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, who did send out of this Realme, as well the Italian Bankers that came from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the tenth, called <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sini,</hi> as all manner of Iewes, who did mightily oppresse the Realme. To omit what other Kings haue done, we know that <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, in the 37 yeare of his raigne made a Statute, whereby none were suffered to take aboue tenne in the hundreth vpon loane, either for wares or money: and this was repealed by the Statute of <hi>Anno</hi> 5, <hi>Edw.</hi> 6, which afterwards being found against Policie was abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So the Statutes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did succeed, which doe tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate the said ten in the hundreth, which are of such strength and continuance at this present, that King <hi>Iames</hi> himselfe is contented to allow the said rate to the Londoners for some moneys borrowed of them; wherein (as I said before) time and occasions do alter things; and as the case for the present standeth with England and forraine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we haue Vsurie like a Woolfe by the eares, dangerous to be kept, and more dangerous to abandone the same. This Vsurie being indeed exercised to the poore or to the rich, without respect of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ensuing, becommeth intollerable: But in case of Interest, when time of payment is neglected in the state of orphants in mutuall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, or in hazard publike,<note place="margin">Where Vsurie is allowable.</note> simply to disallow it is to cut off all trade and commerce, or reparation of damages, and to goe about to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die a mischiefe with a greater inconuenience.</p>
               <p>The Law of <hi>Iustinian</hi> the Emperour, doth therefore moderate the course of Vsurie, which is much to bee regarded, where the words are thus, as followeth.</p>

                     </note> Wee haue thought necessarie to make a generall Law or Statute touching the quantitie of Vsurie, bringing the old, hard, and most grecuous weight of the same, to a certaine moderate stay or meane rate. Therefore We command those Noble men that are Earles, or their betters, that they doe not make any stipulation or firme bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by any manner of contract whatsoeuer, great or lesse, for Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or gaine to bee had aboue foure in the hundreth. Those that are guardians or gouernours ouer handie-crafts men, or places where Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers doe worke, or else doe vse any lawfull trade of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise; Wee will that they shall moderate their stipulation, or firme promise taken in any bargaine to eight in the hundreth. And as for those that doe aduenture their goods beyond the Seas, and put out their substance vpon their owne hazard; such may lawfully demand by firme promise to receiue twelue in the hundreth, and in no wise to take aboue that rate; although by the old Romane Statutes it hath beene lawfull to exceed. And We will that all other men shall take onely six in the hundreth aboue the principall, and the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of excesse in no wise to bee enlarged in other contracts, where Vsurie is wont to bee demanded without stipulation or couenant made: neither shall it be lawfull to the Iudge to increase the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said taxation or rate made, by reason of the Custome vsed in any Countrey, &amp;c.</q>

               <p>This Imperiall Ciuile Law, hauing a regard to the qualitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons was duely obserued, albeit the lender of the money could haue taken more, when the borrower would giue it to serue his occasions, without this precise obseruation of the qualitie of persons. A matter considerable now adayes since the West-Indies haue beene discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whereby the currant of moneys is diuided into many countreys, and runneth also according to occasions, and the Policie of States and Merchants.<note place="margin">Difference of the rate of Vsurie.</note> For the tolleration and permission to deliuer money at Interest, doth differ in the rate in most countreys, taking in one place more and in another lesse, according to the trafficke, and Merchants deuises.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A Policie by plentie of money.</note>In Poland, Lituania, Prussia, and other countries adiacent, when they do abound in corne, money is commonly verie scarce, and the price of corne thereby much abated; at which time they will rather tollerate or proclaime the moneys to be inhanced in price, or to be deliuered at interest after fifteene, twentie, and sometimes twentie and fiue vpon the hundreth for a yeare, or a lesser time: hereupon presently, great store of money commeth from all places thither, which maketh the price of money to rise. Afterwards when many ships are laden, and the fleet departed from Amsterdam and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then the interest beginneth to fall accordingly.</p>
               <p>In the Low-countries it is lawfull for a Merchant to take twelue vpon the hundreth for the yeare, and after the rate for the longer or shorter time within the yeare. But this rate may not be exceeded, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be vpon some conditions of casualties or aduenture.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:14410:174"/>The Romanes and Grecians made a difference as hath beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the law of <hi>Iustinian.</hi> But the taking of one in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth was most vsuall, because Merchants were the most lenders. And this twelue <hi>pro centum</hi> is to be vnderstood also to be Interest vpon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, wherein equitie is to be obserued:<note place="margin">Interest vpon Interest.</note> for this twelue pounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliuered out againe vnto another, is <hi>pro rata</hi> as beneficiall as the 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> principall. Albeit in case of damage, when matters between men are growne litigious, and depending in suits, then the courts of Equitie will account the whole time for the forbearance of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, according to the yeres past, without any Interest vpon Interest.</p>
               <p>Polititians or states-men are to haue a serious consideration of the operation of this Vsurie politicke,<note place="margin">Vsurie a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of mens actions.</note> as a propertie inherent vnto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, because that according to the rate of Vsurie men do measure all their actions, by trade and trafficke, or purchase, build, plant and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in all things accordingly. And vsurie is so inherent, and doth properly grow with the decay of trafficke,<note place="margin">The decay of trade increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Vsurie.</note> as pasturage doth increase with the decrease of tilling. Whereupon the following considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be handled as matters of moment, especially in kingdomes and common-weales which haue no gold or siluer mines of great value, but aboundance of forreine commodities returned for the great plentie and quantitie of their home commodities, wherein the high continuall rate of Vsurie may proue more preiudiciall than the abouesaid policie of Poland, Lituania, or other countries can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall vnto them. For we see that generally all Merchants when they haue gotten any great wealth with vs, leaue trading, and fall to Vsurie; the gaine whereof is easie, certaine, and great: whereas in other countries Merchants continue from generation to generation, to inrich themselues and the state; as we find diuers renowned fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in Germanie, Italie, Spaine, and other countries.</p>
               <p>There was this last yeare a Tract against Vsurie presented to the high Court of Parliament of England,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1621.</note> shewing the inconuenience of the high rate of Vsurie after tenne in the hundreth, in comparison of the lesser rate of sixe in the hundreth, taken in the Low-countries, where money is so plentifull: and vpon this difference is a certaine operation of Vsurie noted to be predominant ouer vs, both in our trade, and other affaires.</p>
               <p>First it is alledged, that by reason of the high rate of Vsurie,<note place="margin">Reasons against the high rates of Vsurie.</note> not onely rich trades-men giue ouer trade, but a number of beginners are vndone and discouraged thereby, their industrie seruing but to inrich others, and begger themselues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that many trades the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues are decayed thereby, because they cannot affoord so great a gaine as ten in the hundreth; whereas if the rate of Vsurie were no higher than in other countries, they had subsisted and flourished still, and perhaps with as much aduantage to the publicke, as those that do bring more to the priuate aduentures, which ought to go together, or else the common good of the State is seldome greatly aduanced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:14410:175"/>Thirdly, that by this disaduantage betweene six and ten in the hundreth, other nations, and especially our industrious neighbours do out trade and vndersell vs, for they almost double the vse allowed, which we cannot by paying ten in the hundreth; wherby also all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions to the war, works of pietie, and glorie, of State are better cheape to them than to vs; as also the buildings of ships or hiring of them, and all other things.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that aboue all the rest, it maketh the land it selfe of smal value, causing the same to be sold so good cheape, that men doe not seeke by industrie any more to improue them, which is plaine both by example and demonstration. For we see in other countries, where the vse of money is at a low rate, lands are generally sold for thirtie, fortie, and some for fiftie yeares purchase, being the best assurance, and securest inheritance which men haue, and therefore bearing still a rate aboue money, which would increase if the rate of Vsurie did decrease: and consequently labourers wages and other dependances thereupon, which are therein more amplie declared, the scope of all tending to haue a moderation in the price of Vsurie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiections to the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the rate of Vsurie.</note>Hereunto are certaine obiections also alledged, and their answeres to maintaine the rate of Vsurie at ten in the hundreth with vs in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; albeit other nations take but foure, fiue, and six in the hundreth, or 6 ¼ which is called rent after the pennie sixteene for sixe times sixteene, and one fourth maketh a hundreth, after the manner of the Low-countries.</p>
               <p>The obiections are few in number. First, The long continuance of ten in the hundreth and things are well enough. Secondly, That so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine changes are dangerous. Thirdly, That money will sodenly be called in, and the borrowers be much preiudiced. Fourthly, That money will be harder to come by, and commerce much hindered. And lastly, That Merchant Strangers money now going here at vse, will be carried away againe, if the rate of Vsurie should be called downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answere to the obiections.</note>The answere to the first and second obiection is, That the practise of Vsurie hath not beene so generally vsed as it is now, when mens consciences are hardened vnto it, without any scruple or indifferent consideration, whereby as in bodies natural, so in politicke, diseases grow by the too much or the too little of a due proportion in all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions. And the rule that innouations are dangerous holds true, where the bodie naturall or politicke is in perfect state of health; but where there is a declining, there to make no alteration, is a certain way to run to destruction.</p>
               <p>To the third, That money will be sodainely called in. It may be made or enacted, that the borrower shall haue two yeares time for the payment of the money he oweth, paying the Interest, and obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing such cautions, conditions, and limitations as may be thought conuenient.</p>
               <p>To the fourth obiection, That money will be hard to be borrowed,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:14410:175"/>
it is well knowne that the high rate of vsurie doth not increase in the quantitie of money (whereof hauing plentie) causeth commerce to flourish, and if money at interest were called downe, what will Vsurers doe with their money? They will not keepe it by them as a dead stocke, for either they must imploy it in trade, purchase lands, or lend for vse at such a rate as the Law will tollerate; so that herein can be no hurt.</p>
               <p>To the last and weakest obiection, concerning the money of other Nations deliuered at interest here, it is demanded, Whether it bee meete to haue them to feed vpon the Realme, and in processe of time to carrie out such gaines thereby by multiplication of interest. For to men of vnderstanding in casting of accounts, it is plainely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that a hundreth pounds managed at tenne in the hundreth,<note place="margin">Interest which seemeth incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</note> mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies it selfe in seuentie yeares (being the age of a man) to a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth thousand pounds, and it is therefore compared to the Butlers boxe: For euen as men when they are at play, feele not what they giue to the boxe, but at the end of Christmasse it makes all, or neere all gamesters losers: so there are not few which continue in Vsurie, that are not ruined. And so the said Treatise concludeth tenne in the hundreth to be biting Vsurie.</p>
               <p>But to apostrophate this discourse, and to remedie the matter; let vs but procure to haue plentie of money really <hi>in specie</hi> within the Realme, together with the meanes vsed in other countreys in the lieu of moneys; as the transferring or setting ouer of Billes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene man and man, the paiments by assignement in Banke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out handling of moneys, and Letters of Credit, or Billes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, as you may find in this Booke declared. For plentie of money will not onely preuent, but also effect the benefits intended in the said Treatise, making Vsurie to decrease in price,<note place="margin">Plentie of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney decreaseth Vsurie in price or rate.</note> as in other countreys where they are tollerated to take twelue in the hundreth; and yet moneys are plentifully to bee had, at fiue, sixe, and seuen in the hundreth: Then will the Kings Customes increase, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce flourish, Noblemens and Gentlemens landes bee improo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, Merchants and Artificers be incouraged, young beginners bee inabled, labourers find quicke imployment, and Vsurers may haue land for their moneys.</p>
               <p>Some will say vnto mee, considering the premisses, That to take tenne in the hundreth of a rich Merchant indeed, or of any other that buyeth landes, or maketh gaine by the money, is no biting Vsurie. Herein (to qualifie the contents of this and the precedent Chapter) I note two considerations for that purpose; albeit that it seemeth no Comma can bee made (as it were) from the highest Climate to the lowest Center in regard of the litterall wordes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by way of curse against Vsurie: For if on the one side, you will take all Texts of Scripture so precisely as men doe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out construction; as for example,<note place="margin">

Therefore to answere the question, I say, That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration being had in your particular, and the partie who made benefit of your money, there is no biting Vsurie committed and no hurt done, but rather mutuall loue increaseth: but if there be consideration had of the generall, there is biting Vsurie commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and euen vpon the poore and mechanike people. For by your meanes (and others deliuering moneys at Interest) is the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into rich mens hands, whereby the meaner sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can haue none to serue their occasions, but at verie excessiue and abominable rates, and that vpon pawne also: For your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering of moneys at tenne in the hundreth and vnder, doth enable them to take intollerable Vsurie of the said meanest sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as shall now bee declared, whereby they deuoure them; so that in all Kingdomes they are prouided for, but heere; and vntill that bee amended, your taking of tenne in the hundreth in nature before declared, is a biting Vsurie, although it doe not belong vnto you to amend the same, but that Princes and Magistrates are to prouide for it. For this is a biting, nay a verie gnawing to the bones of your Christian brother with whom you ought to deale mercifully. As there are three sorts of dealings amongst men, that is,<note place="margin">Three sorts of men, and three sotts of dealings.</note> Gift, Bargaining, and Lending; so are there three sorts of men, the starke Begger, the poore Housholder, and the rich Merchant or Gentleman. To the first you ought to giue freely, not onely to lend freely; to the second you ought to lend, either freely or mercifully, and not to feed vpon him with excessiue Vsurie; but with the third, you may deale straightly and aske your owne with gaine, especially when hee gaineth by your money, vsing in all these a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with discretion.

This intollerable Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is effected by the Brokers selling old apparell and houshold stuffe, which doe take after diuers rates, but all of them excessiuely, they being the fittest instruments to receiue and buy stollen goods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all theeues are incouraged, according to the Prouerbe, <hi>If there were no receiuers, there would be few theeues.</hi> Most of these Brokers haue their money masters, to whom they pay twentie in the hundreth, or 15 at the least; for some of these money masters pay themselues ten in the hundreth vnto others, so that one thing driueth or inforceth another. Like as in a clocke where there be many wheeles, the first wheele being stirred driueth the next, and that the third, and so forth till the last that moueth the instrument that strikes the clocke: or like as in a presse going in at a straight, where the formost is driuen by him that is next him, and the next by him that followes him, and the third by some violent and strong thing that driues him forward, which is the first and principall cause of putting forward all the rest afore him; if hee were kept backe and staied, all they that goe afore would stay withall. This is therefore called <hi>causa efficiens</hi>; and so is Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Politike, vnlesse the biting of it bee hindered as shall bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>The most fauourable extortion by Vsurie vpon pawnes of any mooueable thing, is after six pence for 20 shillings for one moneth of 28 dayes, which is aboue thirtie in the hundreth by the yeare, and two pence for the Bill money of halfe a crowne, or eight pence, or 12 pence for the Bill money of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be redeemed againe; for the intent is alwaies taken to be for one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. And vnder colour of the Bill money, there is for registring of the pawnes likewise exaction made since there was a register appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, who doth not take knowledge of the twentith part of the pawnes, but what they will declare.</p>
               <p>Others doe take eight pence for the moneth or weeke, with the like allowance for Bill money and registring, which commeth to aboue fiftie in the hundreth.</p>
               <p>The vsuall rate vpon small things, is twelue pence for the weeke or moneth as aforesaid, and this is sixtie in the hundreth, and with Bill money aboue eightie; nay, there is taken the shilling pennie by the weeke of the Fish-wiues and other women selling small wares vp and downe streets, which is aboue 400 vpon the hundreth by the yeare, besides the Bil money, what this commeth vnto in diuided smal sums is incredible.

               <p>That the intollerable Vsurie committed by the Lombards might be preuented.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:14410:177"/>That the pawnes should not be worne or vsed, but safely kept, to be by them restored at all times, hauing men and women to looke vnto them.</p>
               <p>That the vse of twentie shillings for one weeke is but one farthing ⅗ parts towards the payment of ware-house and house roome, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the pawnes, and entertainement of seruants wages, and others to manage the same.</p>
               <p>That almost the value of the pawne may be had thereupon, if the borrower will desire it, one yeares time and sixe weekes consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, with the charges; during all which time he may redeeme the same, and pay but after the rate.

               <p>That stolne goods may by these meanes be detected, and theeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie decrease, and mens liues preserued for the good of the Prince and Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Act of Parlement concerning Vsurie, made in the thirteenth yeare of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> declaring that Vsurie is forbidden, and contrarie to all Diuine and Humane Lawes; doth by way of tolleration ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that whosoeuer shall deliuer his money at Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest after the rate of tenne in the hundreth for the yeare, shall onely be in danger to lose that ten in the hundreth, if any man by information, plaint, or bill will sue for the same. But if it be aboue that rate; the deliuerer of the money shall lose the principall money, and incurre other penalties; and this Statute may be pleaded in Barre, and is to bee construed against him directly and indirectly. Wherefore all men deliuering money at Interest, must be verie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full how they make their contracts, because many mistakings may happen, for that all Councell learned in the Lawes are not good Arithmeticians in the calculation of this ten in the hundreth, which is the ground of those contracts; insomuch that by the strict rules of the said Statute, the contracts being found vsurious and to exceed the rate, are not onely void <hi>ipso facto,</hi> but the principall and interest is also lost. This Statute hath relation to the Act made by King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the eight, and the words be in effect as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>None may haue, receiue, accept, or take, for the lending or forbearing of his or their money, for one whole yeare, or for a longer or shorter time, or for a more or lesse summe, aboue the rate of tenne pound</hi> pro cent. <hi>yearely.</hi> 37. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>

But if they had a due consideration, that Time is properly the iudge hereof, and that they could not make the said Statute, without the limitation

of a time certaine, they would not find any absurditie therein, for it was impossible to make it otherwise more certaine.</p>

But if you doe deliuer out 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> from the beginning for one whole yeare; then you cannot haue but tenne pounds Interest for the same at the yeares end with your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, for the propertie of the tenne pounds is not till then altered by your agreement. Thus is it with moneys deliuered for a shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Time.</p>
               <p>In like manner is it for moneys deliuered out for a longer Time; as for example, one deliuered out 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> for foure yeares, for the which at the foure yeares end hee can receiue but 140 <abbr>ll</abbr>; but if hee had deliuered out 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> for one yeare, he may at the yeares end re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue 10 <abbr>ll</abbr> for Interest, and continue the 100 pounds againe for the second yeare by a new agreement, and then receiue another tenne pound, and so for the third and fourth yeare. Now whereas by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his seuerall agreements according to the time, he hath altered the propertie of Interest money, and receiued 10 <abbr>ll</abbr> the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe let vs suppose that the 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> were deliuered out from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of foure yeares, to be repaied by 25 <abbr>ll</abbr> a yeare and the Interest, it followeth proportionably, that the first yeare hee is to receiue 27 <abbr>ll</abbr> 10 <hi>ss,</hi> the second yeare 30 <abbr>ll</abbr>, the third yeare 32 <abbr>ll</abbr>, 10 <hi>ss,</hi> and the fourth yeare 35 <abbr>ll</abbr>, which maketh all but 125 <abbr>ll</abbr>; adde to this the Interest of 25 <abbr>ll</abbr> receiued in deduction of his principall three yeares before the Time, which is 7 <abbr>ll</abbr> 10 <hi>ss,</hi> and of 25 <abbr>ll</abbr> more in

But when moneys are repaied in this manner, as it were by way of anticipation, then the bodie of your summe of 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> is diuided, and still time and interest must concur, for the interest is begotten by time. For you may not deliuer out 300 <abbr>ll</abbr> for three yeares to be repayed 100 <abbr>ll</abbr> yearely, and receiue the first yeare 130 <abbr>ll</abbr>, the second yeare 120 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and the third yeare 110 <abbr>ll</abbr>: but you must receiue the first yeare 110 <abbr>ll</abbr>, the second yere 120 <abbr>ll</abbr>, and the third yeare 130 <abbr>ll</abbr>, because you haue not forborne your money for any longer time proportionably, according to your contract and agreement.

For in this (which is for a more summe and a longer time) there is the like reason as there is with a lesse summe and a shorter time, as by the former example is declared.</p>
               <p>And as there is more gaine when money is deliuered out for three moneths, or lesse time, and so continued from time to time within the yeare than when money is deliuered out for one yeare; so is there more gaine when money is deliuered out for one yeare, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by new agrements from yeare to yeare, than when it is original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deliuered out for six or more yeres, agreeing with the rule of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometricall deliniation, and Arithmeticall proportion.</p>

               <p>If any commoditie be sold vnto any man, who buyeth the same by meanes of a broker, or otherwise, to make a shift, and to sel the same instantly to make money of, to supplie his occasions, losing thereby, (as he must of necessitie) the seller of this commoditie is an Vsurer. In this case, if it be proued that the said seller doth buy, or causeth the said commodities to be bought againe directly or indirectly, the statute against Vsurie will take hold of him, and that verie iustly.</p>
               <p>I do borrow of a man one hundreth pounds for three moneths, promising to giue his wife a satin gowne, or an ambling gelding, hereupon he forbeareth his money for many moneths more without interest, it is Vsurie.</p>
               <p>I do bind my land (worth twentie pounds by the yeare) to a man for one hundreth pounds in money for a yeare, and do not passe it by bargaine and sale, if the creditor do take the reuenues and his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, it is Vsurie.</p>
               <p>Be it that a man lendeth an hundreth pounds freely, and hopeth assuredly to haue some thankefull recompence at the yeares end, this is <hi>Mentalis Vsura.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What if one lend money in hope to get an office, this is also Vsurie.</p>

               <p>I do lend you one hundreth pounds that you shall do as much for me when I shall demand it of you, this is vsurie, because a contract is simplie made without any addition of time appointed, whereas if he had asked so much at the yeares end, then it had beene no vsurie but permutation, when one good turne is done for another, and the time knowne certaine.</p>

               <p>I doe sell commodities vnto a man for six moneths at a reasonable price, and afterwards he payeth me in readie money, deducting the interest for the time after the rate of ten in the hundreth, this is Vsurie.</p>

               <p>A Merchant lendeth to a Corporation or Companie an hundreth pounds, which corporation had a grant by statute, that whosoeuer lendeth such a summe of money, and hath a child of one yeare, shall haue for his child (if it do liue fifteene yeares of age) 500 <abbr>ll</abbr> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: but if the child die before that time, the father to lose his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall for euer. The law saieth, If I lend purposely for gaine, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the perill, I am an vsurer.</p>
               <p>I knowe an honest artificer oweth to a draper fortie pounds to be payed at six moneths.

               <p>I doe deliuer old Wheat to receiue new; if I doe deliuer the same for gaine, and assure my selfe of benefit, I am an Vsurer.</p>
               <p>I doe feare the fall of money, and therefore doe deliuer my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to another man, to haue as much at sixe moneths after, according as the money was then currant when I paied it; this is Vsurie.</p>
               <p>I seeke an office, which I cannot haue except I doe pay a certaine summe of money; to auoid this paiment, I doe lend for two, three, or foure yeares, a grosse summe, because I will not pay the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, in so doing is Vsurie.</p>
               <p>I doe pawne an house with an orchard for certaine money, the creditor hath the benefit of my ground and house, hee is an Vsurer.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman hath a Mannor stocked with thirtie milch kine, and 700 sheepe, valued at 300 markes or thereabouts, as they are then to be bought and sold; this Mannor he would let out with the stocke for tenne yeares, to receiue the old rent of his Mannor, and thirtie pounds yearely besides for his stocke, and at the tenne yeares end, either to haue at his owne choice his cattell of like goodnesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue as hee did let them out, or else 200 <abbr>ll</abbr> in money. Here there is first a lending, because the Farmour hath propertie in the cattell, and may alter them as hee list for his best auaile, paying his yearely rent for them, and restoring so good cattell at the tenne yeares end as he before receiued. Againe, he must answere the cattell at the ten yeares end, and pay rent yearely for tenne yeares, although the cattell die all the verie first yeare. So that this Gentleman (seeking his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine gaine and principall to be safely returned vnto him) is an Vsurer colourably.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to deliuer money by exchange vpon Bills of Exchanges, intending any gaine thereby any manner of wayes, is Vsurie, and all the premisses are vsurious acts, although many not in danger of the Statute.</p>
               <p>Now diuers Merchants and others will say, That then there is no dealings betweene man and man, and all Trafficke and Commerce is ouerthrowne: For (say they) here is nothing excepted, wherein any

               <p>To which end the Master generall of the said counting houses (if breach be made by any one of the parties in any article of this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant) is to receiue the complaint, and to consult with his counsell of assistance, and so to giue notice thereof vnto the next neighbour, Prince, or State of this societie, to see the same redressed or amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE manner of keeping accounts by Debitor and Creditor, was first deuised in Italy vpon verie good considerations. There is great affinitie betweene Faith, Trust, and Confidence; in Diuinitie Trust and Confidence are two handmaides vnto Faith, euen as Faith is the hand whereby wee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Gods mercies, to repose our trust in him, and to bee confident thereof. But in Humane actions the word Trust is more proper, which implieth a credit or beliefe which wee giue or repose vpon others, or others do attribute and giue vnto vs. Hence proceedeth the Italian speech, <hi>Star dal Credere,</hi> grounded vpon that maxime of
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14410:189"/>
the Ciuile Law, <hi>Omnis homo bonus, donec contrarium probetur</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a man negotiating in this world must trust and bee trusted: he that is trusted with any goods, moneys, or other mooueable things, is therefore called a Debitor or Debtor vnto the partie that doth trust him therewith, and he calleth that partie his Creditor, because hee gaue him credit for the same; whereby Debitor and Creditor concurreth betweene partie and partie. Suppose now, that a young man being of age to manage his owne, is desirous to deale in the world in trafficke and trade by buying and selling of commodities, or to let out his money at vse, or by exchange, for other countreys (vnto which three actions wee still obserue our method, as being the Essentiall parts of Trafficke, as often hath beene declared:) and thereupon he endeuoureth to keepe a true account of all his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and negotiation, by way of this manner of account by Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Creditor, that is to say, to haue still a Creditor vnto a Debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and a Debitor vnto a Creditor, which must reciprocally answere each other. Now considering of his meanes for the effecting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he findeth that he hath one hundreth Clothes, two hundreth Kersies, or any other commodities left him by his father or friends, and moreouer some thousand pounds in readie money, and fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth pounds in debts owing by seuerall persons, payable at some time to come, besides some hundreth pounds yearely in Lands or Leases: out of all these he maketh a Stocke or Capitall, which he doth enter into a Book<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Spaniard doth call this Booke <hi>El Libro grande,</hi> and the Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall he calleth <hi>Manuall,</hi> being of a farre lesser volume, commonly but one third part of the other, being manuable, and vnto this they keepe a Borrador or Memorial, wherein all things are first entred,<note place="margin">A Memoriall Booke.</note> and may vpon occasion be blotted, altered, or (by error) be miscast, or not well entred.</p>
               <p>But in the Iournall and Leidger Booke, there may not be any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of cyphers, blotting (nor places left in blanke in the Iournall) but one parcell without intermission must follow another, otherwise the bookes are of no credit in law, or before any Magistrat; whereas otherwise much credit is giuen to bookes well and orderly kept, for the deciding and determination of many controue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys being proceeding from the originalls of commodities or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, and the persons with whom you deale therein, giueth you light and direction to discusse these differencies; and therefore it may well be compared to the measure of <hi>Hercules</hi> foot, whereby the whole Symetricall proportion of all his bodie was found out.<note place="margin">Symetricall proportion in Accounts.</note> And manie Merchants Accounts are so intricate, and ouergrowne with errors, as <hi>Archymedes</hi> Tombe with thornes, when <hi>Cicero</hi> came to visit it.</p>

                  <p>Hereunto I answere, That it was omitted of purpose, because it should not obscure the former demonstration, otherwise the matter is of such importance, that whosoeuer dealeth without consideration of it, is like to a blind man groping in the dark, and yet may hit the egge. For (according to the price of Exchange) all the commodities of the realme which are exported, and all the forreine commodities imported, are sold.</p>

            <head>THE THIRD PART OF <hi>LEX MERCATORIA,</hi> OR THE Ancient <hi>Law-Merchant</hi>; concerning Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges for Moneys by Billes of Exchanges, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Spirit or Facultie of the Soule of TRAFFICKE and COMMERCE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING (in the First and Second Part of this Booke) intreated of the Bodie and Soule of Trafficke, namely, Commodities and Moneys. Let vs now handle the predominant part of the course of Trafficke, which is the Exchange for moneys, by Bils of Exchanges for forrain parts, compared to the Spirit or Facultie of the Soule. For as moneys do infuse life to commodities by the meanes of Equalitie and Equitie, preuenting aduantage betweene Buyers and Sellers: so Exchange for moneys by Bills of Exchanges (being seated euerie where) corroborateth the Vitall Spirit of Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke, directing and controlling (by iust proportions) the prices and values of commodities and money, as shall be declared.</p>
            <p>Many men cannot well discerne the distinction of the Spirit in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie matters, because man (consisting of Bodie and Soule (that) which belongeth to the Spirit) is comprized vnder the name Soule: but if they be willing to vnderstand the necessarie distinction heereof, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the Theoricke Part, will demonstrate the same in the Practike Part of this discourse of Exchanges.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the later end of his second Epistle to the Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, wished a sanctification to their spirits and soules,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.23.</note> and their bodies vntill the day of Iudgement. For albeit the Spirit of man, is rightly termed to bee the Facultie of the Soule;<note place="margin">The Facultie of the Soule, is the Spirit of man.</note> yet the parts of the Soule concerning Vnderstanding and Will, haue their proper relation; for that part called Vnderstanding, is seated chiefly in the Soule, as Will is in the Spirit, both to be accompanied with Knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Phylosophers haue made this distinction by their Chimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call obseruation: and such as place the Soule in the bloud (dispersed through all the veynes of the bodie) do also place the Will of man in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14410:197"/>
the spirit, residing in the heart of man, which the Anatomists de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth to be a little concauitie, where the drops of the vitall bloud are placed in the heart, which are feared vp, and the place is shrunke in bodies which haue been poisoned.</p>
            <p>To make application of this comparison betweene the Soule and Spirit,<note place="margin">Application of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison.</note> we shall find by the following discourse, that euen as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of man is predominant ouer the Soule and Bodie in all the actions thereof, which by the bloud are quickned and preserued, euen so is the Exchange for moneys by Bills of Exchanges, ouerruling the course of commodities and moneys in all places where the action of money is felt or seene, directing the same (by some due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) accordingly.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Exchange for moneys is of great antiquitie: for (as we haue declared) the first Siluer moneys coyned by the Romanes is almost 1900 yeares since. And euen as money was inuented to bee made of the best mettalls, to auoid the trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some carriage of commodities vp and downe, and from one countrey into another: So (vpon the like consideration) when other nations (imitating the Romanes) did coyne moneys,<note place="margin">The cause of the Exchanges</note> Exchange by Bills for moneys was deuised, to auoid both the danger and aduenture of moneys and the troublesome carriage thereof. This money now being made by diuers Nations of seuerall standards and diuers stamps and inscriptions, (as a Marke of Soueraigntie) caused them to appoint a certaine Exchange, for the permutation of the seuerall sorts of coynes in diuers countreys, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any transportation of the coyne, but giuing <hi>Par pro Pari,</hi> or value for value, with a certaine allowance to accomodate the Merchant: and the officers to execute the same, were called <hi>Numularij, Argenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rij,</hi> and <hi>Collybistae,</hi> that is to say, <hi>Numularij</hi> of <hi>Nummus</hi> or the coyne it selfe; <hi>Argentarij,</hi> because the Siluer coyne was most vsuall in the course of trafficke; and <hi>Collybistae,</hi> because it signifieth a reward for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="379" facs="tcp:14410:197"/>Here now let vs obserue foure manner of Exchanges which haue beene vsed, and in some countreys are yet continued, albeit some of them are abrogated in England, commonly called <hi>Cambio Commune, Cambio Reall, Cambio Sicco,</hi> and <hi>Cambio Fictitio,</hi> which denomination may be admitted.</p>
               <p>The first manner of Exchange, called <hi>Cambio Commune,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I <hi>Cambio Commune.</hi>
                  </note> is properly that Exchange which the said <hi>Collibistae,</hi> or common Exchangers did vse by the authoritie of Princes and Common-weales, for the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and currant moneys of their Kingdomes and Territories; which was found to be verie expedient and necessarie, and was established to preuent the exportation of money from one countrie into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countrie: and these Exchangers did deliuer in all countries the Money in one specie, for the Moneys in other species by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, as aforesaid.<note place="margin">Tables of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note> Whereupon King <hi>Edward</hi> the third of England caused certaine Tables to be set vp at Douer and other places of the realme, declaring the value of the said sundrie species of coyne of all countries trafficking with his subiects, and the allowance which Merchants were to giue to haue their turnes serued; as may appeare by the good Lawes made in his time, when there was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys coyned in diuers places of this Kingdome, and not in one mint onely, within the Tower of London. And this was long before the discouerie of the West-Indies, from whence the ocean of Money did run into Christendome. And for the gouernment of the said Tables, all was at the direction of the Master of the Kings Mint at London, and with a correspondence of other Mints, namely at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turburie, at Kingston vpon Hull, New-castle vpon Tine, Bristoll, and Exceter. And the Exchanger for the King at London did also depute Exchangers in the most places, except that certaine Merchants of Florence, called <hi>Friscobaldi,</hi> were the Kings Exchangers at Kingston,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Friscobaldi</hi> the Exchangers.</note> New-castle, and Exceter, who made the said Exchanges of value for value, with a reasonable allowance; and by their meanes were all the said Mints set on worke, and the transportation of our Moneys was preuented; for as Bishop <hi>Tursids</hi> booke of Arithmeticke declareth, by giuing <hi>par pro pari,</hi> or value for value, there was no gaine left to the transporter.</p>
               <p>The Kings of England did constitute these Exchangers,<note place="margin">Kings Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</note> euen as the Cambiadores and Banquers are vsed in other countries, being authorised by the King or Prince of the said countries, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King <hi>Edward</hi> the first of England, who had two Exchangers, the one called <hi>Custos Cambij infra Turrim,</hi> who had the charge in buying of bullion, and to looke to the coynage of Money within the realme, now called the Warden of the Mint: the other was called Keeper of the exchange and rechange within or towards this realme, for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys to be paied <hi>in specie,</hi> by Bills of Exchanges beyond the seas. And afterwards the said Exchanges were made without naming the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but according to the value of the seuerall coynes,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cambio Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi>
                  </note> and this was called <hi>Cambium Regis,</hi> or Royall Exchange, which caused Queene
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14410:198"/>
                  <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to name the Burse in London accordingly.</p>
               <p>This office appeareth to haue been in the eleuenth yere of the said King <hi>Edw.</hi> by an Act of Parliament made at Acton Burnel, since which time the succeeding Kings and Queenes haue continued the same by sixteene seuerall Letters Patents. And whereas it seemed that the said two Exchangers could not execute their offices conueniently being asunder; it fell out, that in <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixth his time, a Law was made, by which both offices were put into one mans hand, and so continued many yeares, vntill the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight,<note place="margin">Exchanges discontinued.</note> when he caused base Moneys to be made at the seige of Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loigne, whereupon no certaine Exchange could be grounded: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that before that time, in the two and twentieth yeare of his raigne, he caused a Proclamation to be made according to an old Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made in the time of King <hi>Richard</hi> the second,<note place="margin">The Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Graston.</hi>
                  </note> That no person should make any Exchanges contrarie to the said meaning or Act of Parliament, vpon paine to be taken to be the Kings mortall enemie, and to forfeit all that he might forfeit. For in his noble fathers time King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth, the Bankers had inuented a course of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandising by Bills of Exchanges; and especially two other Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which they named <hi>Cambio sicco,</hi> and <hi>Cambio fictitio.</hi>

                  </note>This <hi>Cambio sicco, alias</hi> called drie Exchange, is in this manner: A Merchant hath occasion to vse, <hi>Verbi gratia,</hi> one hundreth pounds, which they will deliuer him in London, to be paied vnto their Factor at Stoad: but hauing there no Factor of his owne, the said Merchant is contented to make his Bill of Exchange vpon the Bankers Factor, payable to him the said Factor, with order and aduice, that when the said Bill shall be due, he shall charge him by Exchange againe, and take vp the Money there, and hee will pay the same with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and charges of Factoridge and Brokeridge: wherein they will be sure to make him pay verie great vse or interest, of fifteene or twentie in the hundreth for the taking vp of this Money, and to make it more drier Exchange, they will be contented to take no Bill at all, but the Merchants promise to pay it as other men doe at the same time, dealing in Exchange for the said place of Stoad, and in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for other places.</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>Cambio fictitio</hi> is yet more pernitious, and performed in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: A Merchant (to keepe his credit) being driuen to buy goods for a shift, when Money is not to be had, and he will not be beholden vnto others, comming vnto them (as hauing store of commodities at all times) they faine that they haue need of Money, and must sell their commodities for readie Money; Prouided alwaies (say they with louing protestations) we will pleasure you thus far, looke what the goods come vnto, we will take it vp for you by Exchange for Venice, Lyons, or some other place, so as you will pay vs for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, Rechange, or any other incident charges: wherunto the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant agreeing, then shall he be sure to pay soundly for the vse of the Money, and loose exceedingly vpon the wares.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:14410:198"/>These two biting manner of Exchanges being discouered, were by an Act of Parliament prohibited in the third and fourth yeare of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth: afterwards (as is noted) the Exchange be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discontinued in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight, it happened that the former abuses came to bee rife againe in the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth,<note place="margin">Exchange was forbidden.</note> which caused the vse of Exchange to bee vtterly forbidden for a short time. But as Ships cannot saile without water, no more can trafficke subsist without Exchange in the accustomed places; so that the inconueniences appearing it was restored againe in hope of good dealing and reformation promised by other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, concerning the Royall Exchange. But in the time of Queene <hi>Marie</hi> it was againe neglected; who being married with King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the second of Spaine, did conniue in those things, because the dominion of the Low-countreys were esteemed to be vnder one degree.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Complaints of Exchanges.</note> new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint were made of the new Exchanges, by Master <hi>Hussey</hi> Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of the Companie of Merchants Aduenturers; but no man could apply or find a remedie to moderate the inequalitie of Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to haue value for value, as appeareth by Letters Pattents graunted to the old Lord Treasurer <hi>Burghley,</hi> who did not execute the same in three and twentie yeares after for want of true direction, to the great losse of the Realme, as may bee seene by a Commission in Blanke returned by diuers Merchants: albeit the Italian Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants in those daies could not denie the abuses thereof being expostulated withall, as by their politicke Letters appeareth, vnder the hand of <hi>Acerbo Velutelli, Suigo Caualcanti,</hi> and others, who wanted not some vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to maintaine their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate benefit.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He true royall Exchange for Moneys (by Bills of Exchanges) is grounded vpon the weight, fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and valuation of the Money of each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, according to the <hi>Par,</hi> which is, value for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: and so is our Exchange of England groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the weight and finenesse of our Monies aforesaid, and the weight and finenesse of the Moneys of each other countrie, according to their seuerall standards proportionable in their valuation, which (being truely and iustly made) maketh the price of Exchange for euerie place, according to the denomination of the Money, wherupon all Exchanges are made.</p>
               <p>These Exchanges do much differ in the name and proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the gold and siluer obserued in most countries; so that we are to examine and compare our weight aforesaid, with the weight of other countries, and the finesse of the sterling standard with the finesse of the seuerall standards of the coynes of other countries: and if we differ not with them in the proportion betweene the gold and siluer,<note place="margin">The maner to calculate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</note> then may our Exchanges run at one price both for gold and siluer, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the denomination according to the valuation of Monies of each countries: and hereby shall we find how much fine siluer or gold our pound sterling containeth, &amp; what quantitie of other Monies of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, Italie, France, the Low-countries, Eastland, and elsewhere we are to haue in Exchange to counteruaile the same in the like weight and finenesse answerable vnto ours, be it by the Pound, Doller, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat, Crowne,<note place="margin">Imaginarie and reall coyne.</note> or any other imaginarie or reall coyne, giuing alwaies value for value, and receiuing the like, which is called <hi>Par.</hi> But this course of Exchange being of late yeares abused, and (as it were) made a merchandise,<note place="margin">

were alone.

               <p>This Exchange is properly made by Bills,<note place="margin">The manner of the Royall Exchange.</note> when money is deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red simply here in England, and Bills receiued for the same, to haue the payment thereof in some other countrey beyond the Seas, or when the like is done beyond the Seas, and the money is receiued here in England, and that vpon a certaine price agreed vpon between partie and partie, which is termed the price of Exchange, whereof Merchants haue the onely and whole disposing, and buy and sell their commodities beyond the Seas accordingly: without that few or none of them doe looke into the nature of Exchange, as aforesaid, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the present obiect, which is, to know how the price of Exchange goeth at the time when they haue occasion to deale therewith: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit such Merchants as neuer or seldome deale for commodities, but altogether for money by Exchange haue another obseruation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and Merchants that will be Exchangers indeed, must know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the weight and finenesse of our English coyne, and of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine coyne also, and compare the same together to make the said cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of Exchanges; wherein they are not to be directed by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation which is vncertaine and inconstant,<note place="margin">Valuation of money be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas inconstant.</note> much lesse by the tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moneys beyond the Seas to goe currant aboue the said valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; so that by authoritie they ought to bee gouerned and directed herein, declaring the true value for value, or <hi>Par pro Pari,</hi> as the verie foundation of all Exchanges: because this is not a fit studie for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Merchants capacitie, and may be done neuerthelesse with great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie, and without interruption of trafficke, as shall be declared.</p>
               <p>But to come first to the particulars concerning weight, wee are to know, that in all places beyond the Seas,<note place="margin">Weight of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes.</note> they vse for their moneys (both of Gold and Siluer) the marke weight of eight ounces, hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoken of, with the diuision of twentie pennie weight, or twentie English, so called beyond the Seas, and the subdiuision of twentie and foure graines here, or thirtie two azes or graines there. These eight ounces compared vnto our pound weight Troy of twelue ounces, are within a little all one, ounce for ounce in weight. But vpon the pound of twelue ounces, as aforesaid, which is one marke and a halfe marke weight of theirs, it is found that in the said proportion of a pound, our weight is heauier than the weight of Germanie and the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries by three pennie weight; and than the weight of France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Spaine, and Scotland, by foure pennie weight; all which may be considered in the price of Exchanges, in allowing more or lesse for the <hi>Par</hi> according as the foundation of the Exchange lyeth, either vpon our twentie Shillings sterling, or vpon their Crowne, Ducat, Doller, Florin, or other coyne, which is properly the head or <hi>Radix

                  <note place="margin">The head of Exchanges, or <hi>Radix Cambij.</hi>
                  </note> whereupon Exchanges were made. This weight is to bee considered in the weight of the peece of coyne, and from the peeces to the number of them in the marke or pound weight aforesaid.</p>
               <p>Concerning the finenesse of moneys to be calculated in Exchange, the same is knowne by weight,<note place="margin">Finenesse of money in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes.</note> for it must bee distinguished thereby; that is to say, We ought to know how much fine Siluer or fine Gold there is in the marke or pound weight, of the sundrie coynes of the seuerall standards of moneys of all Countreys, where Exchanges are vsed betweene vs and them: and to calculate the same vpon the pound sterling for some places, or vpon the Crowne, Ducat, Doller, Florin, and other imaginarie coynes for other places, to the end wee may haue finenesse answered by weight.</p>
               <p>To vnderstand the premisses, let vs suppose that a Merchant stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger commeth into the Realm, and bringeth with him many vnknowne and strange coynes, to haue the coyne of the Realme for it, according to value for value by weight and finenes, and that the said Merchant (hauing weighed the said coynes) hath a sufficient knowledge of the quantitie of fine Siluer and Gold which is contained in the said weight,<note place="margin">The manner to examine the weight and finenesse of money.</note> and his desire is to haue the same answered vnto him by the like weight, and by the like finenesse in weight in moneys of this Kingdome. Herein (no doubt) he will be assured, what finenesse or fine Siluer and Gold there is in our moneys, and that he may haue the same by weight in the said quantitie of coynes, whereupon (after the weight of our moneys) hee will calculate distinctly what quantitie of Siluer and Gold there is in the said moneys, and what quantitie of Copper, and so will require the full quantitie both of the Siluer and Gold, and of the Copper accordingly. So is it with the matter of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, grounded vpon the verie value of coynes, if there were no valuation whereby the price of coynes is baptized and receiueth a name, which giueth a denomination of price vnto the said coynes, or vnto the Exchanges of the said coynes, which in the manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said maketh the said price of Exchange.</p>
               <p>But so long as the calculation remaineth vpon weight and finenes, without respect had to the valuation;<note place="margin">Definition of Bullion and Allay.</note> so long may wee esteeme the said coynes to bee in the nature of Materialls or Bullion; that is to say, Prohibited moneys to bee currant, which forraine Nations call Bullion, as it were vnlawfull and sit to be molten down, from whence the word Bullion is deriued, or which other nations call to be Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialls, or Masse of Gold and Siluer, euen as Copper is called Allay or mixture thereunto.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Valuation of moneys in Exchange.</note>Concerning the Valuation of moneys, wee haue alreadie in the Second Part intreated thereof, compendiously and substantially: so that in this place we are to obserue the denomination, which giueth a rate or price vnto Exchanges,<note place="margin">Proportion between Gold and Siluer in Exchanges made in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> euen as it doth vnto the seuerall Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of money in their kind.</p>
               <p>Concerning the proportion betweene the Gold and Siluer in the said Exchanges wee are to obserue. That when the proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:14410:200"/>
the Gold and Siluer was 12 to one, or one pound of Siluer to an ounce of Gold (which is now 13 ½ to one;) then the ensuing calculation in Exchange was true, namely, to account eight Carrats of fine Gold, or foure ounces of fine Siluer for twentie shillings sterling, reseruing in the said rate a reasonable gaine for the Merchants to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their gaines and charges. But now that the said proportion is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and that thirteene ounces and ⅓ part, or foure pennie weight is appointed to be giuen for one ounce; of necessitie it followeth that the Siluer is vnderualued, and the Gold aduanced: so that in matter of Exchange there ariseth a twofold consideration, the one to bee established in <hi>Par,</hi> according to the Gold coynes, and the other after the Siluer coynes. And this measure of Exchange betweene vs and forraine Nations is verie tender and delicate; yet Merchants occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the course of trafficke, doe exceed the said limitation vpon plentie or scarsitie of money, and the many deliuerers or takers vp of the said moneys according thereunto, which is proper to confirme the mutabilitie of Exchanging aboue the said <hi>Par,</hi> but neuer vnder the same: for it is like vnto the Needle of the Compasse, which hath beene touched vpon the fixed North Starre.</p>
               <p>Some Merchants are so farre wide from the knowledge of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of coynes, and the Exchanges made thereupon, that they are of opinion, That there can be no certaine Rate or <hi>Par</hi> of Exchange set to answere iustly the value of the coynes of forraine parts, by reason of the diuersitie and disproportion of the coynes of Gold and Siluer, and their intrinsicall and extrinsicall values. But these Merchants are to vnderstand, that the moneys of all Countreys haue a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble valuation relatiue within themselues, according to their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall standards for weight and finenesse, onely the smaller and baser coyne haue some little knowne aduantage, which may bee considered of in Exchange,<note place="margin">Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble valuation of moneyes for Exchanges to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</note> if there bee cause that the quantitie of those moneys doe exceed the bigger and finer coyne. This consideration hath beene had heretofore; and especially in the <hi>Par</hi> agreed vpon between the Low-countreys and this Realme, in the yeare 1575, when vpon the <hi>Philip</hi> Doller the Exchange was at twentie fiue shillings the <hi>Par,</hi> and the small moneys would exceed twentie seuen shillings and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but the quantitie did not surmount the better coyne. The like was vpon the <hi>Par</hi> agreed vpon with the States of the vnited Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Anno</hi> 1586, at thirtie three shillings foure pence; and with Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough and Stoade, to twentie foure shillings nine pence Lubish vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rickes Doller of thirtie three shillings, or nine markes foure shillings for our pound sterling of twentie shillings, making foure Dollers and one halfe to answere the said <hi>Par,</hi> which Doller is inhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced since to fiftie foure shillings, and were receiue now but foure Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers for the same, and so for other places accordingly.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Denomination of moneys, which wee call Imaginarie, is because there is not any peculiar or proper money to be found <hi>in Specie,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Exchanges are grounded, as it was in times past in many places, where some moneys were the cause to ground the price of Exchange vpon: as our Angell Noble, being coyned for sixe shillings and eight pence sterling, whereupon Exchanges haue beene made, as now is done vpon twentie shillings, and so might the new peeces of our Soueraigne King <hi>Iames</hi> Laureat, be taken. But it is more proper to make Exchanges vpon the siluer coynes; for the price of commodities is most ruled thereby in all places, which by the quantitie is fiue hundreth to one. Hence did proceed the cause that when our Gold in the yeare 1611,<note place="margin">The price of Gold not so effectuall, as the price of Siluer.</note> was aduanced ten in the hundreth aboue the Siluer, the prices of commodities did not rise, albeit for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations did cause the price of Exchange to fall. But if Siluer were inhanced, presently the price of commodities would follow as the rule thereof, and the price of Exchange would fall more, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change will ouerrule both.</p>
               <p>In like manner do we call the moneys of other Countreys, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon Exchanges are made to be Imaginarie, as the Dollers in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the Crownes in France, the Ducats in Italy and other places, which by the great diuersitie you may vnderstand as followeth: together with</p>

               <p>The taking and deliuering money at Sight,<note place="margin">At Sight.</note> bindeth the Taker vp of the moneys to giue his Bill of Exchange, directed vpon his friend Factor or Seruant in any place beyond the Seas, to pay vpon Sight of it, or within three, foure, or more dayes, so much money as hath been taken vp by him after such a rate the Pound, Doller, Ducat or Crown, as is agreed vpon betweene them in forraine coyne, either according to the Valuation of monies, or currant money for merchandise, which is more ordinarie, because Merchants will admit sometimes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue some coynes at a higher rate than they are valued, vpon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that some Species are required for transportation, or some other vse to make paiments;<note place="margin">Policie of Estates.</note> which tolleration is by authoritie many times suffered to draw moneys vnto their places of jurisdiction. Heerein is to be noted, That if the Bill be made payable at so many dayes Sight, that the number of dayes must bee expressed in the Bill or Bills; for commonly there are made three Bills of one Tenor for euerie summe of money taken vp, because if one Bill bee lost, the other may serue in place.</p>
               <p>The second Time of payment called Vsance,<note place="margin">At Vsance.</note> which is either the Time of one moneth, two or three moneths after the date of the Bill
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:14410:204"/>
of Exchange, as heereafter is declared, according to the Custome of the places where these Exchanges doe runne: according to which Time the partie (vpon whom the Bill of Exchange is directed) is to pay the same, vnlesse there be good cause to the contrarie, as shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare hereafter.</p>

But conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the wind and other hinderances, it is better to limit the dayes after Sight in the Bill of Exchange, and to send the same by Sea and Land with a Letter of Aduice, which the Taker of money common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth deliuer with the Bill of Exchange, whereunto the Bill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth also relation, and treble Vsance is accordingly.</p>

               <p>The difference of the times of payment, doe alter the price of Exchanges according to the Time, commonly after twelue, fifteene, or twentie in the hundreth by the yeare: So betweene the pound ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Exchanged for the Low-countries at Sight and Vsance, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene foure and fiue pence, and double Vsance and Vsance, sixe or seuen pence, which ordinarily was accounted to bee but foure pence after 10 <hi>pro</hi> 100.

               <p>Vsance from London to and from Middleborough, Amsterdam, Antuerpe, Bridges, and other places in the Low-countreys, is one moneths Time from the date of the Bill of Exchange; and double Vsance is two moneths.</p>

               <p>Vsance from Genoa to Rome and Naples, is ten dayes Sight; and for Palermo and Antuerp is two moneths by ordinarie obseruation, and so is Luca:</p>
               <p>From Naples to Antuerp is two monethes; and the like for Palermo.</p>

               <p>From Antuerp and London to Seuill is two moneths.</p>

               <p n="1">1 This is the forme of a Bill of Exchange for moneys, taken vp at Amsterdam to be payed in London, wherein the Time of payment may bee made at Sight, or so many dayes after Sight, or at double Vsance, according to the agreement: or the Bill may bee directed to my seruant, or to himselfe or any other: or it may say, Put it to the account of such a man.

               <p>You may not say in the Bill, It may please you to pay, or I pray you to pay (although it were to your Master;) for the Bill (of his high Nature) doth carrie with it a Command without respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and most men will not vse the words <hi>(Make him good Payment)</hi> but the fewer words the more formall; neither is there any witnesse vnto it, nor any seale, but a small peece of paper of some two fingers broad: and the Letter of Aduice doth declare for whose account, or to what intent or purpose the said money is taken vp; which Letter of Aduice, doth accompanie the Bill of Exchange with the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, with the words <hi>De aduiso.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Also for moneys here deliuered (where the ground of Exchange is of the twentie shillings whereupon the Exchange is made) you may not expresse what the sterling money maketh in Flemish money; not so much for that by miscasting you might make your selfe lyable, as for that it is not mannerly to cast vp another mans account: neither may you make a Bill of Exchange payable to the bearer or bringer thereof (as you make your Bills Obligatorie beyond the Seas) to auoid the inconuenience which might happen in derogation of the noblenesse of the said Bill of Exchange,<note place="margin">Although now vsed, or abused.</note> which euerie Merchant is to maintaine. All other Billes of Exchanges for Germanie, Spaine, Italy, France, the Low-countreys, Portugall, or any other places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, to and from place to place, doe not differ in the forme, but in the manner of the moneys to be payed in Banke, or out of the Banke, or in such a Faire or Mart, at such times and in such moneys according to the Countreys.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:14410:205"/>2 The Bankers and diuers Italians haue a custome,<note place="margin">Rare customes in Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes.</note> that for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys taken by them, or for their companie, or any other, one of their seruants doth make the Bills of Exchange, and he subscribeth the name of him, or of the Companie for whom it was taken vp: and the master he doth write vnder the said Bill <hi>Pagate come si dice,</hi> that is to say, Pay as it is said; and this goeth as currant amongst Merchants as any other Bill made by the parties owne hand, and all proceedings thereupon are done accordingly.</p>
               <p n="3">3 They haue also an ordinarie custome to transferre and put ouer their Bills of Exchanges before they are made, vnto any other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as for example.</p>
               <p>One in Antuerpe doth deliuer by Exchange fiue hundreth pounds sterling, to be paied here in London vnto another Merchant there, who is to make him a Bill of Exchange for the same: afterwards within two or three daies this deliuerer of money hath occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take vp fiue hundreth pounds for London, and hauing taken the same of another Merchant, he is to make him also a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for this money, as the other Merchant was to make him for the fiue hundreth pounds which he did deliuer him by Exchange for London, as aforesaid. Hereupon he knowing the name of the partie in London to whom the other mans money was to be made payable, caused the Bill of Exchange to be made payable to the said partie, as he should haue done with his owne proper Bill of Exchange; and whereas the value should be mentioned to be receiued of the second man, that did deliuer him the money, he causeth both of them to be named in the Bill, and sometimes three or foure are named in the said Bill (if it be so often rechanged) by saying, For the value receiued of such a man for such a man and such a man, vpon the account of such a man. This is good at all assaies, for the reuerence which is borne to Bills of Exchanges, and by these meanes there is charges and facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge saued between the parties: besides the commodiousnesse, that one man doth writ and send this Bill of Exchange for all those that did change and rechange there the said money, which is not done all in one summe, and with one Bill of Exchange; but the summe may be made vp by many Bills of Exchange payable all to that man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be by diuers persons: such and the like courses are dayly vsed and practised beyond the seas without interruption in matter of Exchange, which may seeme to be intricate.</p>
               <p>This course of dealing is altogether strange to the common laws of England, and cannot be determined thereby. For whereas (with the aduice of Merchants) some matters vpon Bills of Exchanges haue beene tried vpon an Action of Assumpsit, here is neither considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nor Assumpsit to be proued, vnlesse the Bill had beene accepted, wherein are many obseruations.</p>
               <p>To make this more apparant therefore, let vs illustrate this by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Peter</hi> deliuereth fiue hundreth pounds to <hi>Iohn,</hi> who is to giue the Bill of Exchange for it; <hi>Peter</hi> taketh vp fiue hundreth pounds of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:14410:206"/>
                  <hi>William,</hi> and may giue him the said Bill of <hi>Iohn</hi> for it; <hi>William</hi> taketh vp fiue hundreth pounds of <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and may deliuer <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> Bill for it; <hi>Nicholas</hi> taketh vp fiue hundreth pounds of <hi>Francis,</hi> &amp; doth giue him the Bill of <hi>Iohn,</hi> making mention of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>William.</hi> Here are foure takers vp of money, and but effectually one deliuerer of money, which is <hi>Francis</hi>: for albeit that <hi>Peter</hi> was the first deliuerer of the fiue hundreth pounds, he became a taker againe of the said money, receiuing the same of <hi>William</hi>; so that <hi>gradatim, Iohn</hi> is the first taker vp of the said fiue hundreth pounds, <hi>Peter</hi> is the second taker vp, <hi>William</hi> is the third taker vp, and <hi>Nicholas</hi> is the fourth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker vp of the said fiue hundreth pounds of <hi>Francis.</hi> To this <hi>Francis</hi> is the Bill of Exchange giuen, payable to his friend, factor, or seruant in the place for which the money was taken vp. But the said Bill is made by <hi>Iohn</hi> the first taker vp of the said money, declaring that the value of it was receiued of <hi>Peter</hi> for <hi>William</hi> and for <hi>Nicholas</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of <hi>Francis,</hi> which is the last deliuerer of the money: which Bill being payed, all the parties in this Exchange are satisfied and paied; and this is done with great facilitie.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There is also a custome, that moneys are taken by Exchange for a certaine place, by men who are not generally knowne, and therefore must vse the credit of another man, as a third person in the Exchange. If this man do subscribe his name to the third or second Bill of Exchange, it is sufficient, and will be duely performed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
               <p n="5">5 It is also ordinarie, that a master to draw money from his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant into his owne hands, or a merchant in the like case from his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, will make a Bill of Exchange payable to some other person, and say in the Bill of Exchange, For the value receiued of such a one, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a friend of his, as he taketh the said person to be; if the seruant or factor do accept this Bill, he will be made to pay it; and if this person whose name hath beene vsed will deale vniustly, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or merchant shall be remedilesse, vnlesse he haue some colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall writing for the same, because the Bill of Exchange must be maintained.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Againe if a knowne seruant do take vp moneys beyond the seas, vpon his master, and giue his Bill of Exchange for it vpon the said master, the master is liable to pay the same, although he did not accept the Bill of Exchange; for it is vnderstood, that by his credit (and not by the seruants credit) the money hath beene taken vp; so that vntill he make a publicke declaration, denouncing his seruant to the Brokers of Exchanges and otherwise, the master is to pay all by the Custome of Merchants to be kept inuiolable.</p>
               <p n="7">7 There is also a custome, that a master vnto his seruant, or one friend vnto another, will send Bills of Exchanges, with the names in blanke, from one countrie into another, as from Hamborough to Embden, or from Antuerpe to Amsterdam, and from thence to Dansicke: and at Amsterdam the names are put in to whom to be
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:14410:206"/>
payed, and of whom receiued; and this dependeth vpon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of him that made the Bill of Exchange, and this is also accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed verie orderly.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Againe a Merchant may take by Exchange (in another mans name, or in his owne name and another mans name together) money to be paied in any place where Exchange is vsed, and subscribe his name, and that mans name, or that mans name alone: and this man (whose name is vsed) is liable and answerable to the said Exchange, if it be proued that it was done, or the like vsed to be done by that other partie with his consent or priuitie, for to auoid inconueniences in the course of Exchanges.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Nay this goeth yet further to be considered of in equitie and so adiudged, that if a man do take vp money for any place by Exchange <hi>posito,</hi> from London to Middleborough, and there the money is payed, and taken vp againe by Exchange for Antuerpe, and there it is also paied by money taken vp for Amsterdam, and at Amsterdam it is pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the said money was taken vp there againe for Middleborough, and at Middleborough it was againe returned and taken vp for Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in one or more summes running in account betweene all these parties dealing therein; but here at London it is not paied, but goeth backe againe to Middleborough by Protest, and there the taker vp of it becommeth insoluent. Now if it be proued that those moneys were originally taken vp in London by the credit of that first taker, which hath beene a principall cause of the continuance of it by Exchange, this man of London is to be charged with it as well as the taker vp of the moneys beyond the seas. Thus may we see how tender and noble a Bill of Exchange is of nature, which by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thereupon will be made more apparant. (<g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>)</p>

               <p>These twelue obseruations, are to be kept and maintained by the Custome of Merchants, concerning Bills of Exchanges, as carefully and seriously as the Romanes did their Law of twelue Tables so much celebrated by them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:14410:208"/>There happened of late a case worthy the consideration for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Exchange:<note place="margin">A case about Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes which were accepted.</note> A Merchant of Antuerp being indebted vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Merchant there, did deliuer seuerall Bills of Exchanges for the summe of 800 <abbr>ll</abbr> vpon a Merchant in London, who did accept all the said Bils of Exchanges, which were payable at Vsance and double Vsance; after this the Merchant that gaue the said Bills in Antuerp to the other Merchant, did breake: heereupon the Merchant at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (repenting himselfe to haue accepted the said Bills) maketh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation by a Notarie to the parties to whom the Bills were paiable, that hee did not intend to pay the said Bills, because the partie bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Antuerp had not receiued the value of the money of the other Merchant there; although the Bills of Exchanges did acknowledge the receit, for the Bills were giuen vpon accounts betweene them, which were to be made vp, and hee was not to cleere their accounts, and the partie broken did owe vnto him farre greater summes. The parties at London answered the Notarie, that they looked to bee payed according to the acceptation of the Bills of Exchanges, and for other matters they had nothing to doe therewith. <hi>Interim,</hi> the partie at London who had accepted the Bills dyed, and so all the Bills returned Protested, and the matter rested vndetermined: but the opinion of other Merchants and my owne is, That the acceptor of the Bills was to pay them, and his heires and executors are lyable thereunto, vnlesse there were found an apparant combination and practise in it betweene the two Merchants of Antuerp, as was by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suspected.

                  <note place="margin">Commodities to be deliuered by a day.</note>For commodities bought or sold, to be deliuered at or before such a day, it is not sufficient to make Intimation and to tender the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities before the day; but it must also bee done vpon the last day, and to take witnesse of it: and if the commodities be not of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that they ought to be by the contract or bargaine made, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse for some causes you doe not hold conuenient to refuse them; let there be made a Notariall Instrument or Act concerning the defectiuenesse of the commodities, with a protestation of your intention to recouer all your damages and losses sustained or like to be sustained thereby, which will be verie auailable vnto you vpon all occasions. This is much obserued beyond the Seas, especially vpon the ladings of Ships which are to take in the same, or else may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre a further danger vnto the Charter-partie of fraightment.

as you did vnderwrite the said Bill or Bond: yet ciuilitie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a kind of Intimation and demaund, which is the reason that by the Ciuile Law, although a Bill haue a time limited for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet if the same be thirtie yeares old, and hath beene neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, it is void of course, and cannot be recouered by that law.

               <p>If a Bill of Exchange (by contrarie wind, or other occasions) be so long vpon the way, that the Vsance, or the time limited by the Bill be expired, and being presented to the partie for the payment, he will not pay the same, then the Notarie doth make the Protest, both for the non-acceptation, and for the non-payment, reciting the Bill of Exchange <hi>verbatim.</hi> And moreouer he calleth vnto him some sworne Broker of Exchange,<note place="margin">The maner of payment of a Protested Bills.</note> to know how the price of Exchange runneth at Vsance for the place where the money was taken vp, and he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of it a declaration in the Protest, according vnto which, it must

By this agreement or contract, the said two Merchants do agree and conclude betweene them a set or Positiue price of Exchange, as well for Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, as for Antuerpe, whereby the ducat of Venice shall be rated at so many pence Flemish for the money which is receiued at Antuerp, or the pound Flemish may be valued in sterling money after a rate, and the ducat of Venice likewise. And hereupon they do cleere their accounts betweene them once a yeare accordingly, which sometimes is done with allowance of interest for the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Accidentall Reciprocall Exchanges on the contrarie are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine in their price,<note place="margin">Accidentall Exchanges in price.</note> and alter from time to time as the course of Exchange runneth: As for example, <hi>A. B.</hi> calleth vnto him a Broker of Exchanges, and telleth him, that he hath occasion to take vp one thousand ducats for Venice, and that he is to make ouer the said mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for Antuerpe, and will know the price for both places: the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker answereth, that he will effect the same, and that the price of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice is fiftie and six pence for the ducat, and for Antuerpe thirtie and three shillings Flemish for the pound sterling: and presently after he commeth to <hi>A.B.</hi> the Merchant againe, and telleth him, that <hi>C.D.</hi> the Merchant is contented to deliuer him the thousand ducats for Venice, and to take vp the same for him againe for Antuerpe either at the same prices, or thereabouts. These thousand ducats at fiftie six pence do amount to two hundreth thirtie and three pounds six shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and eight pence sterling, for which <hi>C. D.</hi> giueth Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes for Antuerpe to be paied there at Vsance, which is one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths time from the date of the Bills after the rate of thirtie three shillings Flemish for twenty shillings, or one pound sterling: and <hi>A.B.</hi>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:14410:211"/>
giueth his Bills of Exchanges Reciprocally to <hi>C. D.</hi> for the thousand ducats to be paied at Venice at Vsance, which is three moneths after the date of the said Bills: and here is no money paied on either side at London, and yet the Bills of Exchanges say the vsuall words (for the value receiued of each other) according to their agreement, and both parties send their Bills of Exchanges for the aforesaid places. Not long after, it falleth out, that the Bill of Exchange that <hi>C. D.</hi> gaue for Antuerpe commeth backe againe by Protest for the non-accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and not long after that, another Protest for the non-payment of the said Bill. Hereupon <hi>A.B.</hi> commeth or sendeth to <hi>C. D.</hi> for to haue satisfaction for this Bill of Exchange deliuered him for Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerpe, and <hi>C. D.</hi> giueth him full satisfaction of it, with the rechange and charges according to the said customes, if he be a substantiall man of credit and reputation: for although the said <hi>C. D.</hi> was the first deliuerer of the money vnto <hi>A. B.</hi> by the thousand ducats for Venice, and might alleage that hee receiued no money of him, but a Bill of Exchange for Venice, whereof hee had no aduice whether it were accepted or not; yet such is the precise and commendable Custome vsed in Exchanges, that hee may not stand vpon any euasions or alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which might interrupt the said course without manifest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit vnto him, vnlesse there were cause of doubt that the Bills of Exchanges of <hi>A. B.</hi> should not bee accomplished at Venice; neither may <hi>A. B.</hi> (without discredit) countermand the payment of the thousand Ducats at Venice, vnlesse there were iust cause to call the credit of <hi>C. D.</hi> in question. For the manner of these Exchanges are vsuall in all the places of great Exchanges, as Lyons, Bizanson, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drill and Venice, where the most standing Bankes are, and where they doe get money ingeniously by the calculation vpon their pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the Faires or Markets, by intermissiue times either twice or thrice within the yeare; in regard whereof, and to auoid this obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in that strictnesse, they haue vsed to say in their Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, <hi>Per la Valuta Cambiata,</hi> for the value exchanged with such a one,<note place="margin">The value of money ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed.</note> and not for the value receiued as aforesaid, because they make their paiments (as it were) all at one time, which is otherwise in those places where no Bankes are kept, or may be also in some of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if the money be payable without the Banke, as we haue noted before.</p>
               <p>Many Merchants trafficking onely in Exchanges become good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers, and as ingenious as the Bankers themselues, according to the Adage <hi>Fabricando fabri fimus,</hi> whereby they know the variation of their Compasse, and the points to direct their course by, obseruing the Accidentall causes of great payments of moneys to be made in some places, and of imployment to be made vpon commodities in some other places, or the scarcitie of money for some places, and the plentie for other places, or the generalitie of both, calling it as the Spaniards say <hi>La placa e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:14410:211"/>
streame) can make their Exchanges beneficiall vnto themselues, and that without Stocke or Capitall of their owne; but meerely by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vp money for one place, and deliuering the same for another place, at an vndervalue in the price of Exchange: sending many times the moneys <hi>in specie,</hi> which haue beene taken vp by Exchange, when the same doth yeeld more than the price at which they tooke vp the same; as in our precedent Treatise hath beene declared more amplie.</p>
               <p>This orderly course of payment or satisfaction to be made for Bills of Exchanges, doth admit no rescounter or stoppage, but voluntarie,<note place="margin">Rescounter in Exchange is voluntarie.</note> that is to say, If I owe you one hundreth pounds by a Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change by mee accepted, and within three or foure dayes you shall owe mee the like hundreth pounds for another Bill of Exchange by you accepted; I cannot rescounter these payments to answere each other, vnlesse you condescend thereunto, although the money were due to be payed; but euerie Bill of Exchange is to bee answered and payed in his proper nature. For let vs suppose that some counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be made by him that caused this money to be made ouer vnto you, before you were to pay the said Bill, which (for some causes) you are to conceale for a time, you are for all that to be payed of your hundreth pounds, or the diligences which are requisite to bee done herein, are both wayes to be obserued accordingly. But when it is done by voluntarie consent and agreement, then is it question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; for <hi>Voluntas est mensura actionum,</hi>

               <p>For the better explanation of Exchanges for moneys, taken vp for one place, and deliuered againe for another place, let vs obserue this example.</p>

                  <p>For the better explanation of the premisses, let vs remember the description of a Banke heretofore declared,<note place="margin">Payments in Banke limited.</note> and therein obserue that great power and commaund which is giuen them by the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, to incorporate moneys by the meanes of Exchanges, making it to become a merchandise, and to ouerrule the course of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.</p>
                  <p>Some men are of opinion, that the price of Exchanges are made by an indifferent course, because the Bankers at the time of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Exchanges in the principall places (as Lyons in France, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drill and other places in Spaine, Florence and Genoa in Italie, Bizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and other places elsewhere) haue a meeting, and by certaine tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets in writing euerie man doth deliuer his opinion, what the price of Exchange ought to be for all places then exchanging for the next Faire, or time of payment. And according to the same the calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cast vp by the <hi>Medium,</hi> that is to say,<note place="margin">Exchanges cast vp by the <hi>Medium.</hi>
                     </note> if there be seuen or more voices or tickets, the said seuen are added together, and the seuenth part is the <hi>Medium</hi>; if there be ten, then the same being cast vp, the tenth part is the <hi>Medium,</hi> and so for greater or lesser numbers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. But these men are ignorant of the Bankers obseruations, for they all know how the plentie of money lyeth by Exchanges, and they concur in making the price for their aduantage, and so iumpe all to one end vpon the imaginarie moneys before declared, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the maine ocean of Exchanges, wherein the Exchanges of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land are swallowed vp as a little riuer or braunch of the same, taking still aduantage vpon our fine moneys and staple wares to glut vs with their forreine commodities at deere rates.

               <head>CHAP. X. Of the true reformation of Exchanges.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S of all things and in all humane actions, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, progresse, continuance, and termination or end is to be obserued, for the better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so by comparing them often to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple &amp; originall, not onely the disgression of it is made apparant, but also the longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the same estate, is thereby procured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them againe to their first integritie and goodnesse. For there was neuer any thing by the wit of man so well deuised, or so sure esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, which in continuance of time hath not beene corrupted: so that the matter of Exchange being made a merchandise, requireth this consideration for the reducing thereof to his first principle and foundation, which is the intrinsique value of coynes of countrie and countries according to weight and finenesse, albeit the price thereof in Exchange doth rise and fall according to scarcitie or plentie of money, proceeding of the few or many deliuerers and takers thereof in the course of trafficke, not by commodities only, but also by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes deuised vpon moneys, in nature of merchandise.</p>
               <p>Herein are the three essentiall parts of trafficke (so often named) to be considered iointly and diuidedly for the good and welfare of common-weales,<note place="margin">The generall benefit to be preferred &amp;c.</note> and not for the benefit of particular or few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. For albeit that the generall is composed of the particular, yet it may fall out, that the particular will breed a great inconuenience to the generall, whereby priuate persons may reape a benefit to the hurt of a multitude, or the whole common-wealth, in nature of some Monopolies heretofore declared, which may as well happen by ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance as by premeditated practise.</p>
               <p>For to speake ingeniously, Merchants cannot enter into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the quantitie of forreine commodities imported at deere rates, and the natiue commodities at lesser rates exported, respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of former times; by the disportation whereof, commeth an euident ouerballancing of commodities. Merchants do not regard whether the moneys of a kingdome are vnderualued in Exchange
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:14410:215"/>
by the inhauncing of forreine coyne in other countries, whereby our moneys are exported, and forreine coyne or bullion cannot be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported but at an exceeding losse. Lastly Merchants do not know the weight and finenesse of the moneys of each countrie, and the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obserued betweene gold and siluer, nor the seuerall differences of standards of moneys of gold and siluer, a matter so necessarie for them to know, to driue a profitable trade, as by this booke they may now vnderstand for the common good. Princes and Gouernours therefore are to direct them according to the lawes, wherin the Law-Merchant must be the true guide and directer.</p>
               <p>This direction must as well be established vpon the coyne of other nations, as vpon the moneys of the kingdome, because the payments of Bills of Exchanges beyond the seas are made by seuerall coynes vpon the valuation made thereof, at the pleasure of Princes, wherby sometimes the moneys of the realme are not proportionably valued according to the moneys of other countries, which are therby diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted also to be imported vnto vs: For example, let vs take the valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aforesaid made in the vnited Prouinces during the gouernment of the Earle of Leicester, at which time the Royall of eight was valued at fortie and two stiuers, and the Rickx Doller of the Empire and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so their owne Doller at fortie and fiue stiuers, and the English shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (at twelue pence here) being there valued at ten stiuers made twentie shillings sterling, to be by Exchange thirtie three shillings and foure pence, as a <hi>Par pro pari,</hi> or value for value. The like for Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough at twentie foure shillings and nine pence, as hath beene no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now fiue Royalls of eight which is at fortie two stiuers thirtie fiue shillings, are valued at fortie two shillings and six pence, that is to say, at fiftie one stiuers, and yet the Exchange is taken still at the said rate, according to which calculation the said Royall of eight is by vs receiued at fiue shillings and two pence, which is but foure shillings 2 ½ pence, or thereabouts.
The difference is fifteene vpon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth in lesse than two moneths time: adde hereunto the ten in the hundreth to be had by the said Royalls of eight, that the same are better in weight and finenesse than our six pence sterling, which is taken to answere the said Royall by a common calculation, by reason whereof there will be giuen so much in his maiesties mint, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, that is to say, foure shillings and fiue pence, or at the least foure shillings and foure pence ½, after the rate of fiue shillings sterling, for an ounce of that standard; so together is twentie fiue vpon the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth benefit,<note place="margin">A treatise of Free trade 1622.</note> which caused a Merchant aduenturer to set downe in print an interrogation in this manner: <q>Who will procure licence in Spaine to bring Realls into England to sell them here at tenne in the hundreth gaine, which is lesse than the Exchange from thence will yeeld, when he may haue for the same 25 in the 100 in Holland?</q> A matter whereby Merchants are easily induced to diuert the said Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls from the realme to those and other countries, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vnderstanding to remedie the same, it is thought there is no
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:14410:215"/>
meanes to meete with forreine nations in the inhancing of moneys, but wee must doe the like, albeit experience hath shewed long since that this is not effectuall nor any true remedie. Now if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider things according to the rule aforesaid, it will plainely appeare that the said fifteene vpon the hundred gaine, more than in England, are but imaginarie, if the Exchange for moneys were reformed: for let fiue of these Royalls of eight bee bought in England for twentie two shillings, and be transported into Holland, and there buy commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities with the same (which is according as the price of them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanced, for as the money riseth in price, so doth the price of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) it may fall out the said Merchants should become losers by the commodities, so that the same cannot be termed <hi>Causa mouens</hi>: But the Spanish Merchants, which cause their Royalls to be sent into Holland or Zealand, from Spaine or from the Downes, relye wholly vpon the Low-Exchange, whereby they are inabled to deliuer there their money by Exchange at an vndervalue, at thirtie three shillings foure pence Flemish and vnder, for our twentie shillings sterling, whereby the Kingdome maketh good vnto them the said fifteen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hundreth, consisting betweene the price of fortie two stiuers, and fiftie one stiuers, which is almost eighteene <hi>pro</hi> hundreth. If the Royall went but for fiftie stiuers according to the valuation, so that if the Exchange were made accordingly, which would be aboue thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie seuen shillings six pence, this gaine would not be at all, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys would be imported vnto vs, and not exported.</p>
               <p>For the rule is infallable,<note place="margin">A Maxime in Exchanges.</note> That when the Exchange answereth the true value of moneys, according to their intrinsicke weight and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and their extrinsicke valuation; they are neuer exported, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the said gaine is answered by Exchange, which is the cause of transportation. To make this euident in the Rickx Doller, which is the maine and most vsuall coyne in Germanie, Eastland, the Vnited and Reconciled Low-countreys before their late Proclamations, and currant in many other Countreys: obserue wee, that the said Doller was valued at two markes Lubish,<note place="margin">A shilling Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish, and a sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Flemish was all one 1575.</note> euery marke being sixteene shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings Lubish, or sixteene stiuers. For in the yeare 1575 the said Rickx Doller was still coyned in the Empire for thirtie two shillings or stiuers, and so currant by valuation in the Low-countreys, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were all one in denomination and effect: But the wars in the Low-countreys hath beene the cause of the inhancing of this Doller, which was brought to thirtie fiue stiuers, and in the yeare 1586 to fortie fiue stiuers, or to fiftie two stiuers now by intermissiue valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and times. Howbeit at Hamborough, Stoade, and other places in Germanie, the said Doller did remaine still at thirtie two shillings Lubish, or two markes: and as the said Doller did inhance in price, so did they in the Low-countreys coyne new stiuers accordingly; sometimes lighter in weight,<note place="margin">A great Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> and at other times imbased by Copper or Allay, and yet in account the stiuer did and doth remaine the ground of all their moneys: but the said Doller holdeth his standard
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14410:216"/>
agreeable to the first Doller, called the Burgundian Doller with Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> Crosse, coyned in the yeare 1567, which is in finenesse ten ounces twelue pennie weight of fine Siluer: and foure and one halfe of these Dollers were made equiuolent to our twentie shillings ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as a publike measure betweene vs and the Low-countreys, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, and other places where this Doller went currant, as you may obserue in the precedent Chapters.</p>
               <p>These Dollers haue since beene imitated and made by the States of the Vnited Prouinces in their seuerall Mints, altering onely the Armes of the seuerall Prouinces; as also by the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus</hi> in the reconciled Low Prouinces, and the price of them at Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, Stoad and other places was but aduanced to one stiuer or shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Lubish more, that is to say, at thirtie three shillings Lubish went, the same went in the Low-countreys for fortie fiue stiuers, which made the diuersitie of the said Par of Exchanges of thirtie three shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings foure pence for the Low-countreys, and twentie foure shillings nine pence for Hamborough,<note place="margin">In the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands.</note> being all one in substance. This Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is since that time (as I said) inhaunced to fiftie two stiuers in the Low-countreys, which maketh the price of Exchange aboue thirtie eight shillings, or rather thirtie nine shillings, and shall the Kingdome suffer this and not alter our price of Exchange accordingly, but be contented to take thirtie foure or thirtie fiue shillings, and after that rate vndersell all the commodities of the Realme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">In Germanie.</note>This Doller is likewise since that time more inhaunced in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, from time to time. And leauing the excessiue valuation in remote places, let vs note the valuation of Hamborough, where it hath beene at fiftie foure stiuers the Doller, which maketh the Exchange aboue fortie shillings of their money for our twentie shillings. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we haue raised our price of Exchange, from twentie shillings nine pence, to thirtie fiue shillings and thereabouts, shall we rest here and goe no further? Haue we reason to doe it in part, and not in the whole, according to Iustice, Equitie, and true Policie: and shall we be like a man that by halting in jeast became lame in earnest? <hi>Absic ignorantia.</hi>

               <p>The moneys in Christendome, which haue their ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doe shew their operation vpon commodities,<note place="margin">The course of money and Exchange, are contraties in operation.</note> maketh by plentie the price thereof deare, or by scarsitie better cheape, as hath beene noted: but Exchange hath a contrarie meane of working, for plentie of money maketh a low Exchange, and scarsitie of money maketh a high Exchange and the price to rise, which is of great consideration; because it ouerruleth money and commodities, which neuer entred in the politicke studies of <hi>Aristotle, Seneca,</hi> or <hi>Cicero,</hi> who were but in the infancie of Trade. And Ciuilians can tell vs that <hi>Commercium,</hi> is <hi>quasi Commutatio Mercium,</hi> but went no further in this iust and prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly studie of State affaires, to augment, by all lawfull meanes of <hi>Ius gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> the wealth of their Kingdomes and Territories; as also to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the diminution thereof, by the carrying away of their moneys

               <p>Heere wee are to obserue the Statute of employment to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue, when Merchants (both English and strangers) haue an abilitie giuen them by Exchange to take vp money here, and to deliuer a Bill of Exchange for it payable beyond the Seas, and can send ouer the money <hi>in specie</hi> and bee a great gainer thereby: insomuch that if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue here one hundreth peeces of twentie shillings, I can send nintie peeces to pay my Bill of Exchange, and put ten peeces in my pocket for an ouerplus and gaine.</p>
               <p>The like may bee done by making ouer money from beyond the seas to be payed here by Exchange, which being receiued, I can trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with 15 vpon the hundreth gaines in two moneths and lesse, and aduance a hundreth vpon the hundreth in one yeare, which exceedeth all the benefit to be made by commodities, wherewith I need not to intermeddle, neither can the said statute be any helpe herein to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die the same.</p>
               <p>This gaine ariseth by the vnderualuation of our moneys, in regard of the inhancing and ouerualuation of forreine coynes, so that the cause is extrinsique, and comprised vnder the said Exchange of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and not intrinsique in the weight and finenes of moneys, which are considered in the course of true Exchange betweene vs and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine nations: and thereupon it followeth, that neither difference of weight, finenesse of standard, proportion betweene gold and siluer, or their proper valuation of moneys can be any true cause of the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our moneys, so long as a due course is held in the Exchange which is grounded thereupon.</p>
               <p>Hence ariseth the facilitie of the remedie by the refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

also (in effect) that the forreine coynes beyond the seas are not taken in payment aboue their values, although they be receiued at a higher rate, because the commodities of the realme are sold according to the price of Exchange, which counteruaileth the same according to their inhauncing of coynes, or imbasing of the same by allay or copper.</p>
               <p>All men of common vnderstanding, when they do heare of the raising of moneys beyond the seas, are readie to say, We must do the like. For they conceaue the saying of <hi>Cato, Tu quoque fac simile, sic Ars deluditur Arte,</hi> to be a proper application hereunto. But they do not enter into consideration what alterations it would bring to the State, and that the matter might run <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> as shall be declared.</p>
               <p>But let vs suppose, that this will be a sufficient remedie to inhance or moneys, as they do theirs, to imbase our coynes as they do theirs, and to imitate ouerualuation of gold and siluer as they do, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a continuall labour, charges, and innouation. Is it not an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent thing, that all this can be done by the course of Exchange with great facilitie? and that without inhauncing of our moneys at home, or medling with the weight and finenesse of the sterling stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd; this is to be done onely by his maiesties proclamation, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the statut of Exchanges, Prohibiting that after three moneths next insuing the same, no man shall make any Exchanges by Bills or otherwise, for moneys to be paied in forreine parts, or to be rechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged towards this realme, vnder the true <hi>Par,</hi> or value for value of our moneys, and the moneys of other countries in weight and finenesse, but at the said rate, or aboue the same, as Merchants can agree by the meanes of Brokers, or amongst themselues,<note place="margin">The way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands wealth.</note> but neuer vnder the said rate, which shall be declared in a paire of tables publickely to be seene vpon the royall Exchange in London, according to the said procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: and the said tables shall be altered in price, as occasions shall be ministred beyond the seas, in the seuerall respectiue places of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, either by their inhauncing of moneys by valuation, or by imbasing of the same by allay, as hath beene noted; which by a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant eye may be obserued, and will be a cause to make other nations more constant in the course of their moneys: and this will be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more of course than by authoritie, because gaine doth beare the sway and commaund with most men.</p>
               <p>For the Merchant Stranger being here the deliuerer of money ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, will easily be induced to make the most of his owne, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing by Exchange more for our moneys beyond the seas: and the English Merchant (being the taker of the said moneys) will not be so in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>urious to the State, as to giue lesse beyond the seas than the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of our money in Exchange, contrarie to the said proclamation: and if he would, the deliuerer will not let him haue it. Besides that the takers occasions are inforced by necessitie, and he can be no looser; for by direction, he will sell his commodities beyond the seas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, because the price of Exchange doth still gouerne the
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:14410:218"/>
sale and buying of commodities, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>English Merchants being the deliuerers of the moneys beyond the seas, and the price of Exchange altering there accordingly, will haue the like consideration, and the Merchant Stranger will prouoke him thereunto: and if there be no takers, the English Merchant may bring ouer the money <hi>in specie,</hi> wherein he shall become againer.</p>
               <p>The course is agreeable to justice and the law of nations, or <hi>ius gentium,</hi> and will not hinder the Exchange to rise and fall, as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but keepe all in due order, with these considerations, cautions, and preuentions as shall be set downe to preuent all inconueniencies proceeding by the inhauncing of moneys, which fall generally vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men in the endearing of things,<note place="margin">Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauncing of coynes.</note> &amp; particularly vpon land-lords and creditors in their rents and contracts, and especially vpon the king maiesties lands.</p>
               <p>The statute of Imployment must also be obserued, to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie more compleate, with a Register to record the moneys which forreine mariners do receiue for fraight, comming from Norway and other places, making aboue one hundreth voyages yearely; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so many other ships bringing corn into the Northerne and Westerne parts of the real me, and exporting moneys for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obiections to the remedie.</note>The obiections made by some against this sole remedie are easily to be answered, for they are grounded vpon suppositions against assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red experience.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Some make doubt that the price of Exchange being risen, there will be no takers of money, and then the deliuerer is more thrust vpon the exportation of moneys.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Others say, that those Merchants which haue sold their cloth beyond the seas shall receiue a losse in the making ouer of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys from thence, by deliuering more there in Exchange than now they do.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Others say, that they shall not be able to vent their clothes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the high Exchange, especially now that cloth is out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; and would haue the matter of reformation deferred vntill an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time, in their opinions more commodious.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Answeres.</note>The first obiection is answered before, That the taker is ruled by the deliuerer, who will not giue his money in Exchange vnder the true value, according to the proclamation to be made, and the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer being the Merchant Stranger here, will sooner be thrust vpon the statute of Employment, for by the exportation of money, he shall haue no gaine; whereas some of the discreeter sort would not haue
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:14410:218"/>
the said statute too strictly pressed vpon the stranger, because the trade should not be driuen into their hands, <hi>Mediocria firma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the second, the Proclamation (limiting a time for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) giueth Merchants abilitie to recouer their moneys, or to sell their Bills of debts for money, or to buy commodities for them, as the manner is.</p>
               <p>To the third, experience maketh a full answere to both, that there did not want takers, when the late inhauncing at Hambo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough caused the Exchange to rise from vnder twentie and eight shillings to aboue thirtie and fiue shillings, which is more than the present alteration will be: and Wooll was at thirtie and three shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the Tod, which is now fallen vnder twentie shillings; so that the vent of our Cloth was not hindered, when it was sold deerer by one full third part; but there was aboue eightie thousand Clothes sold yearely, where there is now sold but fortie thousand Clothes. The time is also to be thought more conuenient to aduance a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie, being vnderualued, than to do it when the price is high: for this plurisie of the common-wealth is dangerous, and admitteth no time of curing, like the fire in a citie, which permitteth not any inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to examine how the same began, but requireth euerie mans help to quench the same.</p>
               <p>And wheras it is alledged in the defence of the inhancing of coine,<note place="margin">Treatise of Free trad, <hi>E.M.</hi>
                  </note> That which is equall to all (when he that buyes deere shall sell deere) cannot be said to be iniurious vnto any.</p>
               <p>This opinion is without consideration of the alteration of Weights and Measures betweene vs and other nations, that is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for moneys, and what the same may produce to the losse of the common-wealth, albeit that betweene man and man it may proue alike in some respects.</p>
               <p>To make this euident, Suppose two Merchants, the one dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in London, and the other dwelling at Amsterdam, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract together, that the Londoner sending Clothes to bee sold at Amsterdam, the Merchant of Amsterdam sendeth him Veluets and Silkes to bee sold at London: and (in the account to be kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them) they agree to reckon the moneys in Exchange but at thirtie shillings Flemish, for twentie shillings sterling, and so make returne each to other from time to time, as moneys shall bee receiued both heere and beyond the seas. Whereupon put the case, that there is receiued at Amsterdam one thousand and fiue hundreth pounds Flemish for Cloth, and at London there is receiued one thousand pounds sterling for Veluets and Silkes, which according to the said computation is all one in effect betweene them, and might by way of rescounter answere each other in account. But the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of Amsterdam knowing that (by reason of the inhauncing of the moneys there) he can make a great gaine to haue the said one thousand pounds to be sent vnto him <hi>in specie,</hi> he desireth the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner to send vnto him this one thousand pounds sterling in siluer
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:14410:219"/>
or gold coynes, Royalls of eight, or Rickx dollers, whereby he shall profit fifteene vpon the hundred by the meanes aforesaid, which amounteth to one hundreth and fiftie pound gaines. Now the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doner hauing his one thousand and fiue hundreth pounds Flemish, or one thousand pounds sterling at Amsterdam, cannot do the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the money by the said inhauncing is receiued there aboue the value, so that his money must be deliuered there by Exchange at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie three shillings foure pence, or vnder, wherby he receiueth here the said 1500 <abbr>ll</abbr> Flemish with no gaine at all. Thus the account is made euen betweene them: but by these meanes the kingdome is depriued of the 1000 <abbr>ll</abbr> of the Merchants money sent to Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, which doth not onely procure want of our moneys, but causeth also the natiue commodities to be vndersold, and the forreine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be aduanced in price beyond the seas by plentie of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney there, and hindreth the importation of bullion.</p>
               <p>To preuent this, the question is now, Whether it be better and more expedient to raise the price of Exchange, or the valuation of our moneys? Surely all men of iudgement will say, That the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Exchange breedeth not that alteration which the inhaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of moneys doth, to make euerie thing deere, and to cause land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords and creditors to loose in their rents and contracts. And Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of experience do know, that wee cannot do as they do: for the inhauncing of our moneys here will be countermined by other nations, who still will vnderualue them in Exchange betweene vs, vnlesse it be preuented by our owne true valuation to be made known as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>The Author of this Treatise of Free trade doth say, <hi>That it is not the rate of Exchanges,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 104.</note> 
                  <hi>but the value of Moneys, heere low, elsewhere high which cause their exportation, nor do the Exchanges, but the plentie and scarcitie of moneys cause their values,</hi> which is meerely <hi>Histeron proteron,</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I haue answered heretofore, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </gap> money.</note>If moneys be here low and elsewhere high, how is this knowne but by the valuation of Exchange? considering the diuersities of moneys of seueral standards, wherein the Exchange is like the Assay, whereby the finesse of gold and siluer is knowne, grounded vpon the quantitie which the Exchange requireth, according to the weight of fine siluer &amp; gold contained in the moneys of each countrie, which is the intrinsick value, &amp; not according to extrinsicke valuation, which is altered by denomination, for the name of a thing doth not alter the value really, but the substance doth it, if it be altred; much lesse doth plenty or scarcity of monie cause their values, it being contrary to the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:14410:219"/>
nature and propertie of money; the yeard doth measure the cloth, but the cloth doth not measure the yeard. To illustrate the premisses by example I haue heretofore shewed the consideration incident.</p>
               <p>Suppose that some Merchants strangers doe come ouer into the Realme to buy a packe of tenne clothes, valued at 80 <abbr>ll</abbr> sterling, which they are to pay in gold and siluer, and they doe not know the weight and finenes of their forraine coyne which they haue brought ouer; heereupon to content both parties, the moneys on either side must be tried by the subtle assay, according to their finenes computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the pound weight of twelue ounces Troy, and then (by weight) they answere each other accordingly. And so this negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is (in effect) but a permutation of moneys for commodities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Exchange was inuented.</p>
               <p>Hetherto we haue handled of the reformation of Exchanges, for places where the Basis of Exchange or foundation is made vpon our twentie shillings sterling, that is to say, When Merchants beyond the Seas (deliuering moneys there for England) will cause the Brokers of Exchanges to know how much Flemish or Hamborough money Merchants will giue there, to haue twentie shillings sterling payed in England, euen as wee doe here to know how much in Flemish money or other coynes a Merchant will giue for the said twentie shillings here,<note place="margin">Exchanges which are made vpon forrain coyne.</note> by an agreement to bee paied beyond the Seas by Bill of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change. But now we are to intreate of the reformation of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes which are made vpon forraine coynes, or rather imaginarie moneys of other countreys: as for France vpon the French Crowne of sixtie soulz; for the East countreys vpon the Florin Polish; for Germanie vpon the Rickx Doller of seuentie two Creutzers; for Venice vpon their Ducat, and so for other places, as in the former Chapters we haue noted.</p>
               <p>Herein let vs obserue that the course of it is directly opposite; for whereas in the one we doe procure to haue much money, or at the value answered by Exchange: so in the other wee may doe the like, and rather procure lesse to bee giuen in Exchange, because that the foundation of those Exchanges is made vpon forraine coyne.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse consider wee, that when foure Testons or three Franks <hi>in specie</hi> were calculated for the said Crowne of sixtie soulz in Exchange; then euerie such Teston was fifteene soulz by valuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and euerie such Frank was twentie soulz. But since that time the said peeces of Testons are made currant for 16 ½ soulz, and the Franks at twentie two soulz, being the same in weight and finenesse, without any alteration in the standard called, <hi>Le Pied de la Monoye,</hi> but onely inhaunced in valuation, according to which, payments are made in siluer coynes. Also for the gold coynes, as French Crownes and Pistolets, which are inhanced at times vntill 72 soulz' from 60 soulz, wherupon the said Crown was valued at six shillings sterling; Is there any man of iudgement that will giue (if hee can choose) sixe shillings, or seuentie two pence, and 72 ½ pence, for the said French
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:14410:220"/>
Crowne in Exchange, when the Crowne <hi>in specie</hi> is paied him in France for seuentie fiue soulz? The like consideration are we to haue of the Dollers of Germanie, of the Polish Guilders or Florins, and all other coynes inhaunced aboue the Par of Exchanges heretofore calculated amongst Merchants, and especially with the admittance of Princes.</p>
               <p>The operation heereof in the course of trafficke, is of verie great moment, more than in times past, when the difference was not so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, which made me to compare the same vnto the serpent <hi>Aspis,</hi> which stingeth men in such sort that they fall into a pleasant sleepe vntill they die; which is meant by particular persons, whose estate is consumed by running vpon Exchanges. Or like vnto the crueltie of the Planet <hi>Saturne,</hi> which maketh his spherecall course in thirtie yeares, with great operation, although wee doe not so sensibly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue his motion, which is meant in the reuolution of State affaires in progresse and continuance of time.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Common Law of England doth not vse the course of Attachments, as is vsed by the Custome of the Citie of London, which was borrowed from Merchants actions obserued in forraine Countreys, and was thereupon by Custome here established; it being a readie way whereby men may secure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of present meanes, if they doubt of their debtor. For if the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor do know any debts or goods belonging vnto his debtor, he may instantly vpon a specialtie to be exhibited vnto the Magistrate, haue authoritie to attach the said debts and goods in the hands of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son where he findeth the same, onely Priuiledged places excepted, or Ecclesiasticall persons in most places.</p>
               <p>To this Attachment, if the partie doe appeare and put in baile, either by himselfe or his Atturney; then the Attachment is <hi>ipso facto,</hi> void, and declaration being put in, dependeth in Court vpon the said baile, and if no declaration bee put in the next Court day, or within
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:14410:220"/>
three dayes, then the said baile is likewise discharged by the said Custome; albeit this is not so duely obserued, as the Customarie Law of Merchants requireth. But if the partie doe not appeare, and the Attachment doe proceed three Court dayes, or three defaults to be entred, then for the fourth default judgement or sentence is giuen, that hee who did make the Attachment shall recouer the said debt and goods, and take the same into his owne possession, vpon good sureties to be put into the Court, to answere the value thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one yeare and a day, in which time the proprietarie may disreason the said recouerie, by disprouing the other parties surmises or allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, prouing that the specialtie was paied whereupon the Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was grounded. For the Attachments beyond the Seas cannot be made vpon any pretended Action, but must bee done vpon a Bill of debt, and many times the Magistrates will sequester the goods or debts into their owne hands, to auoid incertainties of honest dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. Besides, Merchants will be aduised before they make Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, because both the Ciuile Law, and Customes of Merchants doe impose great damages vpon the partie, if hee haue made his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment without iust cause, to the ouerthrow of the other parties credit. And moreouer, if it be vpon debts appearing by specialties or Bills Obligatorie, it may fall out that the said debts are transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or set ouer vnto other Merchants, according to the Custome here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore mentioned, whereby the propertie is altered.</p>
               <p>I remember a case of mine owne, that happened aboue twentie yeares since, which concurreth with the matter in hand: A Merchant being indebted vnto me, by a Bill Obligatorie the summe of 800 <abbr>ll</abbr>, payable at six moneths, was perswaded by a friend of his (with whom I had some differences and controuersies of accounts) to suffer an Attachment to be made in his hands of the said moneys, by the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of London, vpon promise made vnto him, That he would giue him long dayes of payment for the said moneys: whereupon my Debtor appeareth to the said Attachment, and did acknowledge the said debt of 800 <abbr>ll</abbr>, relying vpon the long dayes of paiment, and he that made the Attachment did proceed in the Law, and had judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereupon, making no doubt to obtaine execution accordingly. Being aduised by learned councell in London,<note place="margin">Attachments to be remoued after judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> wee suffered him so farre to proceed, and then we did speake in Arrest of execution, and brought a Writ of <hi>Certiorare</hi> out of the Kings Bench, vnder the hand of the Lord Chiefe Iustice, putting in speciall baile in London to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the judgement. The record was remoued to the said Court of Kings Bench, and there wee did put in other baile, and vpon that brought a <hi>Supersedias</hi> into London, and discharged our especiall baile, and by the Law the said Attachment and all proceedings were made void; and this Merchant was taken, <hi>Pro confesso,</hi> and ordered to bring the money instantly into the Court, whereas he had yet six moneths for the payment; the interest whereof was 40 <abbr>ll</abbr>, whereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe tooke place, <hi>Fallere fallentem non est fraus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="426" facs="tcp:14410:221"/>Here the Law did preuaile against Custome: but in another like matter of attachment, Custome hath preuailed against the Law.</p>
               <p>One being indebted vnto another the summe of one hundreth pounds payable at a certaine time, it came to passe that the Creditor went ouer beyond the Seas before the money was due: the cautelous Debtor, vpon vntrue surmise to defraud the Creditor, made attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this money in his owne hands by the Custome of London, and put in sureties to bee answerable for it for one yeare and a day, according to the manner and order of the Court, in which time the said Creditor was to disreason the said pretended debt; but the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor (being beyond the Seas and ignorant of these proceedings) came ouer after the expiration of the yeare and a day, and the Debtor had judgement vpon the said attachment, and execution awarded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in his owne hands. The Creditor being now come ouer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his money, the other denied to owe him any; in briefe the Bill was put in suit at the Common Law, the Debtor did plead the said judgement and recouerie in London, and by that practise and fraudulent meanes defeated his Creditor: and being done by Law, it is taken to be no cousenage to be punished by the Starre-chamber or other Courts, onely the partie is <hi>A.K.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching Citizens or Merchants arrests beyond the Seas, there is a Custome that no Officer may arrest after Sun set;<note place="margin">No arrest to be alter Sun set.</note> such therefore as goe abroad but at those times, are said to <hi>Fly with the Owle,</hi> by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prouerbe: and it is hoped by the said Custome that the Debtor may (by hauing accesse at some time vnto his Creditor) compound with him, and preserue the good opinion and credit wherein hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and thereby not onely haue meanes to recouer himselfe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be an occasion to gather in his owne debts sooner. In some places also they may not arrest vpon the Sabbath dayes and Holy-dayes, to the end they should not bee depriued of Diuine Seruice towardes God, and comfort of their soules.</p>
               <p>The Officers or Serieants may not arrest any man vpon the Bursse or Royall Exchange, although the partie to be arrested should yeeld thereunto, and renounce the said priuiledge. It is not many yeares since that a Merchant of Amsterdam (being vpon the Exchange at Antuerp) had notice giuen him that another Merchant had giuen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that vpon his going from the Exchange hee should bee arrested, and that the Officer did attend him, being neere at hand; whereupon hee perceiuing the said Officer, called him vnto him, and said, Hee would obey the arrest; which for the first time is but an adiourning or citation: the Officer did require a pledge of a peece of coyne in token thereof (as the manner is) which hee gaue him. Afterwards this Merchant of Amsterdam (being otherwise aduised by his friends) did disclaime from that arrest, because it was done vpon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and claimed the said priuiledge: insomuch that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates and the learned Aduocates on both sides, did thereupon as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble in the Towne-house, as it were the Guild-hall, and there the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:14410:221"/>
matter was debated and discussed at large, according to the lawes. And it was at last concluded and determined, that the said Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest was void in Law: for the renunciation of a Priuiledge by any particular,<note place="margin">The renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge cannot abolish the priuiledge.</note> or many persons, cannot derogate or abrogate any Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome or Priuiledge, not only in the generall, but also in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; so that within twentie and foure houres after he might haue bin arrested againe, but he was <hi>non inuentus,</hi> and vpon this Arrest he was to find caution to answere the law.</p>
               <p>The like is to be vnderstood for all priuiledged places, as Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Chappels, Church-yards, and other places of iurisdictions: and diuers Cities and Towns do not permit any man to be arrested vpon forreine pleas for debts or contracts made in other townes, places, or countries, which are as places of refuge for some Merchants, as the towne of Middleborough in Zealand,<note place="margin">Townes of refuge.</note> and the towne of Dort in Holland, and other cities and townes in other countries, and most cities and towns where a Nation, or a Societie of Merchants do agree to make their residence, as the Companie of Merchants Aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and others, commonly the said cities and townes doe exempt them from all litigious suits which happen betweene themselues, to be determined by their Gouernour or Court master; so as only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies happening betweene them and strangers or inhabitants are subiect to the ordinarie course of the law, for the determination of Merchants differences. They will also free them from all debts ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Kings, Princes, and States, so that the subiects goods shall not be lyable thereunto, to the end that trafficke be not interrupted.</p>
               <p>The Officers or Serieants which make these arrests are knowne by their habite,<note place="margin">Officers knowne by their habits.</note> or by a rod to be seene in their hands, and may not by stealth come vpon a man, wherby many insolencies are preuented, and Serieants are not subiect to be killed, as many times they are with vs. And if they haue not their habits or colours, no man is to assist them if they be abused, and the rescuing of a man then is no offence: and howsoeuer, if a man Arrested, or to be Arrested, do run away, euerie man giueth him way, as desirous to helpe him, to keepe him out of troubles, accounting the Arresting of a man to be a part of the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans office: and neuerthelesse, their hangmen are seene to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in rich apparrell, and are reputed as necessarie members in a common-wealth, whereas in England it is verie contemptible and base.</p>
               <p>Returning to speake againe of Attachments, it is a matter of great consideration with vs, not to admit any to be done either in London, or any other citie or towne corporate,<note place="margin">Attachments to be granted vpon special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> according to the custome of London, vnlesse it be vpon plaine specialties, and also with putting in good sureties for the costs: for it is a verie dangerous thing for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants dwelling beyond the seas, as also Merchants which dwell in remote places of the kingdome, hauing their Factors at London, if they vpon any surmise or pretence of debt shall make secretly any Attachment in their owne hands of their masters goods, either when
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:14410:222"/>
they know their master to be dead, or trauelling in some forreine countries vpon a long voiage, as occasion may fall out, and so by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise deceiue them of their estates, by pleading afterwards the said Attachment or Iudgement had thereupon in bar, as aforesaid.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. Of Sequestrations and Executions.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He magistrates considering, that abuses may be committed many waies by attachments, do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly vse Sequestration of goods by deliuering them into the hands of a third person, or taking of them into their owne custodie or power, for by these meanes also are many attachments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, which men would do, if the disposing of the goods or debts did come into their owne power, wherein they haue a care not to feed the humour of contentious persons, which is meerely contrarie to the course of trade, which is the cause that in the execution of their sentences (wherein the life of the law doth consist) they do proceed <hi>gradatim,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Execution is the Life of the Law.</note> and if any such Sequestration is made vniustly, or without cause, the Ciuile Law, as also the office of Priour and Consulls (hereafter declared) will giue good costs and dammages.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Considerable Executions.</note>In the proceeding of the said Magistrates, there are many persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue meanes vsed by them, in the behalfe of the debtour with the creditor, to bring him to a composition, if not, then some Officers are sent to the parties house to keepe him, as it were, a prisoner, to whom he must giue meat, drinke, lodging, and a daily fee, according to the Iudges appointment, and as the matter may be of moment, to the end that by this pecuniarie punishment, he may cause him to pay or satisfie the creditor, which is aggrauated by sending two Officers at the first, then two more, and so six or eight of them to eate him out of house and home; for these men will gnaw him to the verie bones, and are therefore called Clyuers or Deuourers. But if the debtor will not endure this, and do go wilfully to prison, then the creditor must find the debtor maintenance, at the discretion of the Iudge, who may, if he will, presently put him to bread and water, which is
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:14410:222"/>
seldome or neuer done; but when it is knowne that the partie hath meanes, and will not satisfie his creditor, who (after the imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the person) cannot come vpon the goods againe, according to the common lawes of the realme, then he is to be kept in <hi>Arcta custodia,</hi> with bread and water for a time, at the discretion of the Iudge. But if the debtor be so poore, and notwithstanding hath such a cruell aduersarie that will make dice of his bones, that is say, to haue his debtor die in prison, and to hang vp a bale of dice for him in the Crowne Office, as is done by the Officer in place, or the Goaler; then hath the Law beyond the seas prouided some reliefe for this poore man: for the custome is (in Germanie, France, Italie, Spain, and the Low Countries) that no man is imprisoned for debt aboue a yere and a day, in which time the creditors haue power to take, seise, and sell all the estate of the debtor; which being done, or before, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in most places may claime her dower for her reliefe &amp; children, and the rest is diuided amongst the creditors as far as it will go, and so the debtor is freed from those debts for euer: for by the Ciuile Law, <hi>Qui vult cedere bonis, liberatus est a debito,</hi> if the debtor do relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish his estate to the creditor, he is free from the debts, and all goods falling to him afterwards are his owne. But this man is euer after disabled to come to any preferment, and such a creditor as is the cause of it, will be hated and accounted worse than a Iew or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. For the manner of <hi>Cedere bonis,</hi> or to make cession of goods, is verie hainous,<note place="margin">The manner of <hi>Cedere bonis.</hi>
                  </note> and of wonderfull disgrace; so that most men will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther die in miserie, than to come vnto it, because it happeneth not once in twentie yeares: yet is it farre inferiour to the punishment of the pillorie, or the striking ouer the legge vsed in Russia at the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors instance, whereby the debtor is set at libertie, and the debt paid. The partie commeth before the towne-house, and standeth vpon a stone in the view of all the people, and vnloosing his girdle, he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them, and all the world to take notice, that he hath nothing left him to pay his creditors, and so renounceth all, what may be found to be his, or what any manner of waies he might pretend: and in token thereof, he may not weare his girdle any more, nor be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any businesse as a liuing man; yet afterwards by some composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made with the creditors, he may be restored by a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made by some Officer vpon the said stone, and then he is permitted to weare his girdle againe.</p>
               <p>In the said countries, no gentleman or man of qualitie, may be imprisoned at all for debts, his estate onely is liable thereunto, and yet with reseruation of such necessarie things, as Honestie, Honour, Humanitie, and Christianitie doth challenge: namely, the souldiours Person, his Armes, his Apparrell, Bed, and Chamber conueniently and necessarily furnished, which may not be taken for debt: and the like reseruation is made to euerie other man of qualitie, so that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of men bodies for debt (according to the common practise of England) is a greater burden and bondage, than is to
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:14410:223"/>
be found in any other christian or heathen countrie.</p>
               <p>And for asmuch as the mischiefe and incoueniences, arising to the King and Common-wealth, by the imprisoning of mens bodies for debt, haue beene propounded heretofore in Parlement, by a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted remonstrance which (like vnto a Pamphlet) may be lost, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by good matters are many times put in obliuion, I haue thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient to make an abstract thereof, in the maner, as the said reasons are laid downe, to be inserted in this booke, in hope of some releefe vnto decayed Merchants, whose estates may remaine liable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere their creditors, without imprisoning of their bodies, against the Law of God, the Law of man, the Rule of justice, the Law of conscience and christian charitie and against the Practise of other countries, as aforesaid, and finally against the creditors owne profit.</p>
               <p>The Law of God, willeth and commaundeth euerie man to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a vocation to doe the honour,<note place="margin">Against the law of God.</note> duties, and seruices, owing to his Prince and countrie, and Parents, and to maintaine his wife, children and family, and to instruct them, in the feare of God; so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, directly or indirectly forbiddeth the said christian duties, in the performing thereof (by an imprisonment) is against the law of God, whereupon all humane lawes ought to be grounded. No law of God, willeth or commaundeth imprisonments of mens bodies for debt, nor is it warranted by any example in the word of God, and the efficient meanes bringing men into prison as vsurie is, appeareth plainely to be forbidden by the word of God, as hath beene noted out of the old law, neither hath the law of the Gospell a word of commaund or warrant for imprisoning a christian brother for debt,<note place="margin">

               <p>By the Law of man it was not so, <hi>Ab initio</hi>: for by the Common Laws of England,<note place="margin">Against the law of man.</note> which are the most ancient, most eminent, &amp; most binding lawes, no man may be taken or imprisoned for debt, but the creditor was to take satisfaction, vpon the debtors estate of goods &amp; lands, according to <hi>Magna Char.</hi> 3. <hi>H.</hi> 3. and 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. although after accountants onely were to be imprisoned vntill they paied, which was made generall against all debtors by the statute of the 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. yet prisoners in Execution, might and did follow their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and affaires, by baile, mainprise or baston, as by the statute of 1. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. and from that time forwards, were prisoners tied vp shorter to the writ of <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> or the Kings speciall mandate, vpon surmises,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Habeas corpus.</hi>
                  </note> that the said debtors made secret estates in trust to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud their creditors or were wilfull and obstinate to pay them, being able. To answere these obiections, it is vniust to punish all promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously, aswell frauders, as non frauders, without and before any proofe made; yet if the fraud were proued or his abilitie and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie either, there is no cause to imprison his bodie, because the law doth giue the estate fourthwith to the creditor, whether the debtor
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:14410:223"/>
will or no: so it is still needlesse to imprison the bodie, for twentie yeares imprisonment discounteth neuer a pennie of the debt, and yet the debtor hath suffered more miserie and punishment, than a guiltie Traytor or Rebell suffereth for the highest offence.</p>
               <p>It is against the rule of Iustice and law of Nature,<note place="margin">Against the rule of Iustice.</note> that men equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free borne should be depriued of the common and equall libertie, and bee giuen into the power of another without criminall cause or guilt.</p>
               <p>The debtor is either punished for guilt or cohersion: if for guilt, it is against the rule of Iustice; for to bee found a debtor in the Law, is no criminall guilt, and therefore vniust to punish him crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally: If for cohersion, to make the debtor bring forth his estate to the payment of the debt; it is also against the rule of Iustice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force a man by punishment to doe that, which appeareth not to be in his power, or whereof the Law is alreadie certified that there is not wherewithall to doe, according to the purport of the <hi>Capias</hi> granted against the bodie by the Common Law.</p>
               <p>It is also against the rule of Iustice to thrust all kind of debtors into a prison together in a heape, without respect to the different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of men, to more or lesse guilt of fraud or obstinacie, or whether it bee an honest or an vsurious debt,<note place="margin">

But for certaine all (or nine in tenne) are vsurious debts and forfeitures, scarse one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest debt of a hundred, but all by vnlawfull gaine vpon corrupt and desperate aduentures.</p>
               <p>But it wil be said that imprisonment is no punishment, for prisoners liue at ease and pleasure, &amp;c. according to the recei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some haue not meanes sufficient to pay all, and some haue no meanes at all, and are kept in prison because they haue rich friends, who for their sake liue and die miserably in prison.</p>
               <p>Some haue meanes and will not pay, of fraud and obstinacie; but of these there is hardly found one in a hundred: for if that were so, the creditor (who searcheth the verie reines of the debtor, and his estate) will rather seise and recouer the prisoners estate, than cast him into prison, where if he die he loseth all.</p>
               <p>Now if an honest man may innocently fall in the Law, by such a multitude of accidents, practises, and errours of others, and by doing iust and friendly offices to others, and may faile also in his estate, and become insoluent by so many wayes, casually and causelesly in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and by the fault and errors of others, and cannot be a criminall debtor but one way, which is by fraud and obstinacie onely (of which scarce one example is to bee found in a hundred,) how can it stand with any charitie or conscience to neglect and passe by so many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and to fall vpon the debtor with such crueltie, by laying such a heape of miseries vpon him, his wife, children, and reputation at once, as imprisonment bringeth?</p>
               <p>It is true that the ancient Common Lawes of England, are verie strict in this point of maintaining Pacts and Contracts; but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of those times were simple,<note place="margin">Recouery only against the estate.</note> honest, and legall, and the recouerie was against the estate only, for there were no penall bonds knowne, nor vsurie practised by Christians when those Lawes were made; but all our contracts and bonds, or the greatest part, are corrupted with vsurie and forfeitures, which are extortion in a high degree: and to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:14410:225"/>
force men to performe such with the losse of their estates, credit, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, and many times of life too, is most inequitable.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The penaltie of Bonds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust.</note>Especially being the Law prouides euerie creditor his full damage, without the help of a penall Bond, which sheweth that all forfeitures are needlesse: and they are vniust also, for they make the vsurer iudge of his owne damage, which of right belongeth to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law.</p>
               <p>But it will be said, that the Chancerie doth mitigate the hardnesse and rigour of the Law in vsuries for forfeitures, and that wrong judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be reuersed by Attaint, Errors, <hi>Audita Quaerela,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The answere is, That the remedie is worse than the disease, for all courses of reliefe by Law in Chancerie, are hard, tedious, vncertaine, long, and extreame chargeable; and it is a lamentable case, that when the debtor is vniustly or vnconscionably cast in the Law, stript of his estate, his bodie imprisoned, his libertie tied vp, his credit destroyed, and his friends banished; then to send him so disabled to seeke reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die by new suits in Chancerie, which are chargeable aboue measure: and with the same extremitie doth the Statute of Bankrupts deale with the poore debtor, as heretofore hath beene declared.</p>
               <p>That prisoners are compassed with a multitude of ineffable mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and heauie afflictions, and therefore some cannot choose to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weake in faith, staggard or desperate, when there is no man to speake a word of comfort in due season, appeareth by the miserable ends of many desperate persons, whereby one with shame and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemperature loseth his sense and dyes, another for pouertie and want perished, one with feare and griefe breakes his heart outright; anothers heart that cannot breake, the deuill is readie to teach him desperately how to make way: one vncharitably flies from his kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, another desperately aduentures his life to breake prison; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally many are carelesse and giuen to all vices. For faith is rightly compared to a Lampe,<note place="margin">Faith compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a lampe.</note> which must haue oyle continually to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their light, which otherwise is soone exstinguished.

                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:14410:225"/>3 The common saying (<hi>volenti non fit iniuria</hi>) is a false position, else it is lawfull to knocke a man in the head that is willing to die, which is absurd; for the will or consent of the partie vnto an act that is in it selfe vniust, cannot make the act iust, nor iustifie the actour.</p>
               <p>It is also obiected, that if mens bodies may not be imprisoned, how shall they recouer their debts?</p>
               <p>Answere, vpon the debtors estate only, as this kingdome did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, and other kingdomes now do, and therefore let the creditor ground his trust thereupon, and trust no further than the creditors estate, for thence onely can he haue true satisfaction. It is replyed, That there will be no more credit giuen if mens bodies may not be imprisoned, and consequently, trade and comerce wil decay. Answer; honest trade, honest contracts, and honest trust will notwithstanding be as plentifull, for while there is the same vse, necessitie, and profit by commerce, there must needs be the same effect: True it is, that vsurious contracts will bee more relatiuely made to euerie mans estate, credit and honestie, as they did in the times of the old law and of the Gospel, and yet do in politicke gouernments.</p>
               <p>It is against the creditors owne profit,<note place="margin">Against the creditors owne profit.</note> for all meanes of satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must arise either out of the debtors credit, out of his labour and industrie, out of the will of his friends, or out of his owne estate; and all things that depriue or disable the debtor in any of these, do wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and lessen his meanes, and consequently tend to the creditors pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice and disaduantage. Herein it is not needfull to rehearse all the former miseries decreasing the debtors estate: for dayly experience proueth, that many debtors haue offered at the first to pay the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall debt, or halfe, before they were cast in prison, which afterwards by more troubles and charges comming vpon them, were disabled to pay any thing: how preposterous and absurd is it then to cast the deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors bodie into prison, where his estate is wasted, his credit spoiled, his fortunes and vertues lost, his bodie afflicted, his life consumed and murdered, and whereby the creditor bars himselfe from all remedie against his estate for euer?</p>
               <p>The consideration hereof maketh the debtor to retaine in his hands what they can to maintaine themselues, their wiues and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to keepe them from perishing, which maketh also against the crditors profit.</p>
               <p>The bodie of euerie subiect belongeth to the king,<note place="margin">To the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the king and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note> and euerie sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is a member or single part of the bodie of the common-wealth, so that to take this bodie, and to cast the same into prison for debt, where he must lie rotting idlely and vnprofitably all the daies of his life, and die miserably, is no other than to strip and rob the king and common-wealth of their limbes and members, and consequently of the seruices and endeauours of a great number of subiects yearely, of all degrees and professions to do seruice to the king and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; which number of prisoners exceedeth all the prisoners in all other countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:14410:226"/>It is therefore in christian Charity wished, and in all Godly Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie desired, That the bodies and endeauours of all debtors, may be free from imprisonment, and the creditors recouerie be made against the debtors lands and goods, according to the ancient fundamentall Laws of this Kingdome, being most consonant to the Law of God, to christian Charitie, to the rule of Iustice and to godly Policie as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid; And that <hi>Interim,</hi> the releife of prisoners may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which the late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted for her and her Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors in the 28. yeare of her Raigne, by a large Commission recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the high court of Chancerie; the exemplification whereof was by all prisoners for debt humbly desired.</p>

And if they be fit for the place, their time is short, that it doth vanish away in feasts and pleasures, and matters either publike or priuate doe remaine vndecided; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing protracted without due administration of justice: besides how is it (in common sence and reason) possible, that he should command, with the effectuall power of a Magistrate, that within a little while is (as it were) a cipher, without power or authoritie?

                  <p>This authoritie and seueritie of the Iudges therefore doth preuent manie mischiefes, putting a feare in the hearts of the offendors of the law by the rigour thereof, which in criminall cases is called by some crueltie. But the mercifull Iudge is more to be blamed in these cases than the seuere, because seueritie maketh men to be obedient vnto the lawes, whereas too much lenitie causeth contempt both of Lawes and Magistrates. Neuerthelesse, as there is in all common-weales two principall points which the Magistrates are to consider, namely Law and Equitie, so the execution of law is to be considered by the Magistrate, who sometimes being too seuere, may do more hurt to the common-wealth than good; seing the intention of those that made the law,<note place="margin">Lawes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the common good</note> was to prouide for the good of the common-wealth; <hi>Salus populi suprema lex esto.</hi>

for the maintenance of lawes, which otherwise would be fruitlesse, or made as it is said by some, <hi>propter terrorem</hi>; for preuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof, it is verie commendable to preserue this life of the law, consisting in execution: which was the cause that commissioners haue beene heretofore appointed, to retaine men in their dueties, as the Nomophilats in Greece, the Censurors amongst the Romans, the Ephores at Lacedemon, the Areopagits at Athens, the Visitors in Spaine,<note place="margin">Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to retaine Officers in their dueties.</note> and the Commissioners of Troyle, the Bastort in <hi>Edward</hi> the first his time; for all humane actions are so flexible to euill, that they haue need of a continuall remembrancer to vertue for the conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the publicke good.</p>
                  <p>If we will make a comparison betweene the execution of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall causes, and ciuile, we shall in a manner find the same to be all one effectually: for the generall manner of death imposed by the law, is hanging, where in other countries they haue diuers manners of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions, according as the fact is haynous. Murder (being a great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence) hath in all ages been punished with death, but stealing of goods was alwaies taken to be much inferior, because the law of God did not punish the same by death, as is now vsed; and yet a death by sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den execution, is better than a lingering death by famine, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other aduersities, before remembred.</p>
                  <p>The effect of the kings Prerogatiue Royall (to be mercifull euen when law hath had her full course) is to be seen rather in causes ciuile than criminall, and that in the reliefe of poore distressed prisoners and others:<note place="margin">Iustice and Mercie in God are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</note> seeing the Mercy of God (whose Lieutenants they are on earth) is aboue all his Workes; which maketh me to remember an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the common people, which thinke the Iustice and Mercie of God to be contraries, for if they were, they could not be in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the god-head being but one, and alwaies like it selfe, cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit contraries, and contraries they cannot be, being both vertues, whereas no vertue is contrarie to vertue, but onely opposite to vice: so that (respecting the Kings Prerogatiue in criminal causes when the law hath determined death or punishment by perpetuall imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or banishment) the King (imitating Gods mercie) doth restore life, freedome, and libertie, much more may the King do the same in ciuile causes (when the law commaundeth imprisonment vntill satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction be made of the iudgement) giue libertie and prolongation of time, as hauing an interest in the persons of his subiects, as we haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.

               <p>But when a stranger taketh letters of naturalization, then may hee get wealth and possessions within the Realme lawfully and freely: which letters of naturalization must be recorded in the Chamber of Accounts, vpon paine of a penaltie payed to the King, and his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

               <p>But <hi>Monsieur Papon</hi> the Ciuilian saith, That it is not sufficient for one to enioy the same, to bee borne within the Realme, but it must be also of a woman taken in marriage within the Realme: and heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon alleageth an arrest or sentence of the Parlement of Paris, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a cosin of a stranger deceased, was preferred before the sister, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the cosin was born within the realme, and dwelling in the same, and the sister did not dwell within the Realme, and was borne in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other countrey, albeit she caused her selfe to be Naturalized after the decease of her brother, whereof the Court had no regard, because the goods by succession were gotten before, which could not be made void by the Kings Letters Pattents. <hi>Monsieur Banquet</hi> is of opinion, That a Frenchman being departed the Kingdome, for to dwell in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other countrey, that his goods present and to come doe appertaine vnto the King, and cannot dispose thereof by Will or Testament, as it hath beene proued by diuers Decrees of Parlement. The King is Lord of all vacant goods, and therefore wiues and children are to take Letters of Naturalization to purchase their quietnesse. And if any stranger borne and naturalized, should bee out of the Kingdome some eight or ten yeares vpon especiall occasion or otherwise, hee is at his returne to take new Letters of Naturalization, or a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former by some approbation.</p>

               <p>By the premisses wee see, that the Naturalizing in France is farre more compulsorie for Merchants than in England; howbeit that in both Kingdomes, if a stranger Naturalized (after many yeares that hee hath inhabited the same) bee desirous to returne to his father-land or natiue countrey, he may surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Letters Pattents, and bee discharged of his oath.

For it hath beene well obserued by some, that the actions of a wise man and a foole differ in this,<note place="margin">Differences betweene the actions of a wise man and a foole.</note> That the wise haue a regard to the end in what they vndertake, and the foole without consideration permitteth the end to manifest in selfe: whereof ignorant men iudge according to the euent, although the enterprise were neuer so aduisedly taken in hand, and as if the successe did not depend vpon the diuine power, to be guided by his prouidence.</p>
               <p>The determination of all causes and controuersies, especially of Merchants affaires is done and executed, as followeth.</p>

               <p n="4">4 The fourth and last meane, to determine questions and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is by the ciuile or imperiall law, or the common law of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or jurisdiction of the seuerall dominions of princes, according to the fundamentall lawes of them; wherein we are especially to obserue, That the Law-Merchant is predominant and ouerruling for

               <p>Touching the first meane to determine Sea-faring causes, it shall not be needfull to speake much of the definition of an Admirall at the seas,<note place="margin">An Admirall.</note> called by the Romanes <hi>Magnus Dux Classis,</hi> and <hi>Drungarius magnus,</hi> or <hi>Admiratus,</hi> from <hi>Amiras,</hi> a word vsed by the Spaniard <hi>to See,</hi> or <hi>Adelantado,</hi> as going before the rest of ships; also by the Italians <hi>L'amiraglio,</hi> or Admiral in French, because his calling is known to all.</p>
               <p>But let vs obserue that for the readier obedience to the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralls of the seas, it is agreed by common consent of all nations, that they should haue (in regard of their power ouer the liues of men) a soueraigne iurisdiction onely proper to themselues,<note place="margin">The Admiralls Court.</note> in all Sea-faring causes and debates ciuile and criminall, so that no other Iudge should meddle therewith; and the Iudge of the court, being his deputie, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially to decide them by the Aduocats and other Assistants, for the better and iust proceeding of the said court.

               <p>The causes to be determined in the Admiraltie Court do extend verie far, and many are otherwise decreed or determined, especially by the Merchants Courts,<note place="margin">Causes to be determined by the Admiralty</note> and office of Assurances, whereas hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudges of the Admiraltie did minister justice vpon all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, contracts, offences, pleas, exchanges, assurances, debts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, charterparties, couenants, and all other writings concerning lading and vnlading of ships, fraights, hires, moneys lent vpon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of the Sea, and all other seafaring businesses done on the Sea or beyond the Sea, with the acknowledging of writs and appeales from other Iudges, letters of reprizall or mart, to arrest and put in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to inquire within and without liberties, by the oathes of twelue men vpon all offences and trespasses, and namely:</p>

               <p>The Clerke of the Admirall ought to be very skilfull and honest, and is to haue diuers Registers for congees, safe-conducts, pasports, sea-briefes, without which no ship in time of war is to passe,<note place="margin">The Registers of the Clerke.</note> nor yet in far voyages in time of peace; another Register for the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of captaines and masters of ships, and their returne; a third Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister for the names of Merchants, passengers, and owners, which the master ought to deliuer vp to haue them inrolled, and all pilots names (although recorded in the office called the Trinitie house) ought to be set downe, and knowne to the Admirals clerke; also all moneys deliuered vpon hazzard, or bottomarie, as is heretofore declared, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>foenus nauticum,</hi> or <hi>pecunia traiectitia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the manner of proceeding in seafaring causes,<note place="margin">The manner of proceeding.</note> is according to the lawes aforesaid, or the customes written: and if the debate or cause cannot be determined thereby, the last refuge is, according to the opinion of skilfull and vpright men in their owne trading; but all this must be done, as the law saieth, <hi>Velo leuato,</hi> so briefely and summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily without the solemnitie of other ordinarie courts and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, onely looking to God and the trueth, and all complaints to be

ended instantly, especially of ship-wrecke; for it were a crueltie to vexe so miserable persons with tedious proceedings: whereupon in this case the Iudges may proceede to execution vpon euerie interlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutorie, and make restitution presently, vpon good caution to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to satisfie the appellation, if any be made. And herein there is a further priuiledge to them: for whereas by the common rules of the law, where no litiscontestation is past, or as we say, bill and answere depending, no witnesse should be receiued, <hi>nisi ad eternam rei memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Extraordinary priuiledge.</note>

               <p>And as this is an extraordinarie priuiledge, euen so may merchants ordinarily, and masters sailing together, beare witnesse each one to other of their societie within the ship, if they haue neither to lose or gaine therby; and especially mariners for or against the master when the voiage is ended,<note place="margin">Ordinarie pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge.</note> and they free of his commandement.

               <p>Likewise if the partie do not appeare to defend himselfe or his ship after three citations, or foure at the most, called <hi>quatuor defaltae,</hi> hee is taken for contemptuous: the Iudge may ordaine the Marshall or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to put the plaintife in possession by his sentence or <hi>Primum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretum:</hi> Prouided that if the partie appeare within the yeare, and pay the costs and expences, he shall be admitted and heard vpon the proprietie: and in like manner, if any attachment be made vpon the ship or goods, it shall vpon caution giuen summarily be heard and determined, for this law of Admiraltie intendeth nothing but expedition for the better aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Trafficke and Commerce.

Others putting seuerall names in a paper, are contented that a meere stranger shall vpon the backside of the paper pricke their names with a pinne, or that (as they are numbred) the dyce shall bee cast vpon them accordingly by the number.</p>
               <p>Others put their names in seuerall papers, and cause them to bee mingled and drawne by way of lot, by an indifferent person, which course may be thought allowable, as we haue noted in the Chapter of the diuiding of commodities by lots.</p>
               <p>Others will doe the same by nomination of them, and drawing of the longest or shortest straw, or by any other extraordinarie meanes of pointing, numbring, or describing, all tending to one end, to haue indifferencie, and that partialitie may be auoided by all meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="448" facs="tcp:14410:232"/>Consideration must be had also, whether two, three, or all foure shall haue authoritie to determine the cause,<note place="margin">Awards are to be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hands and seales.</note> if they can, to bee done within a limitted time, wherein their award is to be deliuered vp, and whether they may name an vmpire, or not; all which must be declared in the Bond of Compromise, vnlesse the question be onely vpon one point to be determined, wherein no Bond is needfull but by way of assumpsit, by deliuering a peece of coyne each to other, and thereby binding themselues reciprocally vpon the penaltie of a summe of money to stand to the iudgement, it is ended.</p>
               <p>And the said penaltie or forfeiture by assumpsit may be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Law and the Merchants Courts, as well as the forfeitures vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bonds, if the partie doe not performe the sentence or award, if the award be lawfully made:<note place="margin">Fiue points to be obserued in awards.</note> to which end Arbitrators are to take notice of the fiue points following, which by the Law doe make void all awards.</p>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> albeit neuer so small.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That they make a finall end, and doe determine vpon all the points or differences produced before them by specification or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if they be required so to doe, and authorised thereunto.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That they doe not award any of the parties to doe or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme any vnlawfull act or thing prohibited and against the Law.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That they doe not award any thing, whereby any matter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie determined by decree in Chancerie, or judgement at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, or any sentence judicially giuen in the cause, be infringed or medled withall.</p>
               <p>These points ought to be obserued for the reasons following: For touching the first, if the award be not deliuered vp in writing vnder the Arbitrators hands and seales, if the condition of the Bond doe so limit the same: then haue they no authoritie to doe the same af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time which is limited vnto them, by the consent of the parties.</p>
               <p>For the second point, reason requireth in all humane actions, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocall act from one man to another, by deed of performance, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The reason of <hi>Quid pro quo.</hi>
                  </note> although it were a mans sallarie for his paines; which in some cases causeth men to award, that each partie shall pay so much to the Scriuener or Notarie for writing the said award: but this is no collaterall act betweene the parties, neither is it any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter compromitted to the Arbitrators. It is therefore better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse and award, that each partie shall seale and deliuer either, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall acquittances each to other, or with some exceptions therein as the award will lead them.</p>
               <p>The third point is considerable, where the differences are by both parties, or either of them deliuered in Articles in writing to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:14410:232"/>
for herein it is not sufficient to say, That the said arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors shall haue power and authoritie to determine all questions, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, doubts, controuersies, matters of accounts, reckonings, or any other vsuall or generall words, from the beginning of the world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the date of the bond: but they must giue their award vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particular Article, and vpon all of them.</p>
               <p>The fourth point, That the Arbitrators doe not award any thing which is vnlawfull, is to be vnderstood of all things which are euill in themselues, called <hi>Malum in se,</hi> and of things called euill because they are (vpon some respects and considerations) prohibited, and therefore termed <hi>Malum prohibitum,</hi> as the wearing of hats at all times, transportation of corne, eating of flesh in Lent, and the like; wherein there is a further consideration which requireth a distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As for example, an Arbitrator or many Arbitrators doe award,<note place="margin">A notable good distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Law.</note> that a summe of money shall be payed vnto such a man, during all the time he is vnmarried, is good in Law; but to bind the partie by award that he shall not marrie, because he should enioy the money still, is vnlawfull and void by the Law.</p>
               <p>The fifth point is of verie great consequence, to bind the actions of men to the obedience of the Law; whereunto such reuerence is due, that decrees, judgements, and sentences of judiciall Courts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, are alwayes of a higher nature than Arbitrators awards. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse in many doubtful questions, the Ciuilians themselues (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long and curious debates) doe assigne them to be determined by Arbitrators hauing skill and knowledge of the Customes of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, which alwaies doe intend expedition: and that is the cause wherefore an vmpire chosen vpon arbitrable matters,<note place="margin">An Vmpire hath absolute authoritie.</note> hath an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authoritie to himselfe giuen, to end the matter alone without hearing the Arbitrators, if hee will: for albeit this is not without some danger, and that the ending of Arbitrators is to bee preferred; yet breuitie and expedition of justice in Merchants affaires is so much regarded, that by all meanes the same ought to be furthered. Hence it proceeded that the Merchants Courts, gouerned by Prior and Consulls (whereof we intreat in the next Chapter) haue authoritie to reforme or confirme the sentence of Arbitrators,<note place="margin">Arbitrators award subiect to the Prior and Consulls.</note> when Merchants will appeale their arbitrement before them, rather than to goe to Law: and with this prouiso, That the appellation of the sentence of the said Arbitrators shall not be receiued by the said Prior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulls, before the arbitrement bee performed by the partie that doth appeale, conditionally that restitution shal be made, if there be cause, vpon the end of the processe. And the said Prior and Consulls are to note, that no Merchant nor other, being of their jurisdiction, can transport or make ouer their interest to any person priuiledged, and not subiect to the said jurisdiction, be it by gift, sale, or exchange, or by any other meanes, to the end thereby to auoid their authoritie; vpon paine that the same transports or possessings shall bee of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the losse of their right and cause. And all notaries who shall
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:14410:233"/>
receiue any such transports, shall be punished by the said Prior and Consulls in a penaltie arbitrable: and further shall be condemned to pay vnto the aduerse partie, all his costs and charges which hee hath sustained by meanes thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reference of causes to Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</note>And to the end this expedition may by all meanes be furthered, the said Prior and Consulls may distribute and referre causes vnto the most ancient and expert Merchants in the matters in question, to make a true report of the state of the cause, according to the allegations and proofe of the parties, without any sallarie to bee giuen to the said Merchants; howbeit in Italy some reward is giuen vpon the Ricorse of Merchants.</p>
               <p>These Merchants are to take the aduice of the Aduocate, Councell and Atturney of the said Prior and Consulls in matters difficult, the better to discerne the right of the cause to make their report more compleat, for the sooner ending of it according to reason and right, by the true affirmations of the Merchants, and not by fained, subtile, and craftie writings, which oftentimes do darken the truth, vnder the colour of faire phrases declared in them, causing protraction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layes.</p>

                  <hi>Marcus Tullius Cicero</hi> hath truely set downe the difference, which is betweene Iudges of the Law and Arbi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And in this regard it is said, That an vmpire doth represent the Lord Chancellors authoritie, because that the Commissioners, report of the Masters and others of the Chancerie, or of Merchants, is the ground worke whereupon the Lord Chancellor doth deliuer his sentence, and maketh vp his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.

And moreouer their authoritie doth farre exceed the power of Commissioners: for as Arbitrators haue a determinate power to make an end of controuersies in generall termes, without declaration of particulars; so hath the Prior and Consulls power to doe the like, whereas Commissioners are to giue a reason and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their proceedings to the Lord Chancellor. Finally, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators authoritie implyeth a voluntarie command proceeding from both parties, which the Commissioners haue not, but the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Court hath.</p>

               <p>The Ciuilians hauing considered of this Office of Prior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulls established in many places of France, Italie, and Germanie,<note place="margin">Wherin Prior and Consulls haue no power</note> haue made diuers questions of their authorities, saying they cannot decree any thing contrarie to the law of the land; as that the father shall be bound for the sonne, or the sonne for the father, or any thing that is <hi>malum in se,</hi> or naturally vniust, or against the publicke good, or that which sauoureth of a Monopolie: neither may they forbid any man to go to law, or order that a worke begun by one shall not be ended by another, without the others consent: neither are they to deale or to determine of any thing but what concerneth merchandising; for other things, as the selling of houses, lands, and the like, doe not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine vnto them. True it is, that all matters criminall or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue do not belong vnto them to deale in, for there the Kings Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is a partie, and hath interest therein, as falsifying of obligations, and bills of debt, or other writings, matters of reproach, or discredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of persons, theft, and other euill vnlawfull behauiour done and committed by their said seruants, or themselues, or any other Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, Factors, or intermedlers in causes of merchandise, as also all others not exercising the trade of merchandise: are forbidden to be dealt with by the said Prior and Consuls, neither are they to deale with the contracts of Vsurie either fained or otherwise vnlawfull,
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:14410:234"/>
nor with the Wills and Testaments, or contract of marriages of any persons, or with the interchanging of goods by consent, and all other such like contracts, but onely in all ciuile causes of merchandising. How be it these questionable matters are not of that moment to be discussed, considering that their authoritie is declared and confined by the Charters and Priuiledges made vnto them by Princes and Common-weales, whereunto relation is to be had, and accordingly they are to proceed, hauing a respect to the equitie of the cause. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Benvenuto Straccha</hi> the Ciuilian maketh a treatise, <hi>Quomodo proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum sit in causis Mercatorum,</hi> of the manner to proceed in Merchants affaires, wherein are many vniuersall things propounded which are easier, but particular things are commonly more truer, by his owne obseruation;<note place="margin">The decrees of Merchants need no other confirmation.</note> and he concludeth that the decrees of Merchants need no other confirmation or approbation.</p>
               <p>The oath taken by the said Prior and Consuls to obserue the Law-Merchant is subiect to punishment, if they be perfidious or forsworn, as well as the oath of all other Iudges. And writing <hi>de Consulibus Mercatorum,</hi> he saieth, That a Merchant may call in question, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his plea before them, although it be against one that is no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, if the cause concerne merchandising; and the plaintife herein bindeth the defendant to be iudged by the said Prior and Consulls, be he either a Knight or Ecclesiasticall person, or a stranger not resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the place. In the like maner all Bankers, Shop-keepers in faires and markets are bound to their iurisdiction for matter of money and Exchanges, or for merchandise.</p>
               <p>The plaintife may in other places (where the defendant doth deale or negotiate) be at his choice to begin or commence his suit where he will, but not in two places at one time for one cause, wherein some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the penaltie is by him respected to be far greater in one place than in another. Here let vs remember the controuersie betweene two brothers which was aboue fortie-yeares since, called <hi>Ioan de la failia,</hi> and <hi>Iaques de la failia,</hi> who went to law in Brabant for manie thousand pounds; and afterwards one of them did commence suit in Flanders being another iurisdiction, whereupon he was compelled to pay a forfeiture of 4000 <abbr>ll</abbr>;<note place="margin">A fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The proceedings before the said Prior and Consulls is by Libell or Petition, or by Declaration; wherein let vs note the difference set downe by the said Ciuilians.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration.</note> The Libell or Declaration is to be made with all the forme vsed in law, as well for the matter of fact, as the matter of law. But in a Petition the forme is not needfull, so the substance of the matter be well expressed, especially the summe which is demanded, or the goods being lent, or vniustly detained, must be specified; and if it be for money owing for merchandises, or lent, it must be declared, otherwise the Consuls will reiect the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as impertinent; albeit some triuiall errors in Petitions are to be

tollerated, and the partie is to be (by the Merchants Law) relieued.</p>
               <p>They are to proceed summarily in all their actions,<note place="margin">Summarie proceeding.</note> to auoid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of trafficke and commerce; and they are to respect plaine and sincere dealings amongst Merchants, with a consideration to construe all things to be done <hi>bona fide,</hi> so that trust may be preserued amongst them; debarring (as much as in them lyeth) the exceptions of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, Excussion, and of promises made without consideration, <hi>quod nudo pacto promisisti,</hi> and the like; in so much that many times a woman is admitted to be a procuratrix, contrarie to the Ciuile Law:<note place="margin">A custome contrarie to the ciuile law.</note> and all other exceptions vpon plaine bills and obligations are set a part, and the trueth is hunted after, and all exceptions proceeding of Iustice and Equitie to be considered of.</p>
               <p>The paying of Customes, Impositions, Factoridge, Portage, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the like charges are much to be respected by them, as also the execution of Wills and Testaments.</p>
               <p>The publication of witnesses before them, is without delay; and no more witnesses are to be examined after the time of few daies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, is expired:<note place="margin">Sentences of the Prior and Consulls.</note> but sentence is immediatly to bee giuen in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, after pronunciation cleerely made by them, according to the proofe and allegations, vpon paine to be punished by the higher courts, and in Fraunce by the court of Parlement, vpon reformation of their decrees.</p>
               <p>The manner of this summarie proceeding is so briefe, that vpon comming of the parties before them in person, or by their Atturnie, they are presently to nominate their place of residence, or else there is refusall made of their petition or demaund; then there is but one delay admitted, and in the acknowledgement of bills of debt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations there is admitted but one default: after which the bill is held as confessed and auileable,<note place="margin">The authoritie of Prior and Consulls is greater than the authoritie of any Iudges.</note> wherein their authoritie is greater than the authoritie of all other Iudges.

If opposition be made against the sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, sale, or deliuerie of goods, or against the cries, or interpositions of decrees, or against any other chiefe point, where opposition may be admitted, (justice remaining duely garnished) the parties so oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselues shall be sent to their Iudge, and chiefe men of their prouince, to declare before them the causes of their oppositions.</p>

<pb n="463" facs="tcp:14410:239"/>
the ancient Maximes of the said Lawes, of the statute Lawes &amp; Booke Cases, which are yearely obseruations vpon manners, and may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Responsa Prudentum,</hi> comprehending therin the Municipall Lawes,<note place="margin">Municipall Law, as gauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, &amp;c.</note> which is proper to all Kingdomes and Gouernments, as an exception to the fundamentall Lawes thereof; wherein many singular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawne from Diuinitie and Humanitie are effectuall, though there be no bookes for it. For the principles which are taken from the Law of God and Nature, or Reason, are many more, than those which are of man, and giuen by the absolute discretion of the Iudge. And concerning the prudence of the Law, which holdeth this Maxime, That it is better to suffer a mischiefe,<note place="margin">A Maxime in Law.</note> than an inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, attributing the word mischiefe vnto one or some few men, and the word inconuenience to all persons, or the common-wealth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. And here let vs obserue, That
<q>Of the Common Law of England, there may bee made an Art or Science.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider we, that <hi>Ars est causarum consideratio,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Definition of Art.</note> 
                     <hi>ex finibus assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi> Art is the consideration of causes from certaine ends propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; according to which definition an orderly consideration must be taken of the causes, which cannot be without Art: For Art maketh nothing but of things alreadie made, putting a dictinct determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is done with a reformed reason properly called Logicke; which (as it is the instrument of all Sciences) so is it also the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law: and although the Law be now infinite in Practise, yet is the same finite in Precepts. So that as, <hi>In infinitis omnia concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> The Law being finite in her principles, may easily be compiled or incorporated; and experience teacheth, that it is easier to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand many principles well put together, than to put many principles well together, whereby a man may vnderstand the Law, hearing the same deliuered by a Lawyer; yet this may be done by wisemen.</p>
                  <p>For we haue our finite originalls or elements, acts, persons, things, and their adiuncts, and concerning them, finite reasons, of which we doe compound cases infinite; yet are all those cases decided accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the finite reasons of the finite elements. So hath the Phisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an finite simples, though hee doe make infinite compounds, yet are they all proued good or bad to that whereunto they are prepared, by reasons drawne from the finite simples.</p>
                  <p>Now by the elements of the Law,<note place="margin">Elements of the Law.</note> we must vnderstand matter and forme, not as in things naturall and compound, but <hi>Modo &amp; forma,</hi> as they speake: so in all cases, there is matter of Law, matter of Fact, or both, and the twelue men or jurors, are onely ordained to trie the matter of Fact, for they are ignorant in the Law; so that if the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion be of the Law, that is, if both parties doe agree vpon the Fact, and each doe claime that by Law he ought to haue it, and will still in that sort maintaine their right, then it is called a Demurrer in Law,<note place="margin">Demurrer in Law.</note>
                     <pb n="456" facs="tcp:14410:240"/>
which is determined by the Iudges: So that if all cases were reduced vnder these few titles, namely, Pleas of the Crowne, of Right or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Land, of Debt, of Trespasse, of Account, of Trouer, and of the Case: Then might the matter of Fact bee brought nakedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the jurie distinguished from the matter of the Law. For all Cases are either criminall or ciuile,<note place="margin">Cases crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, reall, and personall.</note> or criminall, reall and personall, for life, honour, and goods or lands: and it is an easie matter to describe the nature of these and the like actions, the Law being singular in her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, which would diminish the practises thereupon: whereas by the Ciuile Law the Fact is first examined by witnesses,<note place="margin">Originalls by the Ciuile law.</note> indices, torments, and the like probations to find the truth thereof; and that done, the aduocats doe dispute of the Law, to make of it what they can, saying, <hi>Ex facto, ius oritur,</hi> which is long and tedious.</p>
                  <p>The pleading of generall Issues, with addition of the words, <hi>Modo &amp; forma,</hi> maketh the matter difficult many times, when the jurie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth that this meaneth some matter of Law, when it is onely matter of Fact: the jurors therefore are principally to looke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Issue and Euidence doe concurre, which they ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. True it is there is sometimes matter of Law which altereth the Case, when there must be proued a lawfull consideration of <hi>Quid pro quo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nudum pactum</hi> what it is.</note> otherwise it is <hi>Nudum Pactum ex quo non oritur Actio</hi>; wherefore I haue seene some Pleas plainely distinguishing the matter: so that the jurie might perceiue the naked Issue of the Fact before them in question, with all the circumstances which is sometimes done by way of Replication.</p>
                  <p>There is a Maxime or ground of the Law of England, That if the defendant or tenant in any action, plead a plea that amounteth not to the generall Issue, that hee shall bee compelled to take the generall Issue,<note place="margin">The pleading of generall Issues.</note> and if he will not, he shall be condemned for lacke of answere. The generall Issue in Assize is, That hee that is named the disseisor hath done no wrong, nor no disseisin: and in a Writ of Entrie in the nature of Assize, the generall Issue is, That he disseised him not; and in an action of Trespasse, That he is not guiltie, and so euerie acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath his generall Issue assigned by the Law, and the partie must of necessitie, either take the generall Issue, or plead some plea in the abatement of the Writ: and the cause why this is done, is because the matter of Law should not bee put to the triall of the jurie of twelue men.</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fortescue</hi> saith, That the triall of twelue men is more indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent than the triall before a Iudge, because it is an easie matter to find out two men among a number of men, that may be of the parties acquaintance, so void of charitie and conscience, which for dread, loue, or profit will be readie to gainsay all truth: and to this purpose he alleageth the example of the two witnesses against <hi>Susanna,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which president the witnesses are to bee examined asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and not in the hearing of one another, as is now accustomed. And if their oath touching the matter of Fact were recorded briefly,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:14410:240"/>
the Euidences would be more certaine, for witnesses would be more carefull, vpon which the oath of the Iurie dependeth.</p>
                  <p>If the action bee locall of lands or houses,<note place="margin">Proceeding<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the oath giuen to Iurors is, That they shall deale iustly and truely betweene partie and partie; but the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses are to speake the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and so they take their oath.

                  <p>Neuerthelesse there are three meanes to dissolue the said judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and execution, namely, By a Writ of Attaint, a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and an <hi>Audita Quaerela,</hi> which Writ is grounded vpon Equitie by Law and Conscience.</p>
                  <p>The Writ of Attaint is not onely tedious and thargeable,<note place="margin">Writ of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint.</note> but also neuer or seldome tried: for the same is brought by the partie grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, against the twelue men, and the partie for whom the sentence is giuen. And whereas before commonly vpon the first enquest, they be all Yeomen, or men of meane calling: now vpon this Attaint must goe twentie foure Gentlemen of greater qualitie, and fortie eight must be warned to appeare; then there must in the Attaint no more euidence be brought in, but onely that which was brought in and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged before the first enquest, which not appearing of record is hard to bee made a plaine matter: againe Gentlemen and others are loth to discredit their neighbours; yet if the matter bee so apparant, that they must needs find them attainted; then meanes are found to deferre the judgement, and it may bee the parties shall be brought to an agreement, or at the least one of them that was of the attainted Iurors will dye in the meane time, and then the Attaint ceaseth: yet in this case if the partie be in prison which brought the Writ of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint, he may be bailed, as is in <hi>Natura Breuium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Writ of Error is more easie,<note place="margin">Writ of Error.</note> and was heretofore vsuall to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long suits in Law, before the Statute of <hi>Ieofaile</hi> was made, meaning in good French <hi>I'ay failly.</hi> For euerie small Error, if it were but false Latine, would ouerthrow a Cause; but now it runneth into another extreame, for if the partie grieued speaketh in arrest of judgement,
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:14410:241"/>
and sheweth some materiall Error, vpon motion made, the aduerse partie may haue it amended as often as Errors are opened: the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord therefore ought to be first remoued, and not onely by transcript be put into another Court, but the partie is to plead thereunto, <hi>in nullo est erratum,</hi> and then the danger of opening Errors is past, if there be no trickes vsed in amending of the Records vnder hand, wherein lyeth a <hi>Cerciorare</hi> to satisfie the Court, where the Record is brought, namely, from the Common Pleas to the Kings Bench Court, from the Kings Bench to the Exchequer, which heretofore was done in Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore the partie grieued and in prison of the Kings Bench cannot be baileable vpon a Writ of Error after judgement and execution, as hee is vpon a judgement of the Common Pleas, in the Court of Kings Bench; for this Court of Kings Bench, in regard of the Pleas of the Crowne, challengeth some prioritie herein.</p>

                     </note>The Writ of <hi>Audita Quaerela</hi> is graunted out of the Kings Bench Court, if the judgement doe depend there, and returnable in the said Court, or else out of the Chauncerie returnable in the Kings Bench: whereupon the Lord Chancellor taketh foure bailes in the vacation Time, before a Master of the Chauncerie, and the matter doth meerely depend vpon the baile. The suggestion of the Writ in matter of Law, is a later contract after judgement and execution; an escape in Law, if the prisoner bee by the Gaoler permitted to goe abroad without the Kings Writ, or if he breake prison, in which case the Gaoler is to pay the debt; or vpon a payment made since the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; also a wrong recouerie by an executor, whom the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue Court doth afterwards disavow. Such and the like suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are to be tried by another Iurie, vpon euidence to be produced to proue the said allegation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">A strict Law.</note>This Common Law is so strict, that the Prouerbe is, <hi>Summum ius, summa iniuria:</hi> for example, If a man seized of lands in Fee, hath issue two sonnes, the eldest sonne goeth beyond the Seas, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a common voyce is that hee is dead, the yonger brother is taken for heite, the father dyed, the yonger brother entred as heire, and alienateth the land with a warrantie, and died without any heire of his bodie, and after the elder brother commeth againe and claimeth the land as heire to his father: in this case by the Law, the eldest brother shall be barred by the warrantie of the yonger brother. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, parteners cannot sue each other by the Law:<note place="margin">Parteners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sue each other by the Law.</note> if two men haue a wood ioyntly, and the one selleth the wood, and keepeth all the money wholly to himselfe; in this case his fellow shall haue no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie against him by the Common Law: for as they when they tooke the wood ioyntly, put each other in trust, and were contented to occupie and deale together; so the Law suffereth them to order the profits thereof.</p>
                  <p>The Law therefore is not compleat without the Courts of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie or Equitie, for the imperfection and rigour of it, are qualified thereby, called to be <hi>Aequum &amp; Bonum,</hi> which may bee considered in
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:14410:241"/>
this case. Two strangers ioyntly did deliuer in trust vnto a widow woman a round summe of money, with condition not to deliuer the same out of her hands, but when they both should demand the same: within a while after one of them commeth vnto her, and doth assure her by good indices and probabilities that the other his companion is dead, and thereupon doth intreat her to deliuer him the money; which shee did, not suspecting any fraud, so the partie went away with the money. Afterwards commeth the other (who was said to be dead) and demandeth the money of the woman, and vnderstanding that she had paied the same vnto the other, was much offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and caused her to be adiourned before the Iudge: The woman appearing did declare the matter according to the truth, shewing how the other had deceiued her, and she did wholly relie vpon the integritie and justice of the Iudge.<note place="margin">Example of Law and Equitie.</note> Here an Action of the case might haue beene brought against the woman by the law, and cause her to seeke the partie that had deceiued her: but the Iudge tempering the rigour of the law, did giue sentence, That the woman should pay the money vnto the partie, so as he brought his companion with him to demaund the same, according to the couenant, they both iointly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reposed a trust in her.</p>
                  <p>Here I call to mind the question which no Iudge could determine: A couetous Doctor at the Ciuile law would not instruct a young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, vnlesse he did pay him a great summe of money, whereunto the Student did condescend, conditionally that he should haue the first cause (he tooke in hand) to go on his side: whereupon it fell out, that the cause betweene him and the said Doctor was the first cause, and so there could be no proceeding therein, the Student pleading the condition in barre.</p>
                  <p>The court of Chauncerie is properly called a court of Conscience, because it reasoneth on the part of the complainant, by argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Law of Nature before mentioned, <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris:</hi> for in the Chancerie euerie man is able by light of nature to foresee the end of his cause, and to giue himselfe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof, and is therefore termed a Cause; whereas at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law the clyents matter is termed a Case,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Cause and Case.</note> according to the word <hi>Casus,</hi> which is accedentall; for the partie doth hardly know a reason why it is by law adiudged with or against him.</p>
                  <p>The Chauncerie therefore vpon Bill and Answere betweene the complainant and defendaunt, graunteth an Iniunction to stay the proceeding in the courts of common-law, vntill the equitie of the cause be examined: and if there be no matter of equitie found,<note place="margin">Iniunction of the Chancerie.</note> then the cause is dismissed to the law againe, with costs to the partie. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants causes are properly to be determined by the Chauncerie, and ought to be done with great expedition: but it falleth out otherwise, because they are by commissions commonly referred to Merchants, to make report of the state thereof vnto the Lord Chauncellor; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The rather, for that the triall of an Action of Account at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law is tedious.

                     <note place="margin">The triall of an Action of Account by law.</note> this is first tried by a Iurie, and if the partie be conuicted, and found accountable, then the law doth appoint Auditors to take the account, by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission directed out of the court to Merchants and others, according to the nature of the cause, whereunto two Atturneys of the court are ioined. And when they haue taken the account, and find wherein the differences do consist, then they are to certifie all their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings into the court, and the accountant must make issuable answeres to be pleaded, whereupon eight, ten, twelue, or more issues shall bee made, and then a second Iurie is called to trie all these seuerall issues vpon peremptorie points, and so vpon euerie issue there is giuen a particular verdict, and sometimes an especiall verdict, which is to be determined by the court againe.

                  <p n="8">8 That the witnesses be examined of the time, of the place, and of the case it selfe, whether they haue seene or heard the same, &amp; what they beleeue or know thereof, or of the report they haue heard.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 That (to auoid charges) there be not too many examined.</p>

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:14410:243"/>
and Equitie to bee the Common Law, so much commended aboue the Ciuile Law, by the said M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Fortescue,</hi> sometimes Lord chiefe Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the Kings Bench in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixth, who hath obserued fiue points wherein the same consisteth; let vs obserue many more to extoll the excellencie of the said Common Law, as followeth summarily.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, because of the antiquitie thereof,<note place="margin">Excellencie of the Common Law of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> for that in all the times that the Realme was inhabited by fiue seuerall nations, the same was still ruled by the said Customes that it is now gouerned withall; which if they had not beene good, some of the Kings of these seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall nations, mooued either with justice, or with reason and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would haue changed or abolished the same, especially the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes who iudged all the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, for that the Kings of England at their Coronation doe take a solemne oath, to cause all the Customes of the Realme to be faithfully obserued according to the former institution.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 For that the said ancient Customs or Maximes therof are inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnable, and doe stand of their owne authoritie as Principles, which need no reason to confirme their authoritie, as the Lawes of <hi>Solon, Draco, Carondas, Licurgus, Numa Pompilius,</hi> and the Law of twelue Tables, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Because all differences and controuersies, which happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the King and his subiects are tried and determined by the Law; and if it be done in Parlement; or by the Iudges, it is still accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Because the King personally giueth not any iudgement, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when himselfe is a partie, seeing it is against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be both judge and partie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 For that notwithstanding the decease of the Kings of England from time to time, the Iudges of the Courts of Record, that is to say of the Chancerie, of the Kings Bench, of the Common Pleas, which doe sit as Iudges by the Kings Letters Pattents doe remaine authorised, and their power ended not immediately with the King; howbeit the succeeding Kings doe confirme them in their offices, whereby all seditions are preuented during the <hi>inter Regnum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7 For that with indifferencie, without regard of persons, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth as well the Nobilitie and other persons of dignitie by way of vtlagare or outlaw as the meanest subiects.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 For exercising a power ouer the Iudges, which are not to judge of the Law, but by the Law: and therefore is the word <hi>Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> properly attributed to their determinations; euen as the word <hi>Decretum</hi> is vnderstood of the ordinances or sentences of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, following equitie (as it were) without Law. For there is the like proportion betweene the Law and the execution thereof, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Legis Actio,</hi> as there is betweene Equitie and the dutie of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate called <hi>Iudicis Officium.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="472" facs="tcp:14410:244"/>9 For that the officers thereof are authorised according to the qualitie and due execution of it, by a proportionable distribution, namely, The Iudges for terme of life, and officers subalterne changing from yeare to yeare, to the end the administration of justice may bee more indifferent.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 For the diuersitie of the triall thereof in seuerall Courts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law and Equitie, is the cause of an agreeing and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie discord, as it were, <hi>Concordi Discordia,</hi> whereby the bodie of justice is supported by striuing, as the stones vpholding a vault, as <hi>Cato</hi> saith.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 For that the Iudges in criminall causes doe change from time to time their circuits, and inferiour Iudges of the Court doe execute the place as well as superiour Iudges, whereby partialitie is preuented.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 For that the Law tendeth most carefully for the good and preseruation of life and goods of euerie good and honest man; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that euen in criminall causes, it hath prouided (as much as may stand with justice) a helpe and fauour, permitting the Iudges to order the pleading of offendors and to instruct them to auoid mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleading, and giuing them leaue to except against the Iurors, which they dislike.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 For that it doth forbid the sale of offices, thereby inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding due administration of justice; for where offices are sold (as it were) by the Great, there justice is commonly solde by Retaile.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 Because the same is most agreeable with the nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the people, and the qualitie of the countrey, which by reason of the fertilitie, affordeth verie conuenient meanes for the triall thereof by Iuries of twelue men, the nature of the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gentle.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Because men are to reduce the state or issue of their cause vpon one peremptorie exception to bee tried by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of twelue men, whereby matters are determined with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 For that it commandeth not any thing, but what is honest, reasonable, and possible in it selfe, and all impossibilities are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thereby.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 For that thereof may bee made an Arte or Science in manner before declared, seeing the same is finite in her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, according to the old Maximes or Principles, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euerie thing being reduced and explained, as aforesaid, all am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities and darke sentences would be taken away, and the Iudges should easily giue a cleare vnderstanding thereof, according to the order of <hi>Solon,</hi> who made the Arropagits of Athens to be as Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the Law.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 For that the triall thereof by a Iurie of twelue men vpon one point peremptorily or in certaintie is briefe and substantiall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:14410:244"/>
the witnesses which are produced before them (by whose eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the state of the cause is made) must be approued by the verdict of twelue men, as aforesaid.</p>
                  <p n="19">19 For that the matter of Fact is distinguished from the matter of Law, and is accordingly decided either by the Iurie, vpon the matter of Fact, or by the Iudges vpon Demurrer or otherwise vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Law.</p>
                  <p n="20">20 For the indifferencie of the triall of controuersies and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions betweene the natiue subiects and aliens for they may haue their trialls <hi>Per medietatem linguae,</hi> that is to say, halfe the Iurie of strangers and the other halfe of English subiects, to auoide partialitie.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 For that the Serieants and Councellors at the Law are to giue counsell, and to helpe the poore, which are not able to prosecute Law at their owne charges, which they doe <hi>in forma pauperis</hi> by direction of the Lord Chancellor, and the Lords chiefe Iustices of the Kings Bench and Common Pleas.</p>
                  <p n="22">22 Finally, the Common Law is excellent for hauing fewer faults and imperfections, than any other Law, being most sufficient to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the common-wealth in quietnesse.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Common Law of England, hath like a Queene a Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant power, from whence proceedeth mutuall loue and sure amitie from the Prince to the subiects; and from the subiects againe due obedience to the Prince in a most pleasant harmonie and concord, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the name of a Law receiued, published and recorded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reason to be rendred for the same (as it were) <hi>Lex cum Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logo,</hi> wherewith <hi>Seneca</hi> found fault when he said <hi>Iubeat lex, non suadeat.</hi> And as the Law is deriued <hi>à ligare</hi> to bind, so is the whole State of the Common-wealth bound to the head, and may be made easier in practise: For as the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Of all the written Lawes in France, the Ordinances and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts of the King are most in force; insomuch as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for the onely Lawes, and all other haue their life from them, and are so farre forth auailable as they are strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by them.</p>
                  <p>The arrests of the Courts of Parlement are of great authoritie, being pronounced in the name of the King, and are as Lawes to be followed in all cases.</p>
                  <p>In like manner their Ordinances are to be followed onely during the time that the King prouideth, not otherwise, and in their owne circuit onely; for they haue not authoritie to make Lawes generall and perpetuall.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing heretofore published a Treatise intituled <hi>Englands view in the vnmasking of two Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,</hi> which had beene presented vnto the French King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, as a matter of great consequence, and considerable in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement of common-weales; and finding that the true vnderstanding of them (with a third Paradox obserued by me) did properly allude to the contents of this booke, or the three Essentiall parts of Trafficke, namely Commodities, Money, and Exchange for Money, I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue to handle the substance of them for a Corrollarie of the same,<note place="margin">Paradox, what it is.</note> the rather because Paradoxes are things contrarie to the vulgar opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and will also make all the premisses more manifest and apparant by their conclusion.</p>
               <p>The said two Paradoxes presented by <hi>Monsieur Malestroit</hi> one of the officers of the Finances or Treasurie in France, were as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, saying,
<list>
                     <item>1 <hi>That to complaine of the generall dearth of all things in France was without cause,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Commodities.</note> 
                        <hi>for there was nothing growne deere these three hundreth yeares.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2 <hi>That there is much to be lost vpon a crowne,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Money and</note> 
                        <hi>or any other money of gold and siluer, albeit one do giue the same in payment at the price he did receiue the same.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The third Paradox which I haue added hereunto, is,</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>That the imaginarie moneys supposed in Exchanges for money,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exchange.</note> 
                  <hi>made by Bills of Exchanges, do ouerrule the course and propertie of Reall and Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall moneys</hi> in specie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monsieur Malestroit</hi> saith, that since the ancient permutation hath beene changed in buying and selling, and that the first riches of men (which consisted of cattell) was transferred to the gold and siluer,
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:14410:247"/>
whereby all things haue receiued their estimation;<note place="margin">Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are the Iudges of good cheape or dearth.</note> it followeth that those mettalls are the right judges of good cheape or dearth of all things.</p>
               <p>Wee cannot say that any thing is deerer than it was three hundred yeares ago, vnlesse that for the buying thereof wee must now giue more Gold and Siluer than wee did then: But for the buying of all things, wee doe not giue now more Gold or Siluer than wee did then; therefore (saieth he) nothing is growne deerer in France since that time.</p>
               <p>To proue this, he doth alledge, That during the raigne of King <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> in the yere 1328, the French crown of the flowerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce (as good in weight and finenesse as the French crowne of the Sunne now) was then worth but twentie soulz tournois, commonly accounted to be two shillings sterling. In those daies (saieth he) the French elle or yard of Veluet was worth foure liuers, which is foure crownes, or eight shillings sterling: the said elle of Veluet doth now cost ten liuers, or twentie shillings, and the French crowne which was then valued at two shillings, is now valued at fiftie soulz, or fiue shillings; so that foure crownes do make the said twentie shillings, yet the said French crownes doe not containe more gold in weight or finenesse than before; and consequently the veluet is not now deerer than it was then.</p>
               <p>The gentleman that hath now fiue hundreth liuers by the yere to spend, hath no more than he that had one hundreth liuers to spend in those daies: and in like manner he proceedeth for Corne, Wine, and other commodities, and thereupon concluded, That the dearth of all things, is but imaginarie, and a vaine opinion to conceiue that things should be deerer now than in those daies.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>The second Paradox.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THere is much to be lost vpon a Crowne, or any other money, although the same be giuen in paiment at the price it was receiued.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This (saieth <hi>Monsieur Malestroit</hi>) is an old and common error, roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the iudgement of most men, that are far from the marke and without their reckoning, as he will manifest in the former termes.</p>
                  <p>In the aforesaid time of King <hi>Philip de Valois,</hi> the French crowne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid was worth but twentie soulz, which is now currant for fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie soulz.</p>
                  <p>The gentleman that had fiftie soulz rent or income, did receiue for it two crownes and ahalfe, or so much in siluer accordingly; for which two crownes and a halfe he had halfe a yard and halfe a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of veluet, after the rate of foure liuers the yard, which was the price of veluet then: now for this fiftie soulz the gentleman doth receiue but one crowne, or so much of siluer money, and for that one crowne now he can buy but one quarter of a yard of veluet after the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:14410:247"/>
rate of ten liuers that veluet is now worth, whereas before hee had halfe a yard and halfe a quarter, although hee haue giuen the same in payment for fiftie Sols, which is the price for which hee receiued the said Crowne; and so proceedeth with other the like examples in the buying of commodities with siluer coyne, or in the receiuing of rents or incomes, adding further thereunto, that if any man will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and say, I care not what the crowne, liuer or soulz is worth, so as I hauing a hundreth liuers of rent paied mee, and that I can pay out againe the said hundreth liuers. This man (saith hee) must then make proofe that he can haue now as much ware for two soulz, as he could haue had in times past for two soulz which were of fine siluer, and now almost of copper, and in doing so hee should make a third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox more strange than the former: for hee should goe about to prooue euerie thing to bee become better cheape, which cannot bee prooued.</p>
                  <p>The substance and intention of these two Paradoxes is (saith hee) to shew that the King and his subiects doe buy all things as deere as in times past, for that they must giue as great a quantitie of gold and siluer as in times past: but by the inhauncing of the price of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of gold (from whence of necessitie proceedeth the abating of the siluer moneys;<note place="margin">Inhauncing of gold abateth the siluer, in regard of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</note>) the King doth not receiue in payment of his reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, such a quantitie of gold and siluer, as his predecessors. In like manner, Noblemen and Gentlemen that haue great reuenues and incombes, doe not receiue such a quantitie of gold and siluer as in times past, but are payed (as the King is) in copper in liew of gold and siluer. For which copper, according to the second Paradox, they cannot haue so much wares, as they might haue for the like quantitie of gold and siluer: so that the losse which wee haue by the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deere of all things commeth not by giuing more, but by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lesse quantitie of gold and siluer than before; whereby wee see manifestly that the more wee doe inhaunce the price of money, the more we lose.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Monsieur Bodine,</hi> the famous and learned Politician,<note place="margin">The great French Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician.</note> tooke vpon him to make an answere vnto those two Paradoxes, being of another opinion, and setteth downe other causes of the dearth of things, which are fiue in number, namely;
<list>
                        <item>1 The principall and almost onely cause: The aboundance of gold and siluer, now extant in the Kingdome more than in times past.</item>
                        <item>2 The Monopolies.</item>
                        <item>3 The Want of things causeth by excessiue Trade and wast thereof.</item>
                        <item>4 The Pleasure of Princes that aduance the price of things.</item>
                        <item>5 The alteration of the Valuation of Moneys.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proue the first case and principall, he alleageth diuers exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> doe witnesse,<note place="margin">Examples of great wealth,</note> that <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> after the conquest of Macedon against the Persians, did bring such aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of gold and siluer to Rome, that the people were freed of all
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:14410:248"/>
Imposts, and the price of lands aduanced vnto two third parts sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. The Emperour <hi>Augustus</hi> brought such great treasure from Egypt, that the price of vsurie did decrease, and lands became much dearer: and the like at Ierusalem by the comming of the Queene of Candace: and in the West Indies by the Spaniards conquest there: and heereunto hee maketh a comparison of the want of moneys in times past,<note place="margin">The French King <hi>Iohn</hi> in England, &amp;c.</note> for the paiment of the ransome of Princes taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in those dayes, and the meanes of the increase of wealth by the discouerie of the West Indies; the propagation of the people in France, their trade for Turkie and Barbarie, their Banke at Lyons, and other accidents.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the second cause of Monopolies, hee doth passe ouer the same as a matter not considerable, and doth limit Monopolies onely to the combination of Merchants and Artificers, in the setting of a price to commodities, or their handie worke by augmenting their wages.</p>
                  <p>Touching the third cause of the dearth of things, by the want or waste of them, hee obserueth some especiall things; that corne and wine are better cheape during the time of warre, than peace: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Husbandman is driuen to sell and to make money of his wares, and the Gentleman finding the same perishable, when the Merchant dare not lade his ships, doth abate the price of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and maketh the people to liue good cheape; which according to the Prouerbe (<hi>France can neuer be famished</hi>) would alwaies continue,<note place="margin">The Fertilitie of France.</note> if by the meanes of the stranger their storehouses were not emptied.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the fourth cause of the pleasure of Princes, imposing a price vpon commodities, which they doe affect: <hi>Plato</hi> saith, That it is a generall rule in State matters, That Princes doe not only giue Lawes vnto their subiects, but also by their example they do change the manners of men:<note place="margin">The example of Princes, doth change the manners of men.</note> to which purpose hee doth vse the example of their King <hi>Francis</hi> the first, who being hurt in the head, caused his haire to bee cut off, wherein the people did presently imitate him: We haue seen (saith he) three great Princes striuing, (as it were) who should haue the most learned men and best artificers, namely, the said great King <hi>Francis</hi> the first, <hi>Henrie</hi> the 8 King of England, and Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, insomuch that the King of England could neuer haue the learned and reuerend <hi>Beda</hi>; and the French King, did pay seuentie two thousand Crownes for a Diamond, rather than King <hi>Henrie</hi> should haue had it. Hereupon presently the people did giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to studie and to buy precious stones, when the Nobilitie did imitate the King: and when the King gaue ouer the same, the price of them was much abated.</p>
                  <p>If any man should here obiect (saith <hi>Monsieur Bodin</hi>) that if things should still become deerer, partly through the waste, and partly for the aboundance of gold and siluer, no man should be able to liue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the dearth of things. It is true, but the warres and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties happening to a Common-wealth, doe stay the course of it, as
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:14410:248"/>
wee may note, that the Romanes haue liued with scarsitie, and to speake properly in want and miserie almost fiue hundreth yeares, when they had but copper moneys of a pound weight,<note place="margin">Copper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys of one pound weight.</note> and without stampe: for their gold and siluer came vnto them in one hundreth and twentie yeares by the spoile of all the world, which was brought to Rome by the <hi>Scipions, Paul Emilyus, Marius, Sylla, Lucullus, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Caesar,</hi> especially by the two last: for <hi>Pompey</hi> did conquer so much land,<note place="margin">Great wealth of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</note> as made the reuenue of the Empire to bee eight millions and a halfe of Crownes. <hi>Caesar</hi> notwithstanding all his prodigalities, brought to the treasurie fortie millions of Crownes, hauing giuen at one time vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> Consull, 900 thousand Crownes to hold silence; and vnto <hi>Curion,</hi> Tribune, 1500 thousand Crownes to take his part. <hi>Marke Anthonie</hi> went further, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Appian</hi> haue written, for he gaue vnto his armie for their seruice done 200 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Talents, being 120 millions of Crownes: so did <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour to haue the good will of fortie Legions giue ten millions, whereby appeareth great aboundance of gold and siluer to haue been at Rome, but it did not last euer: for in lesse than three hundreth years the Parths, Goths, Hercules, Hongres and other cruell Nations did ouercome the Empire and all Italy, and ouercame the Romanes, burned their Citie and tooke the spoile of them. The like doth happen vnto all Common-weales to waxe and increase by little and little, and to flourish for a time in wealth and power,<note place="margin">The propertie of Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales.</note> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to grow old and decline, vntill they bee vtterly ruinated and destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Touching the last cause of the dearth of things by the alteration of money, hee sheweth how <hi>Monsieur Malestroit</hi> hath mistaken the matter in the monies themselues made within three hundreth yeares. For whereas he saith, That Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> caused the first sols to be coy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, worth twelue deniers, whereof sixtie foure peeces went to the marke weight of eight ounces; and that in <hi>Philip de Valois</hi> his time, the Crowne of the Flower de Luce without number, and as good as the Crownes now, was valued but at twentie sols, and that afterwardes King <hi>Iohn</hi> caused the Frankes to be made of sine gold, which were but valued twentie sols, and that the sols of siluer was worth fiue of our sols: he doth not say of what weight and finenesse the moneys were in those dayes, and in conclusion hee saith, That the price of things is not altered by the Valuation of moneys.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Monsieur Bodine</hi> (according to his wisedome and deepe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in other matters) had duely considered of these two Paradoxes, hee would haue made a direct answere thereunto before he would haue proceeded in his former discourse.</p>
                  <p>The first Paradox being considered with the second, will shew a manifest contradiction or contrarietie:<note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierie of the Paradoxes.</note> for the first doth consist in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of more gold and siluer for commodities now, than in times past, which hee denieth: and the second, in receiuing lesse commodities for the gold and siluer now, than in times past, which hee affirmeth;
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:14410:249"/>
which both wayes is to bee taken in nature of commutation.</p>
                  <p>Now if wee doe not giue more quantitie of gold and siluer for commodities than in times past; how can we receiue lesse commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the gold and siluer, and thereby receiue a losse, as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Paradox is alleaged?</p>
                  <p>Againe, if we doe receiue lesse quantitie of commodities for gold and siluer than in times past, according to the second Paradox, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we sustaine a losse; how can the first Paradox bee true, That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is growne deere, for that wee giue no more quantitie of gold and siluer than in times past, commodities and moneys lying by this comparison in an equall ballance?</p>
                  <p>But let vs admit, that <hi>Monsieur Malestroit</hi> had an intention, which hee might haue expressed in few words, if hee had the true ground, and vnderstood the matter hee went about, by proouing onely that when moneys doe alter in weight, or in finenesse, or in valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Causes of the denomination of moneys, &amp;c.</note> or in all three, the price of things doth alter onely by deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, if the valuation bee made accordingly: yet <hi>Monsieur Bodine</hi> had not made a good interpretation of the said Paradoxes, and mistooke the true ground of the matter in question touching the prices of commodities, which hee compared within themselues in the Realme of France, whereas the comparison ought to bee of the inhauncing of the price of the commodities of one countrey, with the price of the commodities of other countreys, and thereby find out, whether things are growne deere with vs or with them in effect. So that they both mistaking their grounds, we haue shewed in the said Treatise, That they (hauing lost <hi>Ariadne</hi> her line, wherewith they entred into the laborinth of moneys and their properties before declared) are like vnto a man who hauing lost his way amongst the woods, the further hee goeth, the more hee erreth from the right way.</p>
                  <p>To intreate therefore of commodities and money, in the course of trafficke betweene Kingdomes and Common-weales is not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: but the exchange of moneys, being the publike measure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them must bee regarded, as the principall and ouerruling part thereof.</p>
                  <p>For if a man should frame a silogisme in manner following, he shall find the same full of fallacies and misprision, nay a verie <hi>Dilemma.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing causeth Merchants to export more money out of the Realme than they bring in, but onely the bringing in of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities into the Realme than they carried out;</p>
                  <p>The vnderualuation of our moneys, causeth no more commodities to be brought into the Realme than is carried out;</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Free Trade.</note>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> The vnderualuation of our moneys, causeth not more money to be carried out of the Realme than is brought in, as is declared in our last Treatise to hinder the inhauncing of our moneys, which by the Treatise of free Trade (lately published) was insisted vpon.</p>
                  <p>We do also find, that in the yeare 1577, <hi>Monsieur Garrault</hi> one of
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:14410:249"/>
the French Kings Councell did exhibit two Paradoxes concerning moneys, which may (in regard of the former) seeme more paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or strange, nor only to the vulgar opinion, but also to the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wiser.</p>
                  <p>The first is an assertion, <hi>That moneys haue not changed their values.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other, <hi>That by the inhancing of the coine, or the price of moneys,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxes.</note> 
                     <hi>the price of commodities becommeth abated and good cheape; and that by the reduction and abatement of moneys euerie thing becommeth deerer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for as much, saieth he, that the matter of money is full of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleames, and may be disputed on both parts, his desire is, that some gentle spirit might be stirred vp to discourse of the reasons which may be alledged.</p>
                  <p>Touching the first, <hi>That the value of moneys is not changed,</hi> (omitting to speake of the Cicle of the Hebrews, the Staters of the Persians and Greeks, &amp; the As or Denier of the Romans,) he saieth, That K. <hi>Lewis</hi> 11 did reduce the disorder of moneys vnto their former estate of K. saint <hi>Lewis,</hi> when the Denier of gold was esteemed (in weight) vnto 12 deniers of siluer, which is properly to be called the proportion between the gold &amp; siluer heretofore noted: and hereupon he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how the said proportion hath bin altered; yet so, that the siluer was alwaies made correspondent to the gold, and when the gold ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the marke weight of 8 ounces, was inhanced, &amp; consequently in the peeces or coines; the siluer was likewise inhanced proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, obseruing the said 12 to 1, or sometimes thereabouts, either a little ouer or vnder; and this caused him to say, That moneys had not changed their values, it being only a comparison made betweene the gold &amp; siluer, which is by weight, and not by valuation, to be applied vnto euery peece of coyne, especially to the French crowne of the flouredeluce or sunne; and the piece of siluer called Douzaine, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the said 11 to 1, and the application thereof vnto the price of commodities is more absurd. The weight of 12 of siluer to 1 of gold maketh not the valuation of the mark weight of gold and siluer, much lesse the valuation of the pieces coyned of the said marke, whereby we see how one distinction is able to dispell and disperse the foggie mysteries of deceitfull fallacies, as th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

following each other, whereby it commeth to passe, that the price of wares followeth not the price of moneys, but the common custome; for money was made to no other end, but to maintaine and continue the trade of merchandise, by meanes whereof the commodities and necessaries are brought from one place to another to auoid the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient painefull and troublesome permutation: which trafficke is two-fold, namely, within the realme, and in forreine countries: within the realme the money is more commodious than necessarie, but for the straunger most necessarie, and therefore must be of a fine substance, as Gold and Siluer, to bee inclosed in a small roome, to transport great matters from one place vnto another. And if wee will meerely consider of this substance and effect of strange negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, wee shall finde nothing but a masked permutation of one thing for some certaine quantitie or weight of Gold or Siluer: for hee that trafficketh in forreine countries hath not such regard to the value imposed vpon money, as to the intrinsique goodnes which giueth the value,<note place="margin">A good obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to be had by Mer-chants.</note> and hath the same function in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, according to which inward goodnesse hee setteth a price vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his commodities, to make thereof the like quantitie of Gold or Siluer as he hath laied out, ouer and aboue his charges and profit; so that the moneys remaining stable and firme, the price of Wares and Merchandises remaineth certaine without any augmentation, to shew that there is no inhauncing of the price, because of the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of the price of moneys, which will make vs hereafter to see the good cheapenesse of all things (as he saieth,) for he that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth some forreine commodities to come within the realme, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the alteration of the price of moneys, according to the vnbridled will of the people, will make the price of his commodities accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And this the said <hi>Monsieur Garrault</hi> doth declare by examples of veluets and other commodities, and therefore he is of opinion, that moneys inhaunced should be reduced againe to their price, and that all debts made before that time should be satisfied <hi>à lequipollent,</hi> according to the rate, <hi>vt pecuniarum vna &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If the standards of the said moneys were by allay of copper altered, much lesse would the aduice giuen that Merchants accounts should no more be kept in liuers and soulz, but in French crownes to hinder the inhauncing of moneys, which in some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is secretly practised to bee done of meere policie, when by publicke authorie it is forbidden, and might be effected, as within the realmes of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and other his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties dominions, where the moneys are not inhaunced betweene man and man, and remaine currant according to their price, vntill the kings authoritie doe alter the valuation by Proclamation, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it by exchange it is not so; and therefore according to my third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, we shall find,</p>

Whereupon he did demand, in writing, what was the cause of the said difference or alteration, if this proceed (said he) from the goodnes of the gold, that it is better in finenesse and allay, or in weight, or from the weakenes of the siluer, that it be worse than it was either in finesse &amp; allay, or in weight? then is the cause intrinsick and substantiall, and may be easily considered and resolued, if it bee good or euill, to be intertained, maintained, and set forward, or reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and stayed from all further course: if there be any other cause or reason, it must of force bee extrinsicke and accidentall, let the same bee searched out: if it bee good to the Prince and estates weale and commoditie, it should be assisted and continued: if it be tried euill, proceeding from the policie and craft of trades-men,

tending onely to priuate gaine and commoditie, preiudiciall to the Prince and State to be gainestood and expelled. This proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent vnto mee by a great personage then in high place, was made plaine by demonstration, to proceed of an accidentall cause by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing the Valuation of gold partly in England, when Crowne gold was valued from fiftie fiue shillings the ounce to three pound, and partly in France, when they did aduance the French Crowne <hi>in specie</hi> fiue soulz; aduising therewithall that to remedie the same, it was not to bee done by inhauncing of our gold still more and more, but in the price of exchange betweene France and vs, otherwise wee should vnderualue too much the siluer of the Realme to our excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding losse, shewing withall how easily this might bee done, without alteration of the proportion obserued betweene gold and siluer for most places.

                  <p>To conclude therfore this Paradoxicall discourse, I cannot omit to doe the same, with another Paradox by me obserued, in the making of moneys of gold and siluer, namely;
<q>That a man may commixe Bullion to make a certaine standard of moneys, either of gold and siluer,<note place="margin">A very strange Paradox.</note> and after the commixture made, shall alter the standard and make the same better or worse, without putting any allay or siluer and gold vnto it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is to say, I will melt downe eleuen ounces and two pennie weight of fine siluer, and eighteene pennie weight of copper, both one pound Troy of twelue ounces in weight, making the sterling standard, and yet my moneys made thereof shall be but tenne ounces fine. In like manner I will melt downe tenne ounces of siluer, and two ounces of copper and more to make a standard of tenne ounces fine, and yet my moneys made thereof shall be eleuen ounces fine, or sterling.</p>
                  <p>To vnderstand this mysterie or Paradox, wee are to note that in the making of a standard of moneys, three things must concurre and haue an equalitie proportioned vpon the pound weight of twelue ounces Troy, namely, Finenesse, Allay, and Weight of the peeces made out of a pound, which is the ground worke of the subtile assay; according to which all Assaymasters make their calculation by the marke of eight ounces, or the pound of twelue ounces, making one marke and one halfe.</p>
                  <p>Suppose now that (as in ancient time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third) one pound weight being diuided into twelue ounces, euerie ounce was diuided into twentie peeces, or is now diuided into sixtie peeces, or three pound making sixtie shillings, which then made but twentie, and that these twentie peeces or sixtie shillings were diminished by the sheyre, and there is made twentie two peeces, in regard of the twentie or sixtie six peeces, in the liew of sixtie peeces, which is tenne in the hundreth that the said peeces are lighter than before, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring peece by peece: Now an Assaymaster receiued one of these pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make an assay thereof in manner by vs declared (in the Second Part of this Booke, in the seuenth Chapter of the assayes of Bullion and Moneys) and hauing weighed the same, he calculateth how many of these peeces doe make or weigh one pound, and hee findeth twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie two or sixtie six peeces or thereabouts, because of the vneuennesse of the sheyre, which being tried, hee maketh report of the finenesse accordingly: so that wanting in regard of the pound, tenne in the hundreth by weight, there must needs be wanting so much in finenes, and so eleuen ounces molten downe, is found to be but tenne ounces fine: and in like manner, &amp;c.

                  <p>As this ebbing and flowing is aggrauated by accidentall causes of raine, snow, and the like by the alteration of weather: so doth the rising and falling of exchange, increase and decrease by the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of State affaires betweene contending Princes, according to the vse of moneys.

               <p>The most ancient foundation of Merchants and merchandising in this Kingdome, both for Trade and Gouernement, had by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of time before King <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, did obtaine the name of Staple; the commodities of the Realme, as Woolls, Leather, Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fells,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:14410:256"/>
fells, Lead, Tinne, Butter, Cheese, Clothes, and other commodities were called Staple Merchandise: The Ports from whence the said commodities were to bee transported, were called Staple Ports, as London, Westminster, Hull, Boyston, Bristoll, Southampton, New Castle, and other places: The places of residence of these Merchants, both within this land and beyond the seas, were called the Staples; the Lawes and Ordinances made by the said Merchants, were called Staple Lawes: vnder their gouernement (consisting of a Maior, two Constables, and other Officers) hath the trade of this Kingdome time out of mind flourished, to the great inriching of the Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: and it hath beene supported and assisted by the wisedome of the State in all ages, as may appeare by the seuerall Acts of Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for that purpose in the times of <hi>Henrie</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> the third, <hi>Richard</hi> the second, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henrie</hi> the fifth, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the sixth, and King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth. So that comprehending the Merchants aduenturers Societie with them, which began in the said time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth, it is aboue foure hundreth yeares standing, that the said Societie hath beene, as we haue noted. For by the prouidence of all those Princes, the Staple Trade was from time to time established, and especially by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, in whose raigne a great number of memorable Lawes were made for the purpose, appointing the said officers and their fees to preuent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion; and all the Kings subiects, that would bring their goods to the Staple and trade,<note place="margin">The ancient free Trade.</note> according to the Lawes and Ordinances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, were admitted to be Merchants; such was the free trade of this kingdome in those daies, wherein the subiects of all sorts vpon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions might freely participate vnder gouernment.</p>
               <p>At these Staples were the Kings Customes duely collected, and by the officers of the Staple, at two seuerall times, paied into the Kings Exchequer; and by their gouernment were many inconueniencies preuented, whereby the former causes of the decay of trade, were either moderated or reformed, namely:</p>
               <p n="1">1 The moneys of the Realme were required to bee answered in true exchange, according to their intrinsike value, and their Doller, or other forraine coyne was by the Maior and Constables valued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; for there was no merchandising exchange vsed, neither were Bankers knowne: and when there wanted money in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, or was like to want, order was taken by them to import Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, either the 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> part of the value of commodities exported: The debts betweene Merchants were transferred or set ouer by bills to bee registred before the Maior or Constable, which was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant without the strict proceedings of our Common Law. And the like may be done now by a Register authorised by his Maiesties let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Parents.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In those dayes vsurie was accounted to bee an abominable thing, for it was not vsed by any course politike: but seeing it is now so generall in all countreys, the best remedie to abate the same in
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:14410:256"/>
price, is to procure plentie of money within the Realme by the meanes before mentioned, which will bee more effectuall of course, than any law that will be deuised for the moderation thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 To auoide the litigious suits in law, the said Maior and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables of the Staple had authoritie to determine them with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition: and if it were vpon a difference betweene a Stapler and a Merchant stranger, there were two Merchants strangers admitted and ioyned with the Maior or Constables to determine the same, and that with a present execution without delay, especially vpon a Statute Staple acknowledged before the Maior or Constable, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fishing Trade was not preoccupied by forrain nations, as it hath beene within these hundreth yeares, as hath beene noted; albeit such Ships as were permitted to fish in the Kings Seas and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, payed six pence for euerie tunne burthen, which is now eighteen pence, and this trade might be established with vs, notwithstanding that the seuerall Societies of the Merchants Aduenturers, Russia, and Eastland Merchants, are of opinion that England cannot maintaine the same, and the cloth Trade together, as they haue certified.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The indraping of wooll or making of cloth, being of late much increased beyond the Seas, and lesse cloth made with vs, may giue the better meanes to establish the fishing Trade, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The pollicies of Merchants of seuerall countries is to bee met withall, as the Staplers did in times past, looking to the sales both of woolls, and all other Staple commodities, and the prices of forraine commodities, to preuent the ouerballancing in price of the said for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine wares with our natiue commodities.</p>
               <p n="7">7 To preuent the false making of cloth, let vs obserue that at these Staples, Merchants goods were alwaies diligently and careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viewed and subscribed, by the Correctors and other Officers of the Staple; to the end that all goods exported might bee answerable in goodnesse to their expectation vpon the view required: whereby this Staple Trade continued without any interruption, for they were the sole Merchants of the Realme without competitors, vntill the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth; at which time certaine Mariners and Mercers of London, vsing to barter English clothes in Holland, Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Brabant and other places, had by the said King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, a gouernour set ouer them onely to bee a iudge to heare and decide their controuersies and to punish their misdemeanors, with license that they might congregate themselues for that purpose, as by the graunt appeareth. This licence they in short time peruerted, to the great disturbance of the ancient course of the Staple, whereby the trade of the Realme greatly declined, and the Kings Customes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: so that from 160 thousand pounds yearely payed out of the Staple, the Customes came short of 120 thousand pounds.<note place="margin">The Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Becket.</hi>
                  </note> These new Merchants terming themselues, <hi>The fraternitie of Saint Thomas of Becket,</hi> were by Act of Parlement, and by direction vnder the Great
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:14410:257"/>
Scale of England, in the time of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the sixth, prohibited from doing any act that might preiudice the Staple; and so it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vntill the two and twentieth yeare of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the seuenth, and then there was another great complaint in Parlement against the said fraternitie, for decaying of trade, and a verie strict law made against them, with especiall order that they should admit any of the Kings liege people into their socitie paying vnto them ten markes, which vnder pretence of some priuiledges hath beene interrupted, and especially by his Maiesties Proclamation, in the fifteenth yeare of his Highnesse happie raigne, by reason of the controuersie for the dressing and dying of cloth: neuerthelesse in all their graunts, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made, That the Staplers should not be preiudiced, which in the wisedome of a Parlement will be found most necessarie to be vnited againe, to make a free trade vnder gouernment.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The exportation of the materialls for cloth, as woolls, Fullers earth, woolfells, and woodashes, is prohibited lately by his Maiesties Proclamation, with good orders for the execution thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as heeretofore was done by the Correctors of the Staple for other commodities.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Touching the warres of Christendome, let vs obserue that King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, had also great wars in his times with France and in Ireland; and neuerthelesse he did receiue a verie great assistance by subsidies of fiftie shillings vpon euerie sacke of wooll exported for, and during the time of sixe yeares, which amounted to 1500 hundreth thousand pounds, when one ounce of siluer was valued but at twentie pence, which would now amount to foure millions and a halfe.</p>
               <p n="10">10 And lastly, the immoderate vse of forraine commodities, was by the Maior and Constables of the Staple, had in consideration; for they had alwaies an especiall care to the inriching of the Kingdome, because the prouident care of the King did put them in mind thereof: insomuch that when the said King became forgetfull therein, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the warres, and that the Kingdome wanted chaffer, wares, and necessarie prouisions, the Parlement did absolutely deny to giue him any subsidie, as appeareth by the Chronicle of <hi>Grafton,</hi> in the one and fiftieth yeare of his raigne: so that by the premisses things haue bin (in some measure) considered of, when least disorder in trade appeared.</p>

Vnto him therefore I frame this answere, confessing and auoiding, that true it is, That the ancient Monarchies, Empires, and Common-weales held the knowledge of their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in such reuerence and secret, that none (but the officers which had the managing thereof) were made priuie of them, as being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things, not fitting that the people should take notice thereof, which was truely obserued in the Romane Empire, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales of the Grecians. But as times produce varietie, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of men do change, breeding corruption of lawes and customes; so was it found, that by this secrecie officers were both emboldned and enabled to deceiue the Princes thereby, and the people would pretend ignorance to gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:14410:258"/>
people, but vnto strangers also, which the Emperor <hi>Iustinian</hi> caused to beobserued, and other Emperors succeeding him, as appeareth by the Code and other Bookes, which the French Kings haue imitated euer since; willing and commaunding, that these things should be knowne of euerie one, yea euen of the meere strangers of other countries; so that this obiection is of small moment, especially this booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moderate in the handling thereof.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Mastix</hi> riding a false gallop on a hackney horse (being full fraighted of conceits) commeth to towne, and maketh two excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the methode and contents of the booke: first he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the termes of Art, by diuiding of the same according to the three essentiall parts of Trafficke: next he will not haue Merchants secrets laied open, or their trades divulged.</p>
               <p>To the first, concerning the being, essence, or existance of things, he will make no difference betweene naturall things, and things arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, and so there is but two essentiall parts of <hi>Materia &amp; forma,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that some Philosophers haue established three beginnings of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall things, Matter, Forme, and Depriuation: The Matter hath no other office or function, but the changing from one Forme into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Depriuation giuing an inclination thereunto; for Depriuation is an imperfection so conioyned to the Matter, that without her, if she were seperated, nothing would be ingendered; and therefore in Heauen there is no Depriuation, and consequently no generation ne corruption. The Forme therefore giueth perfection to the thing and being also, and without her the Matter is more imperfect than the eye is without the facultie of seeing, or the eares without hearing. But in artificialls, the being hath her parts, as Trafficke hath three, namely, Commodities, Money, and Exchange: so other things may consist of more being or simples, wherein the termes of Art are not excluded, neither can they auoid <hi>Mastix</hi> his enuie.</p>
               <p>To the second, the whole contents of this Booke manifesteth to all judicious Merchants how necessarie the knowledge is of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein contained, to maintaine Equitie and Iustice by the Law of Nations; and that there is no particular secret of any Merchants trade reuealed, to the preiudice of any man or nation: in so much that they are much pleased with it, as being desirous to aduance the good, and to banish the euill, obseruing that vertue maketh a stranger grow naturall in a strange countrie, and the vicious becommeth a meere stranger in his owne natiue soile. Let vertue therefore enioy her freedome, and possesse her priuiledges by the right of Law, and all the people shal flourish with equitie, Iustice shall maintaine Peace; Peace shall procure Securitie; Securitie shall nourish Wealth, and Wealth Felicitie. No man is to be dismayed at his small tallent, or to grudge at anothers greater prosperitie; for without doubt, Nature hath by her secret motion denied none, some perfect qualitie to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie that want, which in himselfe breeds discontent or mislike: for euen as the fish (hauing no eares) hath a most cleere sight; so though
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:14410:258"/>
want of dignitie be a disgrace to some, though want of coyne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content diuers: and though lacke of wealth impaires the credit of many, yet nature hath supplied that outward ornament with such an internall reward, as a loyall and louing heart (notwithstanding many hard measures) will with constancie spend all his time for the good of the common-wealth being thereunto imployed.</p>
               <p>This worke thus at length happily concluded, and commended to the kind acceptation of all gentle and well disposed minds, is not compiled to please the vaine appetite of some men, according to their nice opinion, but is referred to the judiciall and affable judgements of this age, to whom I shall (during the remainder of my daies) alwaies be readie to supplie any thing which in the next impression may be desired; not doubting but they will measure it by the iust desert, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure thereof as their owne kind natures haue euer beene accustomed.</p>
