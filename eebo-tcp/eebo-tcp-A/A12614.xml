            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OOD is not known, yea not
even taken notice of (as a spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Prouerb deliuereth) vntill
that it be passed by; yea more, be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost. Alas! the trueth hereof I most
apparantly perceiue in my self, it aptly
agreeth with my state, and my runne
course of life, for that I too late tooke
notice thereof, too late knew what time
is, and of what value it is, and what a
precious and inestimable treasure it may
be truely found to be. So farre forth
that I am much aggreiued that I did
not dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erne it, and well might I, for
that I haue lost so great à jewell: and
earnestly I desire (if it were possible)
<pb facs="tcp:1362:5"/>
that I were maister of my yeares al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spent, to the end I might well and
most solicitously employ them, as I-ought,
and my well being requireth, and my
duety commandeth, and that I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
them from the Captiuity and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrallment
with which they haue been
miserably detained, yea and enchained.
Rather might I well say, that he who
hath not known, and prized time bath
justly deserued, that now he lament
aud earnestly vvish for it, and that yet
notvvithstanding he faile to possesie
that vvhich he disesteemed, that vvhich
he, alas! so slightly regarded. But I take
for a singular, a rare grace and mercy
of notable value that our Lord (although
at the end of my dayes) hath giuen me
this capacity, this vnderstanding, and
feruent desire of à better employing my
time, vvhich from hence for vvard his
mercy vvill grant me, that I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
and giue some counsaile to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse;
<pb facs="tcp:1362:6"/>
carelesse and as it vvere altogether
negligent.</p>
            <p>And to give beginning to vvhat is
fore deliuered, I haue desired that he
please to make me his Attorney or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
that I may petitionarily plead for
the ransome, the redemption thereof:
and that I may instruct them, who haue
lost it, hovv they may regaine it, and
that I may declare hovv much it impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
them, hovv farr it concerneth them,
of vvhat great consequence it is to them,
and likevvise further I may earnestly,
and vvith fulnes of charity craue of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and piously, yea euen mooue them that
they cast not avvay one hovver: vvhat
say I? no nor moment of time. I vvill be
breife, though vvere it I should spend
neuer so much time in the account he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof,
I should not judge it lost time.</p>
            <p>I shall not be able to bringe to passe
vvhat <hi>Pythagoras</hi> doth aduise, vvhich
is to contract many sentences in fevv
<pb facs="tcp:1362:6"/>
vvordes, as good Philosophers ought,
and are accustomed to doe. Hence <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi>
to one vvho talking vvith him
seemed to taxe some vvhat the breuity
of the Philosophers sentences, ansvve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
you say right vvell truely they are
in fevv vvords couched indeed, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
not hence reprehension, for vvere it
possible, so likevvise should be the sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
            <p>But I vvill doe the fall extent of my
povver, contracting this vvhole subject
vnder tenne Chapters onely. Herein ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
Gentle Reader that I cast not time
avvay neither in the definition or des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of Time (vvhere it might seeme
that the Treatise should take his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning)
for that it is not necessary (as said
<hi>Saint Augnstine</hi>) for there is not

him on his head in lievv of à Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
Heavens Rainebow; his face

full Noone, with his irradiations,
his glistering beames: his Feete
were like Columnes or great pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of purely bright-burning fire.
In his hand he held a booke ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and treading on the Sea with
his right foote, and on the earth
with his left foote, so loudly strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

that time should haue no being at
all.</p>
               <p>To declare breifly the mysteries
which herein are comprised.</p>
               <p>This Angell according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1362:11"/>
of many Authors, is
Christ our Lord, the Angell of
the great, high and, mighty Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
or is One of the most blessed
Angells, who representeth his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
who hath from him the office
of his Legate or Embassadour;
descended From heaven, for appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly,
most visibly he is to come
downe from thence in a resplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
a cleerly-bright, and most
glorious Cloud, with great and
mighty power to giue Iudgment
on all the world.</p>
               <p>Yet observe also that his being
<hi>covered in a cloud</hi> doth signifie the
confusion, the strange conturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which in those last daies
will appeare, as well in the time
of the raigne and fearefull perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Antichrist, as also when
there shall appeare, such terrible,
such horrible, such dreadfull signes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1362:11"/>
which are to fall out, and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be shewen before the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
iudgment, the day of doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me;
when as the fearful presence
of the Iudge is from moment to
moment looked for.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Rainebow</hi> is the Embleme
or signe of peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Fire,</hi> of Anger, fury, and
chastisment.</p>
               <p>And in the two vttermost boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of humane body, which are
the <hi>Feete</hi> and <hi>heade</hi> (the beginning
and ending thereof) are delineated
the two severall commings of
Christ to the world, whereof the
first was of mercy to make peace
betweene God ad Man, and hence
is it that for deuise he beareth on
his head the <hi>Rainebow of Heauen,</hi>
for signe that the waters of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge,
the afflictions and fore-pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
chastisements were ceased.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1362:12"/>
And in the other he shall come as
a iudge; and hence is it that he is
delineated with <hi>Feete of fire,</hi> which
signifie inflexible, implacable ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
and terrible anger. <hi>Ignis ante
ipsum praecedet</hi> said David,<note place="margin">Psa. 49.</note> he shall
come casting forth fire abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dantly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Forme</hi> and <hi>figure of Colum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

import the mighty povver which
hee will extend in the rigid execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his iudgement and iustice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Open booke in his hand</hi> doth
give vs to vnderstand the eternall
sapience, eternall wisdome which
he hathas God, by vertue whereof
the office of a iudge is his proper
attribute and the fulnes of science,
of knowledge, of wisedome, which
he hath as man to discerne and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse
the reall grounds of things,
the demeanor and desert of all the
sonnes of Adam, and the decreed
rate of the Divine law according
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1362:12"/>
to the which they are to be adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
               <p>The placing <hi>one foote on the Sea,</hi>
and <hi>the other on the Land</hi> is as much
as to say that he surroundeth, that
he comprehendeth the Sea and
land, the land and Sea: and that
there is not ought which can be
exempt from his hands,<note place="margin">Psal. 13.</note> nor hide
it self from his presence.</p>
               <p>The <hi>roaring not vnlike to that of a
Lion,</hi> doth declare the strange an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and inexpressible irefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the iudge, when he shall
pronounce the heauy, and most
dolefull, direfull sentence of the
condemned.</p>
               <p>And the so <hi>Solemne oath</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the infallible certainty,
which shall be in the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,

that, which hee declareth, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth,
he preacheth to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kinde:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1362:13"/>
that in the dayes of the <hi>seauenth
Angell</hi> when as that dreadfull trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
shall be heard, and horridly
resound, which shall summon
to iudgement all the offspring of
Adam, <hi>time for euer and euer shall
cease, shal be consumed, shall haue its
full and vttermost bound and last end,</hi>
and that eternally, that everlastin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly
it shall be wanting to them,
who oportunely did not benefit
themselves by it, but deferred
their well doing when as they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
this Time, vnto the last pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod,
the vttermost day of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Angell</hi> published
the Edict with so many and such
like circumstances and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,
that time should haue its
end once for ever and ever and
when this is to take effect, it is for
that we be informed, and begi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1362:13"/>
fully to vnderstand of what
price, value, and great esteeme it is,
and what greate benefit God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth
to vs, bestovveth on vs, to
make vs <hi>Lords thereof,</hi> the whole
course of our dayes, of our life, and
contrary wise what a great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is that he subtract it from
any one, as being altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of it, it being ill employed:
And to know how precious time is
it would suffice to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate that
in an instant the infinite eternity
of Glory may therein be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
since that man may gaine it
in so litle a space. And hence is it
that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> adviseth vs
to conserue time,<note place="margin">Eccles. 4.</note> as gold careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wrapped vp, as the apple of our
eye, and that we carefully eschewe

successiuely, continually: which
is, as if he should say that we spend

it in good workes, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we loose not ought, no not one

his realle scope is to advertise vs,
to give vs counsaile, and to exhort
vs earnestly to account of time, to
vse time well; oh! yea carefully,
solicitously, and most tenderly,
not onely of a day, but also of each
day; for he who well vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth

his owne proper good and
that of his Neighbours to his full

oh, thou who art a Christian rise

marvailously blamable,

beames of the Sunne rising should
finde thee idle, thee I say sluggish,
and drowsing in thy soft couch.

               <p>Behold, observe well the guifts
bestowed on thee; thou possessest
dayly harvest, and hence each day
is fruite. And in an other Psalme

then, but in the morning, and at

his wordes,<note place="margin">Iohn. 9.</note> Now is the time of pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

the time that one may deserue well,

is it that God Almighty threatneth
a careles sinner, whose manner was
to post of his conuersion and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from day to day, it seeming to
him that he had time, I and euen
time more then was sufficient, very
aboundant, and he thus deliuereth
himselfe: Be not too negligent, be
not careles, play not with time,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1362:33"/>
mocke it not, nor value it for thine

stand on thy guard, least death come
on thee as a theife is wont to doe

that by a suddaine assault it reduce
thee into a miserable exigent, and all
this without that thou know the
houre of its approach. A theife co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to doe mischeife, and taketh
the goods which are not well looked
vnto, not carefully preserued, and
with such diligence which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
whiche they deserue, and such
like is time in the house of a sinner.
And hence iustly our Lord abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him thereof, for that he doth
not spend it in such sort that thereby
he may gaine, and exchange, and
make himself very rich and happy.
And answerable to this our Lord
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1362:34"/>
saith by his <hi>Euangelist S. Matthew:</hi> To
him that hath, more shall be giuen;
from him who hath not, shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, what he had or seemed to
possesse. The iust man esteemeth
time his owne, and is thereof Lord,
and Maister, for that hee well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the vse thereof; and to this he
who is maister of time, more time
shall be afforded him at the period of
his life, more space to recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
to examine, discusse, and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
his conscience; and he shall haue
aboundance, he shall be supplied
with fulnes, all plenty will be bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on him as compleate indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
plentifull grace, and infinite glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and he is not Lord of time, who
whilst he liueth doth not vse it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and tenderly; hence when as
thus deceiued by the deuill, with his
dilation, with his deferring this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,
he thinketh that yet he
hath time, he shall be found by God
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1362:34"/>
his iust iudgement to be depriued
thereof, space of repentance will be
wanting vnto him, either by sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
death, or by some vnhappy
chance, or other: all hitherto are
the vvordes of the glorious <hi>S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardine.</hi>
And hence is it that so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
our Lord doth admonish vs to
watch,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> to be vigilant, for that vve
knovv not the day, the hovver in

and that thy well being and safety
dependeth on it; Be therefore so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
what like à Courtier, well man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered,
and discreet, and giue vvay,
respect, and free entertainement
vnto so honorable à guest. Thou
thy selfe art in thine owne house,
and in thine owne proper soile, for
thou art earthly, and of earth, but
the soule is but à guest in thy hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se,
euen as à stranger, à trauailer

vvould sleepe on hay, and straw, or

Let this be thy way, forsake thy

passe thy pleasures, thy entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

not of dantinesse, nicenesse, but
of pennance: not of delight, not

that hee seemeth to come vnto
thee from forraine countries as à
stranger, but contemplate, obserue
vvell the many, and singular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
which accrew to thee through
his society, his conuersation, and

it vvhich giueth life, spirit, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour

thou vvilt vvell obserue and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what I now deliuer, let it be

that you would be found to bee
if so that it should faile you, and
that it should depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, that

abandon you, and vtterly forsake
you, &amp; your house: in this euen
point, and instant of time, thy ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue
will not be able to doe his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,
thou wilt be vtterly bereaud of
speach; thine eyes will become
blind, thou wilt be depriued of thy
guift of hearing; thy countenance
will appeare pale, all thy beauty
will fade and fully perish, and thou
shalt proue to be terrible foule,
vgly, stark cold, irksome, and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,

Since that vvhich I here deliuer is
true, from whence is it, that for à
small momentary delight that
thou dispensest, and thou notably
offendest, so great à guest, one of
such quality, and so profitable as of
whom so inexpressible vse might
haue been well made? and that
thou takest away it's time, doth
injure it, and stealest from it, and
employest it so ill? but thou canst
not haue euen this thy shadowed

And if so great guifts depend and
accrue to thee through it's presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce

it be in à forraine Countrey, and
banished for sinne from the high

that it is fully reconciled with him,
and in his grace, vvhen so it shall
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1362:71"/>
by him be beloued and one of his

and great inducement &amp; conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
reasons are there, that thou

possible, and vvith all good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

make assaults against vs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of meanes importunate and
earnest prayer is opportune. And
this such like is not so to be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that there may not be à pause

for sleep requireth it's due, feeding
it's, yea and cloathing &amp; some time

are to employ themselues in arts,
vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; diuerse seruices, and to
attend the workes of corporall and
spirituall mercy; What is required
of vs is that in fitting, conuenient,
and opportune time for prayer, we
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1362:86"/>
lift vp our hearts and minds to him
with prayer and humble petition
for vvhat we stand in need of, what
we extreamely want: in such sort
that through the vvhole course of

not found one day or hower vvhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
à man may say, that hee hath
no expresse need thereof, and that
he may decline so important and
necessary à custome and practise.
But to be alwaies praying vocally
or mentally &amp; euermore without
any ceasing, or intermission, there
is not à head, à spirit that can beare
it, nor body that can endure it, nor
doth the lawes of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand it,
nor oblige vs so farre (for his yoke
is sweet, and his burthen light) and
there is some what else to attend

accomplish this, be à man neuer

And for that in this miserable and

And in like manner sayth
<hi>S. Ierome</hi> in his rule, giue no way, no

vvhen thou dost not contemplate,
entertaine thy selfe in some litle

make à litle basket of rushes, or of

whilst the litle seeds sprout vp, and
appeare as grown, pull vp by the

you like well plant some trees,
from vvhich you may in their due

make their honycombes: make

loose time, vvhen so they employ

be ransomed by the doing of good

Many times God Almighty doth

to the course of nature they were
to runne, had they been good (as

à just judge will acquitt him, and
it so happily falleth out, that he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth

to offer it vp to God, and in serious
applying himselfe to God, and to

when he demandeth an imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

was that the years of this life,
are not years, but dayes: and the
dayes, not dayes, but howers, and
the howers, not howers, but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
and the life of the seruants

that those his, yea and many

               <p>And finally he enstyleth his daies

and afflictions, which in it are
found, and which it suffereth, for
temptation is mans life, are the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me
of his life. Hence is it that for
the euills, for the labours, crosses,
misfortunes which often occurre
to man in his daies, the daies are
said to be euill, and in the holy
scripture they are called euill. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
is the day of Doome called
bad,<note place="margin">Psalm. 29.</note> respect had to the euill, and
it goeth vnder the title of sharpe,

shall vnderstand the meaning of
those words which our Lord and

Bee not too much sollicitous of to

You haue enough to doe to
