            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is almoſt incredible to declare what ſtrange and ſpeedy Cures have been performed by my Medicines, the like hath not been known in our Age: For many have been weak and helpleſs for ſome Months, and have been reſtored immediately; but moſt find ſpeedy help, and are recovered to Health in a few days, though judged uncureable by others. Such great Succeſs I have had for many Years paſt, that moſt I have been concerned with are yet living, and able to declare their own Experience. But ſince in my Studies I have diſcovered my Gout-Medicines, it hath pleaſed God by his Bleſſing to perform moſt ſtrange and more miraculous Cures than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I muſt declare it to be the Gift of God, who hath directed me to find out
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:45188:4"/>
ſuch excellent Things, that I never had of Man, nor ever did read them in other Mens Works, or any thing like them: Therefore Thanks be to God, who hath bleſſed my Studies with ſo great Succeſs, as to make me helpful in ſuch an Age as this, wherein many Diſeaſes have proved incureable; and there are others that are very dangerous, and ſome new Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that have puzzled Learned Men to know what to call them: Many that have been afflicted with them, have been loſt for want of Remedies. No doubt but there are excellent things in the World, which Man hath not yet arrived to the knowledg of: Therefore ſuch as by their ingenious Studies do find out hidden things for the preſervation of the Lives of many, ought to be encouraged; and every Gift that God gives to Man, ought to be improved.</p>
            <p>There are ſome envious People in the World, who hate ſuch Medicines as are really good to perform ſpeedy Cures, and do all they can to put People in fear, and endeavour to perſwade againſt them, pretending they are dangerous, though they know not any thing of their Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients. But yet notwithſtanding the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:45188:4"/>
great Oppoſition and envious Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction my Medicines have met with by wicked and malicious Perſons, yet they are become famous; for before the very Face of my Adverſaries, I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed great Cures, which hath ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully put them to ſilence: My Medicines have been often proved by wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Men; therefore let not any regard the evil Perſwaſions of the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or be afraid where there is no man of Danger.</p>
            <p>I deſire no plainer Proof for the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of thoſe that may not yet know my Medicines, than this, that when you ſee the Caſe is deſperate, and there is in the Judgments of all no hopes of Life, then admit that I may come to give my Aſſiſtance, and you will be ſatisfied in my common Succeſs in ſuch Caſes. And this I can ſay for farther incouragement, I never had any died under my hands; but I have been a Means of preſerving the Lives of many when given over, as dying Perſons; and ſome that have been long Speechleſs, and had neither Senſe nor Knowledg of any thing, yet have been recovered to Health again. And the Means that I uſe, are attended with ſo
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:45188:5"/>
great a Bleſſing, that for the moſt part great Alterations, and ſome appearances of Recovery are ſeen before I depart from them.</p>
            <p>It is now as great a pleaſure to me to be doing good, by improving my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, as it was delightful to me in my younger Days to be reading and ſeeking after thoſe things which now I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, through the Goodneſs of God, who maketh me able to do good in my Generation. And though I was croſſed by my Relations, in the things my natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations led me to, yet nothing could prevent me, and God's Hand hath been with me, and hath directed me to the Imployment of healing the Diſeaſed: And it plainly appeared to me, by the much Buſineſs that came in to me of this kind, and the happy Succeſs I have had in my Undertaking, that it is a Work that God hath called me to; and I dare not neglect, but look upon my ſelf bound in Conſcience to follow this Practice. And as God maketh me able, my Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be to do good while I live, and ſhall be ready to be helpful to ſuch as are not able to help themſelves: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let ſuch as are not able to get the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:45188:5"/>
Medicines, apply themſelves to me. But let not any come as Deceivers; for tho I may not know their Condition, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ready to take the Word of any that do but ſay they are poor, yet I have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found out by their Neighbours that they have been Rich: and though they have been unwilling to let their Neighbours know how they came to be cured; yet ſome being importunate with them, being in the like Diſeaſe, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon them to diſcover how they were healed. Let ſuch take heed leſt their Covetouſneſs bring a worſe thing on them.</p>
            <p>My mind is not to exact on any, but I ſhall be willing that every one may have help according to their Condition. I am not forward to take Money where I think I cannot do good, but my deſire is to do as I would be done by: And if the Caſe be difficult, and is ſuch a Matter that I my ſelf do queſtion or doubt of a Cure, I had rather run the hazard at my own Charge, than abuſe People, as ſome do, to take their Money, when at the ſame time they know they can do them no good. Many are greatly abuſed by falſe Pretenders, who ruin them both in Body and Eſtate;
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:45188:6"/>
ſo leave them to periſh, being in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureable Condition. Theſe ignorant ſort of Practitioners are apt to ſpeak ill of others, and think all are Cheats like themſelves; and becauſe they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perform the Cures they undertake, in order to make ſome Profit of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, they will have half down, or elſe they can do nothing: But it is not my way to draw People in after this manner; if I do not ſome good to thoſe that come to me, when I firſt take them in hand, I deſire no Reward. God hath given me that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that in many I am able to give a near Judgment whether they are cureable or not; and do know, if they are cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, nearly the time it will be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and have commonly Succeſs accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my expectation: which maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my envious Adverſaries ſay, How came this Man by this Knowledg? I do give you to underſtand, that I came by it, not by Slothfulneſs, but by my indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Studies: and it was many Years before I came to have the knowledg of the Nature of Diſeaſes; but now, through the Goodneſs of God, I have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> attained to the curing of Diſeaſes, but not with other Mens Receipts, as you report; but theſe
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:45188:6"/>
things by which I do perform ſuch great and ſpeedy Cures, are great Secrets that I have found out by my own Knowledg and Experience.</p>
            <p>I had in my youthful Days a natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſtudy Phyſick; and that which did at firſt put me on it, was for my own Health, being a diſeaſed young Man. In time I obtained my Ends, and cured my ſelf, and ſince I have had great Succeſs in helping of others. Thus by my reading, and much ſtudying, and long practiſing, I have gained Knowledg, and am now able to prepare proper Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines ſuteable for the helping of many Diſeaſes, which I ſhall not here mention; I ſhall only name ſome particular Diſeaſes which I chiefly concern my ſelf in, and wherein I have more than ordinary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs: As in <hi>Gouts, Rheumetiſms, Bedridden-Palſies, Pleuriſies, Cholicks, Convulſions</hi> on Nerves or inward Parts, or ſhrinking of the Sinews, numneſs of Limbs, old Pains. I recover ſuch as have loſt the uſe of their Limbs for many Years, and alſo ſuch as are deprived of the uſe of Nature, or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of Urin, or Stranguries, and moſt painful Diſeaſes, either in the Limbs or inward Parts: Alſo <hi>Dropſies, Yellow-Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,</hi>
               <pb n="x" facs="tcp:45188:7"/>
and <hi>Conſumptions;</hi> alſo venereal and peſtilent Diſeaſes, and <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God hath given me more than an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gift in curing ſuch as I have here named; and I hope he will give me a Heart to improve it. In order to this I publiſh this little Book of Directions, and adviſe ſuch as are at a diſtance in the Country, too far off to have the help that thoſe may have in <hi>London,</hi> or the Towns adjacent, that they be provided with ſome of theſe Medicines to keep by them, that in time of danger, obſerving the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which I ſhall give, they may help themſelves, and do much good for their poor Neighbours: Eſpecially obſerve not to be without theſe three, being of great uſe on ſudden Occaſions; and though I call them the Gout-Medicines, you may read what great uſe they are for in many other dangerous Caſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Gout-Balſam, that takes away ſudden Pains immediately in moſt Caſes; and though uſed outwardly, it helpeth inward Pains in a ſtrange manner.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Gout-Gliſter, obſerving well its Uſe, will do ſtrange Cures, and very ſpeedy, in deſperate Caſes, as you may read.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:45188:7"/>
3. A Pouder for Snuff.</p>
            <p>With theſe three I have been a Means of preſerving the Lives of many; and though they have been ſeemingly Dead, and all motions of Life to appearance have been gone, yet in ſuch Caſes I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them.</p>
            <p>According to what I have known, I do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udg that ſome People in <hi>England</hi> are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried alive: Therefore let this be a Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all, to obſerve well the Bodies of thoſe who are laid out for dead, eſpecially ſuch as die ſuddenly; for though the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may be changed to a dead Colour in all parts, and may be cold and ſtiff after it hath been laid out ſome time; if you do not obſerve it before, obſerve it then, and do not let it go to the Grave, if you find a kind of a damp or cold Sweat on the Stomach, or a little warmth in the ſmall of the Back; then you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there is ſome hopes of Life, though you may not diſcern any Breath. This may be a good Rule for the old Women that are the Searchers of the Dead to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. As for my part I ſhould be very unwilling to bury my Dead before they begin to ſtink or purge, as is uſual, and then I ſhould away with them to their
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:45188:8"/>
Place. This Caution I give, in hopes thereby ſome may be preſerved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored after ſuch-like dying Fits. But my care ſhall be to adviſe and help you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent danger in time by the uſe of Means: And after I have given you large Directions for the uſe of ſuch Means as may be provided to your hand, in the next place I ſhall direct you to prepare ſome neceſſary and uſeful things for the helping and curing of ſeveral Diſeaſes, which may be of uſe in your Family, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for ſuch as cannot be at the charge of a Phyſitian to help them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall alſo communicate unto you ſome Receipts that have cured great numbers of the King's-Evil, and other ſuch-like Diſeaſes; with many other choice Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, that will be of great uſe in many Caſes; that you need not expoſe your ſelves, with hazard of your Lives, to make trial of any falſe Pretenders: for when you are ſatisfied in what you have here before you, I do not ſuppoſe that you will run a hazard, before you have made a trial of your own Preparation, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Directions given you, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when given out by a Perſon of good Report and Reputation, by multitudes of

            <head>A DISCOURSE OF THE GOUT.</head>
            <p>MY Deſign is to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the <hi>Gout;</hi> but it being a Diſeaſe that of late Years is grown ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common, moſt do know what it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, therefore I ſhall not need to make a long Diſcourſe concerning it.</p>
            <p>My Intent is rather to direct you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o that as may help you ſpeedily; and though this is hard to be believed by many, yet by what I ſhall write, you may be convinced that there is one that doth perform great Things,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45188:11"/>
and gives preſent Help in the greateſt Extremity; and ſuch as uſe to be confined many Months, are ſet at liberty in leſs than one Week, but the Pain is taken away in leſs than one Hour. This is the common Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Gout-Balſam, if rightly applied, to which I ſhall give here large and full Directions in all Caſes wherein this Balſam is uſeful: But before I come to that, I ſhall lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſomething of the Nature of the Gout, by ſeveral Inquiries, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Nature of this Diſeaſe, with the Signs and Cauſes.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Queſt. 1.</hi> What is the Gout?</head>
               <p>In general, all may know ſo much of it as to tell 'tis a ſore painful tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting Diſeaſe; but thoſe that are afflicted with it, are more ſenſible to know what it is, and when they may be ſaid to have it, eſpecially after two or three Fits; for uſually it cometh after one and the ſame manner as a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45188:11"/>
the firſt, and about the ſame time of the Year; and for the moſt part it cometh to the ſame Joint or Part where it firſt beginneth; and uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it giveth ſome warning before it cometh; all which doth ſignify to us the Nature of this Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Now the common Signs that do foretel that the Gout is coming, are theſe following Tokens.</p>
               <p>Sometimes an extraordinary Itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Blood, or by ſudden Heat, Fluſhings all about the Body, or ſick Fits, or a Fulneſs after moderate Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or a great Heavineſs, or Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, or a Wearineſs after moderate Exerciſe, or ſubject to Dreams and diſquiet Sleeping, or ill Taſte, or Flemical, or Feveriſh, or a Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Joints, or a Change of the Urine pale: and theſe are ſome of the common Signs that the Gout is coming; but I do not mean that all theſe Signs are in one Body.</p>
               <p>But as there are differing Pains of the Gout, ſo there are differing Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45188:12"/>
and differing Signs: My Intent is but to touch on theſe Things; but if you obſerve, you will have ſome Sign to foretel that the Gout is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as aforeſaid; and in a ſhort time after any of theſe Signs, the Pain cometh, and is commonly violent at the firſt. The Extremity of the Pain cauſeth a Soreneſs, and the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the Humours cauſeth a Weakneſs. Thoſe that are afflicted with this Diſeaſe, are for a long time diſabled; and though it be a Diſeaſe that cometh by Fits, yet for the moſt part every Fit groweth longer, and weakneth the Parts afflicted after the Extremity of the Pain is gone off; ſo the Diſeaſe groweth more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, as the Party groweth in Age.</p>
               <p>Many of late have died of the Gout; and 'tis obſerved, that it is more dangerous than formerly. Thus in ſhort I have ſet before you the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Diſeaſe, and after what manner it cometh; ſo I ſhall come to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45188:12"/>
the ſecond Query, which will ſhew ſome of the immediate Cauſes, the differing Sorts of Pains, in nine parts.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>
                  <hi>Q. 2.</hi> What Parts are afflicted?</head>
               <p>For the moſt part the Pain cometh in the Joints; for the Joints being more looſe and open than other parts, do receive the greater quantity of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that cauſeth the Pain; and for the moſt part the pain cometh to the ſame part again, as if there were the Seat or Settlement of the Humours. Which for ſome Reaſons may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be true, for the Cavity of the Joints being hollow and looſe may be full, and yet nothing ſeen when the pain is greateſt: But after the pain is gone, 'tis common to have a Weakneſs in the Joints, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth on ſome always till the Gout cometh again; for becauſe of the Relicks that do remain in the Joints, it more readily enters in:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45188:13"/>
But when the Joints are full, and the parts ſwelled, then the Humours do ſometimes flow to other parts of the Body; ſo by the increaſe of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, all parts may be afflicted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, both in the Limbs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</p>
               <p>But ſome have it not in the Joints at all, but in the inward Parts only: and uſually when it is in the inward Parts, the Pain is exceeding great for a ſhort time, and runneth about like a Cholick or Spleen, ſometimes like the Pain of the Stone, and ſometimes like the Gripes in the Bowels, and ſometimes like Pluriſies. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are afflicted with the Gout in the inward Parts only.</p>
               <p>Others there are that have the Gout in the Head, and in no other part at all; and the Pain is great by ſits, but doth not continue painful ſo long as it doth in other parts. When the Gout is in the Head only, I have obſerved that it is in the External part without the Scull, and ſo it will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45188:13"/>
flow under the Skin all over the Head at times; but uſually it doth fix on the upper part of the Head, where it doth ſometimes continue for a long time very painful.</p>
               <p>But when the Gout floweth from other parts of the Body into the Head, it is in the Internal part of the Head within the Skull; this is not painful, but cauſeth a lightneſs, and doth often deprive a Man of his Senſes; and indeed it is ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that few eſcape Death: it muſt be extaordinary Means that recover this.</p>
               <p>There is Help to be had in this Caſe; but if Men, through unbelief, are regardleſs of their Lives, they may for want of Means at hand in ſuch a time be caſt away.</p>
               <p>I cannot but pity ſuch as I hear do die of the Gout, for I know ſo much of the Nature of the Diſeaſe, that when the Gout thus cometh from other parts into the Head, they are not ſenſible of their Danger, becauſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45188:14"/>
they ſeem to be at eaſe, and will have a conceit of their doing well when they are near their End.</p>
               <p>If the Danger do appear, by their being in a raving Condition, it's dagerous; I know not where any have been recovered in that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but what I have recovered my ſelf; let ſuch know that have the Gout, that are in fear or danger of their Lives by it, that it hath pleaſed God to provide Means to give help for the preſervation of your Lives in that dangerous Condition: for of all the parts that are afflicted with this Diſeaſe, there is no ſuch danger of Life as when it is thus got into the Head; ſo let this be a ſufficient Caution for you to take help in time.</p>
               <p>The next thing to inquire further, is to know the Cauſe of the Pains of the Gout.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:45188:14"/>
               <head>
                  <hi>Q. 3.</hi> What cauſeth the Pains of the Gout?</head>
               <p>As there are differing Pains, ſo there are differing Cauſes. I ſhall give an account firſt of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ſome the immediate Cauſe is Wind being fixed in the part, and not having vent. This doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſe an Inflammation, or a Swelling that will be very ſore and tender for a long time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſome the immediate Cauſe is a thin and cold whitiſh Water fixed in the Joints, that looſeneth the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaments and other parts, binding the Joints together, that cauſeth a pain and great weakneſs in the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſome the immediate Cauſe, is a ſlimy Matter that is without the Joints: This Humour being cold and thickiſh, cauſeth a hard ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that pitteth like a Dropſy; and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45188:15"/>
the part is cold and ſtiff, but the pain is more moderate than the Humours that are thin. But this ſort of Dropſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Gout uſually continues long<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cauſeth a great weakneſs, except timely prevented.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In ſome the immediate Cauſe is a hot Vapour or Steam, driven into the parts by the heat of the Blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when the Pores are opened where the pain is, this Vapour doth come out like the Smoak of a Chimney that ſhall be ſeen to fill a Room al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with Smoak; and when<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Smoak is come out, the pain is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gone, and the Party walketh about, though helpleſs juſt before.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſome the immediate Cauſe of the pain, is a windy and frothy Blood that ſtoppeth in its Circulation: this ſwelleth in Knobs like the Cramp, is very painful, but quickly over. This is a kind of a ſcurvey ſort of a Gout, and uſually runneth over all parts of the Limbs and Joints.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:45188:15"/>
6. In ſome the immediate Cauſe of the Pain, is a black and ſettled Blood, occaſioned by great cold: This cauſeth univerſal pains in all parts of the Body; yet in this Caſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t is not good to part with your Blood, but rather to cleanſe it, by uſing that Medicine that openeth the Pores: then a ſweating Pill is proper to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off the Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In ſome the immediate Cauſe, is a thick and matter-like Humour, that being fixed long in a place, groweth to a hard kind of a Kernel, that when it is dry it cracketh the Skin, and crumbleth out like little Stones; but the pain is moſt before it cometh to a hardneſs. The beſt time to help this ſort of Gout is, when it firſt beginneth to be painful, for then the Humour is thin, and will eaſily come forth when the Pores are open.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In ſome the immediate Cauſe is, for want of the Blood circulating into all parts: And if the ſtoppage be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45188:16"/>
about the Joints, it eauſeth the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news to be ſtiff and dry, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſhrink, and ſometimes draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Joints together. This will cauſe the Knuckles to be hard and knotty; for by clinching of the Hands together, they are deprived of the Nouriſhment that ſhould come to them by the free circulation of the Blood.

                  <hi>Q. 4.</hi> From whence do theſe Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours come that flow to the Joints?</head>
               <p>There is a great difference in the Judgments of Phyſicians about this Point. One ſaith, they flow from the Head, the external part without the Skull, and ſo flow under the Skin
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45188:17"/>
to the Joints. Others ſay, they flow from the inward parts of the Head, from the Brain: Others from the Bowels: Some name other parts; ſo that if we put the Judgments of all together, the gouty Humours flow from all parts of the Body.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give you my Judgment, and that is, that the Fault lieth chiefly in the Digeſtion, and yet Nature may have ſufficient vent in the lower parts; but the Digeſtion doth not ſo ſpeedily do its Office, by conveying a part of the Suſtenance when 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo ſpeedily as it ought into the lower Veſſels: but when Meat and Drink is received in the Stomach, it uſually ſeemeth to oppreſs with a Fulneſs for ſome time after eating or drinking; and tho Nature doth carry it off after in little time, yet the Food periſheth in the Stomach before it paſſeth; and this doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der natural Nouriſhment, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ill Humours which diſperſe about the Body, but eſpecially to the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45188:17"/>
parts afflicted; but yet every one that hath a bad Digeſtion is not troubled with the Gout: but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is, the Body is much out of order; in ſome it cauſeth Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pains, in others Fevers, and many other Diſtempers which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Body: the Humours are not in all alike.</p>
               <p>But the Humours cauſing the Gout do commonly proceed from a diſorderly Government of the Body, as ſometimes by immoderate Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe or ill Diet, or too much Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Paſſion, or any other vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Motion, and Colds and Heats. Theſe and other ſuch-like diſordering the Body, breed ill Humours, and open the ſecret Paſſages of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and for the moſt part fixeth at the Joints. And this is one part of the Foundation-Cauſes of the Gout.</p>

                  <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Which way do theſe Humours flow into the Joints?</head>
               <p>We cannot be unſenſible that the Branches do receive their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Root, ſo the Limbs do receive their Nouriſhment and Moiſture from the Body; and (as before) I ſay the Food periſheth in the Stomach, breeds ill Humours and not natural Blood: So I conceive that by the ſame way that the Blood paſſeth into the Limbs, ſo do theſe Humours circulate through the Veins and Arteries into the Joints. And the Humours being thin and cold as they flow from the Stomach, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be ſenſibly felt to run through the circulating Paſſages, and to ſettle in the Joints; the Joints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more looſe and open than other parts, do receive the greater Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And this is the way, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Humours flow from the Stomach into the Joints.</p>

               <p>It bringeth away the offending Matter by opening the Pores, and doth thereby prevent the danger of Repelling; for the immediate Cauſe is ſeen to come away from the part afflicted, and this bringeth down the ſwelling of the Gout, and for the moſt part the pain goeth away im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after it is applied: and it doth ſtrengthen weak Limbs, and is very comfortable to cold and nummed Parts. In many Caſes it is a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of great Uſe, as will further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the Directions for the Uſe of it.</p>

               <p>Take a Stick or Quill, and dip in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Pot of Balſam, and ſpot it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the part afflicted, as far as the pain is; then ſtir it about with your Finger very well till it be near dried in, but not by the Fire, for 'tis hot of it ſelf; therefore I order you to ſpot it about, becauſe if you lay on too much in a place it will ſmart: but ſome will bear much to be laid on and feel nothing, therefore my way is to apply a little firſt, and then ſtir that about; and if it be not felt, then I lay on more; and if it do not itch or ſmart, I go over a third time, and all before I put it up; ſo that my way is to apply it till it be felt, and if there be more put on than will be dried in, then I do commonly lay on a piece of Bladder, or any kind of Skin, to keep the Balſam to it, for Clothes will take it away from the part. Thus dreſt, I put it up for four
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45188:22"/>
and twenty Hours, or longer; but if the pain remain, I anoint it again quickly, according as it can be well born or endured. 'Tis needleſs to uſe it when there is no pain; for the beſt time to do the moſt good, is to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it when the pain is greateſt, for then the Humour is in the part, and may be brought forth: But in caſe of a weakneſs remaining after, or any little kind of pain, I do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dreſs the part once in a day, or in two or three days, or once a week, according as Need requires. In this manner uſe the Balſam for the Gout, or ſuch like pains; but if need require, you may uſe it till it bliſter, if the Humour will not go off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; but then anoint the part with any healing thing, as Salet-Oil, or <hi>Lucatellus</hi>'s Balſam, and this will heal it again in a little time; but if it ſwell after 'tis anointed with the Gout-Balſam, apply it again quickly, and the offending Matter will come out.</p>

               <p>Firſt, I ſhall tell you what is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Bodies of ſuch as are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Gout. Salt Meats are not good, nor ſtale Beer, nor no ſharp or ſowre Things, nor mixed Wines, nor Claret, nor too much Spoon-meats, but be ſure to forbear Cyder; theſe and ſuch-like things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void, and be temperate and moderate in the uſe of all things, and this will be a good Rule to obſerve againſt this Diſeaſe. But in the Fit of the Gout you may eat Meat once a day freely; you need not refrain any good Diet no more than at other times. I ſhall not ſtand to name particulars, but in ſhort, you may eat Fiſh or Fleſh, or Herbs, or any thing elſe that is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Food. But ſuch as have had the Gout long on them, and are brought to be weak, and have not an Appetite to common Diet, let them ſtrive to eat and drink ſomething
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45188:34"/>
that is more ſtrengthning than Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Grewel, for ſometimes eating too much of that and other Spoon-meats, brings a Dropſy, and hinders the curing the Gout.</p>
               <p>I ſhall adviſe you to ſuch things as are good to ſtrengthen and nouriſh you; and whereas you can eat but little, eat the oftner, and by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you will by degrees get a better Appetite. But being willing to help you, I will direct to ſuch-like Diet as may be ſutable to help weak Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>In a Morning for a Breakfaſt, Take a pint of Ale, boil it and ſcum it; then take it from the Fire, and let it ſtand till it be half cold, ſo break in two or three new-laid Eggs, brew them together, and drink it while it is warm.</p>
               <p>In my judgment, if a Man hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ot a Stomach to eat a good Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt, he may with ſuch a Morning's-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>raught hold up till Dinner-time. But weak Stomachs want change of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45188:35"/>
Diet. Now if you have a good old Nurſe, they commonly know how to make much of themſelves, and therefore are the better able to adviſe to that as may do good for a Maſter or Miſtreſs. My Mind is, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as are not ſick ſhould get the beſt Kitchin-Phyſick as can be provided, or elſe for want of this Lameneſs may ſoon turn to Sickneſs. I do not intend to fill up my Book with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for Diet, but yet I would give a little help to put your Nurſe in remembrance to ſtudy to make good heartning things to keep up the Body.</p>
               <p>For Change I ſhall give you farther Directions, that you may know what may be good in a Morning, or ſome times between Meals, and uſe the beſt of your skill in providing.</p>
               <p>Good Jellies are proper ſometimes made after this manner.</p>
               <p>Take two Calves-feet, and pu them into three quarts of Water boil them in a Pipkin till half b
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45188:35"/>
waſted away; then ſtrain off the Feet, and ſet the Liquor on the Fire again; put in half a pound of blew Currans well cleanſed, and two pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyworth of Saffron, and half a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an ounce of Cynamon, a dram of large Mace; boil theſe till the Currans be plump, and take it from the Fire, and let it ſtand till it be half cold; then have ready at hand a pint of White-wine, with four Eggs well beaten to mix with the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine, and ſix ounces of fine Loaf-Sugar. Brew theſe with the White-wine very well; then take your Calves-Feet Gelly, being, as I ſaid, half cold; mix all together, beating it very well with a Spoon till it be almoſt cold: this, well prepared, is good to eat at any time, Night or Day; and it may be eaten, either warm or cold, according to the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Year, but in cold Weather warm it a little. This is a good thing in a Morning, to take about half a pint or more.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:45188:36"/>
I would adviſe you for a Dinner to eat Fleſh, though never ſo little; but eat as freely as you can, for that is the beſt way to get ſtrength; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eating againſt Stomach, doth procure a better Appetite againſt the next Meal; for thoſe that are weak, it is not good to boil or roaſt their Meat over-much. I am ſure, for Conſumptive People, Fleſh over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaſted is not good; but if you love not your Meat with the Gravy in it, then you had better ſtew it, and put in Sippets of White-bread; ſo eat it, for then the Liquor is the beſt of it; and Meat thus dreſs'd is ſtrengthning.</p>
               <p>If you are diſpoſed to eat Fowl, 'tis proper to have them well roaſted or boiled. Alſo Fiſh if it be not well dreſs'd, is not good, being ſubject to riſe in the Stomach, and that doth cauſe a loathing of Food. One good way to help the weak, is to ſtudy new things, for often change of Diet is a great help to procure an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite:
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45188:36"/>
and this is the proper Buſineſs of good Cooks and Nurſes.</p>
               <p>I would adviſe you to eat freely in the Day, but at Night be moderate, for then you have more freedom to drink, either Wine or ſtrong Drink, for that is not hurtful, provided you drink not to exceſs: but ſmall Beer is certainly the beſt thing you can take to bring the Gout on you; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you love the Gout, drink good ſtore of ſmall Beer, and you may be ſure it will come with full power. This I can ſpeak by Experience, that I have found that ſmall Beer will bring a Man into a Conſumption ſooner than any thing I know of: I have been caught twice, but I take heed to avoid a third bout, for when I find my ſelf thirſty, I drink good ſtrong Drink. I have ſeen ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the Gout, that with low Diet and ſmall Beer have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſumed to nothing; and the Diſeaſe is much more powerful, and they have no ſtrength to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

It is a miſerable thing that a Man or Woman ſhall be in bodily Health, but yet in great tormenting Pain with a Leg or an Arm, that the very Anguiſh of the Pain ſhall cauſe them to cry aloud till they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent; and yet in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are perſwaded to refrain from eating or drinking of the Beſt, though then they have moſt need of it to ſupport Nature; and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is leſs danger of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to keep the Body in ſtrength, than when the Body is brought low and weak. I do know that what I ſay in this, by admitting you to eat and drink freely in the Fit of the Gout, is contrary to the Judgments of ſome Men; but let none be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended for my giving Advice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my knowledg, of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Diſeaſe: If you think my Advice is not good, then I make my Appeal to you that find fault with me, and I leave you to be Judges by my way of Practice, and by the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45188:37"/>
I have; for no Man can ſay that ever any died of the Gout that have been under my hands.</p>
               <p>It is now near three Years ſince I diſcovered the Gout-Balſam; and I have done greater Cures with that Medicine in this time on the Gout, than have been done by any others, as I have proved before many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. But ſince I have corrected and amended my Gout-Balſam, and diſcovered other great Secrets, I cure many other Diſeaſes, and for the moſt part with outward Medicines: but when I find any that are weak and low, I am conſtrained to direct and adviſe them to ſuch things as are good to ſtrengthen and raiſe them up again.</p>
               <p>After this manner do I deal with thoſe that have the Gout; and have great Succeſs in my Undertakings.</p>
               <p>Thus I have given plain Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that you may do good for your ſelves: But if you do not apply
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45188:38"/>
things ſo well as to have that Succeſs as I have, do not reflect on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or blame him that made them, but rather ſend for him, and ſee what he can do with the ſame Medicines, and then you may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the uſe of them againſt another time.</p>
               <p>You may conclude, that by my publiſhing this Book, my Intention is to do good; for it would be much more for my Advantage if I did not expoſe my Medicines to ſale, my Profit in undertaking Cures would be much more to me, and leſs trouble in preparing. Sometimes they fall into the hands of ignorant People which know not how to uſe them, though directed; and they find fault, becauſe they have laid out their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and are nothing the better. There are others that buy them and turn Doctors, ſo pretend they have the ſame Art with me; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times get a great deal of Money; ſo the People are deceived and cheated,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45188:38"/>
for they may be ignorant of uſing them rightly: theſe things I have known to be done. Others there are that will buy them, thinking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to find out the Ingredients; but that is impoſſible, ſo they deceive themſelves. Many there are that have tried, with all the Tricks and Inventions they could, to diſcover my Medicines, but yet come ſhort of their Deſign.</p>
               <p>My Gout-Balſam hath near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Ingredients in it, but I never knew that Man that could name two things, and yet many will pretend they know what it is made of. Any one that pretends to know that one Medicine, let them make it, for there is but one of the Trade; and if any one can do this thing, he may be my Partner, but till then I ſhall keep it to my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Many there are that would pick Quarrels about my Gout-Balſam, if they could tell how, by finding out ſome dangerous thing in it: but that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45188:39"/>
cannot be done, for they know it may be taken inwardly, and I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it to be ſafe; and though in ſome Caſes it may not do good, yet in this you may be ſatisfied it will not do hurt.</p>
               <p>In ſome Fevers I will uſe it to draw Bliſters on the Temples, and it will give great Relief, it will draw out that Vapour that takes away the Senſes; but if it were hurtful or dangerous, then I venture hard to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it to ſuch tender Part ſo freely as to bliſter it: And if I ſhould uſe ſuch Medicines as ſhould prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, I ſhould not only hurt them to whom I apply them, but do my ſelf greater damage, by being expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Advantage of thoſe that wait for ſuch Opportunities; but my care hath been at all times to prevent them, for I never meddle with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous things, therefore none can take that Advantage againſt me. I know there are ſome Medicines that will cure one and kill another; but

what Medicines I uſe, I can bring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By what I have written, you may be ſatisfied in the ſafe uſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; and by the Directions and Advice I have given, you may be encouraged to make uſe of them your ſelves, or ſend for help, you need not lie in miſery: it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that there is proper Means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to your hand in a readineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a time of need, that will ſet you at liberty, and that very ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45188:40"/>
and by reaſon the very Humou is diſcharged out of the Body through the Pores, you may be preſerved from the Gout for a long time; and by this means ſome are perfectly cured of the Gout. Yet I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cure an old Gout ſo that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhall not need to enlarge any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about the Directions of the Gout-Medicines; you have what is ſufficient to help you in your Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, in many Caſes as well as in the Gout: and you may be further ſatisfied, that none of theſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are in the leaſt repelling; but on the contrary, whereſoever they are uſed, they do prevent the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours getting into the Stomach or Head, and they will certainly ſecure you from that danger; therefore you

may conclude there is no manner o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next thing will be to direct you to what may prevent a return of ill Humours, being alſo proper to hinder the returning of the Gout; and this has been experienced: and tho it be not for my Intereſt, yet I am free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly willing to direct you, and if poſſible ſo to aſſiſt you, that you may never have a Fit more of the Gout.</p>

               <head>A Remedy to hinder or prevent the Gout returning again.</head>
               <p>This is a Pouder that formerly I have uſed in Conſumptions with great Succeſs, I have found it profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in the Gout; it helpeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and cauſeth Nature to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off any offending Matter; cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Stomach, procureth an Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, cauſeth the Body to be in good natural order; and doth, by purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body, prevent ill Humours circulating to the Limbs; and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to take at any time if the Body be any ways diſordered, either by eating or drinking: Then take ſo much as will lie on a new Groat in a Spoonful of Ale, laſt at Night and firſt in the Morning; this obſerved may prevent Sickneſs: But if you fear that by any Diſorder of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or by any Signs appearing that do foretel the Gout is coming, then take the ſame Quantity as before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45188:42"/>
and at the ſame time, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo an hour before every Meal: Or if you find, when you are drinking of Wines or other Liquors, your Taſte is bad, then take of this Pouder ſuch a quantity as before-mentioned, in the ſame Liquor you may be drinking, and it will recover your Taſte. It is profitable in many other Caſes, but if you obſerve this order, it will be a means to prevent the Gout coming on you.</p>
               <p>Theſe Medicines have been tried, proved, and experienced by Learned and Underſtanding Men, and have been ſucceſsful in the ſpeedy and ſafe curing of many dangerous Diſeaſes that have been counted uncureable. God hath by their uſe wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Cures; and there are great numbers of Witneſſes of the Truth of theſe Things, of the Perſons cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that have been in their Beds in a helpleſs Condition; and the very Hour the Means have been applied,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45188:42"/>
their Strength hath been recovered, and have got up and walked about immediately: and many have been preſent who are Eye-witneſſes of theſe things.</p>
               <p>There is hardly one Week paſſeth, but that there is ſome great and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cure performed by theſe Gout-Medicines, being of great uſe in many other Diſeaſes not mentioned in this Book; and in moſt Caſes the Cure is ſpeedily done, both in aged Men and Women, and in young Children: And though in aged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that have been many Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with painful Diſeaſes, yet ſuch have been cured in one Hour's time, and have continued well after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>Such as are Inhabitants in or about the City of <hi>London,</hi> may be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (by enquiring almoſt in any part of the City) of Cures that are done; or if they come to the Author of this Book, they may be ſatisfied what Perſons have been cured in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45188:43"/>
their Condition; and may have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in their own Caſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther curable or not.</p>
               <p>He will alſo give his Advice and Directions to ſuch whoſe Caſes are uncurable, to put them in a way to help themſelves to do that good as can be done for them.</p>
               <p>And as for ſuch as are not capable to prepare Medicines for themſelves, if the Caſe be curable, they ſhall have the Medicines beſtowed on them: and if ever they are in a Condition to be able to pay, I will truſt them till then; but if they have not a Heart to do any thing, then I ſhall not look after them, but leave it to their own Conſciences to do according to their Ability, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing towards the charge of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, that I may the better hold out to help them that can do nothing.</p>
               <p>As for ſuch as are able to pay for their Medicines, they ſhall have them faithfully prepared, and at reaſonable Rates: and I ſhall endeavour, by my
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45188:43"/>
Advice, to give them that Aſſiſtance, that they may receive benefit by them, and have no cauſe to complain that they have laid out their Money and are nothing the better. But if I can ſee the Perſons, or have a right Account brought me, that I may be able to give a true Judgment of their Condition, I ſhall then deal plainly with them, and ſhall not ſuffer them to be at any unneceſſary Charge, for it is againſt my Mind to take Money where I find there is no hopes of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good.</p>
               <p>I am ſo far from coveting Gain to my ſelf, by preparing Medicines for ſuch whoſe Caſes are doubtful, that I had rather give them my Advice and Directions, to make and prepare the Medicines themſelves, and then they will be the more willing to uſe the Means for their own Good, when they know the Ingredients; and in ſo doing they may cure themſelves. But if they have not their Cure, they cannot blame me; for by this you
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45188:44"/>
may ſee my Intention is to do all the Good I can: and though God may deny his Bleſſing on the Means to ſome, yet others by the ſame Means may be cured; therefore let none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of Help, but rather wait upon God in the uſe of Means for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in hopes of Succeſs in the End. And though the Means I uſe my ſelf is for the moſt part very ſucceſsful in performing preſent Cures, yet ſometimes in ſome Diſtempers it doth require longer time. There are ſome whoſe Diſeaſes are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, but ſuch are commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, after the Means I uſe is once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: and ſome there are that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfectly cured, but yet do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive great help; and by the uſe of Means do keep up their Bodies that they can walk abroad. But Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hath ſhewed, that when they have not had the Means at hand, the Diſeaſe hath got Advantage again.</p>
               <p>By reaſon of the differing Cauſes of bodily Diſeaſes, it is impoſſible for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45188:44"/>
Man to find ſuch an infallible Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine as to cure all Diſeaſes. But there are for natural Cauſes, natural Helps; and for differing ſorts of Diſeaſes, there are many ſorts of Medicines proper for their Cures: And thoſe that have Underſtanding will ſeek for help in time, if they know where to have it, for it is difficult to find out ſuch as have good Skill and a good Conſcience. Many will ſay, the World is a Cheat; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>All Men are Liars;</hi> and it may be you will ſay, you have met with ſuch ill uſage that you know not who to truſt, eſpecially in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern Life and Health: in this you are at a loſs and know not what to do, and bodily Diſeaſes come on a ſudden; and commonly in haſte you run to the next that comes to hand for help; but if it prove not a skilful Man, it may be there is a Life loſt, or ſome Miſchief done for want of a right underſtanding of the Diſeaſe, and for want of a proper
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45188:45"/>
Remedy. And ſuch as ſeek only their own Intereſt, will make Profit of them, and make it no Matter of Conſcience whether they live or die; and if they know they can do no good, they will not be ſo honeſt as to tell them ſo, but will keep them in hand while it is too late for others to help them. There are too many ſuch Practitioners, and this is a great Diſcouragement, and makes many afraid to put themſelves into the hands of Phyſicians; but I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſuch that are in Health, to get knowledg of an able Phyſician be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sickneſs comes; and thoſe who know their bodily Diſeaſes, to be provided of ſuch Remedies as they hear do cure others in the like caſe; and this is the way not to be deceived. Believe not any Man by his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port only, nor by a bare Diſcourſe of others, but get plain proof of his Skill, and then you may venture with ſafety.</p>
               <p>

Now ſince I have been in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Gouts, Rheumetiſms and Palſies, and all ſuch-like painful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and weakneſs of Limbs, there are ſome that would ſeek to ruin me if they could, and do hate me, and are maliciouſly ſet againſt me for my doing good: I could name ſome, but I ſhall omit that now; and if they give me farther Occaſion, I ſhall make them aſhamed of their Doing, for no Man ſhall diſcourage me from improving the Gifts God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me; and all may know what great Succeſs I have had by what I have written.</p>
               <p>I am unwilling to put Perſons Names in print that I have cured, by reaſon many are troubleſome to go and make enquiry when they have no occaſion.

               <p>But that which is my Practice, the Doctors do not pretend to, as to cure or help the Gout after that ſpeedy manner as I do, for theſe are new things of late diſcovery, that no Man knoweth but my ſelf; and though many are unbelieving, yet what is

               <p>I did never uſe <hi>Aquafortis</hi> in my Life. And in anſwer to this Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, among the many things that have been named by the Doctors and other Practitioners, put the Judgments of all together, they never named more than one thing in it. You may know by what I have already decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that there is nothing hurtful or dangerous in it, becauſe I can take it inwardly my ſelf, and in the very Nature of the thing, in drawing any venomous Matter out of the Body.</p>
               <p>And further, let any Doctors, or others, propoſe what way ſoever they will to apply it, on purpoſe to do all the hurt they can with it, I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

my own Body for the Trial and Proof of it in Publick, if required. If there were danger of doing Miſchief with it in the uſe of it, then it would have been diſcovered before this time, for I have applied it to Men, Women and Children, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did hurt to any; and I do uſe it freely to bliſter the Part, if need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>But you will not believe this, that I dare uſe it ſo freely; I ſhall give ſome proof of this to help your Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, for in ſome Caſes I cannot cure the Diſeaſe without bliſtering the Part; it doth not make any large bliſtering, but they riſe as Pimples; which if you ſuffer your Woollen Cloth to chaſe the Part, this will cauſe the Skin to come off, but it will quickly heal again; this is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Miſchief that can come on it, but is often profitable if wiſely ordered.

               <p>Mrs. <hi>Hathaway</hi> in <hi>Browns-Lane</hi> in <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> had Bliſters drawn on both her Temples with this Balſam, in an Apoplectical Diſeaſe; ſhe had lain as dead for a long time before I came to here, and no hopes of her Life: But after I had applied this, and other of my Gout-Medicines, ſhe was recovered to her Speech in half an hour, and revived, and roſe up in a very ſhort time after. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to lay ſomething to draw the Bliſters, and to keep them run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; which ſhe did, and they run for two Weeks, and ſo healed up. After this ſhe had her Health bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

than ſhe had for many Years before.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Clifton</hi> in <hi>Old-Fiſhstreet</hi> has been confined by the Gout for all the whole Winter, ſeveral Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but was ſet at liberty about <hi>Chriſtmaſs</hi> laſt, who uſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined till <hi>May.</hi> His Humours were drawn off by bliſtering the Parts with this Balſam.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Jacobs,</hi> Turkey-Merchant in <hi>Aldermanbury,</hi> by Bliſters on his Feet, had help for the Gout, that came out like Gravel, and Dropſy-like Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours which came away as clear Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, near half a Pint in one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Hide</hi> in <hi>Stanhope-ſtreet,</hi> had Bliſters drawn for the Stony-Gout, which brought out the Humours like
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45188:50"/>
thick Curds, and prevented the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Pain, by diſcharging of the Humour in this kind of way, and then it healed up again in a very ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Terry</hi> at the King's-Head in <hi>Cheap-ſide,</hi> had it freely applied for Bliſters on his Knee, to bring out Humours, that cauſed the ſhrinking of Sinews, that he could hardly go with Crutches; but in leſs than 12 Hours his Sinews were brought out, and he could walk without Crutch or Stick.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Howard</hi> at <hi>Limehouſe-Corner,</hi> that was much afflicted with the Gout, and could not be helped, till by Bliſters the Humours were let out, and then he was at eaſe, and could walk abroad. But ſometimes the Bliſters will be healed up in one Night's time, then I apply it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again: but ſome are ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed up, that I am forced to dreſs it on the Bliſters, and open them three or four times one after

another. After this manner he was helped, and kept well for a long time.</p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> at the Bell in <hi>Wood-ſtreet,</hi> was afflicted with a painful tormenting Diſeaſe in one Hand; it was ſwelled all over the Hand, and about the Wriſt, as if it had been poiſoned: She lay in a miſerable Condition for many Weeks, and neither Doctors nor any others could give her Eaſe till I was ſent for; then did I apply this Balſam, which did immediately take away her Pain, and afterwards dreſſed it freely to raiſe theſe Bliſter-Pimples; ſo the venomous Humour came out, and in this manner was ſhe cured.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Tarrant,</hi> at the Bell in <hi>Booth-ſtreet</hi> in <hi>Spittle-Fields,</hi> was greatly afflicted with Sciatick Pains in his Hip and Thigh, that he was almoſt conſumed away like a Conſumptive Man, and kept in Bed in a helpleſs Condition, and there was no Help nor Eaſe could be had till I came;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45188:51"/>
then I applied the Balſam, and bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered the Part, and the Humour came away; ſo he had preſent Eaſe, and was recovered to go abroad in a few Days: and by applying it two or three times, he was perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and is well in Health, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than he uſed to be in former time.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> on <hi>Wapping-Wall,</hi> was very lame, and in tormenting Pain night and day; was perfectly cured by once dreſſing.</p>
               <p>Multitudes of People have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved great Good by my Medicines in many Diſeaſes which I do not make mention of: but you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by what I have given you, that my principal intended Buſineſs, is to attend ſuch who are afflicted with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45188:53"/>
Gouts, Rheumatiſms, Palſies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and all ſuch-like Caſes. I have cured ſome that have been lame many Years, and the Cure hath been performed very ſpeedily; but ſome do require a longer time. This you may conclude, if I undertake a Cure, you may be encouraged it ſhall be my loſs if I do not perform it.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould tell here the Cures I have done for Conſumptive People, you could hardly believe it, but I ſhall not inſiſt here on ſuch things: If I could have had time, I ſhould in pity have writ ſomething to help ſuch in this Book, but that I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the next Impreſſion, and in the mean time ſhall be willing to help ſuch by my Advice, if they can come or ſend to my Houſe.</p>
               <p>Now I muſt return to the Matter intended, for if I ſhould fill up my Book with never ſo many Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of curing the Gout and ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Diſeaſes, yet ſtill ſome cannot or will not believe this to be true,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45188:54"/>
that there is a Man that can do theſe things.</p>
               <p>In a Trial at Law, in difficult Matters, the plain Proof of two or three Witneſſes on Oath, puts an end to all Controverſies, and both Judg and Jury is convinced to believe, and judg according to the Proof and Truth of the Evidence. Such large Proof hath been given of ſpeedy Cures of many diſeaſed Perſons, of Gouts, Rheumetiſms, Palſies, and ſuch-like, and were ſo ſpeedily freed of their Pains, that it is incredible to declare it. But that you may be convinced of the Truth, I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you the Teſtimony of ten Men, who have declared on Oath, every Man in his own Caſe, their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cures, and how ſpeedily done: in the preſence of many Witneſſes was this Proof given, before the Right Honourable Sir <hi>John Fleet,</hi> late Lord Mayor of the City of <hi>London.</hi> And for a farther Confirmation, he hath given it in writing under his own
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45188:54"/>
Hand; alſo ſubſcribed by his Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney at Law.</p>
               <p>It cannot be ſuppoſed that I ſhould put a Cheat on the People by publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, or that I ſhould dare to counterfeit the Hand-writing of ſo great a Magiſtrate, which would but expoſe me ſhamefully to ſuffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſo doing. All rational Perſons may believe this is Truth, therefore I ſhall not need to give any of their Names in this Book; but ſuch as deſire to be further ſatisfied, may ſee every Man's Affidavit in Writing under their own Hands, or may have a printed Paper of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py at the Author's Houſe; with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others who have given under their Hands the manner of their Cures, therefore ſhall not mention any of them here.</p>
               <p>Several of theſe alſo are perfectly cured by my Gout-Balſam, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied freely to bliſter the Parts; by which all may be well ſatisfied there is no danger, though it may bliſter
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45188:55"/>
and cauſe the Skin to come off where it is freely applied: but yet ſome Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are ſo differing from others, that if they uſe never ſo much, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feel it, and it will not cauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pimple or Bliſter on them; but yet though it be not felt, it doth ſo open the Pores that it lets out the Diſeaſe, let it be Wind or Water, and no more to be ſeen afterwards than if nothing had been done: ſo ſome are cured with eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, rather than puniſhment, by u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. And this may be obſerved for a Rule, if you do not feel it you may uſe it as often as you will; or if you are minded to uſe but little, it doth require the longer time for your Cure.</p>
               <p>Now this is my way of vindicating my ſelf, by giving you a plain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count what is done by my Medicines, rather than to name or publiſh what envious lying Perſons report. If I ſhould be as unkind to them as they are to me, I could ſpoil their Practice
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45188:55"/>
and ſelling of Medicines, by making known what Diſcourſe has paſſed to me in the hearing of others; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have viſited me in pretence of Love, that will in other Company ſpeak againſt me without a Cauſe, being only envious for my Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and good Succeſs in Buſineſs; and there are many offended at the Good I do: It would be a Crime in me if I ſhould not do Good; and the Cures I perform prefer me in Practice, and the Succeſs I have ſhameth my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who are not able to do the like.</p>
               <p>You have had an Account here of Cures moſtly concerning the Gout, and ſuch-like painful Diſeaſes, that have been performed chiefly by the Gout-Balſam, being freely uſed to bliſter the Parts, and no hurt done to any. Thus you have that which is ſufficient to prove them Liars that would ſay 'tis a dangerous Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>

The next thing, as a farther Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Excellency of my Gout-Balſam, is to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what ſtrange Cures have been done in Palſies, and ſuch-like Caſes, with the uſe of that and my other Gout-Medicines.</p>

In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two Hours I did remove the Cauſe, and ſhe was comfortably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and in four days time ſhe was cured.</p>

At laſt I was ſent for by a Letter to come at a ſet time; ſo when I came there was Dr. <hi>Merity,</hi> and two of the College-Doctors, and ſeveral others: After a little diſcourſe, I began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply my Medicine, which did in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time cauſe a ſenſible feeling
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45188:59"/>
of the Blood circulating, and in leſs than two hours he ſtood up, and his ſtrength began to come; he walked about a little then. Now as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the Cauſe of this was from Convulſions on the Nerves and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Parts, and by this means the Limbs were affected with a palſical Diſeaſe, that taketh away all ſtrength whereſoever it cometh; the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had appeared by twitchings in his Toes &amp; Feet: but after the means had been applied about three or four hours, he appeared more ſtrongly. Then I came with my Medicines that cure Convulſions, and in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour I brought away the very Cauſe, and from that time he never had any more Convulſions then his ſtrength came, and the next day he walked about without any help; ſo I dreſſed him a ſecond and a third time. Thus he was perfectly cured in about four days time. This was in cold froſty Weather this laſt Winter, ſo it was two Weeks before he went abroad.</p>

Madam <hi>Hudſon,</hi> on <hi>Tower-hill,</hi> was much after the ſame manner as Mr. <hi>Meriton</hi> was, both in the Limbs and inward Parts; only hers was all on one ſide of the Body, half the Head, one Arm, and one Leg; but in the inward parts all together as he was; and had been in this Condition about four Months, and all means was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, and no help could be had: though ſhe had all done as the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors could adviſe her, yet ſtill ſhe remained in this Condition till I came. I applied the Means, and in 24 Hours ſhe was in good order, and ſtronger and better to walk with that Leg that was lame, than with the other, for ſhe was weak in all parts with lying ſo long, and a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Woman long before. This great Alteration was done, chiefly by the firſt dreſſing; and ſince it has been her lot to fall into my hands, I hope, by my Direction, and God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to cure her of the Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have done much in helping
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:45188:60"/>
her, both for the Cholick and Stone, and hope to ſee her in good Health on all Accounts: She is now under the uſe of Means for the Conſumption, and is in a good way of recovery.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Boulton</hi>'s Kinſman, living near the aforeſaid Mr. <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Holborn,</hi> was lame of a nummed and dead Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy: It affected all parts, both Head and Body, eſpecially from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Body to the Toes ends; both his Legs were dead and cold, had no feeling at all; pinching, pricking, or cutting, nothing could hurt him: He was tried, but, he ſaid, if we would cut off his Legs, he ſhould not feel it; they were alſo pale, and looked like the Limbs of a dead Man. This put me to a ſtand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I had beſt do any thing to him or not: I had him then took out of Bed, and laying him croſs on the Bed, I dreſs'd him; and after a little time he felt a pricking in both his Legs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Then he began to be warm, I ſtill chafed the weak parts till he had
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45188:60"/>
good feeling; I pinched him and he cried out. In a little time his ſtrength came; in leſs than two hours time I had done all, and put on his Clothes, and he walked down two pair of Stairs preſently, without Stick or Crutch; then I left him among the Family. This was done the firſt dreſſing, being the fourth day of this inſtant <hi>May</hi> 1694. This young Man liveth with his Uncle, who keeps a Publick Houſe in <hi>Bloomsbury</hi>-Market. He is a Tapſter, and hath ſince gone up and down Stairs to draw Drink, from five a Clock in the Morning till Night. But this was too hard for him, for it hath cauſed a ſtiffneſs in his Limbs; yet he will be well of this in a little time, if not neglected or over-wrought before he hath got his full ſtrength.</p>
               <p>A young Gentlewoman at Mr. <hi>Millers</hi> (the Bull-head Tavern in <hi>Woodſtreet</hi> near <hi>Cheapſide)</hi> was taken with a Dead-Palſy on all one ſide of her Body; it drew her Mouth, cauſed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45188:61"/>
an Impediment in her Speech, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected her Senſes being much in her Head, and her Limbs on that ſide were as dead. Thus ſhe lay in a helpleſs Condition for ſome Weeks, and none could help her. Mrs. <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> came to hear of ſome Cures I had done in that Street, and ſent for me: In like manner I dreſſed the dead Parts, and before I went out of the Houſe, ſhe walked about without any help; in about a Week's time ſhe walked ſtrongly: her Head is alſo recovered, but her Arm is not yet, by reaſon of her being blooded; therefore remember my Cautions: By this Arm it may be ſeen how ſhe was in other Parts; I have her yet in hand for her Arm, and hope in time to recover that alſo. This is one of the firſt Queſtions I ask in any ſuch-like Caſes, <hi>Are they blooded?</hi> A Word to the Wiſe is ſufficient. If my Advice had been obſerved but two Years ago, as it is now, I am ſatisfied ſome might have been yet
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45188:61"/>
living that are now a rotting in their Graves.</p>
               <p>What ſad Objects are daily ſeen, of Perſons afflicted with Palſies and other Diſeaſes, as we walk the Streets, that could never be helped becauſe no Cure was found out for them! and great Numbers do lie in Beds in Chambers and Garrets, hid from the World, and thus they lie till they die. What if God ſend Means at laſt to help ſuch Objects of pity, why ſhould any be offended at this? You have heard what I have done; you know what I can do by what I have ſaid before; How ſhall I ſatisfy you further? Will nothing ſerve but I muſt unfold theſe Secrets to you? Muſt I give my Labour to another, and my Skill to ſuch as love not to take pains? it's not reaſonable. But yet to ſatisfy you further, I will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſomething of the Nature and Safety of this Gout-Balſam, that you may have nothing more to ſay againſt it by your falſe Suppoſitions.</p>

               <p>Firſt of all; You ſay 'tis dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous becauſe it will bliſter: You have heard of the Cures that have been done that way by its uſe. What I declared further is truth, and if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired can give it on Oath, that the moſt dangerous part in it is often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in Cordials by Doctors, that there is nothing in it but what is taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. And further, ſome of the Ingredients are often eaten for Food, and for the moſt part is in common uſe, but eſpecially in Summer-time in moſt Families: Thus far I declare, find out the reſt. You may ſuppoſe I do ſomething more than ordinary to draw out the Virtue, to make them uſeful in this way, but it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble if I would to raiſe any dangerous Matter from the Ingredients; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any part thereof repelling,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45188:62"/>
but all on the contrary; and is ſo far from doing any hurt, that it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of all Danger, as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the manner of its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>What I have laid down is ſufficient to give Satisfaction, both to you as have given a wrong Judgment in the Matter, and to others that may be fearful and timerous; no Man hath any juſt Cauſe to be offended at me, for I am not willing to ſpeak againſt others, except in my own Defence, and deſign not to give offence to any; therefore to remove all Prejudice and Envy, I ſhall make an Apology to the Practitioners in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> to let them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, my Buſineſs may be a help ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a hindrance to them, ſo we may agree together to ſerve our Friends.

although you know my Skill and great Succeſs, you are ſo unkind to your Friends, as to let them lie in Miſery till they ſeek out for farther help, and ſo hear of me.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45188:64"/>
Medicines as you have; and this puts ingenious Men to ſtudy to find out ſomething elſe; and if they do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that which effectually doth Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs according to expectation, who ſhall be offended at this?

                  <p>I do not intend to caſt any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on you, for your Medicines are very neceſſary and uſeful; and moſt of you have good Buſineſs, and no cauſe to complain: As for my part, I ſhall not prepare any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines that belong to your Trade; but thoſe things that I prepare, are more like Food than Phyſick; and I am ſo far from hindering your Buſineſs, that I rather promote it, by giving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to my Patients to the uſe of your Medicines, as occaſion requires. If it were in my way to ſerve you more, I ſhould certainly do it; my Buſineſs doth not lie among the Sick, but with them that are Lame, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der painful Diſeaſes; and for ſuch I

                  <p>I do know ſome of you are very angry with me, becauſe I often come where you are concerned: You ſee I raiſe your Patients on their Legs; and why ſhould you be offended? the great Succeſs I have, ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther move you to promote my Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines by your Advice; when you ſee the Caſe requires it, you would do well to ſend for my Aſſiſtance: and ſeeing you do not prepare your own Medicines, and you cannot find any other Perſon that can do what you know I can, I ſhall therefore give my Attendance to ſerve you, if you think well of it.</p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:45188:65"/>
Let this Offer be well taken, and let not any be offended; and ſuch as have been angry, I hope will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again: if you will not be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, I cannot help it; and though you have threatned me, and do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend if you can to put a ſtop to my Practice, I will ſtand in my Defence againſt you; if you can do the like, I will give place to you. The Law is not intended to bind Mens Hands from doing good, nor made for the private Intereſt of ſome particular Perſons, but the intent is for the good of all the Subjects; and if any prove otherwiſe, our Parliaments can repeal or amend ſuch Laws if they ſee good. Commonly ſuch as are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to others for well-doing, do but little good themſelves, but ſeek their own Intereſt more than the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of others.</p>
                  <p>I do not intend any long Diſcourſe of this kind, being not willing to give any Offence; but becauſe ſome malicious Perſons have interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45188:65"/>
me in my Buſineſs, and ſhew their malicious Intentions, what they would do if they had Power, I am well ſatisfied in my Mind, that they have ſuch Malice againſt me, that if Opportunity ſerved they would certainly do me a Miſchief. If it lie in my power I ſhall be ready to do them good, and ſhould be glad I had not occaſion to mention theſe things; but I ſhall forbear, in hopes that all Anger and Malice may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in time. I have now ſome that are my very good Friends among you, and I ſhall endeavour ſo to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have my ſelf in my publick Buſineſs in the World, that I ſhall give no juſt Cauſe of Offence; but if I muſt fight, my greateſt Weapon ſhall be my Pen to defend my ſelf: I am peaceable of my ſelf, and not eaſily provoked; but if I'm forced, I ſhall do as well as I can, truſting God will be my Defence.</p>

They have done more harm to others, than they can do to me; for many that might have been cured, are now uncureable, and ſome are dead as might have been living. But thus it hath been in former Ages, evil-minded Men are offended at any good Works: and as they love not to do good themſelves, ſo they would hinder others; had they but Power, they would, like devouring Beaſts, deſtroy their Fellow-Creatures.</p>

                  <p>TAKE a Kilderkin, or a leſſer Veſſel, with one end out; and put into your Veſſel two Gallons of Spring-water; then put into the Water three Pounds of Stone-Lime unſlacked, ſtir it about very well; put in two Gallons more, and three Pound of Lime, ſtirring it: then add more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Lime, to what quantity you pleaſe, ſtill ſtirring it till it hath done hiſſing; then cover it up for nine Days, and it will be very clear.</p>
                  <p>Then take of this Lime-water two Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, and put into a Stean, or Pot; then put in half a Pound of Liquoriſh ſliced, and half a Pound of Anni-Seeds, and half a Pound of Currans beaten, with half a Pound of white Saxafras-Root ſliced; ſtir them all together, and after 24 Hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to drink of it.</p>
                  <p>Take half a Pint firſt in the Morning, and at four in the Afternoon, and laſt at Night, for ſome Weeks together. 'Tis beſt for this Diſeaſe to take it at Spring and Fall if need be, for a Month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

This King's-Evil Drink hath cured ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of this Diſeaſe; and being a great cleanſer of the Blood, is good in many other Diſeaſes, as hath been experienced: It works chiefly by Urine, And helps<list>
                        <item>Scurvy and Dropſy,</item>
                        <item>Ulcers and Impoſthumes,</item>
                        <item>Piles and Fiſtula's,</item>
                        <item>Conſumption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>waſtings,</item>
                        <item>Cinpanies,</item>
                        <item>Stone and Gravel,</item>
                        <item>Swelling and Sores,</item>
                        <item>All Corrupt Humours,</item>
                        <item>Shortneſs of Breath,</item>
                        <item>Want of Appetite.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you have any Wound or dangerous Sores that may be under Cure, then drink of this, and it will help the Cure by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the Blood.</p>
                  <p>I have obſerved, that the King's-Evil and other corrupt Diſeaſes, are moſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong poor People: I hope this Receipt, with other Directions I ſhall give, will be of great uſe to help ſuch, and be a means of preſerving their Limbs, that they may be able to work for their Livings; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45188:70"/>
poor Families have been ruined for want of Cure in many ſuch-like Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                  <p>If you make a quantity it will not keep long, except you leave out the Currans; if you leave them out it will ſerve: Or you may mix up a little, and have it freſh. If you would make it pleaſant, you may put in a ſpoonful of Syrup of Elder-Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries into every Draught, or ſweeten it as you like it.</p>
                  <p>Now if your young Children have need of it, if they cannot drink a Quantity to do them good, let them drink the oftner: If they drink it for their common Drink ſeveral Weeks together, it is profitable ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>Some Gentlemen that have experienced it, will drink it a Month together for the Scurvy.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo good for any itching or ſcabby Diſeaſes to drink, for ſix or eight Weeks together if occaſion be.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Another thing good to add to this Drink if need require.</head>
                  <p>Take of thoſe things commonly called Hog-Lice, or as ſome call, Lock-cheſers, becauſe they role round up in your Hand.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45188:71"/>
Dry theſe and pouder them, and take as much as will lie on a Sixpence, laſt at Night, and firſt in the Morning, in a Spoonful of the King's-Evil Drink; then drink a little after it, but not ſo much as when you do not mix this Pouder in it. Obſerve when you take this, follow it for nine days together.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>A Plaiſter for the Swellings of the Evil.</head>
                  <p>Take a Handful of Hounds-tongue, and boil it in a Pint of Oil: Then ſtrain your Oil, and to half a Pint of this Oil, put in half a pound of Red-lead; boil them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a quarter of an hour, or ſomething longer, till it be fit for a Plaiſter. Apply this to the ſwelling, and let it ſtick on till it drops off; then apply another if need be. This is good to diſſolve the Swelling.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>For running Sores of the Evil.</head>
                  <p>You may apply this Plaiſter, and if it run much, lay on a freſh Plaiſter once in two days; but open it twice a day, and waſh it very well with Lime-water; this will keep it clean, and in time heal it up. It is not good to uſe Plaiſters that draw much, that is hurtful; for by drawing the Humours too much to one place, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45188:71"/>
ſharp, there will be danger of hurting the Bones.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>Another Help for running Sores.</head>
                  <p>Take the inward Bark of Elder, and boil in Lime-water; then waſh the Sores twice a day with this, and ſometimes lay on El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-leaves for ſome days for change; after two or three days apply the Plaiſter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: this obſerved, will keep all the Sores in good order, better than if they kept to one thing, eſpecially if the Humour be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſharp. If you do make good uſe of theſe things, you may have great Succeſs in curing the King's-Evil, eſpecially if you apply them in time, then the Cure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed quickly: I have cured ſome in a month, and others in leſs time; but when the Diſtemper is old and fixed, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a longer time: ſtill keep uſing the Means, you will find encouragement by the Amendments. You muſt keep to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Means till it be well; the Drink need not be taken but according to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, chiefly at Spring and Fall. I wiſh you may have the Succeſs I have had in the King's-Evil and Scurvy, and other cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Humours, you have the ſame Means. Next I ſhall give Directions for ſuch as have ſore Breaſts.</p>
