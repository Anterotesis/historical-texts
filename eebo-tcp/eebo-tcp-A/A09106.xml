         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But if the said Reader go to the place, where I do handle this matter, both in the second and seuenth Chapters of this my Answere, he will fynd, that I say no such thing, either in word or sense, but rather the quite contrarie: to wyt, that there is an externall speach (as that of <hi>Saphyra</hi> in the Actes of the Apostles, for therof was the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion) which no mentall reseruation can iustify from a lye, and consequently nor make properlie an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, for that it is false in the mynd of the spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and so cannot stand with the nature of Equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation (that allvvayes must be true) as hath byn largely demonstrated in our Treatise of that matter.</p>

(saith he) <hi>from my aduersary, tooke I matter of comfort, presuming that he that would write in defence of mentall Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would be found to equiuocate in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting also.</hi> This you see is but a presumption, and that a very poore one.

                  <hi>His strong presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

But if they cannot (as I assure my selfe without making of more new, they cannot) then is neither <hi>M. Mortons</hi> cause safe, nor his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sound in this behalfe. Nay his <hi>sheild</hi> and <hi>buckler</hi> is vtterly broken, and his Cittie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge quite ouerthrowne.</p>

            <p>And by this you see, that <hi>M. Morton</hi> is still doing, whether well or euill, God knoweth.

                     <hi>M. Mortons</hi> first argument discussed, about a competent and incompetent Iudge.</head>
                  <p n="31">31. His first argument is taken from my wordes, where in my treatise of Mitigation I do say thus:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Preamb. p.</hi> 46.</note> That in mentall reseruation the speach agreeth to the mynd, and meaning of the speaker, for that when I do say to an incompetent Iudge,<note place="margin">

So I. And hitherto <hi>M. Morton</hi> cyteth my owne wordes, though somewhat brokenly, but yet cutteth of who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the other that immediatly do ensue and make all playne, to wit, (<hi>seeing I haue no obligation to respect any thing what the demander speaketh, or asketh, for so much as he demandeth me against law and equity</hi>). Well this is no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14530:71"/>
playne dealing, as you see. But what argument will <hi>M. Morton</hi> frame out of these my words? <hi>Marke</hi> (saith he) <hi>The truth of Equiuocation is not suspended vpon the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the hearer, who may conceaue, or misconceaue the speach.</hi> so he. But what is this to the purpose? I grant that the truth of any answere made vnto a Iudge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not vpon the vnderstanding, conceipt, or capacity of the said Iudge, but vpon the meaning of the speaker, which meaning notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is to be measured by the compete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, or incompetency of the Iudge.<note place="margin">How the truth of a speaker may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of the Iudg that heareth or demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</note> For if the Iudge be competent, then is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer bound to answere to his intention, and to haue that meaning in his answere which the Iudge hath in his demand: but if he be not competent, then all this obligation ceaseth, and the speaker is free to haue what meaning h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Morton</hi> that the difference of competency of Iudges in the cases of the woman and Priest doth make no diuersity in the truth of their answers, and yet will he needes conclude with this consequence (hauing said no more then I haue touched) that for so much as I said in the Treatise of <hi>Mitigation,</hi> as before you haue heard, that <hi>no clause of reseruation could saue the speach of</hi> Saphyra <hi>from a lye</hi> (for that it was to her lawfull Iudge, to whome she was bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere directly to his intention) <hi>ergo, I do condemn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He saith for that there is no difference in effect between this speach of <hi>Saphyra, I haue sold it for no more, to tell it you,</hi> &amp; of the Priest, I am no Priest, to tell it you.

And this opinion of <hi>Caluin, Bellarmine</hi> proueth out of his owne cleare words in sundry places of his workes, as namely <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Instit. cap.</hi> 20. <hi>&amp;</hi> §. 24. <hi>&amp;</hi> 25. §. 6. So as in setting downe this assertion of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Bellarmine, M. Morton</hi> hath made him to tax all Protestantes, and to say, <hi>they do teach</hi> &amp;c. wheras he taxeth only three particuler men. Neyther haue I yet read any other that defendeth the same. Let vs see now how he maketh <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to contradict himselfe, for herin stands the principall drift of <hi>M. Morton,</hi> in this place, to seeme thereby to say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what against him.</p>
                  <p n="92">92. First then he bringeth in these words as of <hi>Bellarmine: It is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon obiection of Protestantes prouing from Scriptures against the doctrine of Purgatory, that the soules of the faithfull presently after death, go directly vnto heauen</hi> Out of which words <hi>M.

                     <hi>M. Morton</hi> hath concealed craftily the name of <hi>Caluin</hi> in all this obiection, and turned it into <hi>Protestants,</hi> wheras the assertion is ascribed by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> namely and chiefly vnto <hi>Caluin,</hi> and not to other Protesta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: and therfore we graunt that <hi>Caluin</hi> (supposing his former assertion to be true) cannot vse this obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against Purgatorie, <hi>that soules go directly to heauen,</hi> except he would say, that his foresaid <hi>atrium</hi> or <hi>porch,</hi> and outward place of stay, is also heauen, or a peece of

heauen different from that <hi>Sanctuarium Caeli,</hi> into which, he saith, that only Christ is admitted vntill the day of Iudgment.</p>
                  <p n="93">93. But other Protestants that hold not this fond opinion (as few or none perhaps do) may vse their former argument still, if it were true, that soules go directly to hell, or to heauen. And it is to be noted how cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningly <hi>M.

Which wordes of mine do euidently shew, that my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory Epistle was written after the comon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and Treatise: and therfore well might I come to know <hi>M.

practized in that Kingdome by those first ghospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. And is not this a <hi>full satisfaction</hi> trow you? What if the Chronicle of <hi>Buchanan</hi> were called in, that recounted with approbation and insolent triumph the attempts made vpon their lawfull Princes by incitation of this doctrine. Doth this take away the doctrine it self? Or doth it prooue that these first ghospellers held it not? What became of the other bookes of <hi>Knox</hi>? and namely his Chronicle (for he wrote also a Chronicle of the same matters, and of his owne acts therin, as <hi>Caesar</hi> did his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) were they abolished heerby?

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:14530:163"/>
Glozers, but was not then so generally receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And hereof doth he inferre this <hi>new &amp; noble falshood</hi> against me, as though I had auouched him to con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For first I said no more in my Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, then that <hi>M.

               <p n="63">63.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:14530:164"/>
Author that <hi>M. Morton</hi> can produce for disallowing absolutely <hi>Equiuocation</hi> (though indeed he do not) and therby doth plainely prooue, that in the first three hundreth of these foure, there was no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position found to haue byn made to the contrary, among so many multitudes of bookes and Authors, as are extant of those times: or if there had, that their opposition had byn extant, aswell as this of <hi>Sepulu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="64">64. Neither did I say (as <hi>M.

Neither can he auoid that inference and consequence, as hath byn demonstrated: for if it were a receiued doctrine among vs, and no ancient contradiction to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, then must it needes in that antiquity be supposed to haue byn generall current doctrine in our Schooles, Vniuersities, Tribunalls &amp;c.<note place="margin">

So as I leaue the filth of this comparison to the Author, and do conclude in this first point, that heere is nothing at all to be found, either of falshood or falsity in this obiection against me. For what I said, is iustified by <hi>M. Morton</hi> his owne wordes.</p>
               <p n="65">65. There remaineth then the second point to be discussed. But noting first by the way, the lauish immodesty of <hi>M.

               <p n="71">71. Two other Cases in like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner he resolueth by the force of this Rule.

                     </gap>ry Case,</hi> which <hi>M. Morton</hi> in his former book did great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprehend, and iest at, but learned <hi>Azor</hi> (as <hi>M. Morton</hi> calleth him) houldeth it for true and iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to wit, that if a man should, for example sake, come from <hi>Couentry,</hi> or any other Cittie, that is suspected to haue the plague, and indeed hath it not, nor is himselfe otherwise infected:<note place="margin">The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentry case about comming from an infected place.</note> but yet should be demanded at the gates of <hi>London</hi> whether he came from <hi>Couentry</hi> or no? he might lawfully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, he came not: vnderstanding in his mind, that he came not from <hi>Couentry,</hi> as infected. And all these Cases doth <hi>Azor</hi> resolue vnder his first three Rules: which are all directly against M. <hi>Morton</hi> as you see. And in his behalf there is nothing, either in these or in the other two, which haue no particuler Cases assigned them, but only haue this in generall.</p>
               <p n="72">72. The fourth rule of <hi>Azor</hi> is: <hi>Si nulla nobis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iat iniuria &amp;c.</hi>
                  <q>If no iniury be offered vs when we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> are demanded any thing, it is not lawfull to vse ambiguous wordes, except in that sense which the hearers do conceiue. The fifth, <hi>Si reuerà verba <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> quibus vtimur &amp;c.</hi> If indeed the words which we do vse are no doubtfull in their signification, nor in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon vse of men, nor haue any other sense but only one, we must vse them in that sense which they yeeld. Neither is it lawfull for vs, albeit we should be demanded against all law and right to wrest it into another sense by any cogitation of our mind. For it is neuer lawfull for vs to lye: but he doth lye, that doth take wordes in another sense then they do signifie.</q>
So <hi>Azor.</hi> Where you see that he forbiddeth only, that wordes which haue but one only naturall sense and signification,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:14530:167"/>
and are not ambiguous or of diuers senses, should be vsed by the speaker in any other significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then naturally, or by common vse amongst men they do yeeld: as for example, if one that had <hi>a horse</hi> &amp; not an <hi>oxe,</hi> should be demaunded, whether he had any <hi>horse,</hi> he should saie <hi>noe,</hi> meaning that he had noe <hi>Oxe,</hi> for that he conceiued an <hi>Oxe</hi> for an <hi>horse,</hi> this were not lawfull, saith <hi>Azor,</hi> in the vse of words, because the word <hi>horse</hi> hath but one proper meannig amongst men, and cannot signifie an <hi>Oxe</hi>: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently cannot be so taken but by a lye. But if the word <hi>horse</hi> had a doubtful or double significatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying as well an <hi>Oxe</hi> as a <hi>horse,</hi> then might a man vse the amphibology of the word, to auoyd any iniury offered him by an incompetent Iudge, as <hi>Azor</hi> himselfe determineth.</p>
               <p n="73">73. But now (to returne to the matter) what is this against our Clause of Reseruation in a propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or sentence? And how doth this <hi>strike the nayle on the head</hi> for <hi>M. Morton</hi>? Nay, doth not <hi>Azor</hi> strike <hi>M.

The Case proposed heere by <hi>Emanuel Sà,</hi> is of a man that hath no obligation to answere to the intention of him that demaundeth, whether he may answere with <hi>Equiuocation</hi> or noe, and say that it is not so, vnderstanding (<hi>with obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tell it you:</hi>) or I haue it not (<hi>to giue vnto you.</hi>) In which particuler Case he saith, that some men do not admit that kind of answere: but for so much as he hath no obligatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to answere any thing at all, he is bound either to hold his peace or tell the truth.

priuate man may kill a Tyrant for common iniuries. I haue alleaged the later, and P. R. hath opposed the former, both of vs haue affirmed a truth, where then is the falshood?</hi> Thus see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth M. <hi>Morton</hi> to escape, and goeth about by two similitudes to confirme this manner of answering.
<q>The first, that if an Esquire haue a sonne that is a knight, he shall sit aboue him in publike meetings, but not in priuate: that is, that he shall fit aboue him, and not sit aboue him, and so Christ commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus thinketh to haue quitted himselfe learnedly by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, for that as he saith the selfe same Tyrant may be killed, and not killed by a priuate man, in regard of publicke or priuate iniuries.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. But this euasion is ouerthrowne by the words &amp; whole discourse of Doctor <hi>Boucher</hi> now alledged,<note place="margin">The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion.</note> for that he speaketh not only against killing a Tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for priuate iniuries by a priuate man, but also in publicke iniuries: for so doth shew his allegation of the Decree of the Councell of <hi>Constance</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an errour in faith to hold with <hi>Iohn VVick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliffe,</hi> that euery Tyrant may be slayne meritorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by any vassall or subiect of his, by open or secret treasons, which is vnderstood, as well for publicke as priuate iniuries.</p>

                  <p n="143">143. For wheras I said: <hi>If an enemy would discredit both

               <p>TO come then to an end of this triall, and to see what substance there is on either syde: M. <hi>Morton</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vpon him to answere to the charges of falshood &amp; vntrue dealing layd against him in my late Treatise of <hi>Mitigation,</hi> chose out fourteene of those which he thought he could best answere, or make some shew at least of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction vnto them, which he hath performed in the manner that you haue heard, to wit, first leauing out the greatest number of such as pressed him most, as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Chapter you are to behold And albeit he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the beginning to satisfy those that I most insisted in, yet that hath appeared to be false, and may be tried

And why had not this Letter in so many yeares byn published to the world for the credit of the English Seruice, and discredit of the Popes?

                  </note> who saith to the foresaid <hi>Earle,</hi> shewing both his sincerity and affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Iustice.

                  </q>
These are <hi>Prickets</hi> words, which seeme to free him much from the passion of <hi>enuy</hi> and <hi>malediction</hi> obiected by <hi>Syr Edward,</hi> whom he pretendeth greatly to honour by this edition of his speach. And that no affection towards Catholiks did biaz him in this relation, may appeare by his other words that presently did ensue after the former, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
<q>I hope that this speach being produced to a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blike view, shall remayne vnto our publike weale a worthy president, wherin <hi>Romes</hi> Champions may with shame discerne their long continued shamefull practises; Puritans and Schismatiks learne to know <hi>with what iniustice they disturbe the happines of our most happy Peere.</hi>

might enuy somewhat the rich lawiers great wealth and aboundant flowing fortunes.) For thus he beginneth his Epistle to the said <hi>Earle,</hi> lamenting his owne penurie.</p>

Wherby it may appeare that <hi>Pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets</hi> chief endeauour was rather indirectly by laying forth his owne temporall needs to draw somewhat from <hi>Syr Edwards</hi> purse, and by writing the story of his glorious speach at <hi>Norwich,</hi> to gayne vnto himself his good will and affection for his reliefe, then any way to shew malignity against him: wherof I fynd no cause or probability, but rather his pricking sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make against vs, whom <hi>Syr Edward</hi> also impugned, and consequently, if any thing be found in his nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that at this present displeased <hi>Syr Edward,</hi> it must be thought to proceed eyther from the errour of the others memory that directed not well his pen, or from some change of mynd in <hi>Syr Edward</hi> himselfe who now perhaps reprehendeth that which before
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:14530:336"/>
he misliked not, but was well content to haue it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished. And to this later coniecture I am the rather induced to incline for that there are now two yeares past &amp; more, since <hi>Pricket</hi> set forth in print this speach, and I neuer heard that <hi>Syr Edward</hi> did mislike it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at this present I see it so greiuously reprehended by him in this last Preface: for in the former that was prefixed before his sixt part of <hi>Reports</hi> (which seemeth to haue come forth after <hi>Prickets</hi> relation) no complaynt or mention is made therof.</p>
               <p n="105">105. But you will aske me (perhaps) why so great a charge should be found in <hi>Syr Edward,</hi>

To Yorke Assises then they went, where hauing taken their oathes, and pleaded the case, at length they found not that successe, which they expected: For that the whole towne and parish of <hi>Thornley</hi> offering themselues confidently to sweare &amp; depose the contrary in behalf of the defendant (to wit, that tythes were not accustomed to be payd out of that place) the Ministers had sentence giuen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, with no small note of publike periury. Whereof one that was a particuler friend of <hi>M. VVh.</hi> demaunding the reason, how they could sweare or rather softweare in such manner, the thing being knowne to be so notoriously false? He answered, that they in their owne sense did sweare truly (behold then the case of Equiuocation) &amp; that so they were ready to prooue it, if they had bene vrged by the Iudges therin,<note place="margin">A fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and lying E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> to wit, that their meaning in swearing was<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> that the former Incumbent had receaued tythes out of that closse or field, or without that closse or field, namly, in other closses adioyning, though not in the field. And with this Equiuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of (<hi>out</hi>) and (<hi>in</hi>) they thought themselues clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, both for deceyuing the Iudges, and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishioners.

            <p n="4">4. And first of all by this we see, how these good fellowes that do cry out so hideously, and reuell eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where both in bookes, sermons and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon speach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their guilefull deceiuing their lawfull Iudges, that were competent in the cause, &amp; proceeded iuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically, was abhominable.

            <p n="24">24.

But yet heere when he saith that he is before <hi>Abraham</hi> was made, he must needs meane of his Diuinity, and in that he was God: which <hi>S. Augustine</hi> vpon this place doth excellently
