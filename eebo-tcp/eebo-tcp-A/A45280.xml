            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the next place give me leave earneſtly to exhort

            <p>The Communion of Saints is not ſo ſleight that it ſhould be violated by weak miſtakings: if any man through ignorance or ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, ſhall ſtrike at the foundation of faith, let us labour by all gentle means, and brotherly conviction, in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to

reclaim him: If after all powerfull indeavours he will needs remain, obſtinate in his evill way; let us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim his fellowſhip, and not think him worthy of a God-ſpeed.

            <p>In all which proceedings, juſt diſtinction muſt be made betwixt the ſeduced ſoul,
<pb facs="tcp:42064:8"/>
and the peſtilent ſeducer, the one calls for compaſſion, the other, for ſeverity: So then my brethren let us pity and pray for all that have erred and are deceived; let us inſtruct the ignorant, convince the gainſaying, avoid the obſtinate, reſtrain the infectious, and puniſh the ſelf-convicted hereſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch.</p>
            <p>In the fourth place, let us, I beſeech you, take heed of beeing ſwayed with ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſts in all our deſigns: Theſe have ever been the bane of the beſt underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, as being not more plauſibly inſinnuative, then pernicious: For that partiall ſelf-love, that naturally ledges in every mans breſt, is ready to put us upon thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:42064:9"/>
projects, which, under fair pretences, may be extreamly prejudiciall to the publique weal; ſuggeſting not how lawfull or expedient they may be for the common, but how beneficiall to our ſelves; drawing us by inſenſible degrees to ſacrifice the publique welfare to our own advantage, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and croſs the better counſails of more faithfull patriots: Whereupon, many flouriſhing Churches, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, States, have been brought to miſerable ruine: Oh that we could remember, that as all things are ours, ſo we are not our own; that we have the leaſt intereſt in our ſelves, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more conſiderable as parts of a community, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb facs="tcp:42064:9"/>
ſingle perſons; that the main end of our beeing, (next to the glory of our maker) is an univerſall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableneſſe to others: in the attaining whereof, we ſhall far more eminently advance our own happineſs, then by the beſt of our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſelf-ſeeking indeavors.</p>
            <p>But withall, it will be meet for us to conſider, that, as we are made to ſerve all, ſo only in our own ſtation: There can be no hope of a continued wel being without order: There can be no order without a due ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of degrees, and diverſity of vocations; and in vain ſhall divers vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be ordained, if all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſhall enterfere with each other.

            <p>AS thoſe that flit from their old home, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to dwell in another countrey, where they are ſure to ſettle; are wont to forget the faces, and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereto they were formerly inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to apply themſelves to the knowledge and acquaintance of thoſe, with whom they ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards converſe; So it is here with me, being to remove from my earthly Tabernacle, wherein I have worn out the few and evil dayes of my pilgrimage, to an abiding City above, I have deſired to acquaint my ſelf with that Inviſible world, to which I am going: to enter-know my good God, and his bleſſed Angels and Saints, with whom I hope to paſſe an happy eternity. And if by often and ſerious meditation I have attained (through Gods mercy) to any meaſure of lightſome apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:42064:15"/>
of them, and their bliſſeful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; I thought it could be no other then profitable to my fellow-pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, to have it imparted unto them: And, as knowing we can never be ſenſible enough of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, unleſſe we know our own dangers, and the woful miſ-carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of others; nor ſo fully bleſſe our eyes with the ſight of heaven, if we caſt not ſome glances upon hell; I have held it requiſite to beſtow ſome thoughts upon that dreadfull region of darkneſſe, and confuſion, that by the former of theſe, our deſires may be whetted to the fruition of their bleſſedneſſe; and by the other, we may be ſtirred up to a care of avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe paths that lead down to that ſecond death; and to a continual thankfulneſſe unto that mercifull God, whoſe infinite goodneſſe hath delivered us from that pit of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and perdition.</p>

For, how can we give him the honour due to his name, whiles we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too narrowly of him, and his works? To know him as he is, is paſt the capacity of our finite underſtanding, we
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42064:16"/>
muſt have other eyes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that incomprehenſible eſſence; but to ſee him in his divine emanations, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous works, (which are the back parts of that glorious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty) is that, whereof we may be capable, and ſhould be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious; Neither is there any thing in this world, that can ſo much import us: For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſerves the eye of ſenſe, but to view the goodly frame and furniture of the Creation? wherefore ſerves the eye of reaſon and faith, but to ſee that lively and inviſible power, which governs and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it?</p>
               <p>Even this ſenſible, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall world, if we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aright of it, is enough to amaze the moſt inlightned rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for if this globe of earth, in regard of the immenſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, is wont (not unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to be accounted a World, what ſhall we ſay of ſo many

thouſand ſtars, that are (for the moſt part) bigger then it? how can we but admire ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand worlds of light, rolling continually over our heads; all made by the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power; all regularly guided by the infinite provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the great God? How poorly muſt that man needs think of the workmanſhip of the Almighty, that looks upon all theſe, but as ſo many Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſet up in the firmament every evening, only ſo big as they ſeem? and with what aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reſpects muſt he needs be carried to his Creator, that knowes the vaſtneſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually-conſtant movings of thoſe lightſom bodies, ruled and upheld only by the mighty word that made them?</p>
               <p>There is ſtore of wonders in the viſible, but the ſpirituall, and intelligible world is that, which is more worthy to take up our hearts; both as we are

thoſe immateriall and inviſible powers, who receive their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and continuance, their natures and offices from that King of glory; Each one whereof is ſo mighty, as to make up a world of power alone; each one ſo knowing, as to contain a world of wiſdom, and all of them ſo innumerably many, that their number is next to infinite; and all this numberleſſe number ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly united in one celeſtial politie, that their entire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion (under the laws and government of their ſoverain Creator) makes them a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat world of Spirits, inviſibly living and moving both within and above this viſible globe of the materiall world. After theſe, meet we with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſouls of the Juſt, who now let looſe from this priſon of clay, enjoy the full liberty of heaven; and being at laſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to their then immortall

               <p>Laſt of all, may thy thoughts fall upon thoſe infernall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of darkneſſe, the ſpirituall wickedneſſes in heavenly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whoſe number, might, combination, makes up a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world of evil Angels, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting where they prevail not, and tormenting where they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome; Theſe, together with the reprobate ſouls, whom they have captived, are the moſt horrible and wofull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of miſchief and miſery, which either world is ſubject unto; Now all and every of theſe, however in reſpect of largeneſſe, they may well paſſe for ſo many ſeverall worlds; yet as we are wont to account the whole globe of heaven and earth, and the other incloſed elements (though vaſt in their ſeverall extents) to make up

               <p>Wherefore let us firſt ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adore (that <hi>mundum arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>typum</hi>) that one tranſcendent, ſelf-being, and infinite eſſence, in three moſt glorious perſons, the bleſſed Deity, which filleth heaven and earth with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of his glory, as vailed with the beams of infiniteneſſe, and hid in an inacceſſible light; and let us turn our eyes to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual guard, the inviſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of that divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, without the knowledge and right apprehenſion whereof, we ſhall never attain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of their God, and ours, as we ought.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42064:82"/>
Surely this may ſeem ſome ſleight repreſentation of the condition of Apoſtate Angels, and reprobate ſouls: Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they have onely light e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſee themſelves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable; neither are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the leaſt glimpſe of comfort, or mitigation. But, as it fals out with thoſe, which in a dark night bear their own light, that they are eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by an enemy that waits for them, and good aim may be taken at them, even whiles that enemy lurks unſeen of them: ſo it is with us in theſe ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ambuſhes of the infernall powers, their darkneſſe and our light gives them no ſmal advantage againſt us; The ſame power that clears and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens the eyes of our ſoul to ſee thoſe over-excelling glories of the good Angels, can alſo enable us to pierce thorough that helliſh obſcurity, and to

deſcrie ſo much of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and condition of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſpirits as may render us both wary, and thankful.</p>
               <p>In their firſt creation there were no Angels but of light, that any of them ſhould bring evill with him from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his firſt beeing, is the exploded hereſie of a <hi>Manes,</hi> a man fit for his name; and if <hi>Prateolus</hi> may be beleeved, of the Trinit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ians; yea, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my rather, caſting mire in the face of the moſt pure and holy Deity: For, from an abſolute goodneſſe, what can proceed but good? And if any then of thoſe ſpirits could have been originally evil, whence could he pretend to fetch it? Either three muſt be a predominant princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of evill; or a derivation of it from the fountain of infinite goodneſs, either of which were very monſters of impiety: All were once glorious ſpirits; ſin changed their hue, and made
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42064:83"/>
many of them ugly Devils: Now ſtraight I am apt to think, Lord! how ſhould ſin come into the world? how into Angels? God made all things good; ſin could be no work of his: How ſhould the good that he made, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the evill which he hates? Even this curioſity muſt receive an anſwer.</p>
               <p>The great God when he would make his nobleſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, found it fit to produce him in the neareſt likeneſſe to himſelf; and therefore to indue him with perfection of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and freedome of will, either of which being wanting there could have been no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the beſt: ſuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he make his Angels: Their will being made free had power of their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; thoſe free inclinations of ſome of them, ſwayed them awry from that higheſt end which they ſhould have ſolely
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42064:83"/>
aimed at, to a faulty reſpect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oblique ends of their own.</p>
               <p>Hence was the beginning of ſin; for as it fals out in cauſes efficient, that when the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary agent ſwarves from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and direction of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, ſtraight waies a fault there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon enſues (as when the leg by reaſon of crookedneſſe, fails of the performance of that motion, which the appetitive power injoined, an halting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows) ſo it is in finall cauſes alſo, (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> acutely) when the ſecondary end is not kept in, under the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the principall and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt end, there grows a ſin of the will, whoſe object is ever good: but if a ſuppoſed, &amp; ſelf reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive good be ſuffer'd to take the wall of the beſt, &amp; abſolute good, the will inſtantly proves vicious. As therefore there can be no poſſible fault in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident into the will of him who propounds to himſelf as his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42064:84"/>

fall into any intelligent nature, ſince it were no other, then to affect his own not being; for as much as there can be no beeing at all, without a diſtinction of degrees, and ſubordinations of beeings: This was (I ſuppoſe) the threſhold of leaving their firſt eſtate: Now it was with Angelicall ſpirits as it is with heavy bodies, when they begin to fail they went down at once, ſpeedily paſſing through many degrees of wickedneſſe. Let learned <hi>Gerſon</hi> ſee upon what grounds he conceives, that in the beginning their ſin might be veniall, afterwards ariſing to the height of maliciouſneſs; whom <hi>Salmeron</hi> ſeconds by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven reaſons, alledged to that purpoſe; labouring to prove that before their precipitation, they had large time, and place of repentance; the point is too high for any humane determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: this we know too well by our ſelves, that even the

               <p>What were the particular grounds of their defection and ruine, what was their firſt ſin, it is neither needfull, nor poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know; I ſee the wracks of this curioſity in ſome of the Ancient, who miſguiding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a falſe Compaſſe of miſ-applyed Texts, have ſplit upon thoſe ſhelves which their miſcarriage ſhall teach me to avoid; If they have made <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi>

               <p>But if unto all theſe, we ſhall take notice of their malice, no whit inferiour to their power, and knowledge, we cannot but be tranſported with the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at our infinite obligations to the bleſſed Majeſty of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, who preſerves us from the rage of ſo ſpightfull, cunning, mighty enemies. Satan carries hoſtility in his very name, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42064:93"/>
anſwerably in his wicked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: hoſtility to the God that made him, as the avenger of his ſin; hoſtility for his ſake to the Creature, which that God made good: his enmity did, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, deſcend from the higheſt, for it began at the Almighty, and remains as implacable, as impotent.</p>
               <p>It is a bold and uncouth ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſcarce ſafe to relate, which I finde in the book of Conformity reported, as cited by a Demoniack woman, from the mouth of a certain Frier, named <hi>Jacobus de Pozali,</hi> in his Sermon; That S. <hi>Macarius</hi> once went about to make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Satan; That it pleaſed God to ſay, If the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill will acknowledge his fault I will pardon him: To which the evill ſpirit returned anſwer, I will never acknowledge any fault of mine; yea, that cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour ſhould rather cry me mercy for keeping me
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42064:93"/>
thus long in hell: To whom <hi>Macarius,</hi> (as he well might) Avoid Satan. I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more to blame their Saint (if they report him right) for too much charity, or for too little grace and wit, in ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous an indeavour: The very treaty was in him blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; the anſwer no other then could be expected from a ſpirit obdured in malice, and deſperate in that obduredneſſe; The truth is, he hates us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hated God firſt; and like the enraged Panther, tears the picture, becauſe he cannot reach the perſon whom it re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>preſents.</p>
               <p>He that made him an Angell tels us what he is, ſince he made himſelfe a Devill, even a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer from the beginning: His very trade is Murther and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and his executions unweariable: he goes abous continually like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42064:94"/>
It is no other then a marvai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous myſtery of Divine ſtate, too deep for the ſhallowneſſe of humane ſouls to reach into, that God could with one word of his powerfull command de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy and diſſolve all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of hell; yet he knows it beſt not to do it: only we know he hath a juſtice to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie, as well as a mercy; and that he knows how to fetch more honour to himſelf, by drawing good out of evill, then by the amotion, and prevention of evill. Glory be to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power, juſtice, mercy, providence, that contrives all things both in heaven and earth, and hell, to the higheſt advantage of his own bleſſed Name, and to the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefit of his elect.</p>

               <p>The very ſin of the damned is no ſmall part of their hell; for as all their powers, parts, faculties, are as ſo many ſubjects of their inſupportable pain and torture; ſo out of that inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable extremity, they conceive a deſperate indignation, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt God; not as he is in himſelf infinitely good, (for goodneſs can be no object of hate) but as he is to them, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere (though moſt juſt) aven<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ger of ſin; to which is ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a will obſtinately fixed in evill; whiles they were in their way, they were in a poſſibility of reclamation, now, that they are (<hi>in termino</hi>) they can be no other then they are; As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the glorified ſouls are in a condition like to the Angels of
