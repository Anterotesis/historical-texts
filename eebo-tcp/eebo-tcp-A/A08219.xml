            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S ther are many enimies of the truth of the
gospel, and many that write to broach and
spread their errors: so is it needful that some
write against them, least troden truth be quite
forsaken; and silly sowles be wrapped in error,
vnto perdition. It is not easy for al men to espie Satans
subtilties, nor the deceitful sophismes of his ministers:
both he &amp; they, can tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sforme themselves like Angels of
light. Such therfore as discern them through the grace of
God, should give warning vnto others; that as the <hi>foolish

            <p>What wormwood and bitternes &amp; even deadly poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

speeches, he hath beguiled many vnstable sowles; &amp; such
as have had no love to the truth, have been give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> over vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his lies. And never had Satan a fitter time to work his
malicious wil on the sons of Adam: then in these last
evil dayes, when Atheisme and iniquity, doe so much
abound. Never had he a fitter religion for Atheists and
carnal hypocrites, then that which H. N. out of his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and fleshly hart hath set abroach. It taketh away
the crosse of Christ, &amp; persecution for righteousnes sake:
and teacheth men to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate with al religions, servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

               <hi>service of the Love;</hi> It maketh them pure and without

which the Serpent himself did never teach,) it deifieth
them with God. In a word, it bringeth a fretting lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
vpon al religion, &amp; overthroweth the grounds of faith
layd in holy scriptures, which <hi>H. N.</hi> by foolish allegories,
perverteth to the destruction of himself and his Family.
And for the principles of theologie, he hath written more
blasphemously and absurdly then ever did <hi>Mahomet</hi> in
his <hi>Alcoran.</hi> For this cause, in answering this his letter,
(as I was requested by some that heard how much it was
boasted of, among the <hi>Nicholaitans;)</hi> I have touched by
the way some of the impious heresies that are in his other
writings, without knowledge wherof, his frawd in this
Epistle cannot easily be perceived. For as a child of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
he laboureth to be obscure in his words, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men may
admire the deepnes of Satan by which he speaketh; and
himself when he is folowed, &amp; can no other way escape,
may have this for his last refuge, that men <hi>vnderstand him
not.</hi> But<note n="*" place="margin">Ephe. 5. 13.</note> al things when they are reproved of the light,
are manifest: for the light is that which maketh al things
manifest. Now the <note n="|" place="margin">Ps. 119. 105 Pro 6. 13.</note>word of the Lord is a lantern, &amp; his
Law a light; by it therfore have I assayed to discover the
snares of this seducer: not doubting but God, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Morning to know his place, that it may take
hold of the corners of the earth, <note n="†" place="margin">Iob. 38. 13</note>&amp; that the wicked may
be shaken out of it; wil, notwithstanding al the dark
delphick speeches, and glozing allegories of these falsers,
declare their works and manifest their impieties, and wil
<note n="|" place="margin">Iob. 34. 25.</note>turn the night, (in the darknes wherof they think to be
shrowded) and they shalbe destroyed.</p>
            <p>Let therfore the prudent reader, make trial of that


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:25099:3"/>
which on both sides is said, by the word of truth: least,
as the serpent beguiled Evah through his subtilty, so their
harts be withdrawn from the sincerity of Christ. And
the Lord give them vnderstanding in al things; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them <note n="‡" place="margin">Ps. 12. 7. 8.</note>from this generation for ever;

<hi>H. N.</hi> beginneth (as was foretold) not onely with fayr and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
speech / but also with swelling words of <hi>the second birth, out
of the new life of the heavenly being,</hi> and sondry the like. He boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
of <hi>the gift</hi> / of the godly life / <hi>which he beareth before al men</hi> / and
here <hi>severally openeth vnto two yong daughters:</hi> and of this he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<hi>God to witnesse:</hi> He telleth them / (in the 2. section folowing / )
that <hi>the Christ of God was not yet declared vnto them according to
the heavenly truth.</hi> Thus promiseth he great matters / and seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

and if it be true / for to receive it; if false / for to abhorr it / and to
hold the author therof accursed. And herevnto the Lord inable
and guide vs by his grace.</p>
               <p>1. First where he vaunteth of <hi>the gift borne before al men</hi> / (in
his other writings / ) <hi>opened to these daughters</hi> / (in this Epistle;)
let vs bring it to the trial / by the word of <hi>God,</hi> who (he saith) is his
<hi>witnes.</hi> For we read of some / that have<note n="*" place="margin">Ezek. 16. 33</note> given gifts vnto their
lovers / that they might come vnto them on every side for fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and whither this writing / and other pamphlets of <hi>H. N.</hi> be
not gifts sent abroad for such evil purpose / let the godly reader
judge. If his <hi>gift</hi> have wytnes of <hi>God</hi> / it hath witnes of his
written word / as the prophet saith / <note n="†" place="margin">Isa. 8. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>to the Law, and to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
if they speak not according to this word, it is, because ther is no
light in them.</hi> Is <hi>H. N.</hi> willing to come to this trial? it seemeth
farr otherweise; for in al his writings he much inveigheth against
<hi>scripture-learning;</hi> contrary to the true prophets and Apostles / who
highly commended this / as being<note n="|" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15 16.</note> able to make men wise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
salvation / and profitable to teach / to improve / to correct / to
instruct in righteousnes: and never did any of them entwite the
learning or knowledge of the scriptures; as the reader may see
<hi>H. N.</hi> to doe in this Epistle and his other pamphlets. Our savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ / willed al men / even his adversaries / to<note n="*" place="margin">Iob. 5. 39.</note> serch the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures / 
for they testified of him. If they testified likewise of <hi>H. N.</hi>
and his doctrine; doubtlesse he would not despise (as his manner
is) the scripture-learning of others; especially whiles he wil seem
to rely vpon the testimonies of the same for himself. But if we
may not learn the truth of religion / out of holy writt; how then


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:25099:6"/>
may we attayn it? <hi>H. N.</hi> telleth vs in his <hi>First exhortation to his
children,</hi> thus<note n="|" place="margin">1 Exhort. chap. 6. sect. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>My beloved children, like as the true Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niality
of holy ones, and Elders of the house of Love, confesse, vnder
the obedience of the Love, the beleef in Iesu Christ, and the Christian

acknowledge it before al men to be the true faith, and the vpright

So then the doctrine of <hi>H. N.</hi> and his folowers must be the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d

them.</hi> But may we not our selves / by the light and grace that
God giveth vs / make trial of <hi>H. N.</hi> his religion by the word of
the Lord? No: for in his <hi>First exhortation</hi> he saith;<note n="|" place="margin">chap. 16. sect. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>no man can
rightly according to the truth of the holy scriptures nor according to
the spiritual vnderstanding of the godly wisdome, deal in, or vse the
true God-services, nor the services of the holy word, (it becometh
not likewise, that any man should take in hand to busy himself thera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,)
but onely the illuminated Elders in the godlie wisdom, which
walk in the house of Love.</hi> But what if <hi>H. N.</hi> with his coelders / 
be but deceivers of mens sowles / seduced themselves and seducing
others? for be they not men as others are / and subject to error?
He telleth vs no / for<note n="‡" place="margin">ibidem.</note> 
                  <hi>they have received the word of life, through the
power of the most highest, out of his holy heaven, from the living
God, and are even so through the same word, Godded with God.</hi>
Therfore in an other place of that book / he saith men<note n="|" place="margin">chap. 13 sect. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware

themselves y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the exercises, documents &amp; instructions which ar
taught or set forth before them, by the Father of the Familie of Love, or

follow after or to obey. But with perfect harts, humbly and single-mindedly,
even as good willing children vnto the Obedience; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the same instructions, proceeding out of the wisdom and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the Eldest.</hi> And must we needs put out our own eyes / that
<hi>H. N.</hi> may lead vs? may we trust him that he himself is not a
blind guide / and false prophet / such as Christ foretold should
come in this last time? For this matter he hath given vs his

                  <hi>My loving children, and thou Familie of Love, give

layd for himself and his cause: that men should receive his word

and even so then to be forsaken, therfore hath God now in the same
last day showed his grace &amp; mercifulnes on vs poor &amp; wretched ones,
and hath declared vnto vs through his holy spirit, his service of Love,

which is the true way to the everlasting life. Therfore let everie one

that he boast not himself in any of the works of righteousnes, or take
on the same to salvation neyther to condemnation, before that he in

of God. For the Father is not honoured but through the Son, that is,
no man may know, eyther serve God, but that he must be born out of
the spirit of Christ, even like as ther standeth written; Ther availeth
before God neyther circumcision nor vncircumcision, but onely a new
creature in Christ Iesus wrought through the Love, Gal. 6. Therfore
shal Christ in the day of judgements, accuse and find faultie a flesh in
their righteousnes, even like as he saith, I shal reprove or rebuke the
world of their righteousnes. Ioh. 16. That this is al what the man

therfore teaching contrary to the Apostle (as we have seen,) even

of the holy prophets or Apostles to confirm the same; but by

Turks<note n="*" place="margin">Alchoran, Azoar (or chapter) 4. 5. 35. &amp; 42.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Law of God is not impossible and intollerable:</hi> (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Apostles say the contrary <hi>(Rom. 8. 3. Act. 15. 10.)</hi> and
<hi>that they which keep the the Law are joyned with God &amp; saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this <hi>H. N.</hi> sheweth that he meanes not the <hi>elemetish &amp; cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial
righteousnes,</hi> but that which <hi>according to the heavenly truth
is in the Being of Christ,</hi> (for this we had heard is his heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly truth,
that every man should have the <hi>Being</hi> of Christ / or <hi>be Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.)
His proof herof is, <hi>The Father is not honoured but through the

abuseth the scripture <hi>Gal. 6.</hi> 15. wher Paul sayth (against such as
<note n="|" place="margin">vers. 12.</note>vrged Christians to be circumcised / that they might avoid perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution)
that <hi>in Christ Iesus neyther circumcision avayleth any thing,
nor vncircumcision, but a new creature;</hi> meaning that such as were
graffed into Christ by faith / vnto salvation from their syns; they
need not care in this estate for having or wanting the outward
Jewish signe of circumcision / but labour for that which it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied / 
namely to become new creatures / dying dayly vnto syn / and
living vnto righteousnes / which fruits ar vndoubted testimonies
that they ar in Christ. But <hi>H. N.</hi> corrupteth the words / first saying
<hi>Ther avayleth before God,</hi> and then adding, <hi>in Christ Iesus wrought
in the Love,</hi> meaning / that a new creature / in Christ (which Christ
is) wrought in the Love / (for so he thinketh Christ to be the <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

before God / for righteousnes / and <hi>safe-making from our syns;</hi> as his

that they know God / but in works do <hi>deny him, Tit. 1.</hi> 16. The
<hi>confessing</hi> of Christ is with the mouth; <hi>Rom. 10.</hi> 10. the having

faith is in the hart; and (as th'Apostle sheweth <hi>Rom. 10. 10.)</hi>
these both / (confession with the mouth / and beleef with the

make a good and true confession of Christ with the mouth / and
yet in their harts not be partakers of the Christian or godly

Christ with his mouth; or weep bitterly with<note n="‡" place="margin">Mat. 26. 75</note> Peter / if through
fraylty of the flesh he doe deny him. Wheras therfore Gods

these two daughters from the one (namely from outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
with the mouth / ) vnder pretense and colour of the other / 
(namely of having Christs shape within them:) he dealeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully /

them to fornication; and when they alleged against him
Gods Law / <hi>Heb. 12. 16. Let ther be no fornicator &amp;c.</hi> he should
answer / <hi>true, but the meaning you vnderstand not; many suppose


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:25099:17"/>
that the chastity of body, is the right chastitie; no my beloved no, the
godly chastitie must stand in greater force &amp; effect then to be in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
or elementish body, for so the Pharisees vnderstood the Law of
old; but Christ applyeth it against the lusts of the hart. Mat. 5. 27.</hi> 28.
If this reasoning be naught / so is <hi>H. Ns.</hi> about confessing Christ.
For as Gods word requiring <hi>chastitie</hi> / intendeth it both of the
body and of the mind: so when it requireth <hi>confessing of Christ</hi> / it
meaneth both with mouth and hart / as is playnly set down <hi>Rom.

               <p>21. Oh, how wel should they doe, which do now extol them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before the simple, and say that they are preachers of Christ,
if they would first learn to know Christ, before they made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ministers of him. They wil preach the word of Christ, and
yet they have not according to the Spirit, seen the fashion or shape
of Christ, or heard of the same in any world. They say the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
witnesseth vnto vs, that we for Christs cause should forsake our
lives, the which according to the truth, is very true: but the most
part which speaks so much thereof, they themselves vnderstand not
the mind or meaning of God, in that which the scripture sayth:
namely, how that we must hate and forsake our own life, or els
we cannot be the disciples of Christ. Therfore mark wel therevpon; &amp;
not only vpon that, but also vpon al the witnessings of the scripture.</p>
               <p>22, Oh vnderstand advisedly what I doe write, of the forsaking
of our own life. When God had created the man, then was the
man in subjection to the life of God, and not to his own life: for
therevnto God had created the man, that he should be of one life,
one being, one Spirit, and of one nature with God. But when the
man desyred in his hart, to love some other thing beside the life of
God, (namely the concupiscence of the syn,) then went he into his
own life, and contentation, and forsook the life of God, and lived
even so his own life, and the life of the Divil.</p>
               <p>23. The whiles now that the office of Christ hath his ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25099:25"/>
for to bring the man agayn vnto God the Father: so cannot
Christ bring the man to the Father, vnlesse that the man forsake his
own life, which he hath lived so long to the Divel and to himself,
which is al that same wherin he hath sought, loved &amp; lived to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>24. Is not this now a great overshooting or misunderstanding
that the children of men, can say and teach, that Christ meant here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
the natural or elementish man?</p>
            </div>
            <div type="response">
               <head>H. A.</head>
               <p>IT had been wel in deed if <hi>H. N.</hi> who so <hi>extolleth himself
before the simple, &amp; sayth that he is a preacher of Christ,</hi> (yea
Godded with God / ) <hi>would first have learned to know Christ,
before he hade made him self a minister of him.</hi> For now being
ignorant of the principles of religion / and a meer stranger from the
life of God; he hath perverted al things to his own and ther mens
perdition. Witnes this his corrupt doctrine about the <hi>forsaking
of our own life.</hi> Wherin he first and generally seeketh to colour his
iniquity with deceit and fraud. For / to perswade that we need
not give our lives / our <hi>natural &amp; elementish lives,</hi> for Christs cause / 
at any tyme; which is a doctrine of the serpent: he maketh a
discourse of our spiritual life in synn / and the old man corrupted
with vices / that we ought to lay down and forsake; which we al
acknowledge to be a truth. And from this he gathereth <hi>a great
overshooting</hi> and <hi>misunderstanding,</hi> of such as say <hi>Christ meant the
natural or elementish man;</hi> which is a false and deceitful conclusion.
We know that these both are required at our hands; the one (which
is the mortifying of lusts and synful affections / ) of al men / if they
would be saved: the other (which is a suffering of natural death for
Christs sake / ) of so many as God calleth thervnto / in times of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution.
But <hi>H. N.</hi> vrgeth the one / that he might abolish the
other; with as good reason / as if one should perswade vs not to serv
or worship God with <hi>body,</hi> because Christ<note n="|" place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> sayth / we must worship
him <hi>in spirit;</hi> or as if to defend fleshly filthynes / he should reason in
this manner. <hi>The wordome which God condemneth, is the whoring
with mens own inventions, Psal. 106. 39. the fornication, with stones
and stocks, Ier. 3. 9. the going a whoring after other Gods. Deut. 31.
16. Is not this then a great overshooting or misunderstanding, that the
children of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can say &amp; teach of that commandement, Thou shalt not
comit whordom, Deut. 5. 18. that God meant hereby fleshly whordom,
done by the natural or eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tish man?</hi> Loe this is the mould of <hi>H. Ns</hi>
argument / and may as truly be alleged for defence of carnal forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation / 
as he allegeth it for defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of carnal idolatry / which he


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25099:25"/>
would perswade these two daughters to commit with the <hi>man
of syn,</hi> rather then to suffer bands or death for the witnesse of
Christs truth. Neyther is it to be thought but he thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth
in deed the 7. commandement; who so erroneously
vnderstandeth / and expoundeth the second / for the maintenance
of his fleshly ease. But <hi>Oh</hi> he woulde have vs <hi>vnderstand ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
what he doth write of the forsaking of our own life. God</hi>
(sayth <hi>H. N.) had created the man, that he should be of one Life,
one Being, one spirit, and of one nature with God;</hi> this he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth / 
as before we have seen / to be <hi>godded with God,</hi> and that
the man should <hi>be al that God was.</hi> Which blasphemous error / 
I have before by the scriptures refuted. Neither doth <hi>H. N.</hi>
confirm his cursed doctrine here by any scripture; because in deed
he cannot. For al that the scripture sayth is / that God created
man <hi>in his own image and likenes, Gen. 1 26. &amp; 5.</hi> 2. but that the
man should be of <hi>one Being with him;</hi> it sayth not / but <hi>H. N.</hi>
hath forged it out of his arrogant mind / who would thrust
himself into Gods throne. The <hi>image of God,</hi> is expounded by
the Apostle to be in<note n="|" place="margin">Col. 3. 10. Eph. 4. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>knowledge, righteousnes and true holynes:</hi>
and <hi>H. N.</hi> addeth / <hi>to be of one Being.</hi> which if it had been true / 
then could not man have fallen any more then God himself; and
if he had had the same <hi>life</hi> essentially with God; then should he
have ben immortal / and incorruptible / death could never hav seised
on him / 1. <hi>Tim. 6.</hi> 16. So <hi>H. N.</hi> must eyther deny the fal and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of man / wherof not onely the word of God / but nature it
self and dayly experience wil convince him / and himself yeeldeth: or
els / he must hold a God subject to corruption and mortalitie.
Which if he doe / then is he a monster among men / and a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the very hethen. For wheras the Stoiks of old / esteemed
their Gods subject to al humane changes and corruption; a hethen

for I hope he wil not be so wretched as to say that Christ had any

                  <hi>I lay

                  <hi>Hereby have we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

Christ layd down for vs; the like ar we to lay down for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
and for Christ himself / (as Peter<note n="|" place="margin">Iohn. 13. 37</note> sayd he would;) but that
was no <hi>synful life</hi> or conversation / but the natural life which he did
lay down; therfore ours must be the like. Agayn this is further
confirmed by Christs words saying / <hi>he</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>that looseth his life (or sowl)

hope we shal there find no <hi>synful life,</hi> such as <hi>H. N.</hi> fansieth Christ

Christ saying<note n="†" place="margin">Vers. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>For what should it profit a man though he should win
the whole world, if he loose his own life (or sowl.)</hi> But it is our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test

not / as any reasonable man may perceiv. So the <hi>Psyche sowl</hi> or
<hi>life,</hi> which we must be ready at Gods pleasure to lay down for
Christs cause / is not onely the <hi>synful life,</hi> but also the natural life of

as namely because / The earth is the Lords and the plenty therof /

<hi>H. N.</hi> (if he had savoured the things of God) have reasoned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;

Thus should <hi>H. N.</hi> if any Christian wisedome or grace had been in

               <p>28. Oh, what a slight and earthly vnderstanding is this, that God
should be appeased with an elementish body: even like as though that
God were fleshly, even as an vnregenerate man.</p>
               <p>29. I say on Gods behalf, that God is not in that manner of sort with

the man; but rather the vngodly being or nature, which all vnregenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
men do cary in their harts, wherout al wickednes is ingendred and
brought forth. Read <hi>Mark. 7. Mat.</hi> 23. and in more other places in the
scriptures, wher the same is rcited or mentioned.</p>
               <p>30. Therfore my beloved, this is the counsel of God towards yow
both, that yow should not boast yourselves in such an vncertayn confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssing;
but for the love of Christs sake, take it for the best, which I hav
here witnessed vnto yow; namely that yow have not confessed Christ
according to the truth, but the elementish ceremonies, even as they
out of the darknes, without the Spirit of Christ, wer taught vnto yow.
Not that I therin do accuse or blame any man, as one that doth evil of
a set purpose. O no; for they know not any other, then that they doe vse
the doctrine of Christ. But my harty desire is towards every one, which
say that they seek Christ, that they mought seek and find him aright.</p>

               <p>OH what a slight and serpentlike subtilty is this / that <hi>H. N.</hi>

Lord Jesus that was hanged on the tree / which is the onely sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

and suffring of Christians / he falsly imputeth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this
error / to beleev they <hi>appease God with an elementish body,</hi> yea the
frawd of this falser is manifestly discovered / as the reader may
observ; for the error which he would lay vpon others / is found to

be in himself / whose doctrine is such as teacheth men to be their

the scriptures / that we must serve and glorify God both with our

are we willed to give vp<note n="‡" place="margin">Rom. 12. 1.</note> our bodies / a living sacrifice / holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
vnto God / which is our reasonable serving of God. And
if by bonds and prisonment / by racking / scourging / stoning / hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

vs have suffred / God also try vs: we ought with patience to bear
them / and not to go from the confessing of Christ and his truth / for
avoyding them / as this deceiver would perswade vs. His conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
therfore / which he maketh agaynst these two daughters / name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly / 
that <hi>they have not confessed Christ according to the truth, &amp;c.</hi> is
yet to be proved / for asmuch as he hath not by any ground from

onely sought to vndermine it / by falshood and deceyt; abusing the
readers / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perverting the holy scriptures; his desire being to draw
others into the same destruction with himself; who in sted of <hi>confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

the occasion of my writing is chanced, for that I bear a sorrowfull hart
