            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>SInce it hath pleas'd our wiſe and new-born State</l>
               <l>The Common-Prayer-Book t'excommunicate:</l>
               <l>To turne it out of all, as if it were</l>
               <l>Some grand Malignant, or ſome Cavaliere:</l>
               <l>Since in our Churches 't is by them forbid</l>
               <l>To ſay ſuch Prayers, as our Fathers did:</l>
               <l>So that Gods Houſe muſt now be call'd no more</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>The Houſe of Prayer,</hi> ſo ever call'd before:</l>
               <l>As if thoſe Chriſtians were reſolv'd to uſe</l>
               <l>That Houſe, as bad, as ever did the Jews:</l>
               <l>Since that of Chriſt, may now of Prayer be ſaid,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>It wants a place whereon to lay its head.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>I cannot chooſe but think, it was your care,</l>
               <l>To build your Cloſet for diſtreſſed PRAYER;</l>
               <l>VVhich here in mourning clad, preſents it ſelfe,</l>
               <l>Begging ſome little corner on your ſhelfe:</l>
               <l>For ſince 't is baniſh'd from all publique view,</l>
               <l>There be none dare it entertain, but you.</l>
               <l>How times and men are chang'd! who would have thought</l>
               <l>T'have ſeen the <hi>Service-Book</hi> thus ſet at naught?</l>
               <l>A Book worth Gold, if rightly underſtood;</l>
               <l>Compos'd by Martyrs, ſealed with their blood.</l>
               <l>Once burnt by Papiſts, meerly for this cauſe,</l>
               <l>It was repugnant to their Popiſh Lawes.</l>
               <l>Now by our Zelots 't is condemn'd to die,</l>
               <l>Becauſe (forſooth) 't is full of Popery.</l>
               <l>And thus we ſee the Golden meane defy'd,</l>
               <l>And how ('twixt two extreames) 't is crucify'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>¶ But 't is no matter, we ſee ſtranger things,</l>
               <l>Kings muſt be Subjects now, and Subjects, Kings.</l>
               <l>The meaner ſort of men have all the power;</l>
               <l>The upper end is now beneath the lower:</l>
               <l>The head below the feet; they'll weare the Crown:</l>
               <l>who would not think the world's turn'd upſide down?</l>
               <l>Learning muſt now give place to Ignorance,</l>
               <l>So muſt a Statute to an Ordinance;</l>
               <l>Religion to Prophaneneſſe, and vain-glory;</l>
               <l>The Common-Prayer-Book to the Directory.</l>
               <l>All things are out of order, and I feare,</l>
               <l>Are like to be, till we are as we were:</l>
               <l>Till Biſhops doe returne to end the ſtir</l>
               <l>Twixt th'Independent and the Presbyter.</l>
               <l>Till Kings be Kings, and till we (wiſhed) ſee</l>
               <l>The Church enjoy her ancient Lyturgie.</l>
               <l>Till Loyalty be had in more regard:</l>
               <l>And till Rebellion hath its juſt reward.</l>

            <lg>

               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>All this, and more, may be obtain'd by Prayer.</hi>
