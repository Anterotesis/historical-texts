            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

WE haue marked three cau<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ses
of this commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for it pleased God, vnder
the quyete of the seuenth daye
to gyue the people of Israell a
fygure of a ghostly rest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the fayth full ought to cease
from their owne wyll workes,
and suffer God to worke in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
Seconde, he wolde also that
one certayne daye were assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
wherin the people shulde
assemble togither to heare the

Thirdly God wolde
that seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and suche as be
at other mens commandement
shulde haue one day to rest in,
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they might haue some release

                     <pb facs="tcp:5371:21"/>
first cause, no doubte it ceased
at the commynge of Christ, for
he is the truthe, at whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
forthwith all figures and
tokens vanysh, he is the body,
at whose comminge, shadowes
be left,<note place="margin">Colo. 2</note> Therfore sayth Paul,
the sabboth was but a shadow
of a thinge to come, the trouth
wherof he expoundeth, where
he teacheth we be buryed with
Christ,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> that by hys deathe we
myght dye to the corruption of
our fleshe. Nowe this is not
done in one day, but in the hole
coursse of our lyfe it must be
practised, vntyll at laste beynge
vtterly dead in our selues, we
maye be fylled with the lyfe of
God. Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therfore ought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:5371:21"/>
not to haue any supersticiouse
keping of dayes. But for as
moche as the two latter causes
ought not to be accompted with
the olde shadowes, but serue a
lyke for all tymes, therfore
though the sabboth day be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olyshed,
yet neuerthelesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges
vs euen at thys daye,
this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement hath hys
place, that at certayne dayes
we shulde mete togither for the
hearing of goddes worde, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
breakinge of the mystical bread
and for common prayers to be
made, also that seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and

not be brought to passe (our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie

that all our lyfe longe we shuld
