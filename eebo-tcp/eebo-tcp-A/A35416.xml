            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ot many moneths have paſſed ſince I ſent abroad into the world a little Treatiſe, which knew it ſelf by the name of <hi>Spiritual Opticks,</hi> with intention on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make ſome diſcovery of the mindes and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men towards pieces of that Nature; which having met ſomewhere (it ſeemes) with kinde en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entertainment, and acceptance beyond its expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; hath now perſwaded all its fellows into a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to take wing, and adventure themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy candour and ingenuity. I intend not here to hang out Ivy; nor with my Canvaſe to preface this cloth of gold. The work is weaved of Sunne-beams, to hang any thing before it, were but to obſcure it; yet ſomething here muſt needs be ſaid for mine own diſcharge, and thy better ſatisfaction. Know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (gentle Reader) that theſe pieces were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as Scholaſtick Exerciſes in a Colledge-Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb facs="tcp:50910:5"/>
and therefore more properly ſuited to ſuch an Auditory; yet I make no queſtion but ſome of them, the <hi>White Stone</hi> eſpecially, may be read with much profit, by thoſe who are of meaner capacities, and leſſe refined intellectuals. The <hi>Diſcourſe of the Light of Nature</hi> (which, though here it beare the torch before the reſt, is younger brother to them all) was written above ſix yeers ago; the deſigne of it was, as on the one hand to vindicate the uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in matters of Religion from the aſperſions and prejudices of ſome weaker ones in thoſe times, who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving entertained erroneous opinions, which they were no way able to defend, were taught by their more cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſeducers to wink hard, and except againſt all offenſive weapons: ſo on the other hand to chaſtiſe the ſawcineſſe of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers, who dare ſet <hi>Hagar</hi> above her Miſtreſſe, and make <hi>Faith</hi> waite at the elbow of corrupt &amp; diſtorted <hi>Reaſon;</hi> to take off the head of that uncircumciſed Philiſtim with his own ſword, but better ſharpened; and then to lay it up behinde the Ephod in the Sanctuary. An enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe I confeſſe, of no ſmall import; which yet he hoped, with Gods aſſiſtance, to have effected by giving unto <hi>Reaſon</hi> the things that are <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and unto <hi>Faith</hi> the things that are <hi>Faiths.</hi> And had the world been favoured with his longer life, the height of his parts,
<pb facs="tcp:50910:5"/>
and the earneſt he gave, had beſpoken very ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations in thoſe who knew and heard him: But it pleaſed God (having firſt melted him with his love, and then chaſtiſed him, though ſomewhat ſharply) to take him to himſelf; from the contemplation of the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> to the enjoyment of one <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Light inacceſſible,</hi> which none can ſee and live; and to tranſlate him from ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing <hi>a Candle</hi> here, to be made partaker of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints <hi>in Light.</hi> So that all he finiſht to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that undertaking was this <hi>Diſcourſe of the Light of Nature</hi> in general, not deſcending ſo low as to ſhew how the Moral Law was founded in it, or that Goſpel-revelation doth not extinguiſh it. Wherein, if, ſtanding in the midſt between two adverſaries of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme perſwaſions, while he oppoſes the one, he ſeeme to favour the other more then is meet; when thou ſhalt obſerve him at another time to declare as much againſt the other, thou wilt then be of another minde. Judge candidly, and take his opinion, as thou wouldſt do his picture, ſitting; not from a luxuriant expreſſion (wherein he alwayes allowed for the ſhrinking) but from his declared judgement, when he ſpeaks profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly of ſuch a ſubject. For inſtance, if any expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeeme to lift Reaſon up too high; you may, if you pleaſe, otherwhere hear it confeſſe and bewail its own
<pb facs="tcp:50910:6"/>
weakneſſe; [chap. <hi>12.]</hi> you may ſee it bow the head and worſhip, and then lay it ſelf down quietly at the feet of Faith; [chap. <hi>18.]</hi> So that if thou reade but the whole diſcourſe, thou wilt eaſily perceive (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would often affirme) that he abhorred the very thought of advancing the power of Nature into the throne of Free-Grace, or by the light of Nature in the leaſt meaſure to eclipſe that of Faith.</p>
                  <p>I would not willingly by any <hi>Prolepſis</hi> forestall thy reading, yet if thou ſhouldſt deſire a foretaſt of the Authours ſtile, I would turne thee to the beginning of the ſeventeenth chapter; never was light ſo beſpang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; never did it triumph in greater bravery of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. But I detaine thee too long. Let this ſuffice thee as a courſe Liſt to a finer Webb; or as waſte paper to defend this Book from the injury of its covers.</p>

So that to blaſpheme <hi>Reaſon,</hi> 'tis to reproach heaven it ſelf, and to diſhonour the God of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> to queſtion the beauty of his Image, and by a ſtrange ingratitude to ſlight this great and Royal gift of our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. For 'tis he that ſet up theſe two great Luminaries in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavenly ſoul, <hi>the Sun to rule the day, and the Moon to rule the night;</hi> and though there be ſome kinde of creatures that will bark at this leſſer light, and others ſo ſeverely criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, as that they make mountains of thoſe ſpots and freckles which they ſee in her face; yet others know how to be thankful for her weaker beams, and will follow the leaſt light of Gods ſetting up, though it be but <hi>the Candle of the Lord.</hi>

Or if they themſelves can be willing to be ſo ſhamefully degraded, do they think that all others too are bound to follow their example? Oh, what hard thoughts have theſe of Religion? do they look upon it only as on a bird of prey, that comes to peck out the eyes of men? Is this all the nobility that it gives, that men by vertue of it muſt be beheaded preſently? do's it chop off the intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals at one blow?

Why are a weak and perverſe generation, ſo angry and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with it? Is it becauſe this daughter of the morning is fallen from her primitive glory? from her original vigour and perfection? Far be it from me to extenuate that great and fatal overthrow, which the ſons of men had in their firſt and original apoſtaſie from their God; that under which the whole Creation ſigh's and groanes: but this we are ſure, it did not annihilate the ſoul, it did not deſtroy the eſſence, the powers and faculties, nor the operations of the ſoul; though it did defile them, and diſorder them, and every way indiſpoſe them.</p>

'Tis but an old imperfect Manuſcript, with ſome broken periods, ſome letters worn out, muſt they therefore with an unmerciful indignation rend it and tear it aſunder?

Would you perſwade the Lutaniſt to cut all his ſtrings in ſunder, becauſe they are out of tune? and will you break the Bowe upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but becauſe it's unbended? becauſe men have not ſo much of <hi>Reaſon</hi> as they ſhould, will they therefore reſolve to have none at all? will you throw away your gold, becauſe it's mixt with droſſe?

And though the envious Jews would fain perſwade the world that he lighted his can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle at hell it ſelf, for they eſteemed him no better then a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician; as they eſteemed him alſo that was greater then <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon;</hi> yet we know very well, that <hi>Solomons</hi> was a purer Candle then to be lighted at a Lake of fire and brimſtone; 'twas not of Lucifers ſetting up, but it came from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights, 'twas lighted with Sun-beams from heaven.</p>
                     <p>And 'tis a modeſt and humble expreſsion in him to call his underſtanding <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> when as the world look'd upon him as a ſtar of the firſt magnitude, nay as a Sun ſhining in the firmament, gilding the world with knowledge, ſcattering beams of light, ſparkling out in wiſe and prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial ſayings, ſo that the bordering Princes and Nations are

For 'tis very agreeable to the choyceſt, and ſupremeſt being; and the Apoſtle tells us of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. So that 'tis time at length to draw the veile from <hi>Natures</hi> face, and to look upon her beauty.</p>
                     <p>And firſt, 'tis the uſual language of many, both Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and others, to put <hi>Nature</hi> for God himſelf, or at leaſt for the general providence of God; and this in the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens rough and unpoliſht Latin, is ſtiled <hi>Natura naturans;</hi> thus <hi>Nature</hi> is took for that conſtant and Catholick Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that ſpreads its wings over all created beings, and ſhrouds them under its warme and happy protection. Thus that elegant Moraliſt <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaks more like to himſelf then in his former deſcription. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; <hi>Nature</hi> is in all things accurate and punctual, 'tis not defective nor parſimonious, nor yet ſprouting and luxuriant: and conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to this is that ſure axiome, <hi>Natura nihil facit fruſtrá.</hi> Thus God ſet up the world as a fair and goodly clock, to ſtrike in time, and to move in an orderly manner, not by its own weights (as <hi>Durand</hi> would have it) but by freſh influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from himſelf, by that inward and intimate ſpring of immediate concourſe, that ſhould ſupply it in a moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and proportionable manner.</p>
                     <p>Thus God framed this great Organ of the world, he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50910:18"/>
tuned it, yet not ſo as that it could play upon it ſelf, or make any muſick by vertue of this general compoſure, (as <hi>Durand</hi> fanſies it) but that it might be fitted and prepared for the finger of God himſelf, and at the preſence of his powerful touch might ſound forth the praiſe of its Creatour in a moſt ſweet and harmonious manner.</p>
                     <p>And thus <hi>Nature</hi> is that regular line, which the wiſdome of God himſelf has drawn in being <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, as he ſpeaks, whereas that which they miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd Fortune, was nothing but a line fuller of windings and varieties; and as <hi>Nature</hi> was a fixt and ordinary kinde of Providence; ſo <hi>Fortune</hi> was nothing but a more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe, and myſterious, and occult kinde of Providence, and therefore <hi>Fortune</hi> was not blinde, as they falſely painted and repreſented her; but they themſelves were blinde and could not ſee into her. And in this ſenſe that ſpeech of that grave Moraliſt <hi>Seneca</hi> is very remarkable, <hi>Providentia, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, natura, caſus, fortuna ſunt ejuſdem Dei varia nomina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But then ſecondly, <hi>Nature</hi> as 'tis ſcattered and diſtributed in particular beings, ſo 'tis the very ſame with eſſence it ſelf, and therefore ſpirituals, as they have their eſſence, ſo they have their <hi>Nature</hi> too, and if we gloried in names, 'twould be eaſie to heap up a multitude of teſtimonies in which theſe two muſt needs be <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>And thus <hi>Nature</hi> ſpeaks theſe two things.</p>
                     <p n="1">1) It points out <hi>Originem entis,</hi> 'tis the very <hi>Genius</hi> of Entity, 'tis preſent at the nativity of every being, nay 'tis being it ſelf.

                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2) It ſpeaks <hi>Operationem entis,</hi> and 'tis a principle of working in ſpirituals, as well as <hi>principium motûs &amp; quietis</hi> in corporeals.

                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:50910:19"/>

                     <p>And ſo ſome, and <hi>Grotius</hi> amongſt the reſt, would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that place of the Apoſtle, <hi>Does not even Nature it ſelf teach you,</hi> of a general cuſtome: but that word <gap reason="foreign">

Whereas theſe workings were alwayes reckoned to be at the moſt but <hi>inclinationes, &amp; pondera,</hi> and not the fruits of

a legiſlative power. But yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſtaine the pride of them that gloried in the Law, calls ſuch things by the name of Law as were moſt odious and anomalous. Thus he tells us of <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>: Thus he mentions <hi>Legem membrorum,</hi> the ſame which the Schoolmen call <hi>Legem fomitis.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore <hi>Suarez</hi> does give us a more refined de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, when he tells us that <hi>Lex eſt menſura quaedam actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um moralium, it à ut per conformitatem ad illam, Rectitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem moralem habeant, &amp; ſi ab illa diſcordent, obliqui ſint.</hi> A Law is ſuch a juſt and regular tuning of Actions, as that by vertue of this they may conſpire into a moral muſick, and become very pleaſant and harmonious.

                        </gap> that is in Lawes, and in his ſecond book <hi>De Leg.</hi> he does altogether diſcourſe of harmony, and does infinitely prefer mental and intellectual muſick, thoſe powerful and practical ſtrains of goodneſſe, that ſpring from a well-compoſed ſpirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe delicious blandiſhments, thoſe ſoft and tranſient touches that comply with ſenſe, and ſalute it in a more flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering manner; and he tells you of a ſpiritual dancing that is anſwerable to ſo ſweet a muſick, to theſe <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And thus as <hi>Aristotle</hi> well obſerves, ſome Lawes were wont to be put in verſe, and to be ſung like ſo many plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant odes, that might even charme the people into obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>

'Tis true, that learned Philoſopher gives this reaſon of it, they were put into verſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that they might remember them the better: but why may not this reaſon alſo ſhare with it, that they might come with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grace and allurement, that they might hear them as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly as they would do the voice of a Viall or an Harp, that has Rhetorick enough to ſtill and quiet the evill ſpirit? But yet this does not ſufficiently paint out the being of a Law, to ſay that 'tis only <hi>regula &amp; menſura;</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> himſelf is ſo ingenuous as to tell us that he cannot reſt ſatisfied with this deſcription, which he drew but with a coale as a rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather then a full portraiture; and therefore we'll give him ſome time to perfect it, and to put it into more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient colours.</p>
                     <p>And in the meane time we'll look upon that ſpeculative Law-giver, <hi>Plato</hi> I mean, who was alwayes new modelling of Lawes, and rolling Political Ideas in his minde.</p>
                     <p>Now you may ſee him gradually aſcending and climbing up to the deſcription of a law, by theſe four ſeveral ſteps, &amp; yet he does not reach the top &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaks. Whereas <hi>turpe praeceptum non est lex, ſed iniquitas,</hi> for obligation that's the very forme and eſſence of a Law; Now every Law <hi>obligat in Nomine Dei;</hi> but ſo glorious a name did never binde to any thing that was wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Yet you muſt take notice here of theſe two things. (1) That he did not lay ſtreſſe enough upon that binding ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is the very ſinew, nay the life and ſoul of a Law. (2) That theſe three deſcriptions <gap reason="foreign">

But in reſpect of him that is ſubject to the Law it does conſiſt <hi>in actu rationis,</hi> 'tis required only that he ſhould know it, not <hi>in actu voluntatis,</hi> it does not depend upon his obedience. The want of his will is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to enervate and invalidate a Law when 'tis made; all Lawes then would be abrogated every moment. His will indeed is required to the execution and fulfilling of the Law, not to the validity and exiſtence of the Law: and thus all the lawes of God do not at all depend upon the will of man, but upon the power and will of the Law-giver. Now in the framing of every Law there is to be</p>
                     <p n="1">1) <hi>Intentio boni communis,</hi> and thus that ſpeech of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neades, Vtilitas juſti propè mater, &amp; aequi,</hi> if it be took in this ſenſe, is very commendable; whereas in that other ſenſe (in which 'tis thought he meant it) is not ſo much as tolerable. Law-givers ſhould ſend out lawes with Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches in their mouths, they ſhould be fruitful and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; they ſhould drop ſweetneſſe and fatneſſe upon a land. Let not then <hi>Brambles</hi> make lawes for <hi>Trees,</hi> leſt they ſcratch them and tear them, and write their lawes in blood. But Law-givers are to ſend out lawes, as the Sun ſhoots forth his beams, <hi>with healing under their wings:</hi> and thus that elegant Moraliſt <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſpeaks.

Whereas a Law ſhould be a ſtaffe for a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to lean on, and not a Reed to pierce it through. Laws ſhould be cords of love, not nets and ſnares. Hence it is that thoſe laws are moſt radical and fundamental, that principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the conſervation of the vitals and eſſentials of a Kingdome; and thoſe come neereſt the Law of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and are participations of that eternal Law, which is the ſpring and original of all inferiour and derivative lawes. <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis pure judgement without affections, a Law is impartial and makes no factions; and a Law cannot be bribed though a Judge may.

ſo the beauty of this Law gives ſome repreſentations of it ſelf in thoſe pure derivations of inferiour Lawes that ſtream from it.

                     <p>So then, that there is ſuch a prime and ſupreme Law is clear, and unqueſtionable; but who is worthy to unſeal and open this Law? and who can ſufficiently diſplay the glory of it? we had need of a <hi>Moſes</hi> that could aſcend up into the Mount, and converſe with God himſelf, and yet when he came down he would be faine to put a veile upon his face, and upon his expreſſions too, leſt otherwiſe he might too much dazzle inferiour underſtandings; but if the Schoolmen will ſatisfie you, (and you know ſome of them are ſtiled Angelical, and Seraphical) you ſhall hear, if you will, what they'l ſay to it.</p>

So that by this you ſee hovv thoſe eternal <hi>idea's</hi> in the minde of God, and this eternal Law do differ. I ſpeak now of <hi>Idea's</hi> not in a Platonical ſence, but in a Scholaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, (unleſſe they both agree, as ſome would have them.) For <hi>Idea est posſibilium, Lex tantùm futurorum,</hi> God had before him the picture of every poſſibility, yet he did not intend to binde a poſſibility, but only a futurity. Beſides, <hi>Idea's</hi> they were ſituated only in the <hi>underſtanding</hi> of God; whereas a Law has force and efficacy from his <hi>will;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that much commended ſaying, <hi>In Coeleſti &amp; Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca curia voluntas Dei Lex eſt.</hi> And then an <hi>Idea</hi> does <hi>magìs reſpicere artificem,</hi> it ſtayes there where firſt it was; but a Law does <hi>Potiùs reſpicere ſubditum,</hi> it calls for the obedience of another, as <hi>Suarez</hi> does very well difference them.</p>
                     <p>Neither yet is this eternal Law the ſame with the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, though that be eternal alſo. But as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Lex ſe habet ad providentiam, ſicut principium ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerale ad particulares concluſiones;</hi> or, if you will, <hi>Sicut principia primae practicae ad prudentiam;</hi> his meaning is this, that Providence is a more punctual and particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this binding rule, and is not the Law it ſelf but the ſuperintending power, which looks to the execution and accompliſhment of it; or as the moſt acute <hi>Suarez</hi> has it, <hi>Lex dicit jus in communi conſtitutum, providentia dicit curam quae de ſingulis actibus haberi debet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Beſides, a Law in its ſtrict and peculiar notion, does only reach to rational beings; whereas Providence does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and ſpread it ſelf over all. But that which vexes the Schoolmen moſt, is this, that they having required promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation as a neceſſary condition to the exiſtence of a Law, yet they cannot very eaſily ſhew how this eternal Law, ſhould be publiſht from everlaſting. But the moſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory account that can be given to that, is this, that other Law-givers being very voluble and mutable before their minde and will be fully and openly declared, they may
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50910:26"/>
have a purpoſe indeed, but it cannot be eſteem'd a Law. But in God there being no variablenes nor ſhadow of turning, this his Law has a binding vertue as ſoon as it has a being, yet ſo as that it does not actually and formally oblige a creature till it be made known unto it: either by ſome revelation from God himſelf which is poſſible only, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; or elſe by the mediation of ſome other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

the vehemency and neceſſity of natural inclinations; nay, ſenſitive beings cannot reach or aſpire to ſo great a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as to be wrought upon in ſuch an illuminative way as a Law is; they are not drawn with theſe cords of men, with theſe moral ingagements, but in a more impulſive manner driven and ſpurred on with ſuch impetuous propenſions as are founded in matter; which yet are directed by the wiſe and vigilant eye, and by the powerful hand of a Providence to a more beautiful and amiable end, then they themſelves were acquainted with.

                     <p>His meaning is not much different from this:</p>
                     <p>Right Reaſon is a beautiful Law; a Law of a pure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, of a natural colour, of a vaſt extent and diffuſion; its colour never fades, never dies. It encourages men in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience with a ſmile, it chides them and frowns them out of wickedneſſe. Good men heare the leaſt whiſpering of its pleaſant voice, they obſerve the leaſt glance of its lovely eye; but wicked men ſometimes will not heare it though it come to them in thunder; nor take the leaſt notice of it, though it ſhould flaſh out in lightning. None muſt inlarge the Phylacteries of this law, nor muſt any dare to prune off the leaſt branch of it. Nay the malice of man cannot total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deface ſo indelible a beauty. No Pope, nor Prince, nor Parliament, nor People, nor Angel, nor Creature can ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50910:33"/>
you from it. This Law never paints its face, it never changes its colour, it does not put on one Aſpect at <hi>Athens</hi> and another face at <hi>Rome,</hi> but looks upon all Nations &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with an impartial eye, it ſhines upon all ages and times, and conditions, with a perpetual light, <hi>it is yesterday and to day, the ſame for ever.</hi> There is but one Law-giver, one Lord and ſupreme Judge of this Law, <hi>God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> He was the contriver of it, the commander of it, the publiſher of it, and none can be exempted from it, unleſſe he will be baniſht from his own eſſence, and be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from humane Nature.</p>
                     <p>This puniſhment would have ſting enough, if he ſhould avoid a thouſand more that are due to ſo foul a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee that the Heathen, not only had this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> upon them; but alſo they themſelves took ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of it, and the more refined ſort amongſt them, could diſcourſe very admirably about it, which muſt needs leave them the more inexcuſable, for the violation of it. We come now to ſee where the ſtrength of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lies, where its nerves are, where it has ſuch an efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous influence, ſuch a binding vertue.</p>
                     <p>And I finde <hi>Vaſquez</hi> ſomewhat ſingular, and withal erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous in his opinion, whileſt he goes about to ſhew that the formality of this Law conſiſts only in that harmony and proportion, or elſe that diſcord and diſconvenience, which ſuch and ſuch an object, and ſuch and ſuch an action has with a Rational Nature; for, ſaies he, every Eſſence is <hi>Menſura Boni &amp; Mali</hi> in reſpect of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Which, as he thinks, is plainly manifeſted and diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo in corporal beings, which uſe to flie only from ſuch things as are deſtructive to their own formes, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all ſuch neighbourly and friendly beings as will cloſe and comply with them. But he might eaſily have known
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50910:33"/>
that as theſe material beings were never yet ſo honoured, as to be judg'd capable of a Law; ſo neither can any naked Eſſence, though never ſo pure and noble, lay a Moral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon it ſelf, or binde its own being: for this would make the very ſame being ſuperior to it ſelf, as it gives a Law, and inferiour to it ſelf, as it muſt obey it.</p>
                     <p>So that the moſt high and Sovereigne being even God himſelf, does not ſubject himſelf to any Law; though there be ſome Actions alſo moſt agreeable to his Nature, and others plainly inconſiſtent with it, yet they cannot amount to ſuch a power, as to lay any obligation upon him, which ſhould in the leaſt Notion differ from the liberty of his own eſſence.</p>
                     <p>Thus alſo in the Common-wealth of humane Nature, that proportion which Actions bear to Reaſon, is indeed a ſufficient foundation for a Law to build upon; but it is not the Law it ſelf, nor a formal obligation.</p>
                     <p>Yet ſome of the School-men are extreme bold and vaine in their ſuppoſitions; ſo bold, as that I am ready to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether it be beſt to repeate them; yet thus they ſay,</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Si Deus non eſſet, vel ſi non uteretur Ratione, vel ſi non rectè judicaret de Rebus, ſi tamen in homine idem eſſet dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Rectaerationis, quod nunc eſt, haberet etiam eandem Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Legis quam nunc habet.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>But what are the goodly ſpoyles that theſe men expect, if they could break through ſuch a croud of Repugnancies and impoſſibilities? the whole reſult and product of it will prove but a meer Cipher, for Reaſon as 'tis now does not binde in its own name, but in the name of its ſupreme Lord and Sovereigne, by whom Reaſon lives, and moves, and has its being.</p>
                     <p>For if only a creature ſhould binde it ſelf to the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Law, it muſt alſo inflict upon it ſelf ſuch a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as is anſwerable to the violation of it: but no ſuch being would be willing or able to puniſh it ſelf in ſo high a
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50910:34"/>
meaſure as ſuch a tranſgreſſion would meritoriouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; ſo that it muſt be accountable to ſome other Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, which will vindicate its own commands, and will by this means ingage a Creature, to be more mindeful of its own happineſſe, then otherwiſe it would be.</p>
                     <p>For though ſome of the Gallanter Heathen can brave it out ſometimes in an expreſſion; that the very turpitude of ſuch an action is puniſhment enough, and the very beauty of goodneſſe is an abundant reward and compenſation; yet we ſee that all this, and more then this, did not efficaciouſly prevaile with them for their due conformity and full obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Natures Law; ſuch a ſingle cord as this, will be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily broken.</p>
                     <p>Yet there is ſome truth in what they ſay, for thus much is viſible and apparent, that there is ſuch a Magnetical power in ſome good, as muſt needs allure and attract a Rational Being; there is ſuch a native fairneſſe, ſuch an intrinſecal lovelineſſe in ſome objects as does not depend upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal command, but by its own worth muſt needs win up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Soul: and there is ſuch an inſeparable deformity and malignity in ſome evill, as that Reaſon muſt needs loath it and abominate it.</p>
                     <p>Inſomuch as that if there were no Law or Command, yet a Rational being of its own accord, out of meere love would eſpouſe it ſelf to ſuch an amiable good, 'twould claſpe and twine about ſuch a precious object, and if there were not the leaſt check or prohibition, yet in order to its own welfare, 'twould abhor and flie from ſome black evils, that ſpit out ſo much venome againſt its Nature.</p>
                     <p>This is that which the School-men meane, when they tell us, <hi>Quaedam ſunt mala, quia prohibentur; ſed alia prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentur, quia ſunt mala:</hi> that is, in Poſitive Lawes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Divine, or Humane; Acts are to be eſteem'd evill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, becauſe they are forbidden; but in the Law of Nature ſuch an evill was intimately and inevitably an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50910:34"/>
though it ſhould not be forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Now that there are ſuch <hi>Bona per ſe,</hi> and <hi>Mala per ſe,</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak) I ſhall thus demonſtrate: <hi>Quod non eſt Malum per ſe potuit non prohiberi,</hi> for there is no reaſon ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable why there ſhould not be a poſſibility of not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting that which is not abſolutely evil, which is in its own nature indifferent.</p>
                     <p>But now there are ſome evils ſo exceſſively evil, ſo intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably bad, as that they cannot but be forbidden; I ſhall only name this one; <hi>Odium Dei,</hi> for a Being to hate the Creatour and cauſe of its being, if it were poſſible for this not to be forbidden; it were poſſible for it to be lawful; for <hi>Vbi nulla Lex, ibi nulla praevaricatio:</hi> Where there's no Law there's no <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>; where there's no Rule, there's no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomaly; if there were no prohibition of this, 'twould not be ſin to do it. But that to hate God ſhould not be ſin, does involve a whole heap of contradictions; ſo that this evill is ſo full of evill, as that it cannot but be forbidden; and therefore is an evil in order of Nature before the Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Beſides, as the Philoſophers love to ſpeak, <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiae rerum ſunt immutabiles,</hi> Eſſences neither ebbe nor flow, but have in themſelves a perpetual Unity and Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: and all ſuch properties as flow and bubble up from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, are conſtant and unvariable, but if they could be ſtopt in their motion, yet that ſtate would be violent, and not at all connatural to ſuch a ſubject.</p>
                     <p>So that grant only the being of man, and you cannot but grant this alſo; that there is ſuch a conſtant conveniency and Analogy, which ſome objects have with its Eſſence, as that it cannot but encline to them, and that there is ſuch an irreconcileable Diſconvenience, ſuch an Eternal Antipathy between it and other objects, as that it muſt ceaſe to be what it is before it can come neer them.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Suarez</hi> termes a Natural Obligation, and a juſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for a Law; but now before all this can riſe up to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50910:35"/>
height and perfection of a Law: there muſt come a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from ſome Superiour Powers, from whence will ſpring a Moral obligation alſo, and make up the formality of a Law.</p>
                     <p>Therefore God himſelf, for the brightning of his own Glory, for the better regulating and tuning of the world; for the maintaining of ſuch a choyce peece of his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip as man is, has publiſht this his Royal command, and proclaim'd it by that Principle of Reaſon, which he has planted in the being of man: which does fully convince him of the righteouſneſſe, and goodneſſe, and neceſſity of this Law, for the materials of it; and of the validity and authority of this Law, as it comes from the minde and will of his Creatour. Neither is it any eclipſe or diminution of the Liberty of that firſt being; to ſay that there is ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill ſo foul and ill-favour'd, as that it cannot but be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by him; and that there is ſome good ſo fair and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, as that he cannot but command it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For, as the Schoolmen obſerve,</hi> Divina voluntas, licèt ſimpliciter libera ſit ad extra, ex ſuppoſitione tamen unius, Actûs liberi, potest neceſsitari ad alium.</p>
                     <p>Though the will of God be compleatly free in reſpect of all his looks and glances towards the Creature, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding upon the voluntary and free precedency of one Act, we may juſtly conceive him neceſſitated to another, by vertue of that indiſſoluble connexion and concatenation between theſe two Acts, which does in a manner knit and unite them into one.</p>
                     <p>Thus God has an abſolute liberty and choyce, whether he will make a promiſe or no, but if he has made it, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but fulfil it. Thus he is perfectly free, whether he will reveal his minde or no, but if he will reveal it, he cannot but ſpeak truth, and manifeſt it as it is.</p>
                     <p>God had the very ſame liberty whether he would create a world or no, but if he will create it, and keep it in its come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50910:35"/>
and proportion, he muſt then have a vigilant and providential eye over it; and if he will provide for it, he cannot but have a perfect and indefective Providence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his own wiſdome, and goodneſſe, and being, ſo that if he will create ſuch a being as Man; ſuch a Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creature furniſht with ſufficient knowledge to diſcern between ſome good and evill; and if he will ſupply it with a proportionable concourſe in its operations; he cannot then but prohibit ſuch acts as are intrinſecally prejudicial and detrimental to the being of it; neither can he but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch acts as are neceſſary to its preſervation and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
                     <p>God therefore when from all eternity in his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thoughts he contriv'd the being of man, he did alſo with his piercing eye ſee into all conveniences and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, which would be in reference to ſuch a being; and by his eternal Law did reſtrain and determine it to ſuch acts as ſhould be advantageous to it, which in his wiſe Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy and diſpenſation, he publiſht to man by the voyce of Reaſon, by the Mediation of this Natural Law.</p>
                     <p>Whence it is that every violation of this Law, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an injury to mans being, but <hi>ultra nativam rei malitiam,</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak) 'tis alſo a vertual and interpretative contempt of that ſupreme Law-giver, who out of ſo much wiſdome, love, and goodneſſe did thus binde man to his own happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>So much then as man does ſtart aſide and Apoſtatize from this Law, to ſo much miſery and puniſhment does he expoſe himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Though it be not neceſſary that the <hi>Candle</hi> of nature ſhould diſcover the full extent and meaſure of that puniſhment which is due to the breakers of this Law, for to the Nature of puniſhment, <hi>non requiritur ut praecognita ſit poena, ſed ut fiat actus Dignus tali poenâ.</hi> The Lawyers and the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men both will acknowledge this Principle.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:50910:36"/>
For as <hi>Suarez</hi> has it, <hi>Sequitur reatus ex intrinſeca conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one culpae, Ità ut licèt poena per Legem non ſit determinata, Arbitrio tamen competentis judicis puniri poſſit.</hi> Yet the Light of Nature will reveal and diſcloſe thus much: That a being totally dependent upon another, eſſentially ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate and ſubject to it, muſt alſo be accountable to it for every provocation and rebellion: And for the violation of ſo good a Law, which he has ſet it, and for the ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch admirable Providence and juſtice as ſhines out upon it; muſt be liable to ſuch a puniſhment, as that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Law-giver ſhall judge fit for ſuch an offence; who is ſo full of juſtice, as that he cannot, and ſo great in goodneſſe, as that he will not puniſh a Creature above its deſert.</p>

                     <p>There's ſcatter'd in the Soul of Man ſome ſeeds of light, which fill it with a vigorous pregnancy, with a multiplying fruitfulneſſe, ſo that it brings forth a numerous and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling poſterity of ſecondary Notions, which make for the crowning and encompaſſing of the Soul with happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>All the freſh ſprings of Common and Fountain-Notions are in the Soul of Man, for the watering of his Eſſence, for the refreſhing of this heavenly Plant, this <hi>Arbor inverſa,</hi> this encloſed being, this Garden of God.</p>
                     <p>And though the wickedneſſe of man may ſtop the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant motion, the clearand Cryſtalline progreſſe of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,

yet they cannot hinder the firſt riſings, the bubling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of it. They may pull off Natures leaves, and pluck off her fruit, and chop off her branches, but yet the root of it is eternal, the foundation of it is inviolable.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe firſt and Radical Principles are wound up in ſome ſuch ſhort bottomes as theſe: <hi>Bonum eſt appetendum, malum eſt fugiendum; Beatitudo eſt quaerenda; Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri nè feceris.</hi> And Reaſon thus <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>For you muſt not, nor cannot think that Natures Law is confin'd and contracted within the compaſſe of two or three common Notions, but Reaſon as with one foot it fixes a Centre, ſo with the other it meaſures and ſpreads out a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, it drawes ſeveral concluſions, which do all meet and croud into theſe firſt, and Central Principles.

                        </gap>, which are granted as ſoone as they are askt, if not before; but there are alſo whole heaps of firme and immovable Demonſtrations, that are built upon them.

                     <p>For men muſt not only look upon the capital letters of this <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50910:37"/>
then one jot or title of this Law ſhall vaniſh.</p>
                     <p>They muſt not only gaze upon two or three Principles of the firſt Magnitude, but they muſt take notice of the leſſer Celeſtial <hi>Sporades,</hi> for theſe alſo have their light and influence.</p>
                     <p>They muſt not only skim off the Creame of firſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but whatſoever ſweetneſſe comes ſtreaming from the Dugge of Nature, they muſt feed upon it, they may be nouriſht with it.</p>

yet being fetcht from clear and unqueſtionable premiſſes, they have <hi>Natures</hi> Seal upon them; and are thus farre ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, ſo as to have the uſual priviledge of a Concluſion, to be untoucht and undeniable.</p>
                     <p>For though that learned Author, whom I mention'd not long before, do juſtly take notice of this, that diſcourſe is the uſual in-let to Errour, and too often gives an open ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and courteous entertainment to ſuch falſities, as come diſguis'd in a Syllogiſtical forme, which by their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious windings and Gradual inſinuations, twine about ſome weak underſtandings: yet in the nature of the thing it ſelf, 'tis as impoſſible to collect an Errour out of a Truth, as 'tis to gather the blackeſt night out of the faireſt Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine, or the fouleſt wickedneſſe out of the pureſt goodneſſe. A Concluſion therefore that's built upon the Sand, you may very well expect its fall, but that which is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock is impregnable and immovable; for if the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> ſhould not extend it ſelf ſo farre, as to oblige men to an accurate obſervation of that, which is a remoov or two diſtant from firſt Principles, 'twould then prove extremely defective in ſome ſuch Precepts as do moſt intimately and intenſely conduce to the welfare and advantage of an Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual being.</p>
                     <p>And theſe firſt Notions would be moſt barren ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpeculations, unleſſe they did thus encreaſe and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and bring forth fruit with the bleſſing of heaven upon them.</p>
                     <p>So that there is a neceſſary connexion, and concatenati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between firſt Principles, and ſuch Concluſions. For as <hi>Suarez</hi> has it, <hi>Veritas Principii continetur in concluſione:</hi> ſo that he that queſtions the Concluſion, muſt needs alſo ſtrike at the Principle. Nay, if we look to the notion of a Law, there is more of that to be ſeen in theſe more particular deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, then in thoſe more Univerſal notions; for <hi>Lex eſt proxima Regula operationum.</hi> But now particulars are neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50910:38"/>
to exiſtence and operation then univerſals: and in this reſpect do more immediately ſteere and direct the motions of ſuch a being. The one is the bending of the bowe, but the other is the ſhooting of the Arrow.</p>
                     <p>Suarez <hi>does fully determine this in ſuch words as theſe,</hi> Haec omnia Praecepta <hi>(he means both Principles and Concluſions)</hi> prodeunt à Deo Auctore Naturae, &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt ad eundem finem, nimirum ad debitam conſervatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, &amp; Naturalem perfectionem, ſeu foelicitatem Humanae Naturae.</p>
                     <p>This Law of <hi>Nature</hi> as it is thus brancht forth, does binde <hi>in foro Conſcientiae;</hi> for as that noble Author, (whom I more then once commended before) ſpeaks very well in this; Natural Conſcience 'tis <hi>Centrum Notitiarum Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> and 'tis a kinde of <hi>Senſus Communis</hi> in reſpect of the inward faculties, as that other is in reſpect of the outward Senſes. 'Tis a competent Judge of this Law of <hi>Nature:</hi> 'tis the Natural Pulſe of the Soul, by the beating and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the ſtate and temper of men is diſcernable. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thus felt the Heathens pulſe, and found their conſciences ſometimes accuſing them, ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Apology for them. Yet there's a great deale of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Natural Conſcience, and the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> for (as the School-men ſpeak) Conſcience, 'tis <hi>Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Practicum in Particulari;</hi> 'tis a proſecution and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Natural Law, as Providence is of that Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Law.</p>
                     <p>Nay, Conſcience ſometimes does embrace only the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a Law, and does engage men though erroneouſly to the obſervation of that which was never dictated by any juſt Legiſlative power. Nor is itcontent to glance only at what's to come, but <hi>Janus</hi>-like it has a double aſpect, and ſo looks back to what's paſt, as to call men to a ſtrict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt for every violation of this Law.</p>
                     <p>Which Law is ſo accurate as to oblige men not only
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50910:38"/>
                        <hi>ad Actum,</hi> but <hi>ad modum</hi> alſo: it looks as well to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forme and manner, as to the materiality and bulk of outward actions: for every being owes thus much kindneſſe and courteſie to it ſelf, not only to put forth ſuch acts as are eſſential and intrinſecal to its own welfare; but alſo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, and to fulſil them with all poſſible freeneſſe and alacrity, with the greateſt intenſneſſe and complacency. Self-love alone might eaſily conſtraine men to this natural obedience. Humane Lawes indeed reſt ſatisfi'd with a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and external obedience; but Natures Law darts it ſelf into the moſt intimate Eſſentials, and looks for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there.</p>
                     <p>You know that amongſt the Moraliſts only ſuch acts are eſteem'd <hi>Actus Humani</hi> that are <hi>Actus Voluntarii.</hi> When <hi>Nature</hi> has tuned a Rational Being, ſhe expects that every ſtring, every faculty ſhould ſpontaneouſly and cheerfully ſound forth his praiſe.</p>
                     <p>And the God of <hi>Nature</hi> that has not chain'd, nor fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, nor enſlav'd ſuch a Creature, but has given it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent liberty and enlargement; the free diffuſion and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of its own Eſſence; he looks withal that it ſhould willingly conſent to its own happineſſe, and to all ſuch means as are neceſſary for the accompliſhment of its choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt end: and that it ſhould totally abhorre whatſoever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and prejudicial to its own being; which if it do, 'twill preſently embrace the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> if it either love its God or it ſelf; the command of its God, or the welfare of it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Nay, the precepts of this natural Law are ſo potent and triumphant, as that ſome acts which rebel againſt it, become not only <hi>Illiciti,</hi> but <hi>Irriti,</hi> as both the Schoolmen and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers obſerve: they are not only irregularities, but meere nullities: and that either <hi>ob defectum Poteſtatis &amp; Incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Materiae,</hi> as if one ſhould go about to give the ſame thing to two ſeveral Perſons, the ſecond Donation is a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

Neither does it depend only <hi>à mente Legis-latoris,</hi> which is the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Riſe of Mitigation; but 'tis converſant about ſuch acts as are <hi>Per ſe tales,</hi> moſt intrinſecally and inſeparably.</p>
                     <p>Yet notwithſtanding this Law does not refuſe an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, but <hi>Nature</hi> herſelf does gloſſe upon her own Law, as in what circumſtances ſuch an Act is to be eſteem'd murder, and when not; and ſo in many other branches of <hi>Natures</hi> Law, if there be any appearance of Intricacy, any ſeeming knot and difficulty, <hi>Nature</hi> has given edge enough to cut it aſunder.</p>
                     <p>There is another Law bordering upon this Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Jus Gentium, Juri Naturali Propinquum &amp; conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum;</hi> and 'tis <hi>Medium quoddam, inter Jus Naturale &amp; Jus Civile.</hi> Now this <hi>Jus Gentium</hi> is either <hi>per ſimilitudinem &amp; concomitantiam,</hi> when ſeveral Nations in their diſtinct conditions have yet ſome of the ſame poſitive Lawes: or elſe (which indeed is moſt properly <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Now, though the formality of humane Lawes do flow immediately from the power of ſome particular men; yet the ſtrength and ſinew of theſe Lawes is founded in the Law of <hi>Nature;</hi> for <hi>Nature</hi> does permiſſively give them leave to make ſuch Lawes as are for their greater convenience; and when they are made, and whileſt they are in their force and vigour, it does oblige and command them not to break or violate them: for they are not to contradict their own Acts, nor to oppoſe ſuch commands, as <hi>ex Pacto</hi> were fram'd and conſtituted by themſelves.</p>

                     <p>There was never any partition-wall between the Eſſence of Jew and Gentile: Now the Law of <hi>Nature</hi> 'tis founded in Eſſentials.

This is the riſe and original of all that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which is in the Law of Nature. But the publiſhing and manifeſtation of this Law which muſt give notice of all this, does flow from that heavenly beame which God has darted into the ſoul of man; from <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> which God has lighted up for the diſcovery of his owne Lawes; from that intellectual eye which God has fram'd and made exactly proportionable to this Light.</p>
                     <p>Therefore we ſhall eaſily grant that the obligation of this Law does not come from this <hi>Candle of the Lord;</hi> and others I ſuppoſe will not deny that the <hi>Manifeſtation</hi> of this Law does come from this <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> that the <hi>Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of this Law is made by the voice of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>

                     <p>In order of <hi>Nature,</hi> this Law, as all others, muſt be made, before it can be made known, Entity being the juſt Root and bottome of Intelligibility. So that <hi>Reaſon</hi> does not <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> or <hi>ferre legem,</hi> but only <hi>invenire,</hi> as a Candle does not produce an object, but only preſent it to the eye, and make it viſible. All verity 'tis but the gloſſe of Entity, there's a loving Union and Communion between them, as ſoone as being is it may be known.</p>
                     <p>So that <hi>Reaſon</hi> is the Pen by which <hi>Nature</hi> writes this Law of her own compoſing; This Law 'tis publiſht by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from heaven, and Reaſon is the Printer: This eye of the ſoul 'tis to ſpy out all dangers and all advantages, all conveniences and diſconveniences in reference to ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to warne the ſoul in the name of its Creator, to fly

but that the churliſhneſſe of the matter will not well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and entertain ſuch pure irradiations, for thus he ſpeaks; <hi>Eundem Intellectum etiam belluis imminere, eaſque ambire: At ipſi non patere Aditum, propter materiae inepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem.

Nay, ſome tell us that he was left him for an inheritance, ſhut up in a Ring, enclos'd in a golden circle, a goodly ſphere for an Intelligence to move in.

Nay, <hi>Scaliger</hi> tells us of ſome others, that will have this <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> to be <hi>caput &amp; Author conſiliorum omnium,</hi> the contriver of the rareſt and wittieſt inventions; the Author of Guns, of Clocks, of Printing, of the <hi>Pyxis nautica: Materialem verò Intellectum eſſe quaſi Vſufructuarium, &amp; beneficiarium illius.</hi>

                     <p>The Jews eſpecially admire and adore the Influence of an <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> and not forgetful of their Primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and priviledges, but being alwayes a conceited and a bragging generation, they would fain perſwade us that God himſelf is their <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> but to the Gentiles he ſends only an Angel to illuminate them.</p>

                     <p>Amongſt freſher and more moderne writers, <hi>Zabarel</hi> is very intenſe and zealous for this, that God himſelf is the <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> of the ſoul: but being a moſt humble and devoted ſervant of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he can by no means quiet and content himſelf unleſſe he can ſhew the world that his Maſter was of the ſame judgement.</p>
                     <p>This makes him to ſuborne two or three Teſtimonies, or at leaſt to tamper with a place or two; and then bravely to conclude that without doubt 'twas the minde of the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, which is not only againſt the whole ſtream of other Interpreters, but againſt the known &amp; Orthodox Principles of him that was wiſer then to countenance ſuch a vanity.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould ſeeme by that eminent writer of our own, that <hi>Fryer Bacon</hi> was of the ſame mind too, for whoſe words theſe are quoted amongſt many others, out of an <hi>Oxford</hi>-Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript; <hi>Deus reſpectu animae eſt ſicut Sol reſpectu Oculi Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp; Angeli ſicut ſtellae.</hi> Now what angels they were that this <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> fixt his eye upon, whether they were not fallen Stars, let others examine.

                     <p>But this you may perceive in him and the reſt of the great Pleaders for an <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> that they found all their Arguments in a pretty ſimilitude of an eye, and light, and colours, as if this were ſome inconquerable Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50910:47"/>
Whereas that great Maſter of ſubtleties, whom I have more then once nam'd before, has made it appear, that the whole Notion of an <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> is a meere fancy and ſuperfluity.</p>
                     <p>Yet this may be granted to all the foremention'd Authors, and this is the only ſpark of Truth, that lies almoſt buried in that heap of Errours; That God himſelf as he does ſupply every being, the Motion of every Creature with an intimate and immediate concourſe every way anſwerable to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree of its Entity; ſo he does in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner conſtantly aſſiſt the Underſtanding with a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Co-operation. But then as for any ſuch Irradiations upon the ſoul in which that ſhall be meerly patient: God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if he be pleas'd to reveal himſelf in a ſpecial and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, he may thus ſhine out upon it, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by his own light, or elſe drop Angelical influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon it: but that this ſhould be the natural and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way, neceſſarily required to Intellectual workings, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termely prejudicial to ſuch a noble Being as the ſoul of Man is; to which God gave ſuch bright participations of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſtampt his Image upon it, and left it to its own workings, as much as any other created being whatſoever. Nay, as <hi>Scaliger</hi> does moſt confidently object it to <hi>Cardan,</hi> you will not have one Argument left, by which you can e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Immortality of the ſoul, if ye ſhall reſoive all the excellency of its being and operations into an <hi>Intellectus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens</hi> really diſtinct from it.</p>

And though ſome tell us that they have too much droſſe &amp; impurity, that they are too muddy and feculent, not proportionable to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a reaſonable ſoul, yet let them but think of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtrainers they have gone through: thoſe double refinings and clarifyings, that they have had from ſo many percolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and withall they may know that the underſtanding can drink in the moſt pure and flowring part of the <hi>Species,</hi> and can leave the dregges at the bottome.

                     <p>But the famous <hi>Salmaſius</hi> in his late Tractate <hi>De Coma</hi> goes a far different way; and tells us that he had rather ſearch for Natures Law in a naked Indian, then in a ſpruce Athenian, in a rude American, rather then in a gallant Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; in a meer Pagan, rather then in a Jew or Chriſtian.

                     <p>Thoſe Nations that have more of Art and emprovement amongſt them, have ſo painted Natures face, have hung ſo many Jewels in her eare; have put ſo many Bracelets upon her hand; they have cloth'd her in ſuch ſoft and ſilken ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that you cannot gueſſe at her ſo well, as you might have done, if ſhe had nothing but her own ſimple and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected beauty: you cannot taſte the Wine ſo well, becauſe they have put Sugar into it, and have brib'd your palate.</p>
                     <p>So that the learned <hi>Salmaſius</hi> will ſcarce go about to fetch the Law of Nature from the Jews principally; you ſee he chooſes to fetch it rather from a Scythian, from a Barbarian; there he ſhall ſee it without any gloſſes, without any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructures, without any carving and gilding, a <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>But let us ſuppoſe that they dealt thus with their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet can it be ſhewn us that they eſtabliſht Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phagy by a Law? that their Natural Conſcience did not check them for it? or if their reaſon did connive at them; yet how comes it to paſſe that their Angel did not jog them all this while, that their <hi>Intellectus Agens</hi> did not reſtraine them?</p>
                     <p>But out of what Antiquity doth it appear that any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did favour Atheiſme by a Law? that any Kingdome did licence Blaſphemy by a ſtatute, or countenance Murder by a Law?

                     <p>Till all this can appear, let the Teſtimonies of Gentiles be eſteem'd ſomewhat more then the barking of dogs. Me thinks if they were meere Cyphers, yet the Jews going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, they might amount to ſomewhat.

Their darkneſſe and miſery is great enough, let not us aggravate it, and make it more.

Surely there's none can think that light is primitively and original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Candle; but they muſt look upon that only as a weak participation of ſomething that is more bright and glorious.

That learned Knight, in his diſcourſe concerning the ſoul, doth at large ſhew the manner how the minde thus goes a gathering of knowledge; How like a Bee it goes from flower to flower, from one entity to another, how it ſucks the pureſt and ſweeteſt of all, how it refuſes all that is diſtaſteful to it, and makes a pleaſant compoſition of the reſt, and thus prepares honey-combs for it ſelf to feed on.</p>
                     <p>But if it were at all to be granted that the ſoul had many ſtamps and characters upon it; that it had any implanted and ingraffed <hi>Species;</hi> 'twere chiefly to be granted that it hath the connate notion of a Deity, that pure and infinitely refined entity, abſtracted from all appearance of matter.

ſuch a truth upon the ſoul; ſo that no other innate light, but only the power and principle of knowing and reaſoning is <hi>the Candle of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet there is a noble Author of our own, that hath both his <hi>truth</hi> and his <hi>errour,</hi> (as he hath alſo writ about both) who pleads much for his <hi>inſtinctus naturales,</hi> ſo as that at the firſt daſh you would think him a Platonical ſtrain; but if you attend more to what he ſayes, you will ſoon perceive that he proſecutes a farre different notion much to be preferred before the other phanſy.</p>
                     <p>For he doth not make theſe inſtincts any connate <hi>Idea's</hi> and repreſentations of things, but tels us that they are pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties of the ſoul, the firſt-born faculties and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſouls ſtrength, that are preſently eſpouſed to their Virgin-objects cloſing and complying with them, long before diſcourſe can reach them; nay, with ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as diſcourſe cannot reach at all in ſuch a meaſure and perfection: theſe inſtincts he ſtyles <hi>Naturae dotes, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntiae Divinae univerſalis idea, &amp; typus optimus.</hi> Some of theſe are to be found in the loweſt inanimate beings, which yet have no connate <hi>Species</hi> among them; though they have powers and propenſion to their own welfare, a blinde tendency and inclination to their own ſecurity; for thus he ſpeaks—<hi>Inſtinctus ille Naturalis in quovis inarticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lato licèt &amp; incauto elemento, ſapiens eſt ad conſervationem propriam;</hi> and ſuch a noble being as man is, muſt needs have it in a more ſublime and eminent manner.</p>
                     <p>Therefore he tearms theſe inſtincts in man <hi>facultates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ëticae, &amp; facultates Deo analogae;</hi> whereas thoſe other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour faculties are eſteem'd <hi>facultates analogae mundo;</hi> his words being ſomewhat cloudy, I ſhall thus paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The ſoul 'tis made with a through light, with a double window, at one window it looks upon corporeals, at the other it hath a fair proſpect upon ſpirituals. When it takes notice of the material world, it looks out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow

of ſenſe, and views the <hi>putamina &amp; cortices rerum,</hi> theoutward husks and ſhells of being, but not at all pleas'd or contented with them, thoſe higher powers, thoſe purer faculties of the ſoul unclaſp and diſcloſe themſelves, and extend themſelves for receiving ſome delight more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſatisfactory, being made in as harmonious propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuitable to ſpiritual objects, as the eye is to colours, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the care to ſounds. And as you know, a corporeal eye is ſo faſhioned and organiz'd, that though it have no connate <hi>Species</hi> of the Sunne, yet tis pleaſant to behold it; ſo the eye of the ſoul doth willingly open it ſelf to look upon God <hi>per modum objecti,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If you ask when theſe higheſt faculties did firſt open and diſplay themſelves, he tells you 'tis then when they were ſtimulated and excited by outward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and it may be upon this account, that when the ſoul can finde nothing there worthy one glance, one caſt of its eye, impatient of ſuch empty and ſhadowy ſights, it opens it ſelf to the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and warmes it ſelf in thoſe everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sun-beams<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when it comes down from the mount, it puts on the veile of ſenſe, and ſo converſes with materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al objects.</p>
                     <p>Yet I do not here poſitively lay down this for a truth in all the branches of it, but only repreſent the minde of the forementioned Author, who himſelf doth acknowledge that the riſe of theſe firſt principles is very Cryptical and myſterious. His words are theſe. <hi>Vos interea non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>morari debet quèd quomodo eliciantur iſtae notitiae communes neſcia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50910:56"/>
Satis ſupérque diximus vos neſcire quomodo fiat guſtus, odoratus, tactus,</hi> &amp;c. By which you cannot but perceive that he makes the conformity of ſuch a faculty with ſuch an object, the ſpring and original of common notions. Yet this then had deſerved a little clearing, whence the difficulty of underſtanding ſpirituals <hi>pro hoc ſtatu</hi> does ariſe, if there be ſuch a preſent, and exact analogy between them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the intuitive knowledge of God, and viewing thoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notions that are ſteept in his eſſence uſes to be reſerved as a priviledge of a glorified creature. Yet this I ſuppoſe may be ſaid that herein is the ſouls imperfection, that it cannot ſufficiently attend both to ſpirituals and corporeals; and therefore ſenſe being ſo buſie and importunate for the proſecution of her objects; no wonder that theſe noënti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal faculties do faint and languiſh. So that if there be any whom the former diſcourſive way will not ſuffice, it ſeems better for them to have recourſe to an innate power of the ſoul that is fitted and faſhioned for the receiving of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals, <hi>quatenus</hi> ſpirituals, then to flie to I know not what connate <hi>Species,</hi> of I know not how long duration before the ſoul was acquainted with the body. Yet that other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Author of our own, that has the ſame title of truth not without a competent mixture of error too, doth chooſe to reſolve all into a Platonical remembrance, which yet that acute anſwerer of him doth ſhew to be a meer vanity; for as for matters of fact, to be ſure they have no implanted Idea's: And if hiſtorical knowledge may be acquired with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, why then ſhould diſcurſive knowledge have ſuch a dependence upon them? And I wiſh that the Platoniſts would but once determine whether a blinde man be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge of colours by vertue of his connate <hi>Species,</hi> and whether by ſupply of theſe Idea's deaf man may have the true notion of muſick and harmony? if not, then they muſt ingeniouſly confeſſe, that the ſoul for the preſent wants ſo much of light as it wants of the window of ſenſe.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50910:57"/>
But if they tell us that ſome outward objects muſt jogge and waken theſe drowſie and ſlumbring notions, they then lay the foundation in ſenſitives; and withal let them ſhew us, why the generality of men in their intellectuals are not equally improved, whereas they have the ſame objects to quicken and enflame them? in the mean time we will look upon the underſtanding as <hi>ſpeculum non coloratum,</hi> a glaſſe not prejudic'd nor prepoſſeſt with any connate tinctures, but nakedly receiving, and faithfully returning all ſuch co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours as fall upon it. Yet the Platoniſts in this were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, that they lookt upon the ſpirit of a man as <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> though they were deceived in the time when 'twas lighted.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this Candle lighted out of the Eſſence of God himſelf, 'twere a farre more tolerable errour to make the light of a Candle a piece of the Sun's eſſence then to think that this intellectual lamp is a particle of the divine nature: There is but one <gap reason="foreign">

But I finde the Stoicks challeng'd for this errour, that they thought there was a real emanation, and traduction of the ſoul out of God. <hi>Ex ipſa Dei ſubſtantia,</hi> and the Gnoſticks, the Maniche's and Priſcillianiſts are lookt upon as their ſucceſſors in this folly.</p>
                     <p>Now as for the Stoicks you'll ſcarce finde evidence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to prove them guilty of this opinion. They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſome doting and venturing expreſſions, when they amplifie and dignifie the nobility of the ſoul; and will needs have ſome of the royal blood to run in every veine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of it, nor are the Platoniſts defective in this, but lift up the ſoul to as high a pitch of perfection as the Stoicks ever did; yet ſurely both of them but as a limited and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant being infinitely remote from the fulneſſe of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.

                        </gap>, The ſoul, ſaies he, was not framed and carv'd out of the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50910:59"/>
of a Deity, but it rather ſprung from the dilatation, and diffuſion of his power and goodneſſe, as beams do from the Sun, when it ſpreads forth its quickening and cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wings. Yet when you hear the creatures often ſtiled beams of a Deity, and drops of a Deity, you muſt neither imagine that there is the leaſt diviſion, or diminution, or variation in the moſt immutable eſſence of God; nor that the creature does partake the very eſſence of the Creatour, but that it hath ſomewhat of his workmanſhip, obvious and viſible in it, and according to the degree of its being, doth give fainter or brighter reſemblances of its Creatour. As ſuppoſe an accurate Painter ſhould beſtow much of his skill in drawing a lively portraicture of himſelf, you would not think ſuch a picture a piece of his eſſence, but you would look upon it only as the fruit and product of his skil, and as a witty imitation of himſelf. Now there is a far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er diſproportion between God and any created being, then between the face and the picture of it: So that if you ſee any heavenly beauty, any divine lineaments ſparkling in the ſoul, you may preſently conclude that it was <hi>digitus Dei,</hi> nay the hand of God that drew them there, as the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowy repreſentations of his own moſt glorious being. 'Tis the greateſt honour that a creature is capable of, to be the picture of its Creatour. You know the very formality of creation doth ſpeak a being raiſed <hi>ex nihilo;</hi> creation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the production of ſomthing out of the barren womb of nothing; and if the creature muſt be <hi>ex nullo praeexiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> then to be ſure 'tis not extracted out of the eſſence of God himſelf. But the whole generality of the ancient Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers had a vaile upon their face, here they had not a clear and open ſight of the creation, but only ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and imperfect notions about it, which made them think that all corporeals were made <hi>ex aliqua praejacente ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi> coexiſtent with the prime and ſupreme efficient; and becauſe they could not fetch ſpirituals out of materials, nor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50910:60"/>
yet conceive that they ſhould be fetcht out of nothing, this made them determine that they ſprung out of the eſſence of God himſelf, who as a voluntary fountain could bubble them forth when he pleaſed, who as a father of lights could ſparkle and kindle them when he thought beſt. But that fiction of <hi>materia ab aeterno</hi> will do them no ſervice at all; for either 'twas produced by God himſelf, &amp; then it was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>ex nihilo,</hi> for God himſelf was a pure immaterial Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and therefore muſt make matter where none was before; or elſe it was an Independent eternal being, which makes it another Deity, and that involves a flat repugnancy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as corporeal and material beings were raiſed out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by the infinite vigour and power of God himſelf, ſo he can with the very ſame facility produce ſpiritual beings out of nothing too. Can he not as well light this Lamp out of nothing, as build the goodly fabrick of the world out of nothing? Cannot a creating breath make a ſoul as well as a creating word make a world? He that can create the ſhell of corporeals, cannot he as well create the kernel of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als? He that created a viſible Sun, cannot he as well create an inviſible, an intellectual ſpark? You may hear <hi>Aquinas</hi> diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Gentiles, &amp; moſt fully and ſtrongly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating, that God could not be either the <hi>materia</hi> or <hi>forma</hi> of any created being, for its not imaginable how the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf ſhould <hi>ingredi eſſentiam creaturae.</hi> But his cauſality is by way of efficiency producing &amp; maintaining beings; the beſt of creatures are but <hi>vaſa figuli.</hi> Now a veſſel, though a veſſel of honour, yet it is no piece of the Potters eſſence, but only the ſubject of his power and will. One and the ſame Seal may print all the Wax that's poſſible, yet there will not be the leaſt mutation in the Seal, but only in the Wax; nor yet doth the Wax at all participate of the ſeals eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but only receives a ſtamp and ſignature made upon it. So that the Seal was as entire and compleat before it had imprinted the Wax, as it was afterwards; and though all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50910:60"/>
the ſignatures of the Wax were defaced and obliterated, yet the Seal would be as perfect as before.</p>
                     <p>Thus God, though he leaves prints of himſelf upon all the ſouls in the world, nay upon all the beings in the world, yet theſe impreſſions are not particles of himſelf; nor do they make the leaſt mutation in him, only in the creature; for he was as full and perfect before he had printed any one creature, and if the whole impreſſion of creatures were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, yet his eſſence were the ſame, and he could print more when he pleaſed, and as many as he pleaſed. Yet all the entity, goodneſſe, and reality, that is to be found in the creature, was totally derived from him, and is tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſured up in him, as the print of the wax, though it be really different from the print of the Seal, yet that very ſtamp and ſignature had its being from the Seal, 'twas ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and originally in the Seal; and now gives ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of it. All created goodneſſe was <hi>à Deo producta, &amp; à Deo exemplata,</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak) though not very elegantly. 'Tis <hi>à Deo conſervata, &amp; in Deum ordinata,</hi> yet all this while 'twas nothing of the eſſence of a Deity; and indeed it cannot have any of his eſſence, unleſſe it have all of it. He that calls the creature a drop in ſuch a ſenſe, may as well call it a fountain; he that thus termes it a ray of Divinity, may as well call it a Sun, for there are no particles in eſſentials. All eſſence 'tis indiviſible, how much more the eſſence of God himſelf. How fond is the fancy of a ſemi-Deity, away with the Stoicks <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Dares therefore any abſolutely deifie the ſoul? or make it coëſſential or coëqual with God himſelf? Is not the ſoul a limited and reſtrained being? ſhort and imperfect in its operations, a dependent and precarious being; and are theſe things agreeable to a Deity? Is not the ſoul natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united to the body for the quickening and enforming of it? and is that a condition fit for a Deity? nay, are not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50910:61"/>
many ſouls guilty, defiled, miſerable beings? and are they all this while ſpangles of a Deity? They muſt have very low and diſhonourable thoughts of God that make any creature partner or ſharer with him in his eſſence, and they muſt have high and ſwelling thoughts of the creature. How proud is that ſoul that aſpires to be a God? Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a ſoul to approach unto his God, to ſee his face, to enjoy his preſence, to be like unto him, to be knit unto him, in love and affection? Happineſſe doth advance a creature to his juſt perfection, but it doth not lift it above the ſphere of its being. A glorified being, is ſtill a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient and finite being. A ſoul when in its full brightneſſe, yet ſtill is but <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> let it come as neer as it can, yet it will be infinitely diſtant from him. Heaven it doth not mix and blend eſſences together, but keeps them all in their juſt beauty and proportions; ſo that take a creature in what condition you will, and 'tis not the leaſt particle of a Deity. There's another Errour, but it's ſcarce worth mentioning, of ſome that would have <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> lighted up by Angels, as if they had created the ſoul; Nay, the Carpocratians thought that all the reſt of the world was created by them. But as no ſecondary being could create it ſelf, ſo neither can it create any other being. 'Twas no Angelical breath, but the breath of a Deity that gave life to the ſoul, and 'twas not made after the image of an Angel, but of God himſelf. Angels and ſouls both came from the ſame Almighty Father of ſpirits, from the ſame glorious Father of lights, who ſhewed the greatneſſe of his power in raiſing ſuch goodly beings, not out of himſelf, but out of nothing.</p>

His ſoul that plaid him ſome leſſons, and his body danc'd to them. And indeed ſome of the Phyſicians are as loath as he was <hi>ab arte ſua diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere,</hi> and therefore they do embody the ſoul as much as they can, that their skill may extend to the happineſſe and welfare of it, as if they could feel the pulſe of the ſoul, and try experiments upon the ſpirits; as if they could ſoften and compoſe the Paroxyſme of the minde, and cure all the Languors and diſtempers of the ſoul; as if their drugs would work upon immaterial beings; as if they could kill ſouls as faſt as they can kill bodies: as if <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> did depend upon theſe Prolongers; as though the Lamp would go out, unleſſe they pour in ſome of their oile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. No doubt but there is a mutual communion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe between this friendly and eſpowſed paire, the ſoul and body; no doubt but there is a loving ſympathy and fellow-feeling of one anothers conditions; but 'tis not ſo ſtrong and powerful, as that they muſt both live and die together. Yet I ſpeak not this as though the maintaining of the ſouls traduction did neceſſarily prejudice the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of it; for I know there are many learned Doctors amongſt them (and <hi>Seneca</hi> amongſt the reſt) that are for the ſouls beginning in a way of generation, and yet do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and abominate the leaſt thoughts of its corruption. Nay, ſome ſacred writers contend for the ſouls traduction,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50910:62"/>
who yet never queſtioned the perpetuity of it: not only the African father <hi>Tertullian,</hi> but moſt of the Weſtern Churches alſo; and the opinion of <hi>Apollinaris</hi> and <hi>Neme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> that one ſpiritual being might propagate another; I have not yet found ſufficiently diſprov'd, though it be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally reprehended. The truth is, the original of all formes, 'tis <hi>in profundo,</hi> 'tis very latent and myſterious; yet the Naturaliſts muſt needs acknowledge thus much, that the matter and forme of every thing muſt have at leaſt an incompleat being before generation; for by that they do not receive any new abſolute entity, for then it would be a creation, but the parts are only collected, and diſpoſed, and united by a ſtrict &amp; Gordian knot, by an inward continuity. So that in all ſuch production the <hi>materia oritur ex materia, &amp; forma ex forma generantis,</hi> and thus formes are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued according to that degree of being, which they had in the firſt Creation. Now why there ſhould not be ſuch a <hi>traditio Lampadis</hi> in the ſouls of men, will not eaſily be ſhewn; the nobility and purity of the ſoul doth not at all hinder this, for there is a proportionable eminency in the ſoul, that doth produce it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One ſoul prints another with the ſame ſtamp of immortality, that it ſelf had engraven upon it. But if any queſtion how an immaterial being can be conveighed in ſuch a ſeminal way, let him but ſhew us the manner by which 'tis united to the body, and we will as eaſily tell him how it entered into it. Yet <hi>Hierome</hi> was ſo zealous againſt this, that he pronounceth a preſent <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> to all ſuch as ſhall hold the ſoul to be <hi>ex traduce.</hi> But <hi>Auſtin</hi> was a great deale more calme and pacate; Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was in this point <gap reason="foreign">

He could not perceive how the Candle ſhould be ſo ſoyld, if it were lighted only by a pure Sun-beame fetcht from heaven. Yet that knot (which ſo skilful and laborious a hand could not unty) ſome others have eaſily cut aſunder; and indeed there is no ſuch cogency, and prevalency in that argument as can juſtly promiſe it ſelf the victory. For the Schoolmen that are ſtrong aſſertors of the ſouls creation, do ſatisfie all ſuch doubts as theſe. And the major part of modern writers do encline to this, that theſe Lamps are lighted by God himſelf, though ſome indeed do <gap reason="foreign">

its own light and beams, and could by vertue of them look upon all other things, which its own light does unveil, and diſcover, 'twould then give ſome languiſhing adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of a Deity, who is alwayes looking upon his own perfections, and ſeeing creatures by his own light, by his own uncreated beams. For <hi>Species &amp; ſimilitudo omnium eſt in Dei eſſentia.</hi> Thus God looking upon his own omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, knows all poſſibilities; viewing his own determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he ſees all futurities; looking upon his own wiſdome he beholds all varieties, all degrees and differencies of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which yet put not the leaſt ſhadow of difference in him, becauſe the excellencies of all beings are treaſured up in him only by way of tranſcendency, not <hi>per modum compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitionis, ſed per modum perfectionis</hi> (as the Schools have it.) So that when God beholds all created beings by vertue of his own eſſence, yet you muſt not imagine that the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a creature is conteined in an uncreated being, but only that there is enough of being there to give a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of all being whatſoever. As when a glaſſe reflects a face, there's not the leaſt mutation in the glaſſe, much leſſe is the face any part of the glaſſes eſſence; though the glaſſe give a ſufficient reſemblance of it. Yet herein there's this diſparity, that the glaſſe of Gods eſſence did repreſent a creature, before any created face could look into it; for God looking upon himſelf from eternity, did then know <hi>quot moàis aliquid aſſimilari potuit ipſius eſſentiae,</hi> and did know how farre ſuch a being would imitate his eſſence, and how farre it would fall ſhort of it. He ſaw that this being would come neerer, that that being would be more diſtant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from him; this picture would be liker him, that would ſhew very little of him. Now the actuality and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of ſuch an object is not requiſite to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, for how then could we conceive of the privation of a not Entity? How can we otherwiſe apprehend them, then by framing the notion of ſomething poſitive in our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50910:67"/>
mindes, and ſuppoſing a total deficiency from it? Thus as they uſe to ſpeak, <hi>Rectum eſt index ſui &amp; obliqui; &amp; nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimum in unoquoque genere eſt menſura, &amp; exemplar reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quorum,</hi> that firſt and ſupreme being by the great example and patern of himſelf, can judge of all inferiour and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect beings. Nor could he ſee them <hi>ab aeterno</hi> any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in himſelf, there being nothing elſe eternal, but himſelf, and in himſelf he could clearly ſee them as we ſee effects in their cauſe. All created beings were emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently contained in the Centre of one indiviſible eſſence, who by his infinite vertue was to produce them all, who being an intelligent Centre did ſee thoſe ſeveral lines that might be drawn from him, and withall, being a free and a voluntary Centre, did know how many lines he meant to draw from himſelf. Now you know amongſt men, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration <hi>à priori,</hi> is eſteemed moſt certain and ſcientifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, <hi>Scire eſt per cauſas cognoſcere.</hi> God thus knew crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, perfectly knowing himſelf, who was the firſt cauſe of them all; This doth much ſpeak the immutability of the eternal reaſon and wiſdome in the minde of God, and doth remove all imperfections from it: For you ſee, he did not move in an axiomatical way, <hi>per compoſitionem &amp; diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem;</hi> for he ſaw things by his own uncompounded and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible eſſence; much leſſe did his knowledge improve it ſelf in a ſyllogiſtical way, deducing and collecting one thing out of another: This is the Schoolmens meaning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they tell us <hi>cognitio Dei non eſt ratiocinativa,</hi> that is, <hi>non eſt diſcurſiva.</hi> They that will light a candle may ſtrike ſuch ſparks, but the Sunne and Starres want no ſuch light. Angels are above Syllogiſmes, how much more is God himſelf? Nay, even amongſt men, firſt principles are above diſputings, above demonſtrations; now all things are more naked in reſpect of God himſelf, then common notions are to the ſight of men. 'Tis a <hi>motus teſtudineus,</hi> a tardy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tedious work, a fetching a compaſſe, to gather one
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50910:68"/>
thing out of another; 'Tis the ſlow pace of a limited under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. But there's no ſucceſſion in God, not in the knowledge of God. There's no <hi>prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes or concluſions; no <hi>tranſitus ab uno ad aliud,</hi> no <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num medium,</hi> for he does not <hi>cognoſcere per aliud medium à ſeipſo diſtinctum,</hi> there's a compleat ſimultaneity in all his knowledge, his eſſence is altogether, and ſo is his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; plurality of objects will confound a finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for they muſt be preſented by different <hi>Species,</hi> and a created eye cannot exactly view ſuch different faces at once, ſuch ſeveral pictures at once. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſometimes loſes it ſelf in a croud of objects; and when ſuch a multitude comes thronging upon it, it can ſcarce attend to any of them. But God ſeeing them all <hi>per unicam ſpeciem, per unicam operationem,</hi> takes notice of them all with an infinite delight and facility. For he loves to attend to his own eſſence, which doth ſo admirably repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them all; hence his knowledge is alwayes in act, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his eſſence is a pure act; Humane underſtandings have much of their knowledge ſtor'd up in habits, but there are no habits in a Deity, for knowledge is dormant in a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, but his underſtanding never ſlumbers nor ſleeps: There's no potentiality in him, but he's alwayes <hi>in ultima perfectione,</hi> he is <hi>ſemper in actu intelligendi,</hi> as <hi>Sol</hi> is <hi>ſemper in actu lucendi.</hi> Humane underſtandings are faine to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend themſelves ſometimes, as if they were faint and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but Divinity is alwayes vigorous, and Eternity can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver languiſh. The underſtanding of God thus being fill'd with light, his Will alſo muſt needs be rational, <hi>non caeca, ſed oculata notitia.</hi> This makes the Schoolmen very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that though there cannot be <hi>cauſa divinae volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis;</hi> yet there may be aſſign'd <hi>ratio divinae voluntatis.</hi> There can be no cauſe of his Will, for then there would be a cauſe of his Eſſence, his Will being all one with his Eſſence; but there cannot be <hi>cauſa prior primâ.</hi> Yet
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50910:68"/>
this account may be given of his Will, that <hi>bonum intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum eſt fundamentum voliti,</hi> ſo that as God does primarily <hi>intelligere ſeipſum,</hi> ſo he does underſtand other things, only <hi>per ſeipſum,</hi> ſo likewiſe he does principally and neceſſarily <hi>velle ſeipſum,</hi> and does will other things ſecondarily, and out of choice, <hi>propter ſeipſum.</hi> And as God hath ſet all other beings a longing after the perfections and conſervations of their own beings, and has in a ſpecial manner ſtampt upon a rational nature an intellectual appetite of its own well-fare and happineſſe, ſo as that it cannot but propound an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate ſcope and end to it ſelf, and bend and direct all its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for the hitting and attaining of it; ſo he himſelf alſo ſets up himſelf, as the moſt adequate and amiable end of all his workings and motions, and does bend the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does ſhoot every being, and order it to his own glory. Now how rational is that Will of his that does chiefly fix it ſelf upon the faireſt good, and wills other things only as they are ſubſervient to it, <hi>Deus vult bonitatem ſuam tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam finem, &amp; vult omnia alia tanquam media ad finem.</hi> Out of the intenſe and vehement willing of himſelf, he wills alſo ſome prints and reſemblances of himſelf. The beauty of his own face, of his own goodneſſe is ſo great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that he loves the very picture of it; And becauſe one picture cannot ſufficiently expreſſe it, therefore he gives ſuch various and numerous repreſentations of it. As when men cannot expreſſe their minde in one word, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to rhetoricate and inlarge themſelves into more. God doth give many ſimilitudes of himſelf, for the greater expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his own eſſence. His eſſence in it ſelf not being capable of augmentation or multiplications, he loves to ſee ſome imitations and manifeſtations of it, to make known his own power &amp; perfection in a way of cauſality. Now the underſtanding of God being ſo vaſt and infinite, and his will being ſo commenſurate and proportion'd to it, nay all one with it; all thoſe Decrees of his that are the Eternal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50910:69"/>
and reſults of his minde and will, muſt needs be ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal alſo; For in them his underſtanding and will met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his truth and goodneſſe kiſſed each other. And though theſe Decrees of God muſt be reſolved into his abſolute ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and dominion, yet that very ſovereignty of his is founded upon ſo much reaſon, and does act ſo wiſely and intelligently, as that no created underſtanding can juſtly queſtion it, but is bound obediently to adore it. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and application of theſe Decrees, 'tis accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the very ſame wiſdome and reaſon; for what's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence but <hi>oculus in ſceptro,</hi> a rational guiding and ruling all affairs in the world, 'tis <hi>ipſa ratio divina in ſummo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe conſtituta;</hi> 'tis <hi>ratio ordinandorum in finem,</hi> that which in man is called prudence, in God is called Providence; the right tuning and regulating of all circumſtances, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to conſpire &amp; contribute to his own end &amp; glory. And if man could but rightly interpret and comment upon Providence, what freſh diſcoveries, what bright diſplayings of divine reaſon would they all continually meet withall? what ſhinings and ſparklings of divine wiſdome are there in ſome remarkable providential paſſages? You that are moſt acquainted with the wayes of God; tell us if you did ever finde any thing unreaſonable in them. Enquire ſtill more into his dealings, and you'll ſee more of reaſon in them. Could you ſearch deeper into the rich mine of his counſel, you would ſtill meet with more precious veines of wiſdome. The depths of his counſels, what are they but the very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſſe of his reaſon? <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap>. And whenſoever this ſecret counſel of his iſſues out and bubles forth, it is in moſt rational manifeſtations. His commands are all rational, his word is the very pith and marrow of reaſon. His Law is the quickening and waken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of mens reaſon; his Goſpel, 'tis the flowing out of his own reaſon; 'tis the quinteſſence of wiſdome from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove; His ſpirit is a rational agent; the motions of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50910:69"/>
holy Ghoſt are rational breath; the revelations of the holy Ghoſt, a rational light, as rational as a demonſtration: the Apoſtle calls them ſo. As when the Spirit of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the will, it makes a willingneſſe there, where there was an abſolute nolency, an obſtinate refuſal before. So when it over-powers the minde, it makes it underſtand that which it did not, which it could not underſtand before. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual irradiations ſtamp new light, create new reaſon in the ſoul; Nothing comes to man with the ſuperſcription of a Deity, but that which hath upon it ſome ſignature of wiſdome. God himſelf is an intelligent worker in his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all beings, how much rather in his dealing with rational beings? By all this you ſee that God himſelf is the Eternal ſpring and head of reaſon. And that humane wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is but a created and an imperfect copy of his moſt perfect and original wiſdome.</p>
                     <p>Now Philoſophy could dictate thus much, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. God loves to ſee ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creature as man is, to follow and imitate him in his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <hi>Omnia intendunt aſſimilari Deo,</hi> as the Schoolmen have it. Now men cannot be more aſſimilated unto God, then by moving as intelligent agents. Does God himſelf work according to reaſon from eternity to eternity? And has he made a creature in time, whoſe very eſſence is reaſon? Why then does it not open its eyes? why does it not uſe its lamp? and though it cannot diſcover all, yet let it diſcern as much as it can. Let it not act in the choiceſt points of religion, out of blinde and implicit principles, and huddle up its chiefeſt operations in I know not what confuſed and obſcure and undigeſted manner. This neither becomes ſons of light, nor works of light. The more men exerciſe reaſon, the more they reſemble God himſelf, who has but few crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that can repreſent him in ſo bright an excellency as this; only Angels and men; and therefore he expects it
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50910:70"/>
the more from them. And the more they exerciſe their own reaſon, the more they will admire and adore his; For none can admire reaſon but they that uſe ſome reaſon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

This Candle of the Lord when it was firſt lighted up, before there was any thief in it, even then it had but a limited and reſtrained light. God ſaid unto it, Thus farre ſhall thy Light go. Hither ſhalt thou ſhine, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency was not to crown himſelf with his own ſparks. God never intended that a creature ſhould reſt ſatisfied with its own candle-light, but that it ſhould run to the fountain of light, and ſunne it ſelf in the preſence of its God. What a poor happineſſe had it been for a man, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have enjoyed his own Lamp? Could this ever have been a beatifical viſion? Could this light ever have made a heaven fit for a ſoul to dwell in? The ſparkling Seraphims and glittering Cherubims (if it were poſſible that the face of God ſhould be eclipſed from them, that they ſhould have no light, but that which ſhines from their own eſſences) Blackneſſe, and darkneſſe, and gloomineſſe, a totall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Eclipſe, a preſent and perpetual night would ruſh in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

them, if the heaven were fuller of Stars then it is, and if this lower part of the world were adorned and illuminated with as many Lamps as 'tis capable of, yet would they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to ſupply the abſence of one Sun. Their united light would not amount to ſo much as to make up one day, or one moment of a day. Let Angels and men contribute as much light as they can, let them knit and concentricate their beams; yet neither Angelical Star-light, nor the ſons of men with their Lamps and Torches could ever make up the leaſt ſhadow of glory, the leaſt appearance of heaven: the leaſt fringe of happineſſe. Lucifer that needs would be an Independent light that would ſhine with his own beams, you know that he preſently ſunk and fell into perpetual darkneſſe. And <hi>Adams</hi> Candle aſpiring to be a Sun, has burnt the dimmer ever ſince. God taking notice of it, and ſpying him in the duſt; Lo (ſaies he) here lies the ſpark, that would needs become a God.

When God firſt tun'd
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50910:71"/>
the whole creation, every ſtring, every creature praiſed him; but man was the ſweeteſt and loudeſt of the reſt, ſo that when that ſtring apoſtatized, and fell from its firſt tuning, it ſet the whole creation a jarring. When God firſt planted the ſoul of man, it was the garden of God himſelf, his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Eden,</hi> he lov'd to walk in it; 'twas full of the faireſt and choiceſt flowers, of the moſt precious and delicious fruits; 'twas water'd with all the freſh ſprings of heavenly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: No weeds, nor briers, nor thornes to be found there.

The Sun 'tis ready to put out this <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> if it make too neer approaches to it. Humane underſtandings are glad to wink at ſome dazling objects, as <hi>vehemens ſenſibile</hi> doth <hi>deſtruere ſenſum:</hi> ſo <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemens intelligibile</hi> doth <hi>perſtringere intellectum.</hi> For in all knowledge there's required a due proportion between the <hi>objectum cognoſcibile,</hi> and the <hi>virtus cognoſcitiva,</hi> but when the ſeveral powers and faculties of the ſoul loſt that comely proportion which they had amongſt themſelves, they loſt alſo much of that correſpondency and conformity which they had to their ſeveral objects. And the ſoul beſides its own loſſe, had a ſhare in the bodies loſſe alſo: for the body wanting much of that accurate and elegant compoſure which once it had, knowledge it ſelf muſt needs be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd by it; that being amongſt men founded in ſenſe, and in ſome meaſure depending upon organical diſpoſitions. So that the ſtreitning and ſtopping of theſe windows, muſt needs prohibit light. Sin entred in firſt at a corporeal, then at an intellectual window, and ſtole away the heart; and the windows have been broken ever ſince. I know the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Philoſophers do partly excuſe the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and do blame the objects for their exility and poverty, for their little diminutive Entity, for their want of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibility. But the ſubtil <hi>Scotus</hi> doth endeavour to invalidate, that by telling them, that <hi>omnia eâdem facilitate intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50910:74"/>
à Deo.</hi> Thus much is evident and undeniable, that the ſpying out of a little lurking object, doth argue the ſtrength, and quickneſſe, and clearneſſe of the eye. The Sun diſcovers atomes, though they be inviſible by candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, yet that makes them dance naked in his beams. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted underſtandings want ſpectacles to augment and majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſome objects. But the ſoul never meets with more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty then in the underſtanding of ſpiritual beings, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have moſt of Entity, and ſo moſt of intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. Yet the ſoul being impriſon'd in a body not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently clarified and refined, cannot ſo fully cloſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with incorporeal beings. This <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> will diſcover more of ſpirituals when 'tis took out of the Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne <hi>in ſtatu ſeparato,</hi> or when 'tis put into a clearer <hi>in ſtatu conſummato.</hi> But for the preſent how little doth it know of it ſelf? How little of Angels? How little of God? And yet how much might be known of them? Look but a while, (if you can endure to look) upon ſo unlovely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant an object, I mean upon thoſe black and prodigious Errors, that cover and beſpot the face of theſe times. And they'll ſoon convince you of the weakneſſe and dimneſſe of this Lamp-light of the ſpirit of a man. <hi>The Candle of the Lord,</hi> though it be amongſt them, yet 'tis not ſo powerful as to ſcatter and conquer their thick and palpable darkneſs. 'Tis not an eaſie, nor a ſudden, nor a delightful work to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſo many errors, yet if I could reckon them up all, from the <hi>blundering Antinomian,</hi> to the <hi>vagabond Seeker,</hi> or the <hi>wild Seraphick,</hi> ſet on fire of hell, they would all ſerve for ſo many fatal examples of the miſerable weaknes of mens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. 'Tis true, they do not follow <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> for then reaſon would have guided them better. But this very conſideration ſhewes the weakneſſe of their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light, for if it had been a brighter 'twould not have been ſo ſoon put out. 'Tis eaſie to blow out a candle, but who can put out a Starre? or who can extinguiſh the Sun? And
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50910:74"/>
men can ſhut up natural light, but who can impriſon a Star? or who can ſhut up the Sun? This faint and languiſhing candle-light does not alwayes prevaile upon the will, it doth not ſufficiently warme and inflame the affections. Men do not uſe to warme their hands at a candle, 'tis not ſo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious and over-powerings as to ſcatter all the works of darkneſſe. It will be night for all the candle; the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts were not only frigid in their devotions, but ſome of them were very diſſolute in their practiſes. When you think upon theſe things, ſure you'll willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the forementioned particular, which you may do very ſafely, that the ſpirit of a man 'tis but a Candle. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men exile &amp; diminutum.</hi>

and uninterrupted irradiations, doth paraphraſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon all objects, ſo as to uncloud and reveale the moſt obſcure contingency, and to make it preſent, and naked, and viſible. For as the Schoolmen tell us, <hi>Scientia Dei ad om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia preſentialiter ſe habet,</hi> His knowledge being all one with his eſſence, without the leaſt ſhadow of change. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that which with men is a futurity and contingency, with him is alwayes preſent and extant; which ſpeaks for the certainty and infallibility of his preſcience, though it be converſant about ſuch things, as ſeeme to us moſt caſual and fortuitous. For even we our ſelves know theſe things certainly, when they are in act, and in being, becauſe that then they loſe their volubility and contingency, and put on reality and neceſſity: according to that unqueſtionable rule, <hi>Omne quod eſt quando eſt neceſſe eſt eſſe,</hi> a contingency when 'tis <hi>extra ſuas cauſas,</hi> when 'tis actualy produc'd having a <hi>determinatum eſſe,</hi> it may then alſo have a determinate cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcibility. Now God always thus ſees a contingency <hi>in ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino, in eventu, in periodo;</hi> whereas created underſtandings look upon it, <hi>in medio, in motu, in itinere.</hi> Nay ſuch is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty &amp; imperfection of mans knowledge, that many things which are in their own nature neceſſary and demonſtrable; yet perhaps they know them, <hi>per modum probabilitatis &amp; per modum nceceſſitatis.</hi> But ſuch is the height &amp; tranſcendency of the Divine underſtanding, as that ſuch things as are in their own natures moſt dubious and hovering between <hi>eſſe</hi> and <hi>non eſſe;</hi> yet God knows even theſe <hi>per modum infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem,</hi> and plainly perceives which way they will encline, when men ſee only an equipoiſe and neutrality. So that the whole riſe of contingency flows from the wavering of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes. And though <hi>ſcientia Dei</hi> be <hi>cauſa rerum;</hi> yet being but <hi>cauſa remota,</hi> it doth not take away contingency; But God himſelf ſees that ſome things will <hi>evenire contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genter:</hi> For he doth not only <hi>cognoſcere res,</hi> but <hi>ordinem &amp; modum rerum.</hi> And knows that there are ſome <hi>cauſae inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediae,

mediae,</hi> which are <hi>impedibiles</hi> and <hi>defectibiles</hi> (as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeak ſomewhat rudely) and by vertue of theſe, there ariſes a contingency. Thus in a Syllogiſme, though the <hi>major</hi> be neceſſary, yet if the <hi>minor</hi> be contingent, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion will be ſo alſo, and will <hi>ſequi deteriorem partem;</hi> though the firſt cauſe be certain, yet if there be obſtructions in the ſecond, you cannot promiſe your ſelf what the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will be. Though the ſpring of motion cannot fail, yet if the wheels may poſſibly break, the progreſſe will be very uncertain to all but to God himſelf. For other underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings only know that the wheels may break, but God he ſees whether they will break or no, ſo that which in reſpect of creatures is <hi>periculoſae plenum opus aleae,</hi> in reſpect of God is <hi>fixum</hi> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, determined and immoveable in his everlaſting thoughts. Angelical beings cannot reach to ſo high a perfection of knowledge as this is. For <hi>futurum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus futurum,</hi> is <hi>objectum improportionatum intellectui An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelico,</hi> as acute <hi>Suarez</hi> doth abundantly evince. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers finde difficulty enough in explaining the manner how God hath a certain and infallible preſcience of theſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uncertainties. And they finde it a plain impoſſibility for the Angels to have any ſuch knowledge, for they neither have <hi>aeternitatem intuitûs,</hi> which ſhould <hi>ambire in objecto ſuo omnes differentias temporis,</hi> which ſhould remove all ſucceſſion, all <hi>prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> and make a compleat ſimul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanëity, nor yet have they <hi>plenitudinem rationis repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivae,</hi> they have no ſuch boundleſſe and infinite <hi>ſpecies</hi> as the Divine eſſence is, by which God beholds all things. Angels have neither light enough of their own to manifeſt a future object, nor an eye ſtrong enough to pierce into it. They cannot infallibly foretel their own motions, becauſe God can alter them and over-power them, much leſſe can they know the determinations of God himſelf, or any ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that depend upon a free agent, till they bud and bloſſome in ſome actual diſcoveries and appearances. Nor
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50910:76"/>
are they ſo well acquainted with the whole context and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of natural agents, with all thoſe ſecret twinings and complications as to ſpy out beforehand thoſe events which are brought forth in a caſual and unuſual and very unlikely manner. Whenſoever then they have any preſcience of future contingencies, 'tis only by revelation from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. They may ſee the face of a future object <hi>in ſpeculo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vino,</hi> but yet that's <hi>ſpeculum voluntarium,</hi> and ſhews only what it pleaſeth, and when, and to whom it pleaſeth. The wicked Angels know this well enough, that they for their parts have no knowledge of future uncertainties, though they deſire to have it as much as any, and they pretend to it as much as any; yet you know how cautelous they were in their Oracular reſponſals, as that elegant Moraliſt <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> doth moſt excellently ſhew in ſeveral places. They alwayes drew a curtain before their predictions, and wrapt them up in obſcurity, which plainly argued a conſciouſneſſe of their own ignorance in reſpect of future events. The good Angels are ſo fill'd with their preſent happineſſe, they are ſo quieted with the enjoyment of God himſelf, as that they are not at all ſolicitous, or inquiſitive about future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, but they cheerfully entertain and drink in all thoſe beams that come flowing from the face of their God, and they deſire no more then he is pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to them, nay indeed they can deſire no more, for he gives them as much as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. Now if Angelical underſtandings are not ſo wide and comprehenſive as to graſpe and take in ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, what mean then the ſons of men to aſpire and reach after the knowledge of them? if thoſe tall and eminent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſtanding upon the mount of God cannot ſee them, how ſhall the ſons of men that are of a lower ſtature hid in a valley, how ſhall they behold them? Yet there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in the generality of mankinde, a prurient deſire, and hankering afterthe knowledge of future events. Men ſtill
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:50910:76"/>
ſtretch out the hand to the forbidden tree, they long for the fruit of it, and would fain be plucking ſome apples from it. Nay, men long for the greeneſt apples, for the precocious knowledge of events before they come to their juſt ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and maturity. The deſire of this ſets the Aſtrologer a lighting his candle at the Stars. O how doth he flatter himſelf in his own imaginary twincklings, and how doth he perſwade the more ſimple &amp; credulous part of the world that he can diſcover every future atome, that he can put thoſe capital Stars, thoſe golden letters together, and ſpell out all the fates of Kingdomes and perſons?

It moved the <hi>Exſpex</hi> to conſult with the inwards, to ſearch into the bowels of things; he'll but look upon a Liver, and will preſently tell you the colour and complexion of all affairs. It caus'd the <hi>Aruſpex</hi> to behold the behaviour of the dying ſacrifice, and from the quietneſſe or ſtrugling of thoſe ſenſitive creatures, to foretel the reluctancles or facilities in higher matters.

I finde that <hi>Pyrrhon</hi> the great promoter and propagator of this Sect was at firſt a Painter by his trade, and it ſeems he was very loath <hi>ab arte ſua re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere,</hi> for he looks upon every being as a picture and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, a ſhadow, a rude draught and portraicture, a meere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, that hath nothing of ſolidity or reality. Theſe pictures of his drawing enamor'd many others, for this Sect was patroniz'd by men of acuteneſſe and ſubtilty, the wits of the age, <hi>magna ingenia, ſed non ſine mixtura dementiae, mala punica, ſed non ſine grano putrido,</hi> I could name you Authors of good worth and credit, who tell you that <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Archilochus</hi> and <hi>Euripides,</hi> and the Wiſe men of <hi>Greece</hi> were all Scepticks, yet thoſe proofs which they bring to evidence and evince it, are not ſo pregnant and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying, but that you may very lawfully doubt of it, and yet be no Scepticks neither. But <hi>Francis Mirandula</hi> reckons many very learned men that were deeply engaged in this Sect, and ſome others that did very neere border upon it. <hi>Protagoras</hi> among the reſt whom <hi>Plato</hi> frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confutes, who was of this minde that all opinions were true, <hi>Sextus Empericus</hi> paſſes this cenſure upon him, that he was too poſitive and dogmatical in aſſerting theirs; but if he had only queſtion'd and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated

So that according to him ſeverall opinions were but the various diſcoveries and manifeſtations of truth. There was one <hi>verum quod ad te pertinet,</hi> and another <hi>verum quod ad illum pertinet.</hi> Honey was as truly bitter to a feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh palate, as it was ſweet and dellcious to an ordinary taſte. Snow was as truly black, in reſpect of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> as it was white in the eye and eſteem of another. Thus ſaith he, mad men, wiſe men, children, old men, men in a dream, and men awake, they are all competent Judges of theſe things that belong to their ſeveral conditions; for (as he tells us) truth varies according to ſeveral circumſtances, that's true to day, which is not true to morrow, and that's true at <hi>Rome,</hi> that's not true at <hi>Athens;</hi> that's true in this age, that's not true in the next: That's true to one man, that's not true to another. There's none of you but can ſpie out ſuch a weak fallacy as this is; and if he meant to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken truth, he would have ſaid no more then this, that every man thinks his own opinion true. For as the will cannot embrace an object unleſſe it be preſented <hi>ſub umbra boni,</hi> ſo neither can the underſtanding cloſe and comply with any opinion, unleſſe it be diſguiſed, <hi>ſub apparentia veri;</hi> But to make appearance the very eſſence of truth, is to make a ſhadow the eſſence of the Sun, 'tis to make a picture the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a man.

Now God, lets the ſoul have ſome certaine acquaintance with other beings for his own ſake, and in order to his own glory. Nor is it a ſmall expreſſion of his wiſdome and power, to lay the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of mans certainty ſo low, even as low as ſenſe; for by means of ſuch an humble foundation the ſtructure proves the ſurer and the taller. 'Tis true there is a purer and nobler Certainty in ſuch beings as are above ſenſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the Certainty of Angelical knowledge, and the knowledge of God himſelf; yet ſo much certainty as is requiſite for ſuch a rational nature as man is, may well have its riſing and ſpringings out of ſenſe, though it have more refinings and purifyings from the underſtanding. This is the right proportioning of his certainty to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for as his being reſults out of the myſterious union of matter, to immateriality: ſo likewiſe his knowledge and the certainty of his knowledge (I ſpeake of naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) firſt peeps out in ſenſe, and ſhines more brightly in the underſtanding. The firſt dawnings of certainty are in the ſenſe, the noon-day-glory of it is in the Intellect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals. There are indeed frequent errours in this firſt Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of knowledge ſet out by ſenſe; but 'tis then onely when the due conditions are wanting, and the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as ſome printers uſe to do) Corrects the old <hi>Errata</hi> of the firſt Edition, and makes ſome new Errours in its owne. And I need not tell you, that 'tis the ſame ſoul that moves both in the ſenſe and in the underſtanding, for <gap reason="foreign">

its intellectual operations, though it have an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able certainty of ſome, in both. The certainty of ſenſe is ſo great as that an Oath, that high expreſſion of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, is uſually and may very ſafely be built upon it. Mathematical demonſtrations chuſe to preſent themſelves to the ſenſe, and thus become Ocular and viſible. The Scepticks that were the known enemies of certainty, yet would grant more ſhadow and appearance of it in ſenſe, then any where elſe, though erroneouſly. But ſenſe that rackt them ſometimes, and extorted ſome confeſſions from them, which ſpeculative principles could never do. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way then with that humour of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> that tells us <gap reason="foreign">

Surely he ſpeaks onely of his owne watery and weeping eyes, that were ſo dull'd and blur'd, as that they could not clearly diſcerne an object. But he might have given others leave to have ſeen more then he did. Nor can I tell how to excuſe <hi>Plato</hi> for too much ſcorning and ſleighting theſe outward ſenſes, when that he truſted too much inwardly to his owne fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Sextus Empiricus</hi> propounds the queſtion, whether he were not a Sceptick, but he onely ſhew'd himſelf a Sceptick by this, for which he mov'd ſuch a queſtion. 'Tis ſure that <hi>Plato</hi> was ſufficiently dogmatical in all his aſſertions, though this indeed muſt be granted, that ſome of his principles ſtrike at certainty, and much indanger it; for being too fantaſtical and Poetical in his Phiſoſophy, he plac't all his ſecurity in ſome uncertaine airy and imaginary Caſtles of his own contriving and building and fortifyng. His connate Ideas (I mean) which <hi>Artiſtotle</hi> could not at all confide in, but blowed them away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; and perceiving the proud emptineſſe, the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling frothineſſe of ſuch Platonical bubles, he was faine to ſearch for certainty ſome where elſe, and caſting his eye upon the ground he ſpyed the bottome of it, lying in

The firſt rudiments of certainty were drawn by ſenſe, the compleating and conſummating of it was in the underſtanding. The certainty of ſenſe is more groſſe and palpable, the certainty of intellectuals, 'tis more cleere and Cryſtalline, more pure and ſpiritual. To put all certainty or the chiefeſt certainty in ſenſe, would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively injurious to reaſon, and would advance ſome ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive creatures above men, for they have ſome quicker ſenſes then men have; ſenſe 'tis but the gate of certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, (I ſpeak all this while but of humane certainty) the underſtanding 'tis the throne of it. <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> the French Philoſopher reſolves all his aſſurance, into thinking that he thinks, why not into thinking that he ſees? and why may he not be deceived in that as in any other operations? And if there be ſuch a virtue in reflecting and redupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating of it, then there will be more certainty in a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-reflection, in thinking that he thinks that he thinks, and ſo if he run <hi>in infinitum,</hi> according to his conceit he will ſtill have more certainty, though in reality he will have none at all, but will be fain to ſtop and ſtay in Sceptiſme, ſo that theſe refuges of lyes being ſcatter'd, firſt pinciples and common notions with thoſe demonſtrations that ſtream from them, they onely remaine, as the nerves of this aſſurance, as the ſouls of natural Plerophory; and he that will not caſt Anchor upon theſe, condemnes himſelf to perpetual Sceptiſme; which makes me wonder at a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of a Right honourable of our own; Though whether he be the Authour of the paſſage, you may take time to conſider it: But this it is, (the ſenſe of it I mean) That abſolute contradictions may meet together, in the ſame reſpect <hi>Eſſe &amp; non eſſe</hi> it ſeemes are eſpouſed in a moſt neer and conjugal union, and live together very affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately

to have a reverent eſteeme of Antiquity is but fitting and equal, but to ſtand in awe of it, is baſe and unworthy. <hi>Poteſtas ſenatoria</hi> is very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and beneficial, but <hi>dictatoria potestas,</hi> is not to be allowed in the Common-wealth of Learning; yet ſuch hath been the intolerable tyranny and oppreſſion of the Roman faction, as that they have enjoyn'd and engaged as many as they could to ſerve and torture their wits, for the maintaining of whatever ſuch a one as pleaſeth them, ſhall pleaſe to ſay: for they care not how prejudicial or detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental they prove to Learning, ſo that they may but train up their ſchollars in an implicit faith, in a blinde obedience, in a ſlaviſh acknowledgement of ſome infallible judge of controverſies, and may ſhut up and impriſon the generality of people in a dark and benighted condition, not ſo much as allowing them the light of their own Candle, this Lamp of the Lord that ought to ſhine in them. That great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancer of Learning whom I commended before, takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that by ſuch unhappy means as theſe, the more noble and liberal ſciences, have made no progreſſe proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to that which more inferiour and mechanical Arts have done; for in theſe latter <hi>ingenia multorum in unum coëunt,</hi> whereas in the former, <hi>ingenia multorum ſub uno ſuccubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt.</hi> What brave improvements have been made in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, in manufactures, in printing, in the <hi>Pyxis nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica?</hi> For here's no limiting and reſtraining men to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, no chaining them to old Authors, no regulating them to I know not what preſcribed formes and Canons, no ſuch ſtrange voices as theſe. You muſt not build better then your predeceſſors have done, you muſt not print fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the firſt <hi>Tullies</hi> Offices, that ere was printed; 'Tis not lookt upon as a tranſgreſſion and a <hi>piaculum,</hi> if they ſhould chance to be a little more accurate then they were that went before them.

any breach of faith or manners) yet here if a <hi>Galilaeus</hi> ſhould but preſent the world with a handful of new demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though never ſo warily and ſubmiſſively, if he ſhall but frame and contrive a glaſſe for the diſcovery of ſome more lights; all the reward he muſt expect from <hi>Rome,</hi> is, to rot in an Inquiſition, for ſuch unlicenced inventions, for ſuch venturous undertakings. The ſame ſtrain of cruelty hath marcht more vehemently and impetuouſly in ſacred and religious matters, for here <hi>Babylon</hi> hath heated her fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace ſeven times hotter, whileſt under the pompous name of a Catholique Church, under the glittering pretences of Antiquity and Authority, they have as much as they could put out all the Lamps of the Lord. And that Beſtian Empire hath transform'd all its Subjects into ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and irrational creatures. A noble Author of our own tells us in his book <hi>De Veritate,</hi> that he for his part takes them for the Catholique Church, that are conſtant and faithful to firſt principles; that common notions are the bottome and foundation upon which the Church is built. Excuſe our diffidence here great Sir, the Church 'tis built upon a ſurer and higher Rock, upon a more Adamantine and precious foundation; yet thus much is acceptable and undeniable, that whoe're they are that by any practices or cuſtomes, or traditions, or tenents, ſhall ſtop the paſſage of firſt principles, and the ſound reaſon that flowes from them, they are in this farther from a Church then the Indians or the Americans, whilſt they are not only Antichriſtian, but unnatural. And of the two the Church hath more ſecurity in reſting upon genuine Reaſon, then in relying upon ſome ſpurious traditions; for think but a while upon thoſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite deceits and uncertainties that ſuch Hiſtorical convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are liable and expoſed to, I alwayes except thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and heavenly volumes of Scripture, that are ſtrung to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as ſo many pearls, and make a bracelet for the Spouſe to wear upon her hands continually: Theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings

the providence of God hath deeply engaged it ſelf to keep as the apples of his own eye. And they do not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their certainty or validity from any Eccleſiaſtical or univerſal Tradition (which is at the moſt but previous and preparatory) but from thoſe prints of Divinity in them, and ſpecially from the ſeal of the ſame Spirit that endited them, and now aſſures the ſoul, that they were Oracles breathed from God himſelf. As for all other ſacred Antiquity, though I ſhall ever honour it as much as any either did or can do juſtly, and with ſobriety; and ſhall alwayes reverence a gray-headed truth; yet if Antiquity ſhall ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with this Lamp of the Lord (though genuine Antiquity would never offer to do it) yet if it ſhould, it muſt not think much if we prefer Reaſon, a daughter of Eternity, before Antiquity, which is the off-ſpring of time. But had not the ſpirit of Antichriſtianiſme by its early twinings and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations wound and wrought it ſelf into moſt flouriſhing and primitive times, into the boſome of a Virgin-Church, and had it not offered violence to the works of ſome ſacred wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by detracting and augmenting according to its ſeveral exigencies, by feigning and adulterating, by hiding and annihilating ſome of them, as much as they could, (the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary tricks of Antichriſt, which he uſed alwayes more ſubtilly, though of late more palpably) had it not been for ſuch devices as theſe, Antiquity had come flowing to us, in purer and fuller ſtreams, in more fair and kindly deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo might have run down more powerfully and victoriouſly then now it will. But Antichriſt hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to be the <hi>Abaddon</hi> and the <hi>Apollyon</hi> of all ſacred an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, though the very reliques of thoſe ſhining and burning lights that adorn'd the Church of God, have ſplendor enough to ſcatter the darkneſſe of Popery, that empty ſhadow of Religion, that ariſes <hi>ob defectum Luminis;</hi> yet Antiquity (ſetting aſide thoſe that were peculiarly <gap reason="foreign">

ſhine out brighter and brighter, till perfect day. Let none therefore ſo ſuperſtitiouſly look back to former ages, as to be angry with new opinions and diſplayings of light, either in Reaſon or Religion. Who dares oppoſe the goodneſſe and wiſdome of God? if he ſhall enamour the world with the beauty of ſome pearls and jewels, which in former times have been hid, or trampled upon? if he ſhall diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſome more light upon earth, as he hath let ſome new Stars be found in the heavens; This you may be ſure and confident of, that 'tis againſt the minde and meaning of Antiquity to ſtop the progreſſe of Religion and Reaſon. But I know there are ſome will tell us of a viſible tribunal, of an infallible head of the Church borne to determine all controverſies, to regulate all men, 'tis a wonder they do not ſay Angels too.

And though this Candle of the Lord may be too hot for ſome, yet the Lamp 'tis only maintain'd with ſoft and peaceable Oile. There is no jarring in pure intellectuals; if men were tun'd and regulated by Reaſon more, there would be more Concord and Harmony in the world. As man himſelf is a ſociable creature, ſo his Reaſon alſo is a ſociable Light. This Candle would ſhine more clearly and equally if the windes of paſſions were not injurious to it. 'Twere a commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble piece of Stoiciſme, if men could alwayes huſh and ſtill thoſe waves that daſh and beat againſt Reaſon, if they could ſcatter all thoſe clouds that ſoil and diſcolour the face and brightneſſe of it, would there be ſuch fractions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in the State, ſuch Schiſmes and Ruptures in the Church, ſuch hot and fiery perſecutions of ſome trifling opinions? If the ſoft and ſober voice of Reaſon were more attended to, Reaſon would make ſome differencies kiſſe and be friends, 'twould ſheath up many a ſword, 'twould quench many a flame, 'twould binde up many a wound. This Candle of the Lord 'twould ſcatter many a dark ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

The ſoul 'tis toſt with paſſion, but it anchors upon Reaſon. This gentleneſſe and quietneſſe of Reaſon doth never commend it ſelf more then in its agreeing and complying with faith, in not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe high and tranſcendent myſteries that are above its own reach and capacity; nay it had alwayes ſo much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and modeſty, waiting and attending upon it, that it would alwayes ſubmit and ſubordinate it ſelf to all ſuch divine revelations as were above its own ſphere. Though it could not graſp them, though it could not pierce into them; yet it ever reſolv'd with all gratitude to admire them, to bow its head, and to adore them. One light does not oppoſe another; <hi>Lumen fidei &amp; Lumen rationis,</hi> may ſhine both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether though with farre different brightneſſe; <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> 'tis not impatient of a ſuperiour light, 'twould both <hi>ferre parem &amp; priorem.</hi> The light of the Sun that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is <hi>Lumen Monarchicum,</hi> a ſupreme and ſovereign light, that with its golden Scepter rules all created ſparkles, and makes them ſubject and obedient to the Lord and rule of light. Created intellectuals depend upon the brightneſſe of Gods beams, and are ſubordinate to them, Angelical Star-light is but <hi>Lumen Ariſtocraticum,</hi> it borrows and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its glory from a more vaſt and majeſtical light. As they differ from one another in glory, ſo al of them infinitly differ from the Sun in glory. Yet 'tis far above the <hi>Lumen Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:50910:93"/>
that light which appears unto the ſons of men, 'tis a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bove their lamps &amp; Torches, poor and contemptible lights, if left to themſelves; for do but imagine ſuch a thing as this, that this external and corporeal world ſhould be adjudg'd never to ſee the Sun more, never to ſee one Star more. If God ſhould ſhut all the windows of heaven, and ſpread out nothing but clouds and curtains, and allow it nothing but the light of a Candle, how would the world look like a <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clops</hi> with its eye put out? 'Tis now but an obſcure priſon with a few grates to look out at; but what would it be then, but a capacious grave, but a nethermoſt dungeon? yet this were a more grateful ſhade, a pleaſanter and more comely darkneſſe, then for a ſoul to be condemned to the ſolitary light of its own Lamp, ſo as not to have any ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural irradiations from its God. Reaſon does not refuſe any auxiliary beams, it joyes in the company of its fellow-Lamp, it delights in the preſence of an intellectual Sun, which will ſo far favour it, as that 'twill advance it, and nouriſh it, and educate it; 'twill encreaſe it,, and inflame it, and will by no means put it out. A Candle neither can nor will put out the Sun, &amp; an intellectual Sun, can, but will not put out the Lamp. The light of Reaſon doth no more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the light of faith, then the light of a Candle doth extinguiſh the light of a Star. The ſame eye of a ſoul may look ſometimes upon a Lamp, and ſometimes upon a Star; one while upon a firſt principle, another while upon a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truth, as hereafter it ſhall alwayes look upon the Sun and ſee God face to face; Grace doth not come to pluck up nature as a weed, to root out the eſſences of men; but it comes to graft ſpirituals upon morals, that ſo by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſupplies and intercourſe they may produce moſt noble and generous fruit. Can you tell me why the ſhell and the kernel may not dwell together? why the bodies of nature may not be quickened by the ſoul of grace? Did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver obſerve an eye uſing a proſpective-glaſſe, for the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50910:93"/>
and amplifying and approximating of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and yet deſirable object? and did you perceive any oppoſition between the eye and the glaſſe? was there not rather a loving correſpondency and communion between them? why ſhould there be any greater ſtrife between Faith and Reaſon, ſeeing they are brethren? do they not both ſpring from the ſame Father of Lights, and can the Fountain of love and unity, ſend forth any irreconcileable ſtreams? do you think that God did ever intend to divide a rational being, to tear and rend a ſoul in pieces, to ſcatter principles of diſcord and confuſion in it? If God be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to open ſome other paſſage in the ſoul, and to give it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other eye, does that prejudice the former? Man you know is ordained to a choicer end, to a nobler happineſſe, then for the preſent he can attain unto, and therefore he cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that God ſhould now communicate himſelf in ſuch bright and open diſcoveries, in ſuch glorious manifeſtations of himſelf, as he meanes to give hereafter. But he muſt be content for the preſent, to behold thoſe infinite treaſures of reſerved love, in a darker and more ſhadowy way of faith, and not of viſion: Nature and Reaſon are not ſufficiently proportion'd to ſuch bleſſed objects, for there are ſuch weights of glory in them, as do <hi>opprimere ingenium huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> there are ſuch depths, ſuch pleonaſmes, ſuch oceans of all perfections in a Deity as do infinitely exceed all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual capacity but its own. The moſt that mans Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can do, is to fill the underſtanding to the brim, but faith that throws the ſoul into the Ocean, and lets it roll and bathe it ſelf in the vaſtneſſe and fulneſſe of a Deity. Could the ſons of men have extracted all the ſpirits of Reaſon, and made them meet and jump in one head; nay, could Angels and men have united and concentricated all their Reaſon, yet they would never have been able to ſpy out ſuch profound and myſterious excellencies, as faith beholds in one twinckling of her eye. Evangelical beauties ſhine

through a veile that's upon their face; you may ſee the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious objects of faith like ſo many pearls and diamonds ſparkling and glittering in the dark. Reveal'd truths ſhine with their own beams, they do not borrow<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>their Primitive and original luſtre from this <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> but from the purer light, wherewith God hath cloathed and attir'd them as with a garment; God crowns his own Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with his own beams. <hi>The Candle of the Lord</hi> it doth not diſcover, it doth not oppoſe them, it cannot eclipſe them. They are no ſparks of Reaſons ſtriking, but they are flaming darts of heavens ſhooting, that both open and enamour the ſoul. They are Stars of Heavens lighting, men behold them at a great diſtance twinckling in the dark. Whatſoever comes in Gods name does <hi>aut invenire viam, aut facere.</hi> Whatever God reveals in his Word, 'tis <hi>ſupra providentiam rerum communem conſtitutum.</hi> 'Tis not in the road of nature, and therefore for the welcoming and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining of it (as a noble Author of our own doth very well obſerve,) <hi>explicatur ſenſus quidam ſupernaturalis,</hi> &amp; <gap reason="foreign">

Reaſon will not, Reaſon cannot; for it does moſt immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably acknowledge a Deity, and the unqueſtionable truth of a Deity: in all believing there is an aſſent, a yielding to him that ſpeaks by vertue of his own Authority; though he don't prove it, though he don't evince it. Now men themſelves look upon't as a contempt and injury not to have their words taken, and Reaſon it ſelf dictates thus much, that we are to believe ſuch a one whom we have no reaſon to diſtruſt; for without ſome Faith there would be no commerce nor traffiking in the world, there's no trading wit hout ſome truſting. A general and total incredulity would threaten a preſent and fatal diſſolution to humane ſociety. Matters of fact are as certain in being and reality, as demonſtrations; yet in appearance moſt of them can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be prov'd or evinc'd any other way then by meer teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony much hiſtorical knowledge, many a truth has been loſt and buried in unbelief, when as many a falſity in the mean time has prov'd more fortunate and triumphant, &amp; has paſt currantly through the world under the ſpecious diſguiſe of probability; yet becauſe no created being is infallible or authentical, becauſe the ſons of men are ſo eaſily decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves, and are ſo apt and propenſe to deceive and impoſe upon others, 'twill be very lawful to move ſlowly and timerouſly, warily and vigilantly in our aſſents to them; for a ſudden and precocious faith here, is neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable nor durable: But God being truth it ſelf, an Eternal, Immutable truth, his word being <hi>vehiculum veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis;</hi> and all Revelations flowing from him, ſhining with the prints and ſignatures of certainty, hence it is that his naked word is a demonſtration; and he that won't believe a God, is worſe then a Devil, he is the blackeſt Infidel that was e're yet extant. This ſin is ſo unnatural, as that none but an Atheiſt can be guilty of it; for he that acknowledges a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and knows what he acknowledges, ſure he won't offer to make his God a liar. That which might otherwiſe ſeem to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50910:95"/>
ſome to be againſt Reaſon, yet if it bring the ſeal of God in its forehead, by this you may know that 'tis not againſt Reaſon. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſlaying of his ſon may ſeem a moſt horrid and unnatural act, againſt the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, againſt the <hi>Candle of the Lord,</hi> yet being commanded and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by God himſelf, the Candle durſt not oppoſe the Sun. That pattern of faith the father of the faithful does not diſpute and make Syllogiſmes againſt it; he does not plead that 'tis againſt common Notions, that 'tis againſt Demonſtrations (for he had ſaid if he had ſaid ſo,) but he doth dutifully obey the God of Nature, that high and ſupreme Law-giver, who by this call and voice of his did plainly and audibly proclaime, that for <hi>Abraham</hi> to kill his ſon in theſe circumſtances, was not againſt the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. So that all the ſtreſſe and difficulty will be to know whether God reveals ſuch a thing or no; for here Reaſon (corrupt reaſon I mean,) is wont to ſlip and evade, and when it cannot frame a conceit adequate &amp; commenſurate to ſome tranſcendent and ſuperlative myſteries, it would then fain cloud them and eclipſe them, that it may quench and avoid the dazling brightneſſe of them. It would faine make them ſtoop and condeſcend to its own capacity, and therefore it puts ſome inferiour notion upon them. When it cannot graſp what God ſaith, it then preſently queſtions whether God ſay ſo or no, whether that be the minde of his Word. Hence many may erre very deeply and dangerouſly, yet will acknowledge the Scriptures, they will own and honour them as the Word of God; for they are not yet arriv'd to that full perfection of Errour, as thoſe lumps and dunghills of all Sects, I mean that young and upſtart generation of groſſ Anti-Scripturiſts, that have a Powder-plot againſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that would very compendiouſly behead all Chriſtian Religion at one blow, a device which old and ordinary He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks were never acquainted withall. Though they be not come to ſuch an height as this, yet eitheir by their flat
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50910:95"/>
and frigid explicating, they do endeavour to diſpirit and evervate the Word of God; or elſe in a more violent and injurious manner, they do even raviſh it, and deflower the virginity of it, or elſe in a more ſubtle and ſerpentine man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they ſeek to bend the rule, and expound it to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and advantages. The letter of the word, the <hi>vagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na verbi</hi> that does not wound them, that does not ſtrike them, and as for the edge they think they can draw that as they pleaſe, they can blunt it as they liſt, they can order it as they will. But the Law of ſound Reaſon and Nature does oppoſe ſuch unworthy dealings as theſe are; for men look upon't very heinouſly to have their words miſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, to have their meaning wreſted and violenc'd. Can you think that the majeſty of Heaven will allow or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that a creature ſhould ſtudy or buſie it ſelf in pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his words, in corrupting his meaning, in blending it and mixing it with the crude imaginations of their own braine? That Spirit which breath'd out the word at firſt, and which convinces and ſatisfies the ſoul, that 'tis the word of God; the very ſame Spirit is the Interpreter of it, he is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator upon it. The text is his, and the gloſſe is his, and whoſoever ſhall call this a private ſpirit, muſt needs be a bold blaſphemer, a Jeſuit, an Atheiſt. But they that know what the Spirit of God is, will eaſily grant that the Spirit of God unſheaths his own ſword, that he poliſhes Evangelical Pearls, that he anoints and conſecrates the eye of the ſoul, for the welcoming and entertaining of ſuch precious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. 'Tis true indeed, that ſom explications are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and diſtorted, as that a prophane and carnal eye may preſently diſcerne that there was either ſome violence or deceit uſed in them, as who cannot tell when any Author is extremely vext and wrong'd? but if there be any ſuch obſcurity as may give juſt occaſion of doubting and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, who then can be fitter to clear and unfold it, then the Author himſelf? nay, who can explaine his minde cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50910:96"/>
but he himſelf? is it not thus in ſpirituals much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? When God ſcatters any twilight, any darkneſſe there, is it not by a more plentiful ſhedding abroad of his own beams? ſuch a knot as created underſtanding cannot unty, the edge of the Spirit preſently cuts aſunder; Nor yet is providence wanting in external means, which by the goodneſſe and power of God, were annexed as <hi>ſigilla ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> miracles I mean, which are upon this account very ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and proportionably ſubſervient to Faith, they being above natural power, as revealed truths are above natural underſtanding. The one's above the hand of nature, as the other's above the head of nature; But Miracles, though they be very potent, yet they are not alwayes prevalent, for there were many ſpectators of Chriſts Miracles, which yet like ſo many <hi>Pharaohs</hi> were hardened by them, and ſome of them that beheld them were no more moved by them, then ſome of them who only hear of them; will not at all attend to them. So that only the ſeal of the Spirit can make a firme impreſſion upon the ſoul, who writes his own word upon the ſoul with a conquering and triumphant Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam, that is impatient either of cloud or ſhadow. Be open therefore ye everlaſting doors, and ſtand wide open ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual gates, that the ſpirit of grace and glory, with the goodly train of his revealed truths may enter in. There's foundation for all this in a principle of nature; for we muſt ſtill put you in minde of the concord that is betwixt Faith and Reaſon. Now this is the voice of Reaſon, that God can, and that none but God can aſſure you of his own mind; for if he ſhould reveal his minde by a creature, there will ſtill be ſome tremblings and waverings in the ſoul, unleſſe he does withal ſatisfie a ſoul, that ſuch a creature does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his minde truly and really as it is, ſo that ultimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the certainty is reſolv'd into the voice of God, and not into the courteſie of a creature. This holy Spirit of God creates in the ſoul a grace anſwerable to theſe tranſcendent
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50910:96"/>
objects, you cannot but know the name of it, 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Faith, <hi>Super-naturalis forma fidet,</hi> as <hi>Mirandula</hi> the younger ſtiles it, which cloſes and complies with every word that drops from the voice or pen of a Deity, and which facilitates the ſoul to aſſent to revealed truths; So as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that with a heavenly inclination, with a delightful propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it moves to them as to a centre. Reaſon cannot more delight in a common notion or a demonſtration, then Faith does in revealed truth. As the Unity of a Godhead is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable and clear to the eye of Reaſon, ſo the Trinity of perſons, that is, three glorious relations in one God is as certain to an eye of Faith. 'Tis as certain to this eye of Faith that Chriſt is truly God, as it was viſible to an eye both of Senſe and Reaſon that he is truly man. Faith ſpies out the reſurrection of the body; as Reaſon ſees the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul. I know there are ſome Authors of great worth and learning, that endeavour to maintain this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that revealed truths, though they could not be found by reaſon, yet when they are once revealed, that Reaſon can then evince them and demonſtrate them: But I much rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They were never againſt Reaſon, they were alwayes above Reaſon. 'Twill be employment enough, and 'twill be a noble employment too, for Reaſon to redeeme and vindicate them from thoſe thornes and difficulties, with which ſome ſubtle ones have vext them and encompaſt them.

There are ſome things demonſtrable, which to many ſeeme impoſſible, how much more eaſily may there be ſome matters of faith which every one cannot free from all difficulties. 'Tis ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient therefore for ſuch, that they ſo farre forth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them as to be ſure that they are not againſt Reaſon, and that principally upon this account, becauſe they are ſure God has revealed them. And others that are of more advanced and elevated intellectuals, may give ſuch expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of them, as may diſentangle them from all repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, though they cannot diſplay them in their full glory. Nor muſt the multitude or ſtrength and wit of oppoſers fright men out of their Faith and Religion.

So that one affirmative here is to be preferred before a whole heap of negatives; the judgement of one wiſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd, experienc'd, ſpiritualiz'd Chriſtian is more to be attended to, then the votes and ſuffrages of a thouſand gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers; becauſe this is undeniable, that God may give to one that Eye, that Light, that diſcerning power, which he does deny to many others. 'Tis therefore a piece of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive vanity and arrogancy in <hi>Socinus,</hi> to limit and meaſure all Reaſon by his own. Nor does this put any uncertainty

in Reaſon, but only a diverſity in the improvings of it, one Lamp differs from another in glory; and withal it laies down an higher and nobler principle then Reaſon is: for in things meerly natural, every rational being is there a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge in thoſe things that are within the Sphere &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Reaſon, the Reaſon of all men does agree and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire, ſo as that which implies an expreſſe and palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, cannot be own'd by any; but in things above Nature and Reaſon, a paucity here is a better argument then a plurality; becauſe Providence uſes to opèn his Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets only for his Jewels. God manifeſts theſe myſterious ſecrets only to a few friends, his Spirit whiſpers to a few, ſhines upon a few, ſo that if any tell us that Evangelical my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries imply a contradiction, becauſe they cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, it is no more then for a blinde man confidently to determine, that it involves a contradiction to ſay there is a Sun, becauſe he cannot ſee it. Why ſhould you not as well think that a greater part of the world lies in Error, as that it lies in wickedneſſe? is it not defective in the choiſeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals, as well as in the nobleſt practicals? Or can any perſwade himſelf, that a moſt eminent and refined part of mankinde, and (that which is very conſiderable) a Virgin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company which kept it ſelf untoucht from the pollutions of Antichriſt upon mature deliberation, for long continuance upon many debatings, examinings, diſcuſſings, conſtantpray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers unto God for the diſcovery of his minde, ſhould all this while embrace meere contradictions, for the higheſt points of their Religion? or can any conceive that theſe Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Myſteries were invented, and contriv'd, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by men? Could the Head of a creature invent them? could the arme of a creature uphold them? have they not a Divine ſuper-ſcription upon them? have they not an heavenly original? or can you imagine that Providence would have ſo bleſt and proſper'd a contradiction? as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to pluck it out of the pawes of devouring adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?

when the whole Chriſtian world was ready to be ſwallowed up with Arrianiſme, dare any to ſay that God then prepar'd an Arke only for the preſerving of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? Providence does not uſe to countenance contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, ſo as to let them ride in triumph over Truth. The moſt that any oppoſer can ſay, if he will ſpeak truth, is no more then this, that they ſeeme to him to imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction? which may very eaſily be ſo, if he want an higher principle of faith, ſuitable and anſwerable to theſe matters of faith, both of them (the principle and object I mean) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupernatural, neither of them contranatural; for there is a double modeſty in Reaſon very remarkable; As it does not <hi>multa aſſerere,</hi> ſo it does not <hi>multa negare;</hi> as it takes very few things for certain, ſo it concludes very few for impoſſible; Nay, Reaſon though ſhe will not put out her eye, for that's unnatural, yet ſhe will cloſe her eye ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that faith may aime the better, and that's commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: And Faith makes Reaſon abundant compenſation for this; for as a learned Author of our own, and a great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron both of Faith and Reaſon, does notably expreſſe it, Faith is a ſupply of Reaſon in things intelligible, as the imagination is of light in things viſible. The imagination with her witty and laborious penſil drawes and repreſents the ſhapes, proportions and diſtances of perſons and places, taking them only by the help of ſome imperfect deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and 'tis faine to ſtay here, till it be better ſatisfied with the very ſight of the things themſelves. Thus Faith takes things upon an heavenly repreſentation and deſcription, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a word, upon a promiſe, it ſees a heavenly <hi>Canaan</hi> in the Map before an intellectual eye can behold it in a way of cleere and open viſion; for men are not here capable of a preſent Heaven, and happineſſe of a compleat aud beatifical viſion; and therefore they are not capable of ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in their full ſplendor and brightneſſe; for they would make it, if they were thus unfolded, but they now flouriſh

'Tis honour enough for a Chriſtian, if he can but touch the hem of Evangelical Myſteries, for he will never ſee a full Commentary upon the Goſpel, till he can behold the naked face of his God. Yet the knowledge which he hath of him here, <hi>imperfecta cognitio rerum nobiliſſimarum,</hi> 'tis moſt pleaſant and delicious. 'Tis better to know a little of God and Chriſt, then to ſee all the creatures in their full beauty and perfection. The gleanings of ſpirituals is better then the vintage of naturals and morals. The leaſt ſpangle of happineſſe is better then a globe of temporals. This ſets a gloſſe and luſtre upon Chriſtian Religion, and highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the purity and perfection of it, above all other whatſoever, in that it hath <gap reason="foreign">

Whereas the dull and creeping religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> has nothing at all above Nature and Reaſon, though it may have many things againſt both; no need of Faith there, there are no Myſteries in his Alcoran, unleſſe of deceit and iniquity. Nothing at all <hi>niſi quod de facili, à quolibet mediocriter ſapiente naturali ingenio cognoſci poteſt,</hi> as that ſolid Author very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. And therefore that ſtupid impoſter did not ſeale his words with any miracles, for there was not one ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral truth to be ſealed, nor could he have ſealed it if it had been there, but only he proſecutes it with a ſword. <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> Loadſtone does not draw men, but his ſword that conquers them, he draws his ſword, he bids them deliver up their ſouls, and tells them, that upon this condition he will ſpare their lives. <hi>Signa illa quae tyrannis &amp; latronibus

But the very principles of Chriſtian Religion are attractive and magnetical, they enamour and command, they overpower the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make it glad to look upon ſuch myſterious truths as are reflected in a glaſſe, becauſe it is unable to behold them <gap reason="foreign">

This ſpeaks the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of Mount <hi>Sion</hi> above Mount <hi>Sina.</hi> In the Law you have <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> ſhining; in the Goſpel you have the day-ſpring from on high, the Sun ariſing. Nature and Reaſon triumph in the Law, Grace and Faith flower out in the Goſpel. By vertue of this wiſe and free diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, weak ones chiefly receive the Goſpel, for they are as well able to believe as any other, nay they are apter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve then others. If it had gone only by the advancement of intellectuals, by the heightenings and clarifyings of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who then would have been ſaved but the grandees of the world? the Scribes, the Phariſees, the Philoſophers, the Diſputers? but God has fram'd a way that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds thoſe heads of the world, and drops happineſſe into the mouths of babes. There are ſome underſtandings that neither ſpin nor toile, and yet <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his wiſdome and glory was not clothed like one of theſe: for this way of Faith 'tis a more brief &amp; compendious way <hi>Longum iter per Rationem, breve per Fidem.</hi> Very few underſtandings much leſſe all can demonſtrate all that is demonſtrable, but if men have a power of believing, they may preſently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all that's true and certain. That which Reaſon would have been ſweating for this many a yeer, Faith ſups up the quinteſſence of in a moment. All men in the world have not equal abilities, opportunities, advantages of impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Reaſon, even in things natural and moral, ſo that Reaſon it ſelf tels us, that theſe are in ſome meaſure neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to believ others.

'Tis thus in ſpirituals, ſuch is the weakneſſe of humane underſtanding <hi>pro hoc ſtatu,</hi> as that they are neceſſitated to believing here; yet ſuch is its happineſſe, that it hath one to inſtruct it who can neither deceive nor be deceived. God hath choſen this way of Faith, that he may ſtaine the pride and glory of man, that he may poſe his intellectuals, that God may maintaine in man great apprehenſions of himſelf, of his own incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibleneſſe, of his own truth, of his own revelations, as that he may keep a creature in a poſture of dependency, ſo as to give up his underſtanding, ſo as to be diſpoſed and regulated by him.

Men that are took up with intellectual joy, trample upon all other inferiour objects.

The painted and feigned heaven of a <hi>Mahomet,</hi> would prove a real hell to an Angel or glorified Saint. He plants a fooles paradiſe of his own, there are trees of his own ſetting and watering, the fat and juicey Olive, the wanton and ſequacious Ivy, and though he would not allow them Vines on earth (ſuch was his great love of ſobriety) yet he reſerves them for heaven; what meanes that ſenſual and ſottiſh impoſtor, to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of heaven by an Ivy-buſh? Does he think that Goats and Swine, that <hi>Mahomets</hi> muſt enter into the new Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem?

The laughing his enemies to ſcorne, 'tis a pleaſure fit for infinte juſtice, the ſmiling upon his Church, the favouring and countenancing of his people, 'tis a pleaſure fit for mercy and goodneſſe; Miracles are the pleaſure of his omnipotency, varieties are the delight of his wiſdome; Creation was an act of pleaſure, and it muſt needs delight him to behold ſo much of his own workmanſhip, ſo many pictures of his own drawing; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption was an expreſſion of that ſingular delight and pleaſure which he took in the ſons of men.

For an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual lamp to aſpire to be a Sun, 'tis a lofty ſtraine of that intolerable pride which was in <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Adam:</hi> but for <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> to deſire the favour, and preſence, and enjoyment of a beatifical Sun, this is but a juſt and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſire of that end which God himſelf created it for. It muſt needs be a proud and ſwelling drop that deſires to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Ocean; but if it ſeeks only to be united to an Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, ſuch a deſire tends to its own ſafety and honour. The face of the ſoul naturally looks up to God, <hi>coelúmque tueri Juſſit, &amp; erectos ad ſidera tollere vultus,</hi> tis as true of the ſoul as of the body. All light loves to dwell at home with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lights. Heaven 'tis <hi>Patria luminum,</hi> God has there fixt a tabernacle for the Sun, for 'tis good to be there, 'tis a condeſcenſion in a Sunne-beam that 'twill ſtoop ſo low as earth, and that 'twill gild this inferiour part of the world; 'tis the humility of light that 'twill incarnate and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it ſelf into ſublunary bodies; yet even there 'tis not forgetful of its noble birth and original, but 'twill ſtill look upwards to the Father of lights. Though the Sun cover the earth with its healing and ſpreading wings, yet even thoſe wings love to flie aloft, and not to reſt upon the ground in a ſluggiſh poſture. Nay, light when it courteouſly ſalutes ſome earthy bodies, it uſually meets with ſuch churliſh en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, as that by an angry reverberation, 'tis ſent back again, yet in reſpect of it ſelf 'tis many times an happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection and rebound, for 'tis thus neceſſitated to come neerer heaven. If you look but upon a Candle, what an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and ambitious light is it? though the proper figure of flame be Globular and not Pyramidal, (as the noble <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam</hi> tells us in his Hiſtory of Nature) which appears by thoſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50910:109"/>
celeſtial bodies, thoſe fine and rarified flames, (if we may ſo call them with the Peripateticks leave) that roll and move themſelves in a globular and determinate manner: yet that flame which we uſually ſee puts on the form of a Pyramide, occaſionally and accidentally, by reaſon that the aire is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to it, and by quenching the ſides of the flame cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it, and extenuates it into that form, for otherwiſe 'twould aſcend upwards in one greatneſſe, in a rounder and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleater manner. 'Tis juſt thus in <hi>the Candle of the Lord;</hi> Reaſon would move more fully according to the ſphere of its activity, 'twould flame up towards heaven in a more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and uniforme way, but that it is much quencht by that <gap reason="foreign">

Every ſpark of Reaſon flies upwards, this divine flame fell down from heaven, and halted with its fall, (as the Poets in their Mythology tell us of the limping of <hi>Vulcane)</hi> but it would faine aſcend thither againe by ſome ſteps and gradations of its own framing.</p>
                     <p>Reaſon 'tis ſoon weary with its fluttering up and down among the creatures, <hi>the Candle of the Lord</hi> does but waſte it ſelf in vain in ſearching for happines here below. Some of the choiceſt Heathens did thus ſpend their Lamps, &amp; exhauſt their Oile, and then at length were faine to lie down in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; ſorrow; their Lamps did ſhew them ſome glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appearances of a <hi>Summum bonum</hi> at a great diſtance, but it did not ſufficiently direct them in the way to it, no more then a Candle can guide a traveller that is ignorant of his way. You may ſee ſome of the more ſordid Heathen toyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſearching with their Candle in the mines and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries

of riches, to ſee if they could ſpy any veine of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe there, but the earth ſaith, 'Tis not in me. You may ſee others among them feeding and maintaining their Candle with the aire of popular applauſe, ſucking in the breath and eſteem of men, till at the length they perceived that it came with ſuch uncertain blaſts, as that they choſe rather to cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter themſelves up in a Lanthorn, to put themſelves into ſome more reſerved and retired condition, rather then to be expoſed to thoſe tranſient and arbitrary blaſts, which ſome are pleaſed to entitle and ſtile by the name of honours. You might ſee ſome of them pouring the Oile of gladneſſe into their Lamps, till they ſoon perceived that voluptuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, did but melt and diſſolve the Candle, and that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures like ſo many thieves, did ſet it a blazing, and did not keep it in an equal ſhining. You might behold others, and thoſe the moſt eminent amongſt them, ſnuffing their Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles very exactly and accurately, by improving their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuals and refining their morals, till they ſadly perceived that when they were at the brighteſt, their Candles burnt but dimly and blewly, and that for all their ſnuffing they would relapſe into their former dulneſſe. The ſnuffings of Nature and Reaſon will never make up a day, nor a Sun-ſhine of happineſſe; all the light that did ſhine upon theſe Ethiopians did only diſcover their own blackneſſe, yet they were ſo enamour'd with this natural complexion, as that they look't upon't as a piece of the pureſt beauty.</p>
                     <p>Nature <hi>Narciſſus</hi>-like loves to look upon its own face, and is much taken with the reflexions of it ſelf.

liſt. Thus do ſond creatures boaſt of their decayed Lamps, as if they were ſo many Sunnes, or at leaſt Stars of the firſt magnitude. The Stoicks ſpoke this more loudly, yet the reſt of the Heathen whiſpered out the ſame, for they were all of the Poets minde.—<hi>Natura beatis Omnibus eſſe dedit, ſi quis cognoverit uti.</hi> And they would all willingly ſubſcribe to thoſe words of <hi>Saluſt.

If you would ſee the riſe, and progreſſe, and variations of this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, how it began to bluſh and put on more modeſty in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mipelagianiſme; how afterwards it cover'd its nakedneſſe with ſome Popiſh fig-leaves; how at length it refin'd it ſelf and dreſt it ſelf more handſomely in Arminianiſme, you may conſult with the forementioned Author, who kept a relique of his Pelagian Hiſtory in his own breaſt, whileſt it left upon him an Arminian tincture.

The harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compoſing of natural faculties, the tuning of thoſe ſpheres, will never make up an heaven fit for a ſoul to dwell in. Yet notwithſtanding whatſoever is lovely in narure is acceptable even to God himſelf, for 'tis a print of himſelf, and he does proportion ſome temporal rewards unto it; the juſtice of an <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> the good laws of a <hi>Solon</hi> or a <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> the formal devotion of a <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> the prudence of a <hi>Cato,</hi> the courage of a <hi>Scipio,</hi> the moderation of a <hi>Fabius,</hi> the publitk ſpirit of a <hi>Cicero,</hi> they had all ſome rewards ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among them. Nor is there any doubt but that ſome of the Heathen pleaſed God better then others. Surely <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was more lovely in his eyes then <hi>Ariſtophanes, Auguſtus</hi> pleaſed him better then <hi>Tiberius, Cicero</hi> was more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him then <hi>Catiline,</hi> for there were more remainders of his image in the one then in the other, the one was of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer and nobler influence then the other. <hi>Minùs malus reſpectu pejoris eſt bonus,</hi> the one ſhall have more mitigations of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment then the other; <hi>Socrates</hi> ſhall taſte a milder cup of wrath, when as <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> ſhall drink up the dregs of fury; if divine juſtice whip <hi>Cicero</hi> with rods, 'twill whip <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiline</hi> with Scorpions.

Nor is this a ſmall advantage that comes by the excellencies &amp; improvements of Nature, that if God ſhall pleaſe to beautifie and adorne ſuch an one with ſupernatural principles, and if he think good to drop grace into ſuch a ſoul, 'twill be more ſerviceable and inſtrumental to God then others. Religion cannot deſire to ſhine with a greater gloſſe and luſtre, it cannot deſire to ride among men in greater pomp and ſolemnity, in a more triumphant Chariot, then in a ſoul of vaſt intellectuals, of Virgin and undeflowered morals, of calme and compoſed affections, of

pleaſant and ingenuous diſpoſitions. When the ſtrength of Nature, and the power of godlineſſe unite, and concentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their forces, they make up the fineſt and pureſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion; the ſoundeſt and braveſt conſtitution, like a ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and vigorous ſoul, quickening and informing a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful body. Yet this muſt be thought upon, that the different improvement even of Naturals, ſprings only from grace. For Eſſentials and Specificals (which are meer Nature they are equal in all, but whatſoever ſingular or additional per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is annext to ſuch a one, flows only from the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſhing goodneſſe of an higher cauſe; that <hi>Socrates</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny better then <hi>Ariſtophanes,</hi> was not nature, but a kinde of common gift and grace of the Spirit of God, for there are the ſame ſeminal principles in all. <hi>Auguſtus &amp; Tiberius</hi> were hew'n out of the ſame rock; there are in <hi>Cicero</hi> the ſeeds of a <hi>Catiline:</hi> and when the one brings forth more kindely and generous, the other more wilde and corrupted fruit, 'tis ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as the countenance and favourable aſpect of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is pleaſed to give the increaſe; for as the Philoſophers tell us, <hi>Motio moventis praecedit motum mobilis,</hi> was there any propenſion or inclination to goodneſs in the heart of a <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> more then of a <hi>Catiline?</hi> 'twas only from the firſt mover, from the finger of God himſelf that tuned the one more harmoniouſly then the other. As take two ſeveral Lutes, let them be made both alike for eſſentials, for matter and form; if now the one be ſtrung better then the othet, the thanks is not due to the Lute, but to the arbitrary pleaſure of him that ſtrung it; let them be both made alike and ſtrung alike, yet if the one be quickened with a more delicate and graceful touch, the prevailing excellency of the muſick was not to be aſcribed to the nature of the Lute, but to the skill and dexterity of him that did move it and prompted it into ſuch elegant ſounds.

Some dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of Nature have abundantly witneſſed this, whileſt they have run into ſome unnatural practices, that were the very bluſhes of Nature; if then Nature cannot tell how to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, will it ever be able to climbe up to heaven? <hi>Sineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat ſervire, neſcit imperare,</hi> if it be not faithful in a little, do you think that it ſhall be made Ruler over much? no certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, moral endowments when they are at the proudeſt top and <hi>apex,</hi> can do no more, then what that great Antipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Proſper</hi> tells us, <hi>Mortalem vitam honeſtare poſſunt, aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam conferre non poſſunt.</hi> God has ordeined men to a choycer end, then theſe natural faculties can either deſerve, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or enjoy. Natures hand cannot earn it; <hi>Natures hand cannot reach it, Natures eye cannot ſee it.</hi> That glorious and ultimate end, which muſt fill and ſatiate the being of man, is the beatifical viſion of God himſelf. Now there is no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural power nor operation proportioned to ſuch a tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent object as the face of God, as the naked eſſence of a Deity. Inferior creatures may, &amp; do move within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:50910:112"/>
of their natures, and yet they reach that end which was propounded and aſſigned to their being: but ſuch was the ſpecial and peculiar love of God, which he manifeſted to a rational nature, as that it muſt be advanc't above it ſelf by a <hi>ſupernaturale auxilium,</hi> before it can be bleſt with ſo great a perfection, as to arrive to the full end of its being. Yet God has toucht nature with himſelf, and drawes it by the attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and magnetical vertue of ſo commanding an object as his own eſſence is, which makes Nature affect and deſire ſomewhat ſupernatural, that it may make neerer approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es unto happineſſe; for this end God did aſſume humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the divine, that he might make it more capable of this perfection, and by a ſtrict love-knot and union might make it partaker of the divine nature; not that 'tis changed into it, but that it has the very ſubſiſtence of its happineſſe by it. Every being does naturally long for its own perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore a rational nature muſt needs thus breath and pant after God, and the neerer it comes to him, the more intenſely and vehemently it does deſire him, for as they tell us, <hi>Motus naturalis velocior eſt in ſine,</hi> the neerer a body ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to its centre, the more cheerful and vigorous is its motion. The Underſtanding that ſees moſt of God, deſires to ſee more of him; its eye will never leave rolling till it fix it ſelf in the very centre of the Divine eſſence. Nature that has but ſome weake glimpſes of him, and ſo it has but faint and languiſhing velleities after him. <gap reason="foreign">

flowing from Grace do contribute to more Grace &amp; Glory, yet this we ſay, that upon the improvement of any preſent ſtrength, God out of his free goodneſſe, may if he pleaſe give more. As God freely gave them nature (which makes <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſometimes call Nature Grace) and as he freely, and out of his Grace gave them ſome emprovement of Nature, ſo he might as freely give them ſupernatural ſtrength if it ſo pleaſe him. Yet a creature cannot come to heaven by all thoſe improvements which are built upon Natures founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if it ſhould accurately and punctually obſerve eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jot and tittle of Natures Law, yet this natural obedience would not be at all correſpondent or commenſurate to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural happineſſe, which makes Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> break out into ſuch an expreſſion as this; <hi>Qui dicit hominem ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vari poſſe ſine Chriſto, dubito an ipſe per Chriſtum ſervari poſſit;</hi> for this is the only way, the new and living way, by which God will aſſume humane nature to himſelf, and make it happy. Yet notwithſtanding their cenſure is too harſh and rigid, who as if they were Judges of eternal life and death, damne <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> without any queſtion, without any delay at all; and do as confidently pronounce that they are in hell, as if they ſaw them flaming there. Whereas the infinite goodneſſe and wiſdome of God might for ought we know finde out ſeveral wayes of ſaving ſuch by the Pleonaſmes of his love in Jeſus Chriſt; he <hi>might</hi> make a <hi>Socrates</hi> a branch of the true Vine, and <hi>might</hi> graffe <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> into the fruitful Olive; for it was in his power, if he pleaſed, to reveale Chriſt unto them, and to infuſe faith into them after an extraordinary manner; Though indeed the Scripture does not afford our charity any ſufficient ground to believe that he did; nor dorh it warrant us peremtorily to conclude the contrary. <hi>Secreta Deo,</hi> it does not much concerne us to know what became of them; let us then forbear our cenſure, and leave them to their competent Judge. But when we mention <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50910:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and the more eminent and refined ones among the Heathens, you muſt be ſure not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a thought as this, that the excellency of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuals and morals did move and prevail with the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God to ſave them more then others of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as if theſe were <hi>diſpoſitiones de congruo merentes ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem aeternam,</hi> this indeed were nothing but Pelagianiſme a little diſguiſed; whereas you muſt reſolve it only into the free grace of God, that did thus diſtinguiſh them here in time, and might more diſtinguiſh them eternally, if it pleaſed him to beſtow a Saviour upon them. Which grace of God is ſo free, as that it might ſave the worſt of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and let go the reſt; it might ſave an <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> as well as a <hi>Socrates,</hi> nay before a <hi>Socrates,</hi> as well as a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can before a Phariſee: not only all Heathen, but all men are of themſelves in equal circumſtances in order to eternal happineſſe; 'tis God only that makes the difference, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own determinations, that were eternal and unconditional. Yet I am farre from the minde of thoſe Patrons of Univerſal Grace, that make all men in an equal propinquity to ſalvation, whether Jewes, or Pagans, or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; which is nothing but dight and guilded Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, whileſt it makes grace as extenſive and Catholick, a principle of as full latitude as nature is, and reſolves all the difference into created powers and faculties. This makes the barren places of the world in as good a condition as the Garden of God, as the incloſure of the Church: It puts a Philoſopher in as good an eſtate as an Apoſtle; For if the <hi>remedium ſalutiferum</hi> be equally applied to all by God himſelf, and happineſſe depends only upon mens regulating and compoſing of their faculties; how then comes a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian to be neerer to the Kingdome of Heaven then an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian? is there no advantage by the light of the Goſpel ſhining among men with healing under its wings? Surely, though the free grace of God may poſſibly pick and chooſe an Heathen ſometimes, yet certainly he does there more
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50910:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
frequently pour his goodneſſe into the ſoul where he lets it ſtreame out more clearely and conſpicuouſly in external manifeſtations. 'Tis an evident ſigne that God intends more ſalvation there, where he affords more means of ſalvation; if then God do chooſe and call an Heathen, 'tis not by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but by diſtinguiſhing grace. They make Grace Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that make it as common as Nature. Whereas Nature when 'twas moſt triumphant, ſhining in its Primitive beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and glory, yet even then it could not be happy without Grace. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf beſides his <hi>integritas naturae,</hi> had alſo <hi>adjutorium gratiae,</hi> for as the Schoolmen explain it, though he had <hi>viros idoneas ad praeſtanda omnia naturalia; reipſa ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men nihil praeſtitit ſine auxilio gratiae.</hi> As, if you expect any goodly and delicious cluſters from a Vine, beſides its own internal forme which we'll ſtile Nature, there muſt be alſo <hi>auxilium gratiae,</hi> the Sun muſt favour it and ſhine upon it, the raine muſt nouriſh it, and drop upon it, or elſe Nature will never be pregnant and fruitful. <hi>Adams</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle did not ſhine ſo clearly, but that Grace was fain to ſnuffe it. Nature, though 'twere compleate and entire, yet 'twas faine to ſtrengthen and ſupport it ſelf by its twinings about Grace, and for want of the powerful ſupport and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency of Grace, Nature fell down preſently; it ſtartled from it ſelf, and apoſtatiz'd like a broken bowe. What meane the Pelagians to tell us of a <hi>Naturalis Beatitudo,</hi> when as Nature now is ſurrounded with ſo many frailties and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, ſo many diſorders and imperfections? Yet were it as green and flouriſhing as ever it was when 'twas firſt plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Paradiſe, yet even then 'twould be too remote from happineſſe, for perfect happineſſe excludes and baniſhes all futurity and poſſibility of miſery, which Nature never yet did, nor could do. And happineſſe never flows out till the Sunne look upon it, till it ſee the face of God himſelf, whom Natures eye will ne're be able to behold. Yet Oh! how deſirous is Nature of this? how inquiſitive is humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:50910:114"/>
into the cauſes of things, and eſteems it no ſmal piece of its beatitude if it can finde them out? <hi>Foelix qui potuit rerum cognoſcere cauſas.</hi> What a goodly ſight is it then to behold the firſt cauſe of all being, and its own being? how faine would an intellectual eye behold him that made it! Nature longs to ſee who 'twas that firſt contrived it, and fram'd it, and faſhion'd it; the ſoul would fain ſee its Father of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The Candle would faine ſhine in the preſence of him that lighted it up.</p>
                     <p>Yet Nature cannot ſee the face of God and live. <hi>Ante obi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nemo ſupremáque funera foelix.</hi> The Moraliſts happineſs is dormant in the night-time, for there's no <hi>operatio ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm virtutem</hi> then, nor can the ſoul while 'tis clogg'd with a fraile body, climbe to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Nor can Faith look upon the divine eſſence; 'tis a lovely grace indeed, yet it muſt die in the Mount like <hi>Moſes;</hi> it cannot enter into the Land of promiſe; 'tis <hi>auditui magis ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milis quàm viſioni,</hi> it hears the voice of its God, it does not ſee his face, it enflames the deſire of the ſoul, it does not quench it, for men would faine ſee what they beleeve; the object of Faith is obſcure and at a diſtance, but the face of God is all preſence and brightneſſe. Happineſſe it conſiſts in the nobleſt operation of an intellectual being, whereas in beleeving there is <hi>imperfectiſſima operatio ex parte intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctûs, licèt ſit perfectio ex parte objecti.</hi>
                     </p>

that, for demonſtrations are no beatifical viſions. The damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits can demonſtrate a Deity, and yet they are perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally baniſht from his face: there can be no demonſtration of him <hi>à priore,</hi> for he is the firſt cauſe, and all demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fetcht from ſuch effects as flow from him, they do only ſhew you that he is, they do not open and diſplay the divine eſſence, for they are not <hi>effectus adaequantes virtutem cauſae.</hi> To ſee God in the creatures, 'tis to ſee him veil'd, 'tis to ſee him clouded. The ſoul will not reſt contented with ſuch an imperfect knowledge of its God, it ſees him thus here, and yet that does not huſh and quiet rational deſires, but does increaſe and inlarge them.

                     <p>So that though there be ſtill an infinite diſproportion between God and the creature <hi>in eſſe naturali,</hi> yet there is a fit and juſt proportion between them <hi>in eſſe intelligibili.</hi> Though an eye be enabled to behold the Sun, yet this does not make it all one with the Sun, but it keeps its own nature ſtill as much as it did before.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this viſion a comprehenſive viſion, for a finite being will never be able fully to graſpe an infinite eſſence; 'tis true indeed, it ſees the whole eſſence of God, not a piece of his face only, for all eſſence is indiviſible, eſpecially that moſt ſimple and pure eſſence of God himſelf, but the ſoul does not ſee it ſo clearly, and ſo ſtrongly as God himſelf ſees it; hence degrees of happineſſe ſpring, for the <hi>Lumen Gloriae</hi> being variouſly ſhed amongſt bleſſed ſouls, the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger meaſure they have of that, the brighter ſight have they of the divine eſſence.

more cleerly then the reſt. In this glaſſe of the divine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence glorified ſouls ſee all things elſe that conduce to their happineſſe; as God by ſeeing himſelf the cauſe and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of beings, ſees alſo all effects that come ſtreaming from him; ſo theſe alſo looking upon the Sunne, muſt needs ſee his beams; they ſee the Sunne, and ſee other things by the Sun: they ſee there <hi>omnium rerum genera &amp; ſpecies,</hi> they there behold <hi>virtutes, &amp; ordinem univerſi.</hi> Yet becauſe they do not ſee the eſſence of God clearly and perfectly, (that is, comprehenſively) ſo neither can they ſee all thoſe treaſures of myſterious wiſdome, of unſearchable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, of unlimited power, that lie hid in the very depth of the divine eſſence. <hi>Non vident poſſibilia, nec rationes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, nec ea quae dependent ex pura Dei voluntate,</hi> as the Schoolmen do well determine; yet all that a glorified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſees, it's in one twinkling of its eye, for it ſees all by one ſingle <hi>ſpecies,</hi> by the divine eſſence. It forgets its wrangling <hi>Syllogiſmes,</hi> it leaves its tardy <hi>demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> when it once comes to an intuitive knowledge. <hi>Non movetur de uno intelligibili in aliud, ſed quieſcit in actu u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico,</hi> for the ſtate of happineſſe is a Sabbatical ſtate.

                     <p>Whether this glorious happineſſe be more principally ſituated in an act of the underſtanding, or of the will, I leave the <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts</hi> to diſcuſſe it; only this I will ſay in the behalfe of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that the will cannot enjoy this happineſſe any other wayes, then as 'tis a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal appetite.

As therefore the operations of the will, ſo the happineſſe of the will alſo ſeemes to be ſubordinate to that of the underſtanding. But it is enough for us that an intire ſoul, an whole rational being is united to its

deareſt, faireſt, and ſupreme object in a way of pure intuitive ſpeculation, in a way of ſweeteſt love and fruition. Nor could nature of it ſelf reach this, for an inferiour nature cannot thus unite it ſelf to a ſuperiour, but only by his indulgence raiſing it above it ſelf.</p>

His words now were ſmoother then Oile; but then they ſhould have been very ſwords. You ſee the wiſdome of our Apoſtle, and you ſee the pregnancy of Scripture-ſenſe, which in the ſame ſpeech hath ſeveral aimes, all full of excellent uſe. <hi>Paul</hi> here takes off the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from their ſiding with falſe Apoſtles, and from their over-eſteeming conceit which they had of true ones. And though ſome take the former to be the maine drift, and ſcope of the place: Yet I ſhall rather incline to them that reſt in the latter, as the more proper and genuine meaning of it; having more vicinity with the letter of the Text, and being clearer out of the whole <hi>Series</hi> of the Chapter: For what is <hi>Paul?</hi> and what is <hi>Apollo? Paul did</hi> but <hi>plant,</hi> and <hi>Apollo did</hi> but <hi>water:</hi> 'Twas <hi>God only that gave the increaſe; ſo that he that plants is nothing, nor he that waters; but God that gives the increaſe.</hi> You ſee how the Apoſtle makes it his <gap reason="foreign">

Oh, how beautiful were their feet, that brought the glad tydings of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and yet ſuch muſt not be adored, and deify'd; as if the gods had been come down amongſt them, as ſo many Saviours that had been crucified for them, and into whoſe Name they had been baptized. Now that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did thus glory in them, 'tis ſure, and that in a double reſpect. 1. As being baptized by them; and thus, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollo; is as much as I am baptized by <hi>Paul,</hi> and I by <hi>Apollo;</hi> and this was ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an erroneous conceit amongſt them, that the efficacy of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50910:120"/>
the Ordinance depended upon the worthineſſe of the Miniſter; Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> in the following words tells us for his part, that he baptized very few of them; leſt they ſhould ſay, that he bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into his own name. And I finde in very good Authors, that from this time, the forme of Baptiſme in the Greek Church was altered: For whereas before, 'twas <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, leſt they ſhould ſeem to baptize into their own name. It is not for me to queſtion the wiſdome of the Church, in altering their forme: But this I am ſure, that that which we ſtill keep, is very warrantable; while the Miniſter ſaith, <hi>I baptize thee.</hi> 'Tis clear, not in his own name, while he addes, as they alſo did; <hi>In the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt.</hi> But ſecondly, <hi>I am of</hi> Paul, and <hi>I am of</hi> Apollos; They are words of ſuch as glory'd in the ſeveral gifts, and diverſity of excellencies which they had in preaching the Goſpel, and publiſhing the welcome newes of ſalvation by Chriſt; and thus 'tis, I am <hi>Pauls</hi> diſciple, and I am <hi>Apollos</hi> his. One likes the powerful plainneſſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother the ample plenty, and variety of <hi>Apollos:</hi> A third, the ſolidity, and perſpecuity of <hi>Cephas.</hi> And here we will ſee as well as we can, by thoſe obſcure <hi>veſtigia</hi> which we meet withall, wherein their ſeveral excellencies lay.

Now who would doubt whether a ſparke could be quench't in an Ocean? Thy thoughts of diſobedience towards God have been within the compaſſe of time; but his goodneſſe hath been bubbling up towards thee from all eternity. He hath had ſweet plots of freegrace, and gracious contrivances of love towards thee from everlaſting.

There's none but knows how to wound himſelf; I, but he muſt have skill that knowes how to cure him; 'tis eaſie enough to run into debt, and many finde it hard enough to diſcharge it: There's none but can heap up ſin, and treaſure up wrath, and wound conſcience: I, but who is there that can appeaſe wrath, and calme conſcience, and ſcreen a ſoul from a conſuming fire? Sin is an offence againſt an infinite juſtice, ſo that infinite being can either diſpenſe with it, or ſatisfie for it. It is not the bleſſed Virgins milke can waſh out ſo deep a ſtaine, it is not this can whiten the ſoul; no, if the Saints Robes be waſh't white, it muſt be in the blood of the Lambe.

But this we are ſure, that ſoule's humbled enough that's brought to a ſight and ſenſe of his ſinne, ſo as to ſee the neceſſity of a Saviour; and to prize him, and love him as the faireſt of ten thouſand.

                     <hi>And will not remember thy ſins,]</hi> The ſinful ſoul is full of doubts and ſuſpicions; Certainly ſaith he, if God ſhould let me alone now, he will call me to acount for them hereafter; If he ſeem to blot them out now, he will write them again ſometime or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No ſaith God, <hi>I'le blot out thy tranſgreſſions, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi> 'Tis an ordinary ſpeech in the mouth of ſome ſilly ones, they will forgive, but never forget, it had need have a very candid conſtruction, a grain of ſalt is ſcarce enough to make it ſavory; but God never forgives, but he doth forget too; when he blots out iniquities, he remembers them no more. When the ſins are laid upon the head of the ſcape-goat, they are then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into a land of forgetfulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe you recall the uſual rule; <hi>Verba Memoriae denotant affectum, &amp; effectum:</hi> He will not remember them ſo as to call thee to account for them, ſo as to upbraid thee with them, ſo as any way to puniſh thee for them.</p>
                  <p>Guilt and puniſhmeat are correlates, ſuch Twinnes as live and dye together, when the one's remitted, the other's never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Twere injuſtice to puniſh where there is no fault. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed may out of his abſolute dominion and ſovereignty, inflict an evill upon an innocent creature, but then it falls not under the formal notion of a puniſhment; and doth inflict evils upon his own people, which flow from a fatherly caſtigation, and not from a judicial proceeding.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis againſt the very nature of remiſſion. Do you call that forgiving of a debt, to caſt a man into priſon for not diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it? or is that pardoning of a Traitour, to behead him for his treaſon?</p>

And though God remember them no more; yet there's good reaſon that the ſoul ſhould ſtill remember them, (Firſt) to make it more thankful to him that he blotted them out.

                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> And thus we have took a brief ſurvey of the Text; wee'l now ſtrain the quinteſſence of all into one obſervation. <hi>Juſtifying grace, is free grace;</hi> He blots out iniquities for his own ſake: Every juſtifi'd perſon is a monument of free grace, or in the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> language; he's crown'd with loving kindneſſe and tender mercies.</p>
                  <p>The grace of God is free grace; and that</p>
                  <p>Firſt, If you look to the <hi>Spring</hi> from whence it flowes: That Originall goodneſſe, that fountain-mercy in Election, when he ſingl'd out a peculiar people to himſelf; there were beamings out of his love, and bloſſomings of his grace towards thee from everlaſting; He was plotting and ſtudying thy happineſſe, long before thou hadſt any being.

Now what was there that God ſhould ſmile on <hi>Jacob,</hi> and frowne on <hi>Eſau</hi> from all eternity? What was there in thee to perſwade him to all this? What were the motives?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50910:136"/>
Where were the arguments? What was the Rhetorick?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was long before thou hadſt any being, thou wert hid in the barren wombe of nothing; thou hadſt no deſire, no thought of happineſſe, and I can't well underſtand the merite of a <hi>non-entity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God might have had great revenues of glory out of thy eternall ruine; now that he ſhould chooſe to glorifie the riches of his mercy in thy happineſſe and ſalvation, was moſt free grace. Two books were before him, he might have writ thy name in his black book, with fatall and bloudy characters, and made his juſtice glorious in thy miſerie and damnation; I, but he took the book of life, and with the point of a Diamond writ thy name there, thus to make his love wonderful in thy ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider how few God then choſe unto himſelf. Out of thoſe many worlds which he might have made, out of that which he did make; he pickt out a few here and there, they all make up but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, it lyes drench't and drown'd in wickedneſſe. How comes it now that thou doſt not go with the generality; but art one of the little number, is not this free grace? God hath riches of grace for many more, and yet he would ſpend it all upon a few; he would contract and concentricate his love in them, <hi>Et quantò pauciores filios habet, tantò cariores.</hi> 'Tis S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon, that he might make known the riches of glory upon the veſſels of honour; this was the very end, that they might admire his goodneſſe the more, and tell ſtories of free grace to all eternity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Don't think that this was out of any previſion of worth and excellencie in thee more then in another. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This makes the prime wheeling cauſe wholly dependent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inferior movers. The great Creator of Heaven and Earth, muſt wait upon mans <hi>liberum arbitrium;</hi> if the creature pleaſe to determine thus or thus, then he muſt copy out his decree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſpeak as if they had never ſeen the nineth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> What was it that prevail'd with the Potter, to make one veſſell to honour, and the other to diſhonour? Was it becauſe this was the more refined Earth, and ſo fitter for a veſſell of Honour? No ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul,</hi> of the very <hi>ſame lumpe, he made
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50910:136"/>
one a veſſel to honour, and the other to diſhonour.</hi> And <hi>God lov'd</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau, <hi>before they had done either good or evil;</hi> Now if <hi>Jacob</hi> would certainly have done good of his own accord, 'twas all one as if 'twere done already in reſpect of Eternity, all things being equally preſent to that.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This takes away all method, and order of proſecution, for the end is alwayes in intention before the means. God firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves to ſave <hi>Jacob,</hi> and then provides means accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It quite demoliſheth the goodly and faire ſtructure of grace; no diſcriminating grace, 'tis no longer <hi>for his own ſake,</hi> but <hi>for your ſakes</hi> now. A man now makes himſelf to differ, free will muſt be ſet on the throne, 'tis a <hi>Roman</hi> and muſt not be bound; and free grace muſt lye at the footſtool<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on as they pleaſe. But all they that know what grace is, and have had any gracious impreſſions upon their own ſpirits, will eaſily tell you who 'twas that made them differ, even he who choſe them; not becauſe they were any better then others, but he choſe them, and ſo would be ſure to make them better; and if they be lovely, it is with the comlineſſe which he hath put upon them. Grace is free if you look to the fountaine of it, the primitive goodneſſe of God in election, bubling out from all Eternity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you look to the ſeverall <hi>ſtreamings</hi> out of the fountaine, you muſt admire the riches of free grace: For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Gods giving of his only Sonne, and founding and eternal Covenant of love and peace in him; the richeſt and preciouſeſt ſtream that ever flow'd to the ſons of men. Now if there were an aſſembly of thoſe bright and intelligent creatures gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the moſt glorious Cherubims and glittering Seraphims, and if this myſtery which they now pry into, were fully unſeal'd, and explain'd unto them; O how would they ſtand gazing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the riches of free grace, how would they think eternity it ſelf too ſhort for the admiring of it; and what could they reſolve it into but meere love. <hi>God ſo lov'd the world,</hi> ſo freely, ſo fully, ſo unconceiveably, <hi>that he gave his only Sonne,</hi> &amp;c. What was there in thee to draw a Saviour down from heaven? was there ſuch an attractive and magnetical vertue in an undone and bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted creature? How didſt thou perſwade him to diſrobe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50910:137"/>
of light, as of a garment, to cloud and eclipſe the luſtre of his Divinity, by the interpoſition of a pale mortall body! What was it that mov'd him to take upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not the nature of Angels, to let paſſe thoſe faire and eminent beings, and to advance a poor crauling worme! Out of what Topicks didſt thou fetch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that prevail'd with him, to eſpouſe thee to himſelf in mercy and truth, and ſo to love thee as to dye for thee? I know they thoughts are ſwallowed up with the conſideration of ſo boundleſſe and bottomleſſe a love, and deſire ſome time for aſtoniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What ſhould I tell you of thoſe free expreſſions and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations of this his love; thoſe freſh eruptions and ebullitions of it in the Goſpel? I mean thoſe precious promiſes, that are ſo many ſeveral ſproutings and branchings out of the Covenant. The Goſpel's like a ſweet and precious honey-combe, theſe are the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall droppings of it, that flow freely from it. Indeed the whole Goſpel like the midſt of <hi>Solomons</hi> bed in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> is pav'd with love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Think upon thoſe free offers of grace, and tenders of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; how he woes you to receive mercy, how he beſeeches you to be happy, how he intreats you to be ſav'd, to accept of him and of heaven, of grace and of glory. So that if you looke to the ſtreamings out of the fountaine; you ſee they all carry with them the riches of grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider the ſeverall <hi>conveighances</hi> of it; how God diffuſes this his goodneſſe to thy ſoul; and thou ſhalt ſee how thou haſt liv'd upon the expences of free grace all thy dayes. And for this, obſerve how he tun'd all circumſtances in a ſweet and harmonious way, ſo as they did all ſweetly agree and conſort in thy happineſſe; and how all providentiall paſſages did joyn for thee, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>work together</hi> for thy good: As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. 'Twas out of the riches of free grace, that he planted thee in a place of light, when he ſhut up and impriſon'd the reſt of the world in palpable darkneſſe. The Goſpel ſhines out but upon a little ſpot of ground which God hath enclos'd for himſelf, and ſtiles it his Garden. <hi>Paul</hi> plants it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Apollos</hi> waters it, and he himſelf gives it an increaſe: The reſt of the world lyes like a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50910:137"/>
barren and deſolate wilderneſſe, the word of the Goſpel never dropt upon it; nothing but briers and thornes fit for the fire. Now, how fell thy lot in ſo faire a ground; and who is it that gives thee ſo goodly an heritage? Who is it that ſhines thus upon thy Tabernacle, and fixes it in a land that flowes with milke and honey? Give a reaſon if thou canſt, why thou wert not plac't in ſome obſcure corner of <hi>America,</hi> and left only to the weak and glimmering light of nature? Prethee, tell me who that was that open'd for thee ſo many wells of ſalvation, and feaſted thee with all thoſe ſpirituall dainties and delicacies that are diſht out in variety of Ordinances? I would fain know who that was that cruſh't the honey-combe on purpoſe, that it might drop upon thy ſoul? Prethee, tell me, if thou can'ſt, who that was that beſpoke a place for thee in the Church, among the aſſembly of the Saints? Hath God dealt ſo with every Nation, or have the Heathen knowledge of this Law? Aſcribe this then to free grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That ſalvation ſhould wait upon thee ſo long, and when thou hadſt repuls't ſo many rich offers of grace and mercie; that ſtill it ſhould be importunate with thee: If mercy had knock't once or twice, nay according to the rule, <hi>Si ter pulſanti,</hi> &amp;c.; if it had then bid thy ſoul farewell, thou hadſt dropt into hell ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably. How many years hath free grace ſtood at the door, and begg'd for ſome admiſſion, and thou haſt not ſo much as bid it welcome? Free grace followes thee and purſues thee, and will not let thee go till thou haſt a bleſſing. Would any friend have given thee ſo many invitations after thou haſt rejected them? Are there not many of the damned that muſt lye roaring there to all eternity, that never taſted of ſo much goodneſſe, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferance as thou haſt done? O, why wert not thou ſent thither amongſt the reſt? that that Spirit which thou haſt ſo much griev'd, and ſo often vext, ſhould ſtill breath upon thee, and follow thee with ſecret whiſperings, and gentle ſolicitations to entice and allure thee to goodneſſe; what canſt thou call this but free grace?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider in what ſtate thou wert all the while; and Enemy, a Rebell, ſtudying how to be damn'd; galloping to hell and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction with full careere, a ſcholars pace: who was't now that ſtopt thee in thy courſe? who bridl'd in the proud
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50910:138"/>
waves and ſaid, <hi>Hither ye ſhall go, and no further? Saul</hi> when he is breathing out of ſlaughters, and making havock of the Church, even then he becomes a <hi>Paul.</hi> When the ſoul is even ripe for judgement, then mercy ſhines out upon it. And that which would ſeeme the moſt reaſonable time for vengeance, is made a bleſſed opportunity of ſhewing mercy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider the efficacious and overpowering work of grace; he muſt force thee to be happy, and neceſſitate thee to ſalvation, and compell thee to come in. It is not enough to provide the meanes, but he muſt ſtrongly apply them; unleſſe the arme of the Lord be reveal'd, there's none will beleeve our report. It may be thou cam'ſt occaſionally to hear a Sermon; well, God hath the two-edged ſword in his own hand; he brandiſh't the glittering ſword, he fought againſt thee, he wounded thee, and frighted thee out of thy ſinnes. Well, thou wenteſt away with groans, and ſighes, and teares; like a Hart ſtuck with an arrow, panting and breathing, and faine would'ſt have ſome refreſhment; Ere long, he met with a faithful Meſſenger, and ſent thee ſome balme from <hi>Gilead;</hi> he began to let in ſome of his love to thy ſoul, and to cheere thee with Goſpel-cordials; and were not they all bought with the riches of free grace? Or it may be, thou cam'ſt into a Church with a minde, to ſmile at Religion, to laugh at Goodneſſe, to mock at Piety; or elſe to gueſſe the beſt, thou cam'ſt for flowers and not for fruit, to crop an Elegancy, to take acquaintance of a Notion, or a fine expreſſion; <hi>as he</hi> once to hear an eloquent <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> Thou cam'ſt for a bait, but met'ſt with an hook, and 'twas happy for thee that thou wert ſo caught; Thou thought'ſt only to ſee the flouriſhing of the ſword, but thou felt'ſt the edge of it, and 'twas well for thee that thou wert ſo wounded.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Remember the manner how he thus wrought upon thee; it may be 'twas with ſofter and gentler impreſſions, in a winning, in a melting way; he drew thee with the cords of a man, and ſweetly diſſolv'd thy ſtony heart. 'Tis true, the Law had its work, and ſtrook thee with the flaming edge of a curſe, but the Goſpel preſently brought oile and powr'd it into the wounded ſpirit. The love of Chriſt was the powerful <hi>Suada;</hi> Heavens Rhetorick; there was <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his double Deity in it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50910:138"/>
it conſtrain'd thee to obedience: And was it not mercy to be dealt withal in ſo milde a way? Well, but what if thou wert a more knotty and obdurate piece, and 'twas not a little matter would tame thy unruly ſpirit? God came in a more victorious and triumphant manner, and led captivity captive, when he gave gifts unto thy ſoul: He was fain to batter down ſtrong holds, and bring to the ground towering imaginations. Thou had'ſt a rocky and flinty ſpirit, and was not his word an hammer? did not he take it into his own hand? he ſmote the ſtony rock indeed, ſo as the waters guſhed out: Well, and had he no bowels all the while? was it not abundance of mercy to take pains with ſuch an obſtinate ſinner? Referre it you to what you will, we'le put it under the head of free grace.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Think upon thoſe mountains of oppoſition that were beaten down, when this goodly fabrick of the Temple went up with the ſhoutings and acclamations of free grace. The ſtrong man was diſpoſſeſt, all the plots and ſtratagems of Satan were fruſtrated. God cruſh't his deſignes, and blaſted his enterpriſes, and broke his ſnares, and reſcu'd thee out of the paw of the Lion. 'Twas much love and grace to ſet a ſilly bird out of the ſnare, to ranſome a poor captive, to break the chaine, and beat off the irons, to diſentangle a ſoul, and ſet it at liberty. And then he arm'd thee againſt the diſgraces and frownes of the world, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd thee againſt the ſmiles and blandiſhments of the world, and carried thee againſt the potent ſtream of examples, which all ran another way; free grace hid thy ſoul under the ſhadow of its wings.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Haſt thou not freſh ſupplies of free grace flowing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon thy ſoul, and maintaining it to all eternity? If God in this new creation had given thee, as he did at the firſt, a ſtock of grace, and left it to thine own improvement, thou would'ſt have ſpent it immediately; Thou haſt ſomewhat of free grace, every moment of thy ſpiritual being. God feeds and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the <hi>humidum radicale</hi> of the ſoul, or elſe 'twould quickly waſte away. He ſends thee in rich influences and Auxiliary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and keeps thee by his mighty power through faith unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And this is no ſmall work of grace; <hi>Conſervatio,</hi> you know, <hi>'tis continuata creatio.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. Compare thy ſelf with thoſe that have had none of all this

                  <p n="1">1. Many of them are ſuch as have improv'd their preſent ſtrength far better. Many Heathens have liv'd more accurately and exactly then ſome Chriſtians in their unregenerate condition, and yet one out of all ordinary poſſibility of ſalvation, and the others ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciouſly called. He may do with his own what he will, and he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy. Thus Publicans are before Phariſees and ſwelling Juſtitiaries; that free grace may be more apparent and conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some have deſired more ſtrength, and in their way pray'd for it too, and it may be have had the prayers of others too, and yet have gone without it; but thou haſt not call'd upon me, O <hi>Jacob; I was found of thee, when thou ſought'ſt me not.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. He paſt by men of moſt admirable endowments, moſt rare accompliſhments; that in all probability would have done him a great deal more honourable ſervice, then thou art like to do. Would not an <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> have made a glorious convert, and fill'd the world as full of Divinity as he did of Philoſophy? but God paſſeth by theſe ſtately Cedars of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and chooſeth a few contemptible Shrubs, and this is the good will of him that dwelt in the buſh; he hath choſen the <gap reason="foreign">

himſelf. It doth not become the mouth of any Creature to ask the heart to it ſelf. But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks it in the name of Wiſdome, and ſo in the name of God himſelf, the eternal fountain of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It is he that calls unto the ſons of men, and bids them to give him their hearts.</p>
                  <p>And though I know that the Hebrew <hi>Idiom</hi> ſometimes by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the heart, doth imply no more, then the ſerious conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and pondering of a thing, the laying it to heart, as we uſe to ſpeak; yet I ſhall take the words here in a fuller ſenſe, as the heart in a ſpecial manner is due unto God.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. For the Relation, My Sonne. Five things are very conſiderable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſpeaks here to a <hi>Son,</hi> and to not a <hi>Stranger.</hi> No wonder that Strangers give not the heart unto God; no wonder that a Pagan gives not the heart unto God. Such as are aliens from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Strangers to the Covenant of grace. Such as are at a great diſtance from him; nay, that live without God in the World; ſuch as lye like the dry heath, and the barren wilderneſſe, the word of the Kingdome never dropt upon them: but thou art a <hi>Sonne</hi> in neer relation to him; He reveales his minde to thee; he manifeſts, and diſplayes himſelf to thee; he makes his goodneſſe paſſe before thee. Thou haſt the continual droppings of the word upon thee; his Prophets are ſent to thee earely, and late; thou haſt the happy Sun-ſhine of his preſence with thee, enough to warme, and ſoften a ſtony heart; and out of ſuch ſtones to raiſe up children unto <hi>Abraham.</hi> Though an <hi>Indian,</hi> though an <hi>American</hi> do not give the heart unto God; yet a Chriſtian ſhould. Though a Stranger do not give him the heart; yet a <hi>Son</hi> ſhould.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>Son,</hi> and not an <hi>Enemy.</hi> God doth not expect the hearts of Enemies; ſuch as are in open hoſtility, and oppoſition againſt him; ſuch as are ſaid to be <hi>haters of him, and hated by him;</hi> ſuch as bid him <hi>depart from them, for they not deſire the knowledge of his wayes:</hi> he doth not look for the hearts of theſe. He doth indeed many times turne the heart of an Enemie, meet the heart
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50910:141"/>
of a <hi>Saul,</hi> while he is breathing out ſlaughters againſt the Church: but whil'ſt he is in a ſtate of enmity, he doth not look for the heart from them. Nay, if an Enemy could give the heart unto God, it would not be accepted by him. He will not accept of a Traitors heart. But thou art reconciled to him, ſo far from being an Enemy, as that thou art a <hi>Son.</hi> Thow haſt all expreſſions of love from him: and thine heart it is expected by him, and it will be accepted of him. Though an Enemy do not give the heart unto God; yet a <hi>Son</hi> ſhould.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A <hi>Sonne,</hi> and not a <hi>Slave.</hi> A Slave doth a great deal of work, and drudgery, more work then a <hi>Sonne;</hi> but he doth not give the heart all the while. He workes out of fear, he looks upon it as a task, as a burden; he watches an opportunity for ſhaking off the yoke. But now Religion doth not come thus to enſlave men, but to enlarge them, to ennoble them; it comes to beat off the chaines, and fetters, to beat open the Priſon doors; it brings a perpetual Jubilee, a perpetual Triumph along with it. Religion it floweth out of filial principles: <hi>My Son,</hi> hear my words; and <hi>My Sonne,</hi> give me thine heart. If the <hi>Son</hi> make you free, why then you are free indeed; and if you be free like <hi>Sons,</hi> why then you are free indeed. The Goſpel brings with it a filial Liberty, a filial Plerophory; an Evangelical yoke is a ſoft, and pleaſant yoke; a Saviours burden is <hi>onus alarum,</hi> it do's no more load the ſoul, then wings do a bird, which advance and promote its flight toward heaven. In Sinne there is nothing but ſlavery; in Religion there is perfect Liberty. Though a Slave do not give the heart unto God; yet a <hi>Son</hi> ſhould.</p>

Adopted Sons, were not alwayes Sons; now the Sons of God, are ſons by Adoption. And let it ſuffice you (ſaith the Apoſtle) that in thoſe former times of your ignorance, of your folly, and vanity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that then you gave your hearts unto other objects; but now that you are come into a ſtate of Son-ſhip, now that ye have this great, and honourable Goſpel-priviledge, to be called a Son of God; now withdraw your hearts from former objects. Let them not be beſtowed upon former vanities, do not embaſe them ſo much; fix them only upon your God. Though once thou didſt not give thy

                  <p n="5">5. A <hi>Sonne;</hi> and ſo in way of mutual affection, thou art to give the heart unto him.

And if God have not the hearts of Sons where ſhall he have any hearts to praiſe him? Who will admire him, and adore him, if his Sons will not? And then he hath given thee his only Son, he hath given thee a Saviour, that hath given his heart to thee, that hath given his life for thee, that had his heart pierc't through for thy ſake; and is there no attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive power in all this? That is the fifth thing, thou art a <hi>Son,</hi> and ſo in way of gratitude, and mutual affection thou art to give thine heart to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. The Manner of yielding up the heart unto God, which is here expreſt by way of giving; which includes ſeveral things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Give it <hi>Cheerfully. God loves a cheerful giver.</hi> Religion ſhould be full of alacrity; it doth not come to extort the heart, to hale men to obedience, but to lead them by a ſweet, and eaſie manuduction; it doth not <hi>rapere Cor,</hi> but <hi>allicere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> It doth not ſtorme the Caſtle, but hath it fairely yielded up upon termes of agreement. That efficacious work of grace in converſion, doth indeed overpower the hearts of men; but it is by making them willing, not by drawing them whil'ſt they are unwilling; but it takes away that Nolence, and reluctancy that is in the hearts of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50910:142"/>
men, and thus compells them to come in. What freer then a Gift? Now the heart it is to be given unto God. The Will hath never more freedome, then when it moves towards God. And thoſe heavenly duties, and ſpiritual performances are to flow freely from the ſoul, like thoſe voluntary drops, that come ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Honey-comb of its own accord, without any preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, without any cruſhing at all. It is only the dregs of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that comes forth with ſqueezing, and wringing. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing is, the more freely doth it diffuſe it ſelf. There ſhould be no need now of binding the ſacrifice with cords unto the Altar, unleſſe it be with the cords of love; thoſe ſoft and ſilken knots of affection. Cheerfulneſſe puts a gloſſe, and luſtre upon Religion, and makes it amiable, even in the eyes of the world. And truely I cannot tell how any one can give the heart to God, unleſſe he ſerve him with alacrity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Give it <hi>preſently.</hi> You know, <hi>Bis dat, qui citò dat.</hi> Give it him now, he calls for it; it muſt be <hi>donum hodiernum.</hi> Now that it is called <hi>to day, harden not your hearts.</hi> Give him a tender hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O how pleaſant is it to ſee a Virgin-light, a Morning-light of education ſhining out upon the ſoul, and in ſome meaſure preparing, and prediſpoſing the heart for the wayes of God. O this is an happy prejudice, an earely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion of the ſoul. And this is that which the wiſe Man here intends, when he ſpeaks to a Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to one of tender age. And do but conſider it; can you give your heart unto God too ſoon? Why ſhould'ſt thou deferre thine own welfare? or is it comely then to offer thine heart unto God, when thou can'ſt give it to none elſe? <hi>Da <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Give it,</hi> do <hi>not lend it only.</hi> In giving there is an alteration of the propriety, which is not in lending. When thou haſt given thine heart unto God, thou art no longer thine own then. There are ſome that will <hi>lend</hi> their hearts unto God, upon ſome ſpecial occaſions, for an houre at a Sermon, for a little while in prayer;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50910:142"/>
lend it him upon a Lords day, upon a day of Humiliation, and then call for the heart again, and beſtow it upon their luſts. But ſo great a Majeſty will not borrow of Creatures; he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive hearts, unleſſe they be wholly given to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Give it,</hi> do <hi>not ſell it.</hi> 'Tis very ſordid, and odious to be hirelings in Religion. They ſell their hearts unto God, that ſerve him only for by-ends, and ſelf-reſpects. This is <hi>Donum Hamatum,</hi> a gift with an hook in it; they give ſomewhat, that they may catch more. They ſell their hearts unto God for ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ends. Hence it is, that the Church hath ſo many friends in proſperous dayes. There are many that ſell their hearts unto God. You know in the Goſpel, there were ſome that followed Chriſt for the Loaves, and not for the Miracles. There are ſome that love the Additionals in Religion, more then the Principals. Succeſſe, and Victories are the only Arguments to convince ſome of the rightneſſe of a Cauſe. Eſteeme of men, worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and accommodations; theſe make many men take a little tincture of Religion, who otherwiſe would not have ſo much as a ſhew of it. Whereas Religion ſhould be loved for her beauty, and not for her dowry. God ſhould be loved for thoſe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and tranſcendencies that are in himſelf; for thoſe treaſures of goodneſſe, and wiſdome, that are ſtored up in his own glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eſſence. Thou ſhould'ſt love him, though he did not love thee again. Why ſhould'ſt not thou love a thing truly amiable, though thou haſt no benefit by it? For thy happineſſe is but an inferiour, and ſecondary thing, and is not to have ſo much of thine heart as he is to have. Thou art only to love thy ſelf, as thou art ſomewhat of him; thou art to love Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him; thou art to love the Goſpel, as the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his love, and all the promiſes of the right hand, and the left, as the various manifeſtations of his goodneſſe. Thou art firſt to give thine heart unto thy God, and then to other things in ſuch meaſure, and proportion as they are ſubordinate to him.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Give</hi> thine heart, do <hi>not keep it to thy ſelf.</hi> Would'ſt thou be truſted with thine own heart? Would'ſt thou be left to thine own deceitfull ſpirit?

Can'ſt thou lay up thy Jewel in a ſafer Cabinet? Let him keep thine heart by his mighty power through faith unto falvation,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Give it.</hi> God is pleaſed to call that a Gift, <hi>which is indeed a Debt:</hi> All thy <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and thy <hi>Poſſe</hi> and thy <hi>Poſſidere</hi> is due to him, yet that thy heart may come in a way of freeneſſe, and that he may ſhew thee, how it is accepted by him; he calls it a Gift, ſuch a gift as do's enrich the Giver, not the Receiver. It is an honour to thee, 'tis no benefit to him; His glory doth not ſhine with borrowed beams: 'Tis neither in the power of a Creature to ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipſe the brightneſſe of his Crown, nor to adde one ſparke to it. If thou doeſt ill, what hurt hath he by it? or if thou doſt well, what good flowes unto him? any otherwiſe then as he hath joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own glory, and the welfare of his People together. Thy goodneſſe may profit thy ſelf, and it may extend to men like thy ſelf, but it can make no additions to that which is already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Thy heart is due to him, and 'tis thine honour that thou mayſt give it him.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. To whom the heart muſt be given.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not to any created being. No creature can be a centre for the heart to fix in. The heart was not made for any creature, nor proportioned to it. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine heart upon that which is not?</hi> Wilt thou give thine heart to vanity, and vexation? Wilt thou ſet thine heart upon that which hath wings, and can flye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way when it liſteth? Riches have wings; honours, and pleaſures have wings, all creature-comforts have wings, and can flye away when they pleaſe. And therefore</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Give not thine heart to the world. Give it not to the ſmiles, and blandiſhments of the world: Let it not be broken with the frownes, and injuries of the world: <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for I have overcome the world.</hi> And be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>careful for the things of the world; <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Give it not to Satan. The Devil that old Serpent would faine be winding, and inſinuating into hearts; he ſeeks them, and deſires, and would faine by any means obtain them; and we ſee how many give their hearts unto him. But what, wilt thou give thy Darling to the Lion? Wilt thou give thy Turtle as a prey to the Devourer? wilt thou give thine heart to the Deſtroyer?</p>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:50910:143"/>
4. Give it not to Sin, to Luſt. Give it not to a <hi>Dalilah.</hi> To give it to ſin, is to give it to a Privation, to a Non-entity. Give not thine heart to that which will weaken it; to that, that will defile it; to that, that will wound it; to that, that will ſting, and diſquiet it. O! keep it calme, and ſerene; keep it pure, and unſpotted; keep it in its proper freedome, and enlargement.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. We come to conſider the gift it ſelf, what it is that is to be given unto God: The heart,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Not</hi> thine <hi>outward man only,</hi> not thy body only. God dwells not ſo much in theſe Temples made with hands, as in bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and contrite Spirits. For he himſelf is a Spirit, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Spirits, and he will be ſerved in Spirit, and Truth. He do's not ask for a ſhell, but for a kernel: He do's not ask for a Casket, but for a Jewel. Give him the kernel, give him the Jewel, give him thine heart. No queſtion, but the body alſo is to be preſented to him, but it is no otherwiſe accepted of him, then as it is animated, and enlivened by an obedient heart. For how elſe can it be <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, as the Apoſtle there calls it. Give me thine heart, (1.) Not thine eare onely. Though it be very commendable to encline an eare unto Wiſdome, and to receive the gracious words that flow from its mouth; yet the eare is only to be a gate, and entrance to let it into the heart, and <hi>to hear</hi> in Scripture-Language is to obey. The word of God muſt not hang like a Jewel only in the eare, but it muſt be cabinetted, and lockt up in the heart as its ſafeſt repoſitory. (2) Not thy tongue only. Religion is not only to warme thy mouth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but 'tis to melt the heart; it do's indeed ſeaſon the diſcourſe, ſo as ſavoury words come out of ſuch a mouth. It do's ſet a watch before the lips, and bridle that ſame unruly evil; but can you think that it reacheth no farther then thus? Can you think that Religion dwells here? Is it only a Lip-labour, only a matter of diſcourſe? Nay, are there not many that draw near unto God with their lips, and yet their hearts are far from him? (3.) Not thine head only. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion 'tis not a meere notion, it doth not conſiſt only in ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. You ſee many times that men of the vaſteſt Intellectuals, are moſt defective in Practicals. Who of the heads of the world beleeved in Chriſt? Who of the Scribes and Phariſees beleeved in him? There may be precious pearly truth's in a venomous head. And indeed the head can never be given unto God, till the heart be given him alſo.</p>

2. <hi>The heart: not appearances not only:</hi> Not a ſurface, not a colour, not a ſhadow only; but a Reality. God is a pure Act, pure Entity, and Reality; and therefore Appearances, that do meerely pretend to entity, muſt needs be very remote from him. And this is the weakneſſe of Superſtition, it gives him only a complement, a ceremouy. They tell him, they are his ſervants. What more ordinary complement in the mouthes of men? they give him outward adoration; they bow the knee to Chriſt, and ſo did they that crucified him: What do you do more then they? And this is the vanity of Popery, it do's not give God the heart. That ſpiritual <hi>Jezabel</hi> gives him only a painted face, ſhe do's not give him the heart. She is clothed in Scarlet; but ſhe embraces a Dunghill. She puts on an outward meretricious bravery; but within there is nothing but rottenneſſe. But the Spouſe of Chriſt is all glorious within. When the ſhadowes are multiplied, God called for the heart then in the times of the Law; much more now in the times of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The heart, the whole heart.</hi> Not a piece of it, not a corner of it only. The true Mother would not have the Child divided. God indeed loves a broken, and a Contrite heart; but he won't accept of a divided heart. This is that Royall Law, the great commandment: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart:</hi>
                     <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Devil obſerves the other rule: <hi>Divide, &amp; impera:</hi> He would ſeem to be very moderate, to be content with a piece of the heart only; but 'tis becauſe he knowes by this means he ſhall have all. For God won't have any of it unleſſe he have it entire. And this is one great happineſſe, that comes by Religion; the heart is thus united, and fixt upon one ſupreme object. Luſts, they do divide the heart, and diſtract it:—<hi>duplici in diverſum ſcinderis hamo</hi> (as the <hi>Satyriſt</hi> ſpeaks very elegantly). The ſoul do's as it were, bite at two baits at once, and is caught with two ſeveral hooks; this pulls that way, and that pulls another way. Pride calls for this thing; but Covetouſneſſe forbids it: which muſt needs breed a great confuſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tumultuation in the ſoul. But when the heart is given unto God, and yields to his Scepter,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50910:144"/>
then other Lords ſhall no longer rule over it. When a Saviour comes into the ſoul, the windes, and theſtormes, and the waves obey him.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. He askes it of thee. He knocks at the door, he wooes thine heart, and invites it to himſelf; and what is the whole minde of the Goſpel, but to draw hearts unto God with all Arguments of love?</p>

As the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>He having given thee his Son; how ſhall he not with him give thee all things alſo?</hi> This is the ſpring of motion, that ſets the wheeles on working. When this Royal Fort is taken, all the reſt will be yielded up preſently. When the <hi>Heart ondites a good matter,</hi> then the <hi>Tongue will be like the Pen of a ready Writer;</hi> then thy <hi>Glory will awake,</hi> thy Tongue will praiſe his Name, and encourage others in his wayes; then thy bowels will be enlarged, and thy hands open to the neceſſitie of the Saints; then there will be a Covenant made with the eyes, and a watch ſet before the door of thy lips; then thy feet will run to the place where his honour dwelleth; and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the body will become inſtruments of Righteouſneſſe unto Holineſſe. Which ſhewes the vanity of thoſe ignorant ones, who thank God, though they cannot expreſſe themſelves, yet their hearts are as good as the beſt; though there be not one

beam of light in, nor one ſpark of love in them; whereas a good heart never wanted for ſome real expreſſion. He in the <hi>Comaedian</hi> was very deſervedly laught at; who would ſeem to be angry, but could expreſſe it no otherwiſe, then by ſaying <hi>Iraſcor;</hi> whereas true anger would ſoon have ſhewne it ſelf in its proper colours<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in its ſudden, and extemporary ſparklings, in its vehement, and furious flamings. They that can ſhew a good heart no otherwiſe then by ſaying they have a good one; they do even deſire us not to believe them</p>
                  <p>They that offered up ſacrifices were wont to judge of them moſt according to the inwards, and God doth thus judge of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The leaſt performances, if the heart accompany them, are accepted by him. That <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch was famous for accepting a little water from the hand of a loving Subject: And doth not Chriſt accept of the ſame? <hi>He that ſhall give a cup of cold water to a Diſciple, in the name of a Diſciple, ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> What though thou canſt not bring ſuch coſtly ſacrifices, thou canſt not offer up Hecatombs? Well then, bring thy Turtle-Doves, and young Pigeons; and theſe ſhall be accepted by him. Thou haſt no Gold, nor Jewels; thou canſt not bring any Silk, and Purple to the Tabernacle: yet bring thy Goats haire, and Bad gers skins, and theſe ſhall be welcome to him. Thou canſt not bring Cedars to the Temple, thou canſt not poliſh, and carve, and guild the Temple; Well, but canſt thou be any way ſerviceable to it? even that ſhall be rewarded by him. A few broken ſighs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they ariſe from a broken heart, are very potent, and Rhetorical. A few teares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they flow from this fountain, are preſently botled up; he puts your teares in his Bottle.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God accepts of your intentions, if they flow from a pure heart, though they be blaſted in the bud, though they be cruſht <hi>in Ovo,</hi> though they never come to the birth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>
                        <l>In magnis voluiſſe ſat eſt.—</l>

It was in <hi>Davids</hi> heart to build a Temple, that's enough. The Schoolmen do very well determine, that <hi>Tota bonitas moralis, &amp; malitia eſt in Voluntate.</hi> God judgeth of the ſouls complexion by thoſe inward productions, though men judge only by outward expreſſions. That two-edged ſword of God doth thus pierce to the marrow, to the very intentions of the heart. The Law of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50910:146"/>
God it reacheth intentions, as our Saviour in thoſe heavenly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of his upon the Mount doth Spiritualize it, and parapbraſe upon it. And God doth in eſpecial manner puniſh naked inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe men cannot puniſh them. The venome of the ſeed of the Serpent doth moſt ſhew it ſelf in intentions. God reſtrains the outward acts for his people ſake. But the ſtrength of ſin is moſt vigorous in its firſt eruptions, and ebullitions, and ſo the ſtrength of goodneſſe too.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When the heart is entire. Though there be obliquities, and irregularities, yet they are paſt by, and not ſo much attended to. No doubt but <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith ſtaggered, when he was put to an equivocation, and we cannot eaſily excuſe <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſupplantings, and <hi>Rebekka's</hi> deceits, and <hi>Rahabs</hi> diſſemblings; and the <hi>piaefraudes</hi> of the Fathers. There was ſo much frailty, and imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in all theſe, as did plainly ſpot, and blemiſh them; and yet the heart being right, God accepts of that, and covers the reſt with his pardoning love.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Hence it is, that God looks not to the outward lump, and heap of performances, but looks to the manner of them, and the Spirit from whence they come. This might ſpare many a Papiſt his beads, which he thinks ſo neceſſary for the numbring of his prayers.</p>
                  <p>The glimmering light of Nature taught the Heathen thus much, that the gods did not expect any benefit from them, but only a grateful acknowledgment. And this is the reaſon they give, why they conſecrated to their gods barren trees, which indeed were green, and flouriſhing, but brought forth no fruit at all, as the <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> to <hi>Apollo,</hi> the <hi>Ivy</hi> to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the <hi>Mirtle</hi> to <hi>Venus,</hi> the <hi>Oake</hi> to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> the <hi>Pine</hi> to <hi>Neptune,</hi> the <hi>Poplur</hi> to <hi>Hercules;</hi> and ſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the reſt. And they will tell you, that the gods did not look for any fruit from their worſhippers, but lookt for homage, and obedience, and thankfulneſſe. And it is that which ingenuity teacheth men, not to look to the quantity, and value of a gift; but to reſpect the affection of him that gives it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Away then with thoſe vaine ones, that think to bribe Heaven with their gifts, and to ſtop the mouth of Juſtice with their performances. All duties and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances they are but to comment, and paraphraſe upon the heart. In prayer God expects a flaming heart; in hearing of the Word, he looks for a melted heart; in faſting, rend your hearts, and not your clothes; in thanſgiving he liſtens to hear whether
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50910:146"/>
ye make melody in your hearts. Religion it doth ſpiritualize per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and doth ſhell them, and take the kernel; it doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the ſpirits, and quiteſſence of them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Hence it is, that without this, the moſt pompous perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are ſcorned, and rejected. A ſacrifice without an heart is an abomination to him. <hi>I hate your burnt-offerings, my ſoul nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeates your ſolemne aſſemblies.</hi> Odi Danaos, &amp; dona ferentes. <hi>Bring me no more vain oblations;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. A corrupt heart, it ſoiles every Ordinance, it ſtains and diſcolours every Duty, it envenoms every mercy. If ſuch a one pray, 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed houling; if he mourne, 'tis hanging down the head like a bul-ruſh; if he ſacrifice, 'tis cutting off a dogs neck; if he rejoyce, 'tis but a blaze, a crackling of thornes under the pot.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In Heaven when outward performances ſhall vaniſh, yet then God ſhall have thine heart, and thou ſhalt have his face; thy well-beloved ſhall be thine, and thou ſhalt be his. When Preaching ſhall ceaſe, and Prayer ſhall ceaſe, when Sacraments ſhall diſappear, yet then thy naked heart ſhall be offered unto God; it ſhall twine about the chiefeſt good, and by a neer, and immediate union ſhall enjoy it for ever.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>The Heart</hi> is to be given unto God, becauſe thou haſt promiſed it him. Remember that Primitive, and Original vow in Baptiſme. God then may take poſſeſſion of the heart, if he pleaſe; for he hath the key of all hearts; he hath the key of an Infants heart, and can open it if he pleaſe. But however there is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement upon thee by this to give him thine heart. And ſure there are few, but ſometime or other, have given him ſeverall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſes of their hearts. Did'ſt thou never offer thine heart unto him in a ſtorme? in a judgement? in a ſickneſſe? Well then, withall remember that God takes no pleaſure in fools, that make vowes, and break them. His promiſes to thee are ſure, why ſhould thine be deceitful?</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Give thine heart unto him, that he may make it better. It may be thou haſt a flinty, and unmalliable heart; give it to him, and he will melt it, and diſſolve it. It may be thou haſt a barren, and unprofitable heart; give it to him, and he will make it fruitful; he will bid it increaſe, and multiply. It may be thou haſt an unquiet, and diſcompoſed heart; give it to him, and he will tune it. It may be thou haſt a narrow, and contracted heart; give it to him, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50910:147"/>
he will enlarge it. It may be thou haſt a droſſy, and corrupt heart; give it to him, and he will purifie, and refine it.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. Give it him, that he may make it happy, that he may fill it with his love, that he may ſatisfie it with himſelf, that he may ſeal it with his Spirit. It hath toiled already ſufficiently, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it ſelf among vanities; it hath gone from flower to flower, and can extract nothing but bitterneſſe; and ſtill Deſire, which is <hi>hiatus cordis</hi> opens it's mouth wide, and cries aloud, Give, give. Go then to the Fountaine, to the Ocean, and there fill thy ſelf. Doſt thou think thou canſt ſuck any ſweetneſſe from the breaſt of a Creature? no, but go to the fulneſſe, and exuberancy of a Deity, and then ſtretch thy deſires to the utmoſt compaſſe, widen thine heart as much as thou canſt, yet there will be enough to make thee run over with happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>That's the firſt thing, why the heart muſt be given to God? We'le conſider in the next place, when the Heart may be ſaid to be given to him?</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) When thou acteſt out of a principle of love toward him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What's love but a giving of the heart? As <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; How canſt thou ſay thou lov-ſt me, when thine heart is not with me.</hi> A lover not only, <hi>quaerit coſtam ſuam,</hi> as the Jewes ſpeak, <hi>ſed quaerit cor ſuum,</hi> for he hath given that to another. And where there is mutuall love, there's a mutual exchange of hearts. God loves himſelf in thee, and thou findeſt thy ſelf in God. His thoughts are for thy well-fare, and thy thoughts are for his glory. In love there is a mixing and blending of beings; 'tis <hi>fibula animarum;</hi> nay, it knits, and weaves ſouls together. <hi>Knit my heart unto thee, O God,</hi> ſayes the Pſalmiſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Then thine heart is given unto God, when thou doſt act out of ſincerity, when thou art an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> without guile. This is Evangelicall perfection: it is that Evangelical allowance, which is put into the ballance of the Sanctuary, ſo as a Chriſtian is not found too light. As for keeping every jot, and <hi>apex</hi> of the Law, let them ſpeak of it, that could ever do it. Thy Saviour hath kept it for thee in the full rigour, and exactneſſe of it, and thoſe ſpots which thou findeſt in thine own heart, thou muſt waſh them out in the blood of the Lamb; thou muſt whiten thine heart in that <hi>Fountaine,</hi> which is <hi>ſet open for the houſe of David, and for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin, and for uncleanneſſe.</hi> If thou beeſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50910:147"/>
and cordial, and faithful with thy God, then thine heart is given to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Then thou doſt give thine heart unto God, when thou doſt fully comply with him in thoſe glorious ends, in thoſe great intereſts, and deſignes which he doth propound to himſelf; when thou doſt ſubmit thy will unto his, and conforme thy deſires unto his; when thou doſt wholly reſigne up thy ſelf unto him, and ſweetly cloſe with his providence, though never ſo myſterious, and unſearchable: when thou doſt pluck out thy right eye for him and cut off thy right hand for him; when thou thinkeſt not thy life too dear for him.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4.) Then thou doſt give thine heart unto God, when thou doſt ſerve him with vigour, and intention. Luke-warme <hi>Laodicea</hi> could not give the heart unto Chriſt. <hi>Epheſus</hi> when ſhe falls from her firſt love, her heart is unbended preſently, performances come dropping from her in a weak, and languiſhing manner. Whereas ſpiritual productions they ſhould be ſtrong, and maſculine, ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ruſhing forth with a ſacred <hi>impetus,</hi> as Gods love comes ſtreaming to thee with an irreſiſtible fulneſſe. Thine heart ſhould boyle up a good matter, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks.

                  <p n="5">(5.) Then thou giveſt thine heart unto God, when thou giveſt it unto the people of God. <hi>In aſmuch as you did it unto one of theſe,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50910:148"/>
you did it unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. There's an union between God and his people; and therefore if thine heart be united to them, it is united to him alſo. And how ſad is it, that thoſe hearts ſhould jarre amongſt themſelves; who yet harmoniouſly meet in the cloſe in the union with their God!</p>
                  <p>And thus we have ſeen why the heart muſt be given unto God, and when it is given to him. We will now ſhut up all in a word of Application.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. See then how powerfull Religion is, it commands the heart; it ſeizeth upon the vitals. Morality that comes with a pruning knife, and cuts off all ſproutings, and wilde luxuriancies; I, but Religion layes the axe to the root of the tree. Morality looks that the skin of the Apple be fair; but Religion ſearcheth to the very core. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality chides outward exorbitancies: but Religion checks ſecret inclinations. Or at the beſt in Morality there is but a poliſhing, a guilding, a carving of the heart; but in Religion there is a new framing, a new modelling; nay, a new creating. That's the power of god lineſſe, it changeth the heart.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. See alſo the odiouſneſſe of an Hypocrite. He doth not give God the heart; and yet will give any thing elſe; I, and will ſeem to give that too. He hath <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which the Apoſtle renders by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now an heart, and an heart, 'tis as odious as a weight, and a weight, as a ballance, and a ballance. Treachery, and perfidiouſneſſe is that, which is ſo much deteſted by men, as that which cuts the ſinews of humane Society: and though there be ſome that will practiſe it, yet there are ſcarſe any that will in expreſſe termes patronize it;
<q>

                           <gap reason="foreign">

                     </q>
as he there ſpeaks. Now as perfidiouſneſſe hinders commerce, and intercourſe with men; ſo hypocriſie muſt needs hinder communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God. Can you think that a painted Sepulchre is a fit place for his Spirit to dwell in? This is that which Chriſt doth ſo much upbraid; Thou blinde Phariſee, thou that never reflecteſt upon thine own heart, thou that keepeſt a continual poring on the outſide only, and lookeſt to the painting, and whiting, and daubing of that; doſt thou think thus to pleaſe the pure, and bright, and piercing eye of Omniſcience? Thou haſt not the black skin of the <hi>Ethiopian;</hi> thou haſt not thoſe eminent ſpots of the

                     <hi>Leopard:</hi> I, but thou haſt the plague of the heart, thou haſt the Leproſie within, and is not that more deadly and dangerous? The heart of a Publican is far whiter then thine.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. See then the bitter root of Apoſtaſie. There are ſome that never gave their hearts unto God, no wonder if they fall from him. Hypocriſie 'tis the ſeed of Apoſtaſie. <hi>Take heed</hi> (ſayes the Apoſtle) <hi>leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbeliefe, ſo as that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the living God.</hi> He that hath a <hi>Judas</hi> his heart in him will at length betray a Saviour: he that hath a Demas his heart in him will at length embrace the preſent World. An Apoſtate did but lend the heart unto God for a while, and now he calls for it again.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet ſee the ſecurity of a weak Chriſtian, he hath an heart as well as others, and he hath given that to his God. He hath a vital Principle, an immortal Principle within him. What though the ſturdy Oakes of <hi>Baſan</hi> be broken? what though the ſtately Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> fall? what though the green Bay-trees vaniſh, and diſappear? what though men of vaſt abilities, of rare accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of fair flouriſhes in Religion, what though theſe draw back from God? yet a weak Vine may ſtand all this while leaning upon his beloved laden with fruit, chearing both God, and men; a bruiſed Reed may laſt all this while, if it be but bound up in the Bundle of Life. The ſmoaking flax may be kindled into ſo pure a flame, as that it may outſhine a blazing Profeſſour. A worme may conſume <hi>Jonah</hi> his Gourd, but a Whale ſhall not conſume <hi>Jonah</hi> himſelf. Outward profeſſion may wither, but nothing ſhall ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate a Sincere ſoul from his God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such as have not yet given their hearts unto God, let them with-hold them no longer. Put up thy weak deſires, and pray him to give thee ſuch an heart, as may returne it ſelf to him. Doth God ask thine heart of thee, and doſt thou refuſe to give it him? What do'ſt thou ask of him that he denies thee, if it be good for thee? and do but think how eaſily do'ſt thou give thine heart unto any other but thy God. When the World knocks, when Satan knocks, thou openeſt preſently; nay, it may be before they knock; and muſt a Saviour only be excluded? Is there no Rhetorick in the love of Chriſt? Is there nothing that can draw thine heart to him? Are all the cords of love too weak? Do'ſt thou break them all? Will not the influences of the Goſpel ſoften thine heart?
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50910:149"/>
Will not the blood of a Saviour diſſolve it? will not importunate wooings, and beſeechings move thee? Out of what Rock wert thou hewen, O obdurate Soul? Doth a greater then <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmite the Rock, and will not it guſh out with water? Doſt thou ſay, thou can'ſt not give it to him? this anſwer is ready for thee; <hi>Non velle in cauſa eſt, non poſſe praetenditur;</hi> if thou hadſt a will to give it him, thou would'ſt have a power to give it him too. However as thou haſt ſome faint velleities, ſo make ſome weak endeavours; when he moves thee, then offer it to him as well as thou canſt, though but with a weak, though but with a trembling hand, and his hand will meet thine, and will preſently take it of thee.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such as have given their hearts unto God, here's matter of praiſe, and thankfulneſſe. Bleſſe thy God that would receive ſuch a vaine, and contemptible thing, as thine heart was, when firſt thou gaveſt it to him. Was it not infinite love to eſpouſe ſuch an heart to himſelf; to beautifie it, and enrich it, and prepare it for his Love; to guide it, and teach it, and rule it; to ſteep it in all precious ſweetneſſe; to amplifie it, and dilate it, that it might be more capable of his Love; to ſet a guard about it, and to keep it againſt the ſubtlety, and vigilancy, the malice, and fury of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies? How canſt thou enough admire the greatneſſe of this his Goodneſſe?</p>

1. 'Tis a thingfull of reaſon and equity, that every one that profeſſes himſelf an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> ſhould help <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that Chriſtians ſhould be of a publick ſpirit; it is but juſt that <hi>Meroz</hi> ſhould aid <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. How every one may help the Lord againſt the mighty, and ſtand for the peace of <hi>Sion;</hi> by what means they may do this.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) A Chriſtian ſhould be of a publick and enlarged ſpirit not ſeeking only himſelf and his own ends, with a narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted heart; but he ſhould ſeek the glory of God, and the good of <hi>Sion,</hi> of his Church and people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the very nature of goodneſſe to diffuſe it ſelf abroad in a ſpreading and liberal manner; for it do's not thus loſe any thing, but augments, and increaſes its being by communicating it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You may ſee ſome prints and foot-ſteps of this in Nature, ſome obſcure repreſentations of this truth there. The Sun, it do's not monopolize its beams, and engroſſe its light; but ſcatters them abroad, gilds the whole world with them; it ſhines more for others then it ſelf, it is a publick light.</p>
                  <p>Look on a fountaine, it do's not binde in its ſtreams, ſeale up it ſelf, and encloſe its waters, but ſpends it ſelf with a continual bubbling forth; it ſtreams forth in a fluent, liberal, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicative manner; it is a publick ſpring.</p>
                  <p>Nay natural bodies will part with their own properties, leave their motions; nay, croſſe their own inclinations for a general good. The Aire, a light and nimble body, that mounts upwards, and do's naturally aſcend; yet for an univerſal good, rather then there ſhall be a breach and rupture in nature, a <hi>vacuum,</hi> it will deſcend for the ſtopping of that <hi>hiatus.</hi> In the body of man, the inferiour members will venter themſelves for the good of the whole; The hand will be cut off, and loſe its own being, rather then the head ſhall be endanger'd; you ſee ſome ſhadowes of this truth in Nature.</p>

4. Conſider, that every mans private welfare is included in the publick. The welfare of <hi>Meroz</hi> depended upon <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſafety; what would have become of <hi>Meroz,</hi> if the reſt of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brethren had periſht? So that it was a part of great folly in <hi>Meroz,</hi> not to come out to the help of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> When the diſeaſe ſeazes upon a vitall part, as the head, or the heart, or the like, ſo as to endanger the whole; then every member is in danger, though for the preſent they may be free from paine. The well-being of every private man, depends on the publick good. A ſingle drop is ſoon dry'd up and conſum'd; I, but a drop in the Ocean when 'tis united to a multitude of other drops, 'tis there more ſafe; and a drop by it ſelf is weak, and can make no reſiſtance: I, but a drop in the Ocean is terrible. Men have a more ſafe, and a more honourable being, as joyn'd to the whole, then taken ſingle by themſelves. A ſingle drop can do nothing; but a multitude of drops joyn'd together, will make a ſtream, and carry all before them: A ſingle beame is obſcure; but in the Sun the centre of rayes, meeting in the publick point, they are glorious.</p>

                  <p>And when did <hi>Jeremy</hi> make his Lamentation, that whole book of mourning; but when the glory of <hi>Sion</hi> was laid in the duſt; when <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Lady of Nations was made deſolate?

                  <p n="2">II. That you may follow ſo good example; think whoſe cauſe it is: The cauſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is the cauſe of God; <hi>To the help of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Can you have a better cauſe? The good of the Church, and the glory of God are knit together by an act of Gods gracious will. So that he that ſeeks the good of the Church, do's in the ſame act ſeek the glory of God: And he that helps not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> comes not out to the help of the Lord.

You are bound in a way of thankfulneſſe, to ſtand for him and his cauſe, by thoſe ſweet mercies, thoſe precious pledges of his love, which he every moment heaps upon you; by thoſe many bleſſings that come

ſwimming to you in the blood of a Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By many Promiſes, Vowes, Proteſtations. Your firſt and Originall vow in Baptiſme, obliges you to maintaine the cauſe of God, and of his Church, againſt all the enemies thereof. And you have often repeated this Vow, and ſeal'd it again in the Lords Supper, for you know that's a ſealing up of the Covenant; Now what's the Covenant but this, <hi>That he ſhall be your God, and you ſhall be his people?</hi> And then you can't but remember a late Vow that you have made too; the very ſumme of which was this, to ſtand for the publick good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Certainty to proſper; it is the cauſe of God; A Chriſtian is of the ſureſt ſide, of the winning ſide. There's none but has a minde to proſper, then <hi>pray for the peace of Ieruſalem, they ſhall proſper that love thee.</hi> There's none can eclipſe the glory of God; it's beyond the limited power of a creature, to dimme the luſtre of his Crown; God will maintaine his own cauſe, or elſe he ſhould loſe of his glory; his mighty Arme will get himſelf the victory. Chriſt is the Captain of this Church, and he is the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt often thouſand, (the Enſigne-bearer.) And this is comfort enough for a Chriſtian, the enemies muſt conquer Chriſt, before they can overcome his Church. Chriſt the head of the Church is impregnable. This is the ſecond ground why Chriſtians muſt ſtand for the cauſe of the Church; becauſe 'tis the cauſe of God, to which they are bound. (1.) By engagements, many and great. (2.) By Vows. (3.) Encouraged with certainty of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. A Chriſtian's bound to be of a publick ſpirit, by vertue of the communion of Saints. Every Chriſtian's a member of Chriſts myſticall body, and ſo muſt take care for the good of the whole. He that is united to Chriſt the Head, muſt be knit alſo to the other members; He that do's not ſympathize with the Church, is not of the body; He that can hear of the breaches of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the decayes of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> He that can ſee the apples of Gods eye pierc't through, and not be affected with it, will ye call ſuch mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts body? He that is not truely affected with the bleeding condition of the Chriſtians in <hi>Ireland,</hi> do's virtually and in effect deny this Article of his Creed, <hi>The Communion of Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">IV. It is <hi>againſt the Mighty:</hi> Chriſtians had need have publike

ſpirits, becauſe they have publick enemies; the Devil, a publick enemy; Antichriſt, a publick enemy: They are private enough in reſpect of their malice, and ſubtlety; but publick in force, and oppoſition. As there is the paw of the Lion for ſtrength, ſo there is the head of the Serpent for wiſdome; but yet the head of the Serpent is broken, their wiſdome infatuated: <hi>He that is in heaven, can counterplot them, and laugh them to ſcorne:</hi> But yet thus much you may learn of the enemies of the Church, to ſtudy the publick good: They ſeek the ruine of the whole, and why ſhould not you ſeek the welfare of the whole? If they be ſo ſedulous and induſtrious, ſo forward and active in a bad cauſe, will you be negligent and remiſſe in the beſt cauſe, in the cauſe of God, in the helping of the Lord? All that they do, they'l tell you 'tis for the Catholick cauſe, they are for the publick. What won't a Jeſuite do for the Catholick cauſe? Hee'l compaſſe Sea and Land to gaine one proſelyte. They do publick miſchiefs, and have a malignant and venomous influence into all places where they come; and why ſhould not Chriſtians do as publick ſervice for God, as they do for the Devil? Come out therefore againſt the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ghty to the help of the Lord. That which was <hi>Meroz</hi> his excuſe perhaps, becauſe the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were mighty ones, therefore they durſt not come out againſt them; this God makes the very aggravation of their ſin; for if the enemies were mighty, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had more need of their help and aide, <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, ſaith the Angel of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Meroz</hi> might have conſider'd, that as there are mighty enemies, ſo there is a mighty God too, an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that can cruſh proud <hi>Siſera,</hi> and daſh in pieces the ſtrongeſt enemy. And now by this time you have ſeen that 'tis but fit and equall for a Chriſtian to be of a publick ſpirit, to come out to the help of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) The manner, how every Chriſtian may promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good. And here by way of premiſall;</p>

Nay, do's he not forbid it, and deteſt

it? It is a clear and undenyable truth of our Saviour; <hi>You must not do evil, that good may come of it.</hi> A ſpeech of one of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; <hi>You muſt not tell the leaſt lie, if you could ſave the whole Church by it.</hi> You remember the clauſe in the Proteſtation, <hi>as far as lawfuy I may;</hi> he that ſeeks the publick good in an unlawfull courſe, breaks his Proteſtation. To the right conducting of an action, beſides the intention of an end truely, there muſt be alſo the choice of juſt direct means for the accompliſhing of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In a prudent and orderly way. They that come out to the help of the Lord, muſt keep their ranks; <hi>The Starres fought in their courſes againſt Siſera.</hi> Chriſtians muſt keep their ſeverall ſtations; if there be confuſion, you can't tell a <hi>Canaanite</hi> from an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> a friend from a foe. Let every Chriſtian that ſtudies the publick good, keep his own place; The Magiſtrate his; the Miniſters theirs; and the people alſo theirs. And now there are ſome wayes very good and warrantable, by which Chriſtians may come out to the help of the Lord, and to the aiding of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) <hi>By Prayer.</hi> To be ſure this is a lawful meanes; I, and 'tis a prevalent means too, and has great influence upon the publick good; <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 11. When <hi>Moſes</hi> held up his hand, then <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevail'd. 'Tis a ſpeciall benefit that Chriſtians have by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, the prayers one of another. There's a ſtock of prayers the Church has, and the weakeſt Chriſtian has a ſhare in it. Thou haſt the benefit of many Chriſtians prayer, whoſe face thou never ſaweſt, whom thou never heard'ſt of; perhaps he lives in <hi>America,</hi> or ſome remote corner of the world; but wheree're he be thou haſt the benefit of his prayer, as a member of the myſtical body. For there's no prayer put up to God for his Church, but it encludes every particular member of the Church in it; ſo that prayer do's wonderfully promote the publick good. <hi>Pray for the peace of</hi> Jeruſalem, pray for it, that's the way to have it. And many an one that can uſe no other means, yet may uſe this. There's many can't help the Chriſtians in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but there's no Chriſtian but may pray for them. There's many that can't fight againſt the Rebels; and yet they can pray againſt them, to have them reſtrain'd and ſubdu'd. Many a weak and aged and ſickly one, unfit for warre, and yet powerful in prayer. And theſe weapons of our warfare, they are not carnal, but mighty.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50910:163"/>
You can't encounter an enemy; I, but you may thus wraſtle with the Almighty. You can't batter down a ſtrong hold; but yet ye can beſiege<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the throne of grace with concentred abilities. You are not fit to be ſet in a Watch-tower, to ſpy out the approach of an enemie; but yet you may watch unto prayer. And this is a great advantage that Chriſtians have over their enemies; The enemy knows not how to pray; they know how to curſe, and ſwear, and blaſpheme the name of God; but they know not how to pray: Or if they do pray, and tell their prayers with their beads, that they may know the number of them; yet their prayer is turn'd into fin, <hi>The prayer of the wicked is an abomination.</hi> Let them cry aloud to their Idols, and ſee if they will hear them; they can't look that God ſhould hear them: For, <hi>If I regard ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayer.</hi> O then let Chriſtians know their own happineſſe, and make uſe of this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall weapon of prayer, that oppoſes the enemy more then all other weapons whatſoever: Let them brandiſh the glittering ſword, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And this is the chief uſe you are to make of all the news you hear, to know how to order your prayers accordingly. No que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion more ordinary in mens mouth, then, what news? And I finde no fault with the queſtion, it is good and fitting: But news are not to be enquired after only for the ſatisfying of mens mindes, and curioſity; as the <hi>Athenians</hi> ſpent all their time in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for ſome news: But this is the main end of it, to know how to ſend up your prayers for the good of the Church; and your praiſes for ſuch mercies as God beſtowes upon it. All news heard by a publick ſpirit, will ſtir up prayer or thankſgiving. This is the uſe you are to make of news; if ſad news of the Churches miſery and deſolation, then ſend up more fervent prayer, that God would repaire the breaches of it, and ſettle it in a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; if welcome news, then praiſe God for his free goodneſſe, and deſire him to perfect the great work which he has begun. This is one ſpecial means to promote the publick good, the prayer of the righteous. And God alwayes when he intends any great mercy, he poures upon his people a ſpirit of prayer, he ſtirres up their hearts in this way; he opens their mouth wide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fills it.</p>

good. And how can you expect a publick and glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, unleſſe firſt you reforme in private? Look upon the grievances of your own ſoul; hearken unto thoſe many petitions that are put up to you by the Miniſters; who beſeech you to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd unto God. Every ſin addes to wrath; it provokes God, pulls down his judgements, and ripens a Nation for deſtruction, and has a malignant and venemous influence upon the whole. So then the turning from ſin, and reforming your wayes, is the means to divert judgements, to bring down mercies, and bring down publick good. If there were more private Reformations in mens ſpirits; there is no doubt, but God would bleſſe the publick Reformation. Sinne puts more rubs in the way, then any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or oppoſer whatſoever. This is the great Mountain that hinders the going up of the Temple; if this one were but took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, all other would quickly become a plain. They are very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the publick good, that go on in a courſe of ſinning, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo gracious a God, that do's ſuch great things for us. <hi>One ſinner deſtroyes much good,</hi> as the wiſe man ſpeaks.</p>

You may learn more wiſdome of them that are wiſer in their generation, then the children of light; what a ſtrait union and confederacy have they among themſelves? <hi>Gebal,</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Ama'ek,</hi> the Philiſtines, with them that dwell at <hi>Tyre.</hi> Theſe ſcales of <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> (as that in <hi>Job</hi> is uſually allegoriz'd) are ſhut together as with a cloſe ſeale. And if they ſhould be at variance, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among themſelves; yet they have a ſure way of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a joynt oppoſition of the godly. <hi>Ephraim</hi> againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> both againſt <hi>Judah. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> made friends in crucifying Chriſt. If wicked men can agree in oppoſing of goodneſſe, why ſhould not Chriſtians in helping forward goodneſſe?</p>

between you, ſeeing you are Brethren?</p>
                  <p>And then conſider; What will not united forces do, when you ſhall joyn to the work of the Lord with one conſent, with one ſhoulder? What is it that this union won't bring to paſſe? It will ſtrike terrour to the Churches enemies, and ſtrengthen the hearts of friends: It will mightily promote the publick goood, and tend to the glory of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> If men would but lay out themſelves, and their ſeveral gifts and abilities in one general aime for the advantage of their Maſter, and good of their fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; what glorious times ſhould we then ſee?</p>

There is a principle of corrupt ſelf-love in men, that makes them of narrow and contracted ſpirits; All their aimes are for themſelves, and their own ends; they do not minde the good of the Church. If they hear but of a worldy loſſe, ſome ſhip caſt away, and their eſtate be weaken'd, this will pierce and affect their ſpirits; 'twill ſad and darken their joy: But they can hear of ruines of the Church, the breaches of <hi>Sion;</hi> that the Church has many rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and commotions, and not be wrought upon, not be much mov'd with it.

1. None can be aſſur'd of another mans ſalvation, unleſſe it be of ſuch whom the Scripture tells us were in the ſtate of Grace; whoſe ſincerity is made famous to all the world; to whom the Spirit has ſet its broad ſeal, and given them a publike Teſtimony that they were within the Covenant: for others we know in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that there are a ſelect and peculiar company whom God has choſen out as his jewels, but we cannot ſay certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly of ſuch a particular perſon, of any <hi>Individuum,</hi> that he is a choſen veſſel. Of ſome 'tis evident and apparent, that for the preſent, they are not in the ſtate of Grace; we are ſure that as yet they are not efficaciouſly call'd, but we know not whether they be choſen; for others we have great hopes, and an high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of probability, that they are truly born again, but yet we have no abſolute certainty; for Hypocriſie will go ſo farre, as that the beſt Criticks may be deceived. And a man can never tell certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another mans ſincerity, unleſſe he could ſupply the place of Conſcience. An Hypocrite may ſpin ſo fair a thred, as that it may deceive his own eye, he may admire the cobweb, and not know himſelf to be the Spider; how much more eaſie may he deceive a ſtander by? And as for any extraordinary ſpirit of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning, I know no ground for it, nor any promiſe of it in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>You'l ſay, this takes much from the communion of Saints, and from the ſweetneſſe of Chriſtian ſociety, if we cannot tell who are true members of the Myſtical body, fellow-brethren and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-heirs of the ſame promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though we cannot tell abſolutely and infallibly, yet we may know very probably; we know there are ſuch <hi>a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a choſen generation, a Royal Prieſt-hood,</hi> and we know that ſuch and ſuch are the likelieſt in the world to be of this number, ſo as we have no reaſon to diſtruſt them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt commend much of this to Gods providence, who very ſeldome ſuffers Hypocrites to go undetected; he that is the great ſearcher of hearts will be ſure to meet with them: he hates a rotten heart, and will be ſure to make it odious.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis fitting that this and many other priviledges ſhould be reſerv'd for heaven, that ſo we may long after that the more. There ſhall be a pure and unmixt communion, <hi>the perfect beauty of holineſſe.</hi> Nothing ſhall enter there that makes a lie, nothing

                  <p n="1">I. And here firſt, what Aſſurance is.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a reflex act of the ſoule, by which a Chriſtian clearly ſees, that he is for the preſent in the ſtate of grace, and ſo an heire apparent to glory; or in the words of the text, by which he knows his <hi>Calling and Election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis a reflex act, and ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Aſſurance is ſituated in the ſoules moſt <hi>noble,</hi> moſt cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>, moſt private<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and moſt ſpiritual operation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.) Reflex acts are the moſt noble and moſt royal operations, the moſt rational and judicious acts of a moſt intelligent Spirit. Reaſon is now in its exaltation, it ſits upon the Throne, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes a Judge-like power; all the faculties of the ſoule muſt appear before its Tribunal, and give up a ſtrict account, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the Pythagoreans were wont to poſe and catechize themſelves: your inferiour ſenſitive creatures can go poring on upon a preſent object, and blunder on in a direct way, but are far enough from any reflex acts; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome talk of reflexiveneſſe in ſenſe too, (as to ſee that they ſee, or the like) but 'tis but a fancy of their own; Senſitive Creatures could never reach ſo high as a reflex act; and indeed ſenſual men know not what belong unto it, but the reaſonable ſoul can retire into it ſelf, and take a view and ſurvey of its own actings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.) It is the moſt ſecret and retir'd operation; the ſoule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawes and bids the body farewel, and even here becomes an <hi>anima ſeparata:</hi> it retires into its Cloſet, and bolts its ſelfe up, where none can peep in, none can eveſdrop it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.) The moſt refin'd and ſpiritual working of all, this is moſt
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50910:168"/>
abſtracted from matter. The ſoul here does not commerce with outward droſſy objects, but looks upon it ſelf, fixes its eye upon its own face. This is the moſt ſpiritual employment of the ſoule, which does moſt ſtrongly argue its immortality, and ſhewes it to be a ſpark of Divinity: How does the prime and fountain Being ſpend all Eternity, but in looking upon his own tranſcendent and glorious Eſſence? in viewing the bright Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of his Attributes, &amp; ſeeing ſome ſhadowy and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Repreſentations of himſelf in the glaſſe of the Creatures? 'Tis one of the chief works of a Chriſtian, to reflect upon himſelf, <hi>Vita eſt in ſe reflexio;</hi> as the grave Moraliſt <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks. The Prodigal came to himſelf, when he came to reflex acts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo 1 <hi>King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="2">II. But yet this working of the ſoul is but weak and <hi>tranſient,</hi> 'tis fleeting and deſultory, it quickly vaniſhes; which ſhewes a great diſorder and irregularity in the Spirit, that that which is the nobleſt and moſt proper operation, that borders upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, men are leaſt ver'ſt in it. How rare is it for men to reflect upon their own conditions, to enter into an exact trial and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of their own wayes? <hi>Radius reflexus languet,</hi> as the Opticks ſpeak; The beam begins to be weary, and is ready to faint, it gives a weak and languiſhing Repreſentation: 'tis true of intellectual beames too, <hi>radius reflexus languet.</hi> O how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are men weary of ſerious thoughts and conſiderations? They look upon them as melancholy interruptions, <hi>turbida intervalla.</hi> You had need of good arguments to perſwade men to entertain a ſerious thought; outward objects, theſe divert the minde, and take it off from its greateſt work. <hi>As a man that ſees his natural face in a glaſſe,</hi> (as St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>goes his way, and preſently forgets what manner of man he was.</hi> The ſoule ſcarce knowes its own viſage, it looks abroad and is a ſtranger to it ſelf. Many a mans ſoule ha's ſcarce look't upon it ſelf all his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. It conſiſts in a reflex act, (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>we are more then Conquerours.</hi> 'Tis <hi>flos fidei,</hi> the very luſtre and eminency of faith. Faith that's the Root, Aſſurance is the Top-branch, the flouriſhing of faith, faith with a gloſſe upon it. Juſtifying faith, that does not only dwell in the underſtanding, <hi>in nudo aſſenſu,</hi> but requires an act of the will too, which muſt embrace a promiſe: indeed it calls for an act reſulting from the whole ſoule, which muſt receive Chriſt offered unto it: but now aſſurance conſiſts only in the minde, and ſo there you have the difference between faith of Adherence, and faith of Aſſurance. The firſt is an act of the whole ſoule, the latter is a work of the minde only; it ariſeth <hi>è ſenſu quodam ſpirituali;</hi> whereby we know and perceive that we beleeve. And when I ſay every beleever may be aſſur'd of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: I don't ſay that every beleever is aſſur'd of it; No, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one is to labour for it, to <hi>give diligence,</hi> as our Apoſtle ſpeaks: but every one ha's not yet obtained it: Aſſurance is not of the Eſſence of a Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>; A man may be a true childe of God, and certainly ſaved, though he have not Aſſurance; He can have little ſweetneſſe and comfort without it, little joy and peace, but yet he may be in a ſafe though in a ſad condition. 'Tis requir'd to the <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> not to the <hi>eſſe</hi> of a Believer.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the Promiſe is made to the direct act, and not to the reflex. <hi>Believe, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> that's the voice of the Goſpel: Not, know that thou doſt believe. Now there is many a weak Chriſtian that ha's faith, and yet does not know that he ha's it; Faith like a grain of muſtard-ſeed, lies hid for a while, but it ha's a vigorous and operative ſpirit, and will work out in time, and ſpread it ſelf into goodly branches. The leaſt degree of faith, if it be true, brings ſalvation, but it does not bring aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many true Chriſtians are in a ſtate of deſertion: all their light is eclipſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their joy and comfort is put out. Nay, they look upon God as an enemy; they are ſo far from being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of their ſalvation, as that they verily think themſelves in a

loſt condition, and yet all this while are in a true ſtate of grace. Their condition is cloudy and dark, and very uncomfortable for the preſent, but yet 'tis ſafe; they are true believers, and yet far enough from aſſurance. An excellent place in <hi>Iſaiah</hi> for this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. <hi>Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and hath not light? let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God;</hi> ſome may truly <hi>fear God,</hi> and yet <hi>walk in darkneſſe,</hi> and have no light, not the leaſt glimpſe of aſſurance no beame of Gods favourable countenance, yet <hi>let him truſt in the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God.</hi> He may do this though he ha's no light, he may multiply direct acts, though he ha's no reflex acts. And here he may lay all the ſtreſſe of his ſalvation, leane upon the grace of God in Chriſt, and with a ſweet recumbency reſt himſelf upon his God.</p>
                  <p>And this conſideration may ſtrengthen many a bruiſed reed, and revive many a drooping Spirit, who for the preſent do not know that they believe, their caſe may be good for all this. Thou mayeſt be a true believer, though thou art but a weak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, nay, though thou think thy ſelf no believer; I do not ſpeak this that any ſhould reſt in this condition; no, this were againſt the text; All muſt <hi>give diligence to make their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure:</hi> And a Chriſtian can have little or no quiet, till he attain to aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>And thus you have ſeen the nature of Aſſurance, we ſhall in the next place prove, that a Chriſtian may be aſſur'd of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

Scarce any eminent Chriſtian in the whole Book of God, but ha's ſet his Seale to this truth by his own particular experience. This is ſo clear as the adverſaries themſelves cannot deny, but that many choice ones have had a full and ſatisfying light ſpringing in upon their ſoul, and clearing their eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to them. But they ſay 'tis by way of extraordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a ſpecial Priviledge vouchſafed to ſome few of Gods choiceſt Worthies by a rare indulgence. But this is ſpoken <hi>gratis,</hi> and is contrary to the preſent experience of many thouſands of Chriſtians; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 13. The very drift of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Epiſtle, is that Chriſtians might have aſſurance. And beſides, thoſe <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> by which Chriſtians attain to Aſſurance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are common to all:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50910:170"/>
All of them have the Spirit dwelling in them: all have the fruits of the Spirit, and a ſweet teſtimony of their own Spirits; though ſome have it in a weak meaſure and cannot reach to a Plerophery: all come not to this full aſſurance; but yet theſe are the uſual wayes, by which men attaine to it, which have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in them of extra ordinary Revelation: they are <hi>via Regia,</hi> and yet <hi>via trita</hi> too. Adde to this the ſcope of the text. St. <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts all <hi>to give diligence to make their Calling and Election ſure,</hi> which, to what purpoſe were it, if it came only by ſpecial &amp; extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Revelation, which does not depend upon their diligence?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Search into the nature of faith it ſelf, and you will ſee that it does much tend to aſſurance, and ha's ſome vicinity with it. There's a double act of faith, as the moſt acute <hi>Ames</hi> obſerves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (1.) The <hi>actus primus,</hi> by which I beleeve in Chriſt for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of my ſins, and juſtifying of my perſon, which is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtifying faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (2.) <hi>Actus ex fide emanans,</hi> by which I believe that my ſins are remitted, which does neceſſarily preſuppoſe the former act: for thou haſt no more reaſon to beleeve that thy ſins are remitted then any other, till thou haſt firſt received Chriſt for the Remiſſion of thy ſins. And this is contain'd in the Article of the Creed, <hi>I beleeve the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> not only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, for this the devils beleeve &amp; yet tremble: but the Chriſtian pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarizes it, and draws ſweetnes out of it, I beleeve the forgivenes of my ſins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And of this latter 'tis meant, that <hi>fidelis certus eſſe poteſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

What ſweetneſſe can a Chriſtian draw from a promiſe till he knows that it belongs unto him? Will this enrich a man, to know that there are Pearls and Diamonds in the world? Will this ſatisfie a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſraelite, to know that there is a <hi>Canaan,</hi> a land that flowes with milk and honey, although (it may be) he ſhall ne're come neer't? Nay, is it not a greater ſting and vexation for the ſoul to think I know there are pure fountains and pleaſant ſtreams, but yet I may die with thirſt? there are ſpiritual dainties, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delicacies, but I am not ſure to have one taſte of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many a promiſe looks with a pleaſant and propitious eye, but 'tis not fixt upon my ſoul; ſo that take away a Chriſtians intereſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in a promiſe, and what becomes of his conſolation? God has given his word, his oath, his ſeal, his earneſt, and all to this very end, that a poor Chriſtian may be aſſur'd of his ſalvation, that he might have ſtrong and vigorous conſolation; ſo that to deny him this, is to annihilate the word of God, to fruſtrate the oath of God, to evacuate the ſeal of God, and as much as in them lies to make him loſe his earneſt, and to leave the ſoul in an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and perplext condition.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Teſtimony of Gods Spirit is alwayes accompanied with the Teſtimony of our own ſpirit: and ſo that word, <hi>Rom</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. A man may have the teſtimony of his own ſpirit, that has not the witneſſe of Gods Spirit. The Spirit as it breaths when it pleaſes, ſo it ſhines when it pleaſes too: Well then the queſtion is, whether the Chriſtian, who has but the ſingle teſtimony of his own ſpirit, may be aſſur'd of his ſalvation?</p>
                  <p>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Perkin's</hi> propounds the caſe, and reſolves it thus: If the teſtimony of the Spirit be wanting, then the other teſtimony, the ſanctification of heart, will ſuffice to aſſure us. We know it ſufficiently to be true, and not painted fire, if there be heat, though there be no flame; thus he: And his meaning is as indeed the thing is, that it is a true Aſſurance, though not ſo bright an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. I may ſee a thing certainly by the light of a candle, and yet I may ſee it more clearly by the light of the Sun. And for my part, I think that certainty do's not conſiſt <hi>in puncto,</hi> but may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a latitude; and receive <hi>magìs</hi> and <hi>minús:</hi> And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary principle do's delude many.

So here; though one teſtimony be enough for Aſſurance, yet a double teſtimony makes it more glorious. Certainty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of degrees, and a man may be more certain of a thing, that he is already certain of. Take two Chriſtians, both may be aſſur'd of their ſalvation; and yet one may have a clearer aſſurance then

the other has: One may have a double teſtimony, and another but a ſingle. Nay, the ſame ſoul may have at one time a double teſtimony, and at another but a ſingle. The light of the Spirit may, and do's often withdraw it ſelf, and leave only the witneſſe of our own ſpirit; and yet then the ſoul has Aſſurance. But yet the ſoul ſhould aime at the higheſt Plerophory, at the top of Aſſurance: Then <hi>quench not the Spirit,</hi> leſt you put out your own joy; grieve not ſo ſweet an inhabitant, that comes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort you, give him no cauſe to withdraw his light.</p>

Improve but preſent ſtrength, and God will ſend thee in freſh ſupplies Auxiliary forces, and thou ſhalt walk from ſtrength to ſtrength, till thou appeareſt before God in glory. Thy light ſhall ſhine out brighter and brighter till per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect day, <hi>Donec ſtabiliatur dies,</hi> according to the <hi>Syriac,</hi> till thou com'ſt to a firme and well eſtabliſht Aſſurance.

may more exactly analyſe thy condition, and ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text and coherence of it. 'Tis the ſpeech of <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 33. 23. There meets him a meſſenger, an Interpreter, one among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, to ſhew unto him his uprightneſſe; Hee'l ſhew thee, here's grace, and there's grace; here's a true pearle, and there's a ſpark though in aſhes, and there's an evidence.

                  <p n="1">1. When reflex acts are wanting, be ſure to multiply direct acts: when there is no certainty of Evidence, yet even then have a certainty of Adherence and Recumbency. Now graſp a Promiſe, take faſt hold of that precious offer, rolle thy ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the free grace of a God in Chriſt; lay all the ſtreſſe of thy ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon it, with a gallant and heroical reſolution; <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi> Thus <hi>Job, Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Thus our Saviour, <hi>My God, my god, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And this muſt needs be a ſtrong act of faith, even then to rely upon God when he ſeems thine enemy; to truſt in an angry and diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and when he frowns on thee, yet then to lean upon him. Like men ready to be drown'd, be ſure to take faſt hold; caſt Anchor, though in the dark.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Study ſelf-denyal, and though thou long and breath after Aſſurance; yet reſigne up thy ſelf wholly to his will, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to want Aſſurance, if he ſee it beſt for thee. Take heed of murmuring in the wilderneſſe, in the ſaddeſt and moſt deſerted condition. Throw thy ſelf at his feet, with this reſolution; O my God, I'le bleſſe thee for thoſe eternal treaſures of ſweetneſſe that are in thy ſelf, though I ſhould never taſte of them: I'le bleſſe thee for thoſe ſmiles of thy face, which thou beſtoweſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, though thou wilt not caſt one gracious look upon my ſoule: I'le bleſſe thee for thoſe rich offers of grace thou makeſt unto me, though I have not a heart to lay hold of them.</p>

3. Put thy ſoul into a waiting poſture, and ſtay till he pleaſe to diſplay ſome of himſelf unto thee, and make ſome of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe paſſe before thee. One beam of his countenance, one gracious ſmile, one propitious glance of his eye, the leaſt crumb of the hidden Manna; 'tis worth waiting for all thy life-time. And when I ſpeak of waiting, I mean not that the ſoul ſhould ſtand ſtill, and do nothing; no, this were againſt the Text, <hi>Give diligence,</hi> &amp;c. improve all preſent ſtrength; waite upon him in prayer, beg one glimpſe of him, be earneſt for a taſte, for a reliſh of the hidden Manna; and wait upon him in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, here the Spirit breaths, here Manna's rain'd down, here God ſhews his face; here's the ſealing place, the Spirit confirmes the word, and prints it upon thy ſoul. Thus waite upon him in his own way; I, and waite upon him in his own time too, don't think time tedious; He that beleeves, makes not haſte, which S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Paul</hi> renders; <hi>He that beleeves, is not aſhamed;</hi> as if to make haſte and be aſham'd, were all one. God will wonderfully prepare the ſoule, that he means to fill with his love. Aſſurance is too precious a thing to be pour'd into every ſpirit: He won't <hi>put new wine into old bottles.</hi> God is all this while making thee more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of his love; and though for the preſent thou haſt no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, yet thus truſting and waiting upon him, thou art in a great tendency to it. And put the worſt that can be imagin'd, that thou ſhould'ſt dye under a cloud; yet thy condition were ſafe, and thou ſhalt come then to a full Aſſurance; nay, to a full poſſeſſion of thine inheritance; and thou ſhalt ſee the glorious Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine of the face of God, a beam of which thou did'ſt ſo much long for here.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the fourth particular; thoſe ſpecial Seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, when Chriſtians have their Aſſurance and Plero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phory.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Many times at their firſt converſion, God do's then ſeale up the work of grace in the ſoul. When the Spirit of Bondage has paſt upon the ſoul, and by a ſtrong conviction, has apply'd par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly guilt and wrath unto it; the fatal ſentence is pronounc't, and the ſoul is fill'd with the ſcorching pre-apprehenſions of hell and damnation, and trembles at the very thought of eternity: Now for the Goſpel to bring thee wellcome newes of a pardon, and for the Spirit of Adoption to apply grace and mercy unto the

ſoul: for the priſon-doores to be broken open, and a poor cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſet at liberty; to have all the chaines and fetters beaten off, and to be brought into a marvellous light; to have all the balme of <hi>Gilead</hi> pour'd into him, Evangelical fruitions and cordials pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for him, and which is the very extraction and quinteſſence of all, the love of a Saviour ſhed into his heart: What ſtrong impreſſions of joy, think you, muſt there be in ſuch a ſoul? What precious infuſions of ſpiritual ſweetneſſe? What ſecret ſpringings and elevations of Spirit? What triumphs, what Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee's, what love-raptures? <hi>I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine.</hi> I muſt appeal to your breaſts that have found this great and heavenly work wrought upon your ſoul; 'tis you only that have taſted the joy of the holy Ghoſt, that is glorious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable. And do you tell us, had not ye then the firſt reliſh of the hidden Manna? was not it very ſweet and delicious? hadſt not thou then the firſt glimpſe of the White Stone? and was not it very bright and orient? hadſt not thou then the Spouſe kiſſe, and was not it precious and more worth then a world? didſt not thou t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

I know your ſouls dance within you, with the very recalling of ſo happy and golden a time, and you pant and breath after more of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a Saviour, and truly he deſerves an <hi>Anathema,</hi> that do's not preferre the very poſſibility of having of it before all the world. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11. 1. <hi>When</hi> Iſrael <hi>was a childe, then I lov'd him; I taught</hi> Ephraim <hi>alſo to go, taking them by their armes,</hi>

God has a ſpeciall care of tender plants; when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a tender vine, O then he fenc'd it, and hedg'd it, and ſhone out upon it, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt is thus pleas'd to reveal his love, to unboſome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the ſouls of young Converts, for their greater incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the wayes of grace: At the firſt ſtep to heaven, he gives them a <hi>viaticum.</hi> If after the ſoul had been ſteept in legall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, and poſſeſt with feares and terrours and amazements,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50910:178"/>
compaſs't with clouds, and now at laſt it has been drawn by a mighty work to receive a Saviour; If after all this it ſhould have no Sun-ſhine, 'twould droop and languiſh, and be ready to pine away; 'twould be very unfit and unſerviceable, the wheels of the ſoul would move heavily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God therefore oiles the wheels, poures <hi>the Oile of gladneſſe</hi> into the ſoul. And now it moves like the chariots of <hi>Aminadab,</hi> with a nimble ſpontaneity. Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to flouriſh through the Lettices, lets in ſome of his love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſoul; I, and gives it a ſenſe of this love too, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it to obedience; and ſets the ſoul a longing for more of this love, and for more ſenſe of this love; and ſo it will never leave longing, till it have a full fruition of it in heaven. This is Gods method, this is the uſuall progreſſe of grace in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>And hence you may ſee why young Converts are uſually ſo act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive in the wayes of Religion, ſo forward and vehement. O, they have freſh apprehenſions of the love of a Saviour; with an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent alteration he has wrought in them; how they are rais'd from death to life? O, they can tell you long ſtories of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; what great things he hath done for their ſoul. So that their affections are rais'd; there's a fluſh of joy, the ſoul runs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and knows no banks, no bounds. Thus God does many times ſeal up the work of grace in the ſoul, and gives a ſatisfying light at the firſt converſion: but yet I cannot ſay that this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſo, for there are diverſities of workings, and grace ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wrought in the ſoul after a more ſtill and undiſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner; as we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sacrament-times, are ſealing times. I ſpeak of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper; for as for thoſe ſecret breathings of the Spirit upon Infants in that other Sacrament of Baptiſme, they are altogether unſearchable, and paſt finding out. Now in the Lords Supper you have the New Covenant ſeal'd up unto the ſoul; the ſoul has not only his graces increaſed, but they are printed clearer; that ſeale of the Spirits does print a Chriſtians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences with a clearer ſtamp. You have plaine and viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the love of a Saviour; and you have the ſenſe of this love pour'd out into you. A Chriſtian feeds not only upon Sacramental bread, but upon <hi>hidden Manna</hi> too, and has taſtes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50910:179"/>
of that love that is ſweeter then wine. Here's <hi>a feaſt of fat things; The ſoul is ſatisfied as with marrow and ſweetneſſe;</hi> ſpiritual refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments like fat things, they are ſweet, and they are filling too; yet not like other fat things, that have a cloying fulſomeneſſe in them; no, theſe carry a delicious reliſh with them, ſuch as the ſoul takes preſent complacency in them, and has a longing appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite for them. The ſoul never nauſeats the feaſt of fat things; but the more it feeds upon them, the more it hungers after them. Now the two grand ends of this Sacrament in reference to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, are (1.) Growth of Grace. (2.) Senſe of Grace. 'Tis a Sacrament of Augmentation by which a new-borne-infant-ſoul may grow up to its juſt proportion and full ſtature in Jeſus Chriſt; and 'tis a Sacrament evidencing this his condition to the ſoul. Chriſtians come hither <hi>ad corroborandum Titulum; the ſmoaking flax</hi> comes hither to have ſome light, and <hi>the bruiſed reed</hi> comes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have ſome ſtrength; the worme <hi>Jacob</hi> crawl's into the preſence of a Saviour, and is ſent away with an encouraging voice, <hi>Fear not, thou worme Jacob.</hi> Many a tender babe in Chriſt, has ſtretcht out its weak and trembling hand, to lay hold of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and has found vertue coming out from him. Many a thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty ſoul has come breathing and panting after the ſtreames of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; 'thas open'd his mouth wide, and he has fill'd it. The long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and affectionate ſoul has come with vehement and enlarg'd deſires, and has found full expreſſions and manifeſtations of his love towards her. Many a cloudy ſoul has come hither to ſee if he could ſpy out one beam, and has been ſent away brighter then the Sun in all its glory. You that come hither with the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and capacious ſouls; tell us whether you ben't fill'd up to the brim, whether your cup don't overflow? O what heavenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe is there between you and a Saviour? what pleaſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects? what mutual love-glances? what ſmiles and blandiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Don't you finde in your own ſouls<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a full Paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the book of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> that book of Loves? He comes with an earthy and droſſie ſoul, that is not rais'd and advanc't with ſuch glorious myſteries.</p>
                  <p>And yet my meaning is not, as if every true Chriſtian that had received this Sacrament, muſt needs have Aſſurance; No, we know</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Beleevers themſelves may receive unworthily, as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50910:179"/>
                     <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (when <hi>Paul</hi> tells them) they came together for the worſe, and not for the better, he ſpeaks it of ſuch as were truly in the ſtate of grace. Thus he concludes his diſcourſe, <hi>You are chaſtened of the Lord, that you might not be condemned with the world.</hi> And thus the ſoul may go from a Sacrament with leſſe comfort then it brought thither.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Many that have much joy and ſweetneſſe from a Sacrament, real and ſpiritual joy, I and ſtrengh and vigour too, yet it may be have it not in ſo great a proportion, in ſo high a meaſure; their cup is not ſo brim-ful, as that it ſhould reach to Aſſurance. All that do truly partake of theſe heavenly delicacies, yet don't go away equally ſatisfied. Some have but a taſte which is enough to cheriſh them, others a full draught which does mightily enliven them. So then, all we ſay is this, thoſe Chriſtians that have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, have it uſuall at theſe times, and ſome Chriſtians that have wanted aſſurance, yet here have found it, which ſhould ſtrongly engage all to come hither with great and ſolemn pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, quickening and exciting their graces, emproving all preſent ſtrength, breathing and longing after theſe pleaſant ſtreams, widening and enlarging their affections, opening their mouths like a dry and thirſty land that waits for ſome ſatisfying ſhowers, and would fain be fill'd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Times of employment are ſealing times. When God intends a Chriſtian for great and eminent ſervice, he firſt makes his goodneſſe paſſe before him, he ſheds ſome of his love into his heart, which does both conſtraine him to obedience, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him in it; his ſmile makes the ſoul go cheerefully about his work, his preſence gives life and vigour to a performance. The ſervants of God wait on him, fix their eyes upon him, look whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he gives them a propitious glance, they walk in the light of his countenance, they follow the directions of his eye; they won't move unleſſe he breath on them. <hi>Moſes</hi> won't ſtir without Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of his preſence. All the cluſters of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice him, he had rather dwell with briars and thornes in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe with the good will of him that dwells in the buſh: He had rather be in a barren, and deſolate, and howling wilderneſſe: then in a pleaſant and fruitful land, in a delicious land without the preſence of his God. He knows there's no ſweetneſſe in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> without him; there's more ſting then honey in the land of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50910:180"/>
Promiſe, unleſſe he be there; and <hi>Canaan</hi> it ſelf will prove a wilderneſſe if he withdraw himſelf. The beames of his gracious Preſence, theſe gild a place: they can turn a deſert into a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, and can make a priſon glorious. The love of God in Chriſt 'tis attractive and magnetical, and drawes the ſoule along when 'tis once touch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>t with it, this will draw <hi>Moſes</hi> to the land of Promiſe, this will carry him through all difficulties. God ſheds ſome of this love into <hi>Moſes</hi> his heart, and then he goes on with cheerfulneſſe and alacrity. And ſo 'twas with his Succeſſour <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua.</hi> God calls him to an honourable employment, to be the Shepherd of his little flock, to guide and govern his People <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> Now how does he prepare him for ſo great a work? why, he ſtrengthens him, and heartens him with a Promiſe of himſelf, with aſſurance of his love; <hi>Feare not, but be of courage, I am with thee:</hi> Thou haſt my preſenee, thou ſhalt have my bleſſing; I have done much for thee, and I will do more for thee; be faithful in my ſervice, and be couragious, and don't doubt of the love of God towards thee. Thus God when he call'd <hi>Abraham</hi> to that great expreſſion of obedience in the ſacrificing of his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he firſt warmes his heart with his love, and ſeals up the Covenant of Grace to him: he ſpreads before him ample and comprehenſive Promiſes, <hi>I am thy God All-ſufficient;</hi> I am thy Buckler, and <hi>thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great reward;</hi> and this will beare up and ſupport <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> though the ſtaffe of his old age be taken away, and by his own hands caſt into the fire.</p>
                  <p>And this was his uſual dealing with the Prophets, when he ſent them with great and weighry meſſages. He firſt reveales his goodneſſe to them, before he reveales his minde by them; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures them of directing mercy, of protecting mercy that ſhall beare them company, that ſhall go along with them: and this puts a generous undauntedneſſe upon them, that they feare not the frowns of men, nor the threatnings of men, nor of the greateſt of men: this makes <hi>Jeremy</hi> to ſet his face like a flint, and <hi>Eſay to lift up his voice like a Trumpet, to tell</hi> Iſrael <hi>their ſins, and</hi> Judah <hi>their tranſgreſſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is that which prepares the Martyres for their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. God tempers and allayes that Cup, he drops ſome of his goodneſſe into it, and ſweetens it to them. He firſt ſets his ſeal to their ſoules, before they ſet their ſeal to his truth; he diets
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50910:180"/>
them with the hidden Manna, and gives them before-hand the <hi>White Stone,</hi> as a ſure pledge of victory. What is it but this that makes them devoure torments, and come to them with an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite? 'tis this that ſoftens the flames, and turnes them into a bed of Roſes; 'tis this that fills their ſouls with joy, and their mouths with praiſes: that makes them more chearful in their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, then their Saviour in his; for they uſually have the face of a reconciled God ſhining out upon them, which was wholly with drawn from him, when he cry'd out, <hi>My God, my God, Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Praying times are ſealing times. The ſame Spirit that endites the Prayer, ſeales it up. When <hi>Hannah</hi> had put up her Prayer, 1 <hi>Sam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> 1. 18. the text ſayes expreſſely, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>that <hi>her countenance was no more ſad.</hi> As 'tis the great Priviledge of Aſſurance. that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may then with confidence cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> ſo alſo 'tis a great meanes to Aſſurance. The hearing of Prayers is a mighty ſtrengthening to faith; and the ſtrengthening of faith does ſtrongly tend to Aſſurance. Beſides, Chriſtians may pray for Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance; they may be importunate for a glimpſe of his face, for one beam, for one ſmile, and his bowels won't let him deny them. Hence you ſhall finde it, that ſuch as are moſt frequent in Prayer, are moſt bleſt with Aſſurance. Praying Chriſtians have much entercourſe and communion with their God. And thus there may be a National kinde of Aſſurance, I ſay a National plerophory; when God ſhall poure out a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication upon his people, and they with united and concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated abilities ſhall beſiege the Throne of Grace; there is no doubt, there can be no doubt, but at length he will yield up ſuch a mercy to his praying People.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Times of outward exigencies are ſealing times, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Though our outward man decay, yet our inward man is renew'd daily;</hi> that feeds upon hidden Mannah, a precious reſtaurative for a fainting Chriſtian: Manna you know was rain'd down in the wilderneſſe; and when the Iſraelites proviſion failed them, then Manna was rain'd down. When the water-pots are fill'd up to the brim, then water preſently turn'd into wine: and ſo this hidden Mannah is provided for ſad and cloudy conditions. We except only the caſe of total deſertion, when the ſoul has not the leaſt light ſhining in upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is the ſevereſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50910:181"/>
that a true Chriſtian is capable of: but in other diſtreſſes, eſpecially outward and temporal diſtreſſes, he does reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more immediately to them. And though the creature frown, yet he will ſmile upon them. Believers they are the friends of God, and 'tis no part of friendſhip to forſake them in the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt times. St. <hi>John,</hi> when a baniſh't man in the Iſle of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> then God ſhewes him that glorious <hi>Revelation. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> when in priſon, then brim-full of joy, which breaks out into Pſalmes of Praiſe. In the fiery trial, as there is ſome ſcorching, ſo there is ſome light too. And God does prepare his People for the ſeal of the Spirit, by thus melting and ſoftening their heart; for the ſofter the heart is, the clearer will the Print of his love be. When God had brought that great ſickneſſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and thus had diſſolv'd and ſoft'ned his heart, he preſently prints his love upon it: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Thon haſt lov'd my ſoule from the grave.</hi> God does then moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe his love, when they have moſt need of it. The white Stone ſparkles moſt oriently in the darkeſt condition. O how gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly does God ſhine in upon the priſons of Martyrs? what fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſits does he give them? it might even make men ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of their ſufferings, that they might have ſome ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his love towards them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Times of Victory and Conqueſts over luſts and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſealing times. God after ſuch victories will give his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a triumph. This is expreſt in that text of the <hi>Revelation, Rev.</hi> 2. 17. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>To him that overcomes will I give to eate of the hidden Mannah,</hi> &amp;c. Thus when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was wraſtling with, and conquering that great temptation, whatever it was, that is mentioned in 2 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 12. God then gives to eat of the hidden Mannah, and ſtrengthens him with this, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> He gives him the white Stone with that Motto graven in it, <hi>My grace,</hi> &amp;c. Thus that noble Chriſtian, and famous Convert of <hi>Italy Galeacius Caracciolus,</hi> when he had ſcorn'd the pomp and luſtre of the world, and had trampl'd upon all relations for the love of a Saviour: when Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan that cunning Angler of ſouls had ſpent all his baits upon him, and he had refuſ'd them all: O then what a deal of precious ſweetneſſe ſlides into his ſoul? what ruſhings in of glorious joy? he had never ſuch joy at <hi>Naples,</hi> as he had at <hi>Geneva.</hi> You may

hear him pronouncing an <hi>Anathema</hi> to all ſuch, as ſhall prefer all the gold and ſilver in the world before one dayes ſweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Jeſus Chriſt. As none have more dregs of wrath then relapſing and apoſtatizing Spirits, (Remember but <hi>Spira</hi>'s caſe;) ſo none have ſweeter and choicer mercy then the faithful Servants of the Lord Jeſus, that follow him in the houre of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. Apoſtates are ſeal'd up to a day of vengeance, but theſe are ſeal'd up to a day of Redemption. Thus the Mourners in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that would not yield to the abominations of the times muſt have a ſeal ſet upon them. Thus that Virgin-company in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> that would not proſtitute their ſoules to Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian folly, have the ſeal of God in their foreheads. This is the happineſſe of a Chriſtian, that he has a ſweet ſatisfaction in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyal; in denying ſin, in repulſing luſt, in conquering tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, in pulling out his right eye, in cutting off his right hand, in mortifying the body of death, he has a ſweet ſatisfaction in all theſe. And thus you have ſeen thoſe ſpecial ſealing times when Chriſtians have this high plerophory, theſe riches of Aſſurance: we come now to ſpeak of them in a more Applicatory way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Times of Aſſurance, they ſhould be times of humility and dependance upon God. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had been ſo long in the Mount, and had a luſtre upon him by converſing with God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, preſently at the foot of the Mount he meets with matter of humiliation. The Iſraelites have made them a golden Calfe; <hi>Thy People,</hi> ſayes God to <hi>Moſes,</hi> they have done this. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had been rapt up into the third Heaven, and had heard there ſome of <hi>Arcana Coeli,</hi> things that neither could nor might be utter'd; for both are imply'd in <gap reason="foreign">

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a little thing will puffe up a bubble, a ſmall happineſſe will ſwell up the ſons of men. Pride as it twines about the choiceſt graces, ſo it devoures the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt comforts. But yet there is nothing tends more to ſoule-abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſelf-examination, then the beholding of Gods face, then the ſeeing of his glory, this will make the ſoul abhorre it ſelf in duſt and aſhes. The more God reveals himſelf unto the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50910:182"/>
ſoul, the more will the ſoul ſee that huge diſproportion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it ſelf and a Deity. There's none here below that ever ſaw more of Gods face then <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had done, and there were none that ever had lower apprehenſions of themſelves. They knew well enough what the Sun-ſhine of his preſence was, what a glorious ſight it was to behold his face, and yet they had rather part with this, then he ſhould part with his glory. They are like men amaz'd with the vaſtneſſe and ſpaciouſneſſe of the Ocean, and make nothing of a little inconſiderable drop of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They that know not theſe treaſures of love and ſweetneſſe, thoſe heaps of excellencies that are ſtor'd up in God, theſe are the grand admirers of themſelves. But when the ſoul comes to have a proſpect of heaven, and fixes its eye upon an object of the firſt magnitude, the creature diſappears, ſelf vaniſhes and loſes it ſelf in the fulneſſe of God. And if God do aſſure thee of this his love, thou canſt not but wonder at the greatneſſe of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eſpecially when thou ſhalt recollect thy ſelf, and think upon thine own unworthineſſe. Thou that didſt not deſerve a beam of his face, what does he give thee a full Sun-ſhine? Thou that could'ſt not look for the leaſt taſte of his love, what does he give thee a whole cluſter of <hi>Canaan?</hi> Thou that didſt not deſerve the leaſt crumb of the hidden Mannah, does he fill thee an Omer full of it? Nay, yet higher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou that didſt deſerve a brand from his Juſtice, does he give thee a ſeal of his love? he might have given thee gall and vineger to drink, and does he flow in upon thee with milk and honey? he might have given thee the firſt flaſhes of hell, and does he give thee the firſt-fruits of heaven? what could'ſt thou have look't for but an eternal frown, and doſt thou meet with ſo gracious a ſmile? O then fall down and adore his goodneſſe, <hi>and let all that is within thee bleſſe his holy name.</hi> Tell me now, is there any ground for pride in ſuch a ſoul? Does not Aſſurance beſpeak humility; and ſpeak a meet dependance?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Times of Aſſurance, they ſhould be times of trampling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature, and ſcorning of things below. Doſt thou now take care for corne, and wine, and oile, when God lifts up the light of his countenance upon thee? is this ſame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Angels food, this ſame hidden Mannah, is it too light meat for thee? Now thou art within the land of Promiſe, feeding upon the grapes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50910:182"/>
and pomegranates of the land, doſt thou now long for the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and onions of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Now thou art within thy fathers houſe, and the fatted Calfe is ſlaine, wilt thou now ſtill feed upon husks? Art thou cloth'd with the Sun, and canſt not thou trample the Moon under thy feet? O let them ſcramble for the world that have nothing elſe to live on. Pray give room to the green Bay-trees to ſpread themſelves abroad; but don't thou loſe thy fatneſſe and ſweetneſſe to rule over theſe. Art thou ſure of heaven, and would'ſt thou fix thy Tabernacle upon earth? Is it good for thee to be here? or would'ſt have any more then the light of Gods countenance? is it not enough that thou art ſure of happineſſe? is not a fountain enough for thee? why wilt thou drink in muddy ſtreames? and thou that art fill'd with the love of a Saviour, canſt thou tell how to ſpend a thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world? is not there more beauty in a Chriſt then in the Creature? is not he <hi>the faireſt of ten thouſand?</hi> Away then with adulterous glances, for why ſhould'ſt thou embrace the boſome of a ſtranger?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Times of Aſſurance they ſhould be times of watchfulneſſe, and more accurate walking with God. To ſin againſt revealed love, is a deep and killing aggravation. To ſin againſt light is too too much, but to ſin againſt love is a great deal more: this height'ned <hi>Solomons</hi> idolatry, (1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9.) that he turn'd from the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which had appeared to him twice. What wilt thou with <hi>Jeſhurun</hi> wax fat and kick, and kick againſt bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els too? To provoke God in a wilderneſſe is not ſo much as to provoke him in a Paradiſe. What could he have done more for thee then he has done! and what couldſt thou have done more againſt him then thou haſt done! and wilt thou ſtill requite him thus? wilt thou provoke him with Mannah in thy mouth? Does he give thee the ſweet cluſters of the land, and doſt thou return him wilde grapes? that which is the ſtrongeſt engagement to obedience, doſt thou make it an encouragement to ſin? art thou ſo willing to daſh thy joy, to loſe thy peace? And O how will it pleaſe the powers of darkneſſe to ſee thee abuſe a beam? The devil has ſeveral deſignes againſt the welfare of a ſoul. Firſt, if it were poſſible he would keep thee from having any grace at all. But ſecondly, if he can't do that, he would keep thee from ſtrength of grace, from growth in grace; he would <hi>break the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50910:183"/>
bruiſed reed,</hi> and he would <hi>quench the ſmoaking flax</hi> But then if he can't prevaile here neither; then in the third place, he would keep thee from ſenſe of grace, in a ſad and cloudy condition: he envies thee one beam, one ſmile, one glance of his eye. But then if the riches of Gods goodneſſe do ſo run over, as that he will give thee a ſenſe of his love; then fourthly, in the laſt place, he would have thee abuſe his grace, and turn it into wantonneſſe. But when God has planted thee in ſo happy a Paradiſe, don't thou liſten to the whiſperings of the Serpent. Thou that art ſeal'd by the Holy Spirit, don't attend to a lying ſpirit. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that great plunderer of ſoules, would faine rob thee of thy Jewels, of thy joy, and peace, and happineſſe: but do thou hide them in a Chriſt, in the wounds of a Saviour; and take heed of blotting thine Evidences; thou that art a Childe of light, be not rul'd by a Prince of darkneſſe. If God give thee a ſenſe of his love, walk more ſtedfaſtly, walk more accurately with thy God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Times of Aſſurance they ſhould be times of inviting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging others in the wayes of grace. Thus the Pſalmiſt, when his Cup overflowes, he calls others to taſte of it, <hi>O taſte and ſee how gracious God is,</hi> that ye may truſt in him. Thou mayeſt now bring a good report upon the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> thou mayeſt ſhew them the goodly fruits of the land, that were cut down at the brook <hi>Eſhcol.</hi> Men look upon Religion as a rigid and auſtere thing, that comes to rob them of their joy, they muſt never have a ſmile more, they muſt never have a Summers day after it; but thou canſt tell them of the ſweetneſſe and deliciouſneſſe that is in the wayes of grace, thou canſt aſſure them that all the wayes of wiſdome are pleaſantneſſe; thou canſt ſatisfie them, that grace does not mean to take away their joy, but only to refine it; that it does not mean to put out the light, but only to ſnuffe it, that it may burn brighter and clearer. There's no ſuch joy to be found in the wayes of ſin, there's no ſuch joy to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from the Creature; no, the ſweeteſt and pureſt honey 'tis ſuck'd from a flower of Paradiſe. Spiritual joy 'tis the moſt clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd joy; I, and 'tis ſolid and maſſy joy, beaten joy, like beaten gold, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. I, and 'tis laſting and durable joy. All the Creatures make but a blaze, but the leaſt ſpark of this 'tis immortal. Can there be a ſweeter Sabbatiſme of Spirit? can there be a happier compoſedneſſe of ſoul, then to be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50910:183"/>
for eternity; to be ſure of heaven, of happineſſe and glory; to have the revealing of Gods love, the diſplaying of himſelf, the beamings out of his face? is not the leaſt appearance of his love more worth then a world? are not the gleanings of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals better then the vintage of temporals? Me thinks an aſſur'd Chriſtian, like a <hi>Caleb</hi> or a <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſhould be able and ready to confute all the falſe intelligence of the Spies, and to anſwer the weak objections that they bring againſt the land of Promiſe. Awake O ſluggard, and ariſe, there is no Lion in the way, or if it be it has honey in it: There are no ſons of <hi>Anak,</hi> or if there be, before <hi>Iſrael</hi> even theſe mountaines ſhall become a Plain.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Times of Aſſurance they ſhould be times of ſtore, <gap reason="foreign">

Then thou mayeſt confidently applaud thy ſelf, <hi>Soul, take thine eaſe, thou haſt goods laid up for many yeares.</hi> Happy thou, if this night thy ſoul be taken from thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Storing up of former evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, is a good proviſion againſt a cloudy day.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Times of Aſſurance ſhould be times of breathing after full poſſeſſion. The eſpouſed ſoule ſhould long for the Nuptials, for the full conſummation of its joy: and by a heavenly gradation it ſhould aſcend in its thoughts. Is there ſuch ſweetneſſe in one cluſter of <hi>Canaan,</hi> what ſhall there be in the full vintage? is there ſuch pleaſantneſſe in a proſpect of the land upon the top of Mount <hi>Piſgah,</hi> what happineſſe ſhall there be in enjoyment of the land? is there ſuch glory in a beam of Gods face, what ſhall there be in an eternal Sun-ſhine? is there ſuch a ſparkling luſtre in the white Stone, what then ſhall there be in all thoſe pearles that garniſh the ſoundations, and make up the gates of the New <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> is there ſo much in the preface of glory, what ſhall there be in the inlargements and amplifications of it? is there ſo much in the <hi>Aenigma,</hi> what is there in the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? can you ſee ſo much beauty in happineſſe, when her Mask is on, how glorious then will ſhe appear when ſhe is unveil'd? does the ſoul ſing ſo ſweetly in a Cage of clay, what melody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> think you, ſhall it then make when 'tis let looſe to all Eternity?</p>
                  <p>We now come to winde up all in a word of Application.</p>
                  <p>Now the more pure and delicious a truth is, the more do the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50910:184"/>
men of the world diſreliſh it: the more bright and ſhining it is, the more offenſive to their eyes. The more orient the Pearle, the more do they trample upon it. Evangelical diſcoveries meet with the fierceſt oppoſitions. The Serpent will be ſure to winde into Paradiſe, and the ſeed of the Serpent ever knew how to ſtill ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous and malignant conſequences, out of ſweet and flowery truthes. 'Tis the devils work to impriſon all truth, but the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more precious truthes muſt be ſure to be put in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and darkeſt dungeons. As here now, Aſſurance of ſalvation, 'tis the very Crown and joy of a Chriſtian; the <hi>Flos lactis,</hi> the Cream of that <gap reason="foreign">

He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt feed upon nothing but duſt, and how does he envy them their hidden Mannah? That Son of the morning is now bound in chaines of darkneſſe, and how does he envy them their light and liberty? how faine would he cloud and eclipſe their Sun, and ſtop it in its race? nay, ſet it ten degrees backward? How does he envy them one beam of Gods face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a grape of <hi>Canaan,</hi> one ſmile, one glance of Gods eye? Now he could finde out no fitter inſtrument to rob Chriſtians of their joy, then Antichriſt that grand enemy of the Church, that ſpiritual <hi>Nero,</hi> that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſoules that vice-<hi>Beelzebub,</hi> that Prince of darkneſſe that rules in the children of diſobedience. He rules them, and yet they are children of diſobedience for all that. This Beſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, (for ſo 'tis ſtill'd in the <hi>Revelation,)</hi> delights only in ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and ſtrikes at ſpirituals. It ſtrikes at the vitals of Religion at the power and eſſence of godlineſſe. Here are the men that muſt cry down Aſſurance under the names of preſumption, ſecurity, an heap of Enthuſiaſmes, as if this hidden Mannah would breed all theſe wormes. If men do but dip in the honey-combe, and take ſome of theſe voluntary drops that ſweat from it freely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of

their own accord, as <hi>Saul</hi> told <hi>Jonathan,</hi> they muſt certainly die for it. O this were a way to open their eyes, as it did <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thant.</hi> They are loth to let men taſte and ſee how gracious God is, leſt they might truſt in him.</p>
                  <p>There are therefore two things which I ſhall here endeavour by way of Application.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to give you a brief diſcovery of thoſe grounds that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate the adverſaries of this truth to deny Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to take off that vain and frivolous cavil, that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a Principle of Libertiniſme, and that if men be once aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd of their ſalvation, they may then do what they liſt.</p>
                  <p>And firſt for the grounds that make them deny Aſſurance. And though I might here ſhew at large, that all Popery, the Quinteſſence of it is extracted out of gueſſes and conjectures, their whole Religion is but a bundle of uncertainties, a rude heap of contingencies, built upon the thoughts of others, upon the intentions of a Prieſt; yet I ſhall let that paſſe now, and give you theſe foure conſiderations that prevaile with them to deny Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They lay too much ſtreſſe upon good works. Now Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is too goodly a ſtructure to be built upon ſuch a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They part ſtakes between grace and merit, and ſo leave the ſoul in a tottering condition. There is ſo much pride bound up in the Spirits of men, as that they are loth to depend upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for their happineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would have an innate and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick happineſſe within themſelves. But alas, ſelf-bottomings are weak and uncertain, and they that build upon their own good meanings, and their good wiſhes and good reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon their good endeavours and goodworks, when they have done all, they have built but the houſe of the Spider. Theſe that ſpin ſalvation out of their own bowels, their hope 'tis but as a Spiders web<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And there are many that neither thus ſpin nor toile; and yet I ſay unto you, that a Phariſee in all his glory is not cloth'd like one of theſe If men do but enquire, and look a little to the ebbings and flowings of their own ſpirits, to the waxing and waining of their own performances: ſurely they will preſently acknowledge, that they can't fetch a Plerophory out of theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believe it, the ſoul can't anchor upon a wave, or upon its own fluctuating motions. So that 'tis a piece of ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50910:185"/>
in them, to tell men, that whileſt they build upon the ſand; they can have no great ſecurity that their houſe will laſt long: they may ſafely ſay of the Spider, that it can have no certainty that its houſe ſhall ſtand. Whileſt they lean upon a reed wee'l al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to queſtion whether it won't break or no; nay, if they pleaſe, they may very well queſtion whether it won't pierce them thorough. They can be ſure of nothing unleſſe they be ſure of ruine. Aſſurance cannot be founded in a bubble, in a creature, for the very eſſence of a creature is doubtful and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, it muſt be built upon an immutable Entity, upon the free love of God in Chriſt, upon his royal word and oath, the ſure expreſſions of his minde and love, upon the witneſſe of the Holy Ghoſt, the ſeal of God himſelf. Here the ſoul may reſt, and lean, and quiet it ſelf, for with God there is no variableneſſe nor ſhadow of turning. The creature is all ſhadow and vanity, 'tis <hi>filia noctis;</hi> like <hi>Jonah's</hi> gourd, man may ſit under its ſhadow for a while, but it ſoon decayes and dies. All its certainty is in dependance upon its God. A creature, if like a ſingle drop left to it ſelf, it ſpends and waſtes it ſelf preſently: but if like a drop in the fountain and Ocean of Being, it has abundance of ſecurity. No ſafety to the ſoul, but in the armes of a Chriſt, in the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Saviour. No reſt to a Dove-like ſpirit, but in the Ark of the Govenant, and there's the pot of hidden Mannah. You know that dying <hi>Bellarmine</hi> was faine to acknowledge, that the neareſt way to Aſſurance, was only to reſt upon the free grace of God in Chriſt. And they that cry down duties ſo much, if they would mean no more then this, that men muſt not truſt in them, nor make Chriſts of them, nor Saviours of them, (as they uſe to expreſs it) wee'l eaſily grant them this if they'l be content with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They take away that claſping and cloſing power of faith it ſelf, by which it ſhould ſweetly and ſtrongly embrace its own object. They would have the ſoul embrace clouds and dwell in generals; they reſolve all the ſweetneſſe and preciouſneſſe of the Goſpel, either into this Univerſal, <hi>Whoſoever believes ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</hi> or elſe, which is all one, into this Conditional, <hi>If thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thou ſhalt be ſaved</hi> Now this is ſo farre from aſſurance, as that the Devils themſelves do thus believe and yet tremble. The thirſty ſoul may know that there is a fountaine but it muſt not preſume to know that ever it ſhall taſte of it. The wounded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50910:185"/>
ſoul (with them) may take notice that there is balme in <hi>Gilead,</hi> but it muſt only give a gueſſe, that it ſhall be heal'd. They won't allow the ſoul to break the ſhell of a Promiſe, ſo as to come to the kernell. They ſilence Faith, when it would ſpeak in its own Idiom, <hi>My Lord, and my God.</hi> O what miſerable comforters are theſe: How can they ever ſpeak one word upon the wheels, one ſeaſonable word to a wearie ſoul; when as all they can reach to, by their own acknowledgement, is to leave the ſoul hovering betwixt heaven and hell? And as they ſay in matter of Reproof, <hi>Generalia non pungunt:</hi> ſo 'tis as true in matter of Comfort, <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralia non mulcent.</hi> Yet to ſee how abundantly unreaſonable theſe men are; for in the matter of their Church, there they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a particular appropriating faith, a Monopolizing faith, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only true viſible Church: and this is no preſumption with them. Thus they can embrace a dull Errour, and let go a precious Truth. But the true Church of Chriſt, as 'tis it ſelf built upon a Rock; ſo every Member of the Church has the ſame ſecurity. And the ſoul with a Spouſe-like affection, do's not only conjecture who is her Well-beloved, but is in his very armes, and breaks out into that expreſſion of love and union; <hi>I am my well-beloved's, and my well-beloved is mine.</hi> But how ſtrangely do's their conjectural certainty take away the ſweetneſs of ſuch Relations? Chriſtians with them muſt only conjecture that they are the Sons of God, the Spouſe muſt only gueſſe at her beloved husband; the ſheep muſt hope that this is the Shepherds voice. O how do they emaſculate and enervate Religion! how do they diſpirit it, and cut the very ſinews of the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe! But all you that would finde reſt to your ſouls, muſt know that you can never apply a Chriſt too much, that you can never appropriate a Saviour enough, that whole happineſſe is in union with him.</p>

And though the outward Sun-ſhine with liberal and undiſtinguiſhing beams, ſhines both upon the good and the bad, upon the Roſe and Nettle; yet the light of Gods countenance beams out only upon the Apples of his own eye: the Sun-ſhine of his gracious preſence, gilds only the veſſels of Honour, and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50910:187"/>
puts a luſtre upon none but his own Jewels. And though the pourings forth of ordinary goodneſſe fall upon a wilderneſſe ſometimes, as well as on a Paradiſe; yet theſe more choiſe and luſcious influences of heaven, ſlide only into the hearts of Gods peculiar ones.

Thus nettles will ſting moſt violently, when they are handled moſt gently. Thus the wretched <hi>Indians</hi> adore the Devil, becauſe he is their enemy, and neglect the Majeſty of heaven, becauſe 'tis ſo propitious. When God ſhines out upon ungrateful dunghils, they returne him nothing but venomous and malignant evaporations. We'l eaſily acknowledge, that if theſe men ſhould have the White Stone, they would trample upon it: For you ſee how they deal with ordinary mercy, which the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heaven heaps upon their heads.</p>
                  <p>There are ſuch Pleonaſms of love in God, ſuch runnings over of goodneſſe, as that much falls upon theſe. God breaks the box of common mercies, and fills the whole world with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it. But what tribute and Revenues of glory has he from them for all this?

Do you think he will poure wine into it? No, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals his love to none but to his friends; he ſets his Seale to none, but to ſuch whom he ſets as a Seale upon his heart and on his arme; ſuch as have an happy conformity to him, and a full complyance with him; ſuch as have the ſame intereſts, and the ſame glorious

Theſe men only tell us what they would do if they had Aſſurance; but truly they are not like to have it, till their hearts be chang'd, and then they'l be of another minde.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Love is a ſweeter and ſurer and ſtronger principle of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience then feare. So that God did infatuate the counſel of that <hi>Achitophel, Machiavel</hi> I mean, when he ſtill'd that venom into the hearts of Princes, that they had better rule their Subjects with a Rod of iron, then with a Scepter of gold; that they had better enſlave them by feare, then engage them by love. The truth is, he had given them ſuch Rules, that he knew if they follow'd them, they could not poſſibly be lov'd; and therefore he would faine perſwade them, that 'tis better to be fear'd. And though this may ſeem to adde ſome ſparklings to Majeſty, and to brighten the Crown of Sovereignty; yet it leaves it farre more tottering, more unfixt and unſettled upon their heads. There is ſuch a virulency mixt with fear: ſuch a tincture of hatred in it; both theſe affections are much of a colour, ſad and pale. And therefore that Tyrant was ſo wiſe yet as to expect hatred; <hi>Ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint dum metuant,</hi> ſayes he, he knew whileſt they fear'd him, that they would hate him; And then there is a reluctancy and Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in fear; And thoſe workings upon the ſoul, that come only from terrours, they uſually prove Abortive. And what though a body be pull'd and hal'd and ſcar'd into obedience? the ſoul is not conquer'd with all this. A ſlave do's but watch an opportunity for ſhaking off the yoke. And then there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing and diſenabling power in fear, it contracts and freezes up the motions of the ſoul; it clips the wings, it takes off the wheels,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50910:188"/>
it unbends the bowe. Trembling and Paralytick motions are weak and languiſhing. Indeed fear 'tis nothing but <hi>Praecox triſtitia,</hi> a crude and indigeſted kinde of ſorrow; and 'tis the ſowrer, becauſe it is not ripe. And therefore God himſelf that is a moſt abſolute Monarch, and has a boundleſſe and infinite ſupremacy over all things; yet has far more glory from them that love him, and only paſſive obedience from them that fear him. Indeed he never goes about to rule any by fear, but thoſe that have firſt trampl'd upon Love, and are no longer Subjects, but profeſt Rebells. 'Tis love that glews and faſtens the whole Creation together. Thoſe ſeeds of love which God himſelf, (who is love) has ſcatter'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Beings; thoſe ſparks of love which God himſelf, (who is love,) has kindled amongſt Beings, and thoſe indeleble prints of love which God himſelf, (who is love,) has ſtampt upon Beings, maintain the whole fabrick of the world in its juſt beauty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. The harmonious compoſure of Beings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the tuning of the ſeveral ſtrings, makes them ſound out his praiſe more melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. O how comely is it to ſee the ſweet context and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Beings, the loving connexion and concatenation of cauſes: one being eſpous'd to another in faithfulneſſe and truth; the mutual claſpings and twinings, the <hi>due benevolence</hi> of entities. Behold, <hi>how goodly a thing it is</hi> and pleaſant to behold Beings, <hi>like Brethren to dwell together in unity:</hi> It calls to minde thoſe preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous drops of love, that fall from the head of the firſt Being, and fell down upon the skirts of inferiour entities. And is not there as much of this love to be ſeen in the new Creation, in the work of grace in the ſoul? Is not the foundation of the ſecond Temple laid in love? is not the top and pinacle of it ſet up by a hand of love? Are not the poliſhings and carvings of it, the works and expreſſions of love? the witty inventions of love? Is not the ſtructure maintain'd and repair'd at the conſtant expences of love? Is it not inhabited by a Prince of love? one more loving then <hi>Solomon</hi> is there; nay, what is the whole Goſpel elſe, but <gap reason="foreign">

They have not only as we here below, ſome drops and ſprinklings of happineſſe; but they are at the very Fountain, and have freſh bubblings of joy, full ſtreamings out of ſweetneſſe, and can ſwim in the rivers of pleaſure.

What though there be ſome unworthy dealings with their God, yet theſe flow only from thoſe reliques of ſlaviſh principles that remain in them, ſome fragments of the old Leaven that was not throughly purged out. And not by vertue of a Goſpel-Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory. What do's the knowing that they are Sons of light, do's this diſpoſe them to works of darkneſſe? Do's the knowing that they are the Spouſe of Chriſt, do's this beſpeak adulterous glances? 'Tis true, the Sons of God may provoke him, but muſt they therefore needs do it under this very notion, becauſe they know they are his Sons? nay, muſt they do it the more for this? This were the extreameſt malice that were imaginable; more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice then the devils themſelves are capable of. What bold blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy then is this againſt the Sons of God, and againſt the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit. I, and it envolves a flat contradiction too, it puts an <hi>eſſe</hi> and a <hi>non eſſe ſimul;</hi> becauſe they know they are friends, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they'l deal like enemies; and becauſe they know they'r Sons, therefore they'l deal like ſlaves. O what fine repugnancies are theſe? Thus would they not only veile and cloud, but alſo ſpot and deface ſo beautiful a Truth; but that it ſhines out with ſuch victorious and triumphant beams. But if any can yet doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſurance do advance obedience, let them but a while com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men aſſur'd of their ſalvation: (1.) With others in the ſtate of grace that want Aſſurance, or with themſelves when once

without it: And then let them tell us, whether they don't differ as much as a bruiſed Reed, and a ſtately Cedar in <hi>Lebanon?</hi> The doubting Chriſtian do's but ſmoake, when the aſſured Chriſtian flames. What faintings and ſhiverings and paleneſs in the one? what vigour and livelineſs, what a ruddy complexion of ſoul in the other? How is the one left to the pleaſure of a wave, when as the other lies ſafe at Anchor. The one can ſcarce lift up his weak and trembling hands in prayer, when the other is wreſtling with Omnipotency. The one comes behinde and touches the hem of his Saviours garments, when as the other is in his very armes and embraces. The one dares ſcarce touch a Promiſe, ſcarce caſt an eye upon a Promiſe; when as the other claimes it, and graſps it, and appropriates it. The performances of the one are green, and crude, and unconcocted; the others are ripen'd, and mellow'd with a ſtronger Sun-beam of Love. The one like a Lute with his ſtrings looſe and languiſhing; the other is tun'd up to its juſt height of affection. The one like a Bowe bent, ſends forth his arrows very vigorouſly; the other do's but drop them, and let them fall. How do's Satan wound the one with many a fiery dart, that the other quenches! How do's the one fear the roaring of the Lion, which the other tramples under his feet! (2.) If you ſhould compare them with men in an unregenerate condition; O what a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, what a vaſte gulfe is there between them? Sure you don't queſtion, whether God has more ſervice from <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that feed upon <hi>hidden Manna;</hi> or from <hi>Egyptians</hi> that feed upon Garlick and Onions? Men that are under the damning and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering power of luſts, and are only kept a little in awe, by ſome thundrings from Mount <hi>Sinai:</hi> Though they ſpend a few ſighs ſometimes, and drop a few teares ſometimes; yet when they are thus waſht, how ſoon do they returne to their wallowing in the mire? The chaining of a Wolfe, do's that meeken and ſoften him? or the putting a hook into <hi>Leviathan,</hi> do's that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him? Though wicked men by feares and terrours have their bounds ſet them, like the Sea, which they cannot paſſe; Yet they are ſtill like the raging Sea, they ſwell and foame and caſt out their mire and dirt. And who more wicked then they that are deſperate? Thoſe black and damned Potentates of hell, becauſe they are out of all poſſibility of mercy; how do they act <hi>ad extremum virium</hi> in all expreſſions of malice and wickedneſſe?
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:50910:191"/>
And therefore God out of his infinite goodneſs, though he do's u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſeal men up to life and happineſſe, and lets them make their Calling and Election ſure; yet he do's ſcarce ever, or very rarely ſo ſeal men up to ruine, ſo as to let them know certainly that they are Reprobates: for this would make them deſperate; there would be no living with them in the world. Or if he do's ſhew them this, he do's withall let them run into ſome act of violence, that preſently frees the world from them. That hope which wicked men have of being ſav'd, though it be groundleſſe, yet it keeps them within their bounds and compaſſe. Though it be but like the Spiders web; yet the very ſpinning of that web, keeps them in the mean while from a full expreſſion of their venome. And that ſame ſhadow of obedience which God has from Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, 'tis founded in ſome ſhadow of hope that they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in: and when this hope of their own framing vaniſhes and deceives them, then they back-ſlide and apoſtatize.</p>

God will make his own people know that 'tis a bitter thing to depart from him, and to forſake their firſt love.

                  <p n="1">(1.) They may fall from Aſſurance. Though they can't loſe the ſeed and the root of grace, yet they may loſe the flouriſhing and fragrancy of it. Though the foundation of God remaine ſure, yet they may fall from their top and eminency. Though they be built upon a Rock, yet they may be daſht with waves. Though the Seale of God be of an eternal efficacy, yet they may deface the Print and ſculpture of it, ſo as that it may not be viſible to their eye. Now what a ſad alteration will this be? Thou muſt not look for any more ſtroakings, for any more ſmiles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glances any more. Thou muſt bid thy fountaines of joy farewell. Thou muſt not look to ſee thy Spouſe flouriſhing through the Lattices any more. Thou muſt expect clouds, and ſhadows, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50910:191"/>
veils, and curtaines, and walls of ſeparation. The fig-tree of <hi>Canaan</hi> ſhall not bloſſome, and there ſhall be no fruit in the Vines, and the labour of the Olive ſhall faile. Thou muſt paſſe many a day without one Sun-beam; God will ſeal up his ſweeteſt influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, he will ſhut up the windows of heaven and ſtop the bottles of heaven; he will rain down no more Manna upon thee. Go to thy husks, and ſee if they I feed thee. Nay</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) They may not only fall from Aſſurance, but even in a total deſertion look upon God as an enemy, and inſtead of a filial Plerophory, may come to afearful expectation of the fierceſt wrath of God. Now this I ſay is more judgement then wicked men are capable of here; in this reſpect that they never had his love once revealed to them: Whereas theſe are thrown down from the very pinacle of the Temple. And God do's not only eclipſe the luſtre of their former joy; but dips his Pen in gall, and writes bitter things againſt them. He was wont to ſhoot nothing but the fiery darts of Love; I, but now his envenom'd arrowes ſtick faſt in them. They did once furfet of the Grapes and Cluſters of <hi>Canaan;</hi> but now he hedges them in with briers and thornes. They were wont to taſte of a cup of ſweetneſſe, a cup of love; but he has now prepar'd for them a cup of trembling and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They had once a Spring-time, a budding, a bloſſoming-time, the dew of heaven dropt on them, the beams of heaven vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited them: But now comes a ſad and diſconſolate Autumne, a fading and withering time. Their gloſſe and greenneſſe is gone; Heaven reveales it ſelf in thunderings and lightning flaſhes againſt them, ſo as they ſhall even envy green Bay-trees, then men of the world that are free from all this. Now is not this enough to keep a ſoul in awe? The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was very neer this which we ſpeak of; He often tells you, that his joy was put out, that his peace was gone, that he was even ground to powder, that he was baniſht from the face of his God; that he was excommunicated from that happy and heavenly intercourſe with God, which once he had. Theſe are frequent complaints; And yet he was one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As if he had been one of the Church triumphant, he was alwayes ſinging freſh <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> He had a ſoft and delicate touch upon the Harpe, he could ſtill <hi>Sauls</hi> evil ſpirit with his muſick; I, but he could not thus tune and compoſe his own troubled and diſtemper'd ſpirit. He was faine now to hang his Harpe upon the willows; and the voice of his Lute was turn'd into ſighing. And if he do's ſing ſometimes with a thorne at his breaſt, 'tis ſome penitential Pſalme or other.</p>

And then for when he do's ſo often envy the men of the world, and is ready to ſtumble at the proſperity of the wicked; it was not ſo much for the outward things of the world which they enjoy'd, for thoſe he had himſelf too in a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful meaſure; but it was for the quietneſſe of their ſpirits, they were calme and ſerene, if compared with him, not in ſuch fears and doubts as he now was: they had not ſuch conflicts and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſmes and tumultuations of ſoul as he now had. And yet he was one that once had the face of God ſhining out upon him.

O but ſtay a while, there are moſt myſterious things, which lurke at the bottome, and require a profounder ſearch: they muſt dive deep before they fetch up theſe Pearls.

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:50910:193"/>
It requires diligence; For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are but few that have any right and intereſt in the love of God in Chriſt, at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of thoſe few that have a ſhare and portion in his love, yet all of them have not aſſurance of his love. There are but few that enter into the Temple; I, but there is only ſome <hi>Aaron</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the <hi>ſanctum ſanctorum,</hi> and caſts his Anchor within the Veile. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there are but few upon whom God beſtoweth his love. 'Twas alwayes a principle in Morality, that ſweet and intimate friendſhip cannot be extended to many. Friends uſually go by paires. Now God, though he be of vaſt and boundleſſe love, and has love enough to ſatisfie a multitude of worlds, yet he has choſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o concentricate it all in a few pickt out of the world: that he might thus engage them the more to himſelf. His large and precious love is kept for his only Spouſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, of thoſe few whom he loves, ſome are not aſſur'd of his love. He lov'd them all from everlaſting, yet none of them could be then aſſur'd of his love. A non-entity cannot reach to a Plerophory. Well, but when they peept out of their firſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, truly they were not any rare objects of love: much leſſe could they then be aſſur'd of the love of their God; when they were in a ſtate of enmity and oppoſition, and the children of wrath as well as others: Well, but when he put them into a ſtate of love, and made them lovely with that beauty and comelineſſe, with thoſe jewels and bracelets, which he had put upon them: when he lov'd them as his new creatures, as his veſſels of honour, that were now caſt into their juſt mold and faſhion: When he lov'd them, as his new-born ſons: yet theſe babes in Chriſt could not preſently cry <hi>Abba Father.</hi> They were his Epiſtle, written in a fair and goodly character, dated from eternity, folded up and kept ſecret, at length ſent into the world: the ſuperſcription was writ in time, in Vocation: Well, but all this while they were not ſeal'd, till the ſpirit comes and ſtamps a clear impreſſion of Gods love upon their ſoft'ned and melted ſpirits. 'Tis true, they were ſeal'd as ſoone as they were written, in Gods eternal Decree, but they were not viſibly ſeal'd, till now. Now what pantings and breathings? What longings and entreaties? What prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations were there in the ſoul, before it could <hi>obtaine</hi> this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:50910:193"/>
Secondly, it requires diligence to <hi>keep</hi> aſſurance. O take heed of waſting and crumbling away thy hidden Manna. God may break the ſtaffe of bread, and what will thy weary ſoul do then? Take heed of loſing the White Stone, take heed of forgetting thy new name. O maintain the Oile of gladneſſe in the Cruſe. Thou that art a Vine of <hi>Canaan</hi> laden with generous fruit; would'ſt thou willingly part with thy ſweetneſſe, and fruifulneſſe? Thou that art a green Olive-tree flouriſhing in the houſe of thy God; would'ſt thou be content to part with thy fatneſſe, and pleaſantneſſe? Thou wert wont to ſtay and Anchor thy ſoul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy God; And would'ſt thou now be left to the courteſie of a wave? What? Art thou in love with the Tents of <hi>Kedar?</hi> They are black indeed; And do'ſt thou think them comely too? Art thou weary of the Sun-ſhine? And would'ſt thou coole thy ſelf in the ſhade? Do'ſt thou begin to loath thy hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Manna, and would'ſt thou returne to the Garlick and Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Egypt?</hi> Art thou cloy'd with the cluſters of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and do'ſt thou nauſeate the Honey-comb? O remember, thou did ſt not ſo ſoone obtaine aſſurance, and wilt thou ſo ſoone loſe it?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, give diligence to <hi>recover</hi> aſſurance, if loſt: O when will the winter be paſt? when will the raine be over and gone? that the flowers may appear, and the time of ſinging may come: That the Vines of <hi>Canaan</hi> may flouriſh again, that the tender Grapes may appear. <hi>Awake O South-winde, and with thy gentle breathings, blow upon the Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out!</hi> Never leave till thou find'ſt thy Spouſe again, thou that art ſick of love: Tell him that thou long'ſt for a cluſter of <hi>Canaan;</hi> That thou art even famiſh'd for want of hidden Manna. Deſire a new edition of his love, with all the enlargements of affections. Lay thine heart before him, and deſire new ſtamps &amp; impreſſions; tel him that though thou haſt loſt the print, yet he has not loſt the Seal: Tell him that thou wilt now prize his love more then thou ever did'ſt or could'ſt do before. Give him no reſt, till he give thy ſoul reſt, and fill it with himſelf. Surely thou would'ſt not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet in a cloud: thou would'ſt not go out of the world with thine Evidences blotted and blurr'd: Surely thou would'ſt not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be toſt and daſht with waves in ſight of the haven. Had'ſt thou not rather go to thy grave in peace? O deſire himto ſhine out upon thee a little before thou goeſt hence, and be nomore ſeene.</p>

And yet Chriſtians may fruſtrate him here too, and by a ſtrong and claſping hand of faith, may lay ſuch faſt hold of a God in Chriſt, as that they may even make the Devill give over: and to all his former, may adde this new deſpair of ever eclipſing their glory: and may ſend him away as weary as he would be, if he ſhould go about to interrupt the joy of a glorifi'd Saint, or of one of thoſe Angels that ſtill dwel in glory.

with thoſe weak wiſhes and velleities, that are ſo frequent in the mouths of many, O that we were ſure of heaven, of happineſſe! O that our ſouls were well provided for! O that we knew what ſhould become of them to eternity! Truly theſe are but gaping and yawning deſires, as if hidden Manna would drop into their mouths. This great bleſſing requires a wreſtling prayer. The White Stone is given to none but a Conquerour. The Spirit won't ſet his ſeal to a faint and languiſhing velleity. An Echo won't anſwer a whiſperer; a weak voice is not worth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
                  <p>The truth is, there is a great deal of Vicinity and friendſhip, nay I think I might ſay Conſanguinity, between Aſſurance and Prayer.

                  <p n="3">3. Be diligent and frequent in <hi>communion</hi> with thy God. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with God puts a luſtre and radiancy upon the ſoul; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to the creature, puts a Veile upon that former bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ſweet and familiar entercourſe with thy God, puts thee into the number of his friends; and friendſhip brings Aſſurance and Confidence along with it.</p>

And couldſt thou but recover thy former neerneſſe to him, thou need'ſt not doubt of the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate expreſſions from him. Communion with God, 'tis that which gives an heavenly and eternal Plerophory; 'tis that which maintains the aſſurance of glorious Angels, and glorifi'd Saints. And that which takes away all hope from the damn'd is this, that they are perpetually baniſht, irrecoverably excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from the face of their God: <hi>Depart from me, I know you not:</hi> there is more in that then in fire and brimſtone.

You know that the Apoſtle <hi>Thomas,</hi> when he was abſent from the Apoſtles meeting, he fell into a ſtrange diſtruſt of that which the others were very well aſſur'd of. Go then to thoſe Ordinances, that drop golden Oile upon the ſoul, and make its countenance to ſhine. Hide thy ſelf in thoſe clefts of the Rock, that God may make his goodneſſe paſſe before thee.

                  <p>'Tis a miſerable thing to toile for vanity and emptineſſe; to ſowe the winde, and to reap the whirlewinde. But to take pains for happineſſe, who would not be willing to this? An Iſraelite

that would be loath to ſpend his time in gathering ſtubble, would willingly ſpend it in gathering Grapes. A wiſe Virgin will cheerfully put in ſo much Oile, as will make the Lampe to ſhine. The ſoul will never be weary of gathering hidden Manna. Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a very ſatisfactory thing; men take a preſent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat acquieſcence in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider it in Temporals, what won't worldlings do to ſecure their lands, and goods, and eſtates? How do they ſeek for Bonds, and Seals, and Oaths, and Sureties; and yet think all this too little? They have ſet up an Enſurers Office, and will ſcarce venture a Ship at Sea, unleſſe it can have an unqueſtionable Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophory; unleſſe one will ſecure it from warres; and another from rocks; and a third from windes and tempeſts. And this is one of thoſe ſtings and vexations which God has put into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, that they are uncertain. Many a worldling has pin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way under this very notion, that his riches had wings, and could flie away when they liſt. And this was the reaſon, why the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures were all for enjoying the preſent moment; becauſe that was all they were certain of; and therefore they would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd and ſoopt up the quinteſſence of all happineſſe in a <gap reason="foreign">

And this was that which made the Heathen ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with Fortune, a goddeſſe of their own framing, becauſe ſhe put them alwayes upon blinde uncertainties, This made the Stoicks to run into the other extreme, to fix themſelves in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable certainty, in a ſullen neceſſity, to anchor upon fate, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to be left to a wavering contingency.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Aſſurance in Intellectuals is very ſatisfactory. There's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that tortures the ſoule more then ſcruples and difficulties; it makes it to dwell like a lily amongſt thornes.</p>
                  <p>The Scepticks were a perpetual wrack to themſelves. Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons flie like duſt into the ſoules eye, and ſometimes 'tis faine to weep them out. How does it vex the Naturaliſt that his head is ſo non-pluſt, as that he muſt flie to the refuge of an occult quality? How impatient was <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> what boylings and toſlings in his breaſt more then in <hi>Euripus,</hi> becauſe he could not give a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ebbing and flowing of that river? He threw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into it, as if he thought to finde more reſt there then in his own ſpirit, diſcompoſed only with this uncertainty. Every que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50910:197"/>
checks the underſtanding, and makes it remove a little from certainty, as the learned <hi>Verulam</hi> obſerves. Every queſtion 'tis ſome grace to errour, and ſome repulſe to truth.</p>
                  <p>But how ſweetly does the minde reliſh thoſe firſt and common notions, that carry a native light, and convincing evidence and certainty in them, and won't give the ſoule leave to doubt? and how does it bathe it ſelf in thoſe cryſtalline ſtreamings out, thoſe pure derivations of ſecondary notions, that freely bubble out from theſe fountain-principles, which for their certainty ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are honoured with the name of axioms? And ſome give this rule for a trial and touchſtone of notions: Whatſoever Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minde does fully cloſe with, that is unqueſtionably true, becauſe the minde can't reſt ſatisfi'd but with certainty. And that which it gives but an hovering and imperfect aſſent to, is but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably true. Now though ſometimes a falſity may come under the faire diſguiſe of an apparent certainty, yet this is alſo ſure, that the minde cannot ſo fully and ſweetly acquieſce in an appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent certainty, as in a real certainty. As neither can the Will ſo fully cloſe with an apparent good, as with a real good; for in realities there is a ſure Entity at the bottom, which is a juſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for appearance, whereas the other is a meer colour, a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, a ſhadow. And the more perfect any intellectual being is, the more of certainty it has.</p>
                  <p>Our knowledge therefore here is but cloudy and enigmatical, ſhadowy and in a glaſſe. The nearer to God any being is, the more it has of certainty. And therefore the Angels and Spirits that ſee God face to face, are ſatisfied with his image. Truth then plucks off her veile, pulls off her mask, that the ſoule may ſalute her. And this is the great Prerogative of that infinite and ſupream Being, God himſelf, that he has an independent and eternal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and beholds all beings and motions of beings paſt, preſent, and to come, without the leaſt ſhadow of variation. And thoſe things which poſe created beings, are more plain and obvious to his eye, then firſt principles are to ours. The very intimate formes of beings are naked and anatomiz'd before him. He looks down upon the ſons of men, and ſees them rolling and fluctuating, toſt and tumbl'd up and down in uncertainties, ſometimes even queſtioning him in his wayes and his dealings, while as he reſts in a full and abſolute Omniſcience. And this is his great goodneſſe,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50910:197"/>
that he allowes us Certainty in thoſe things that concern our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and happineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In ſpirituals and eternals, Aſſurance is very ſatisfactory. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould be above ſyllogiſmes &amp; diſputings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spiritual notions ſhould have the ſeale of God in their foreheads; they are not to be ſtruck like ſparks out of a flint: but are to ſpring like light from the Sun; they are to flow like ſtreames from the Ocean. And Principles of Religion muſt be built upon a rock, upon the moſt ſure and unqueſtionable grounds that can be. Men that build for eternity, had need to lay the foundation ſure, and they muſt build gold and precious ſtones upon the foundation, that which has a ſolidity, and a firme Certainty in it. And if this were obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You would not have ſuch jarres and diviſions in the Church. You would not be ſo much troubled with the noiſe of Axes and Hammers. Impoſing things queſtionable as certain, is agreeable to that ſpirit, which allowes no other Aſſurance but this; that their Church is the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The mixing and blending of Religion with uncertainties, is that which does emaſculate, and diſpirit, and endanger it; 'tis a daſhing the wine with water; 'tis an adulterating the gold with droſſe, ſo as it won't endure the fiery triall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The taking up Religion upon uncertain grounds, does put men upon an odious luke-warmneſſe and neutrality: for men can't be zealous for a thing they doubt of. It puts them upon variableneſſe and unconſtancy, upon the very brim of Apoſtaſie; and (it may be) plunges them into it. Nay, it ſtrongly tends to Atheiſme: ſome do ſo long queſtion, which is the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as that at length they reſolve to have none at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The leaving the ſucceſſe of Religion uncertain, do's damp and coole the ſpirits of men. The learned Moraliſts amongſt the Heathen, could never content themſelves with a faire probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty only of <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> but did ſpin it out to an imaginary certainty. The Stoicks would have a domeſtick Plerophory, they muſt be unavoidably happy: A meere certainty won't ſuffice them, it muſt be condens'd into a neceſſity. A wiſe man with them muſt irreverſibly ſeale up himſelf to happineſſe: And ſo though he were in <hi>Phalaris</hi> his Bull, he muſt glory and triumph and ſing Halelujahs. But the fairer Moraliſts, were willing to depend more upon the bounty of heaven, which yet they lookt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50910:198"/>
upon as a ſure and unqueſtionable thing; nay, they pleas'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not only in a Plerophory, but in a preſent poſſeſſion. For you know vertue with them was <hi>Praecox <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eatitudo,</hi> as grace with us is glory not fully ripe. And ſerenity of natural conſcience was their hidden Manna; their White Stone. Thus were they fain to ſtill their ſouls in ſome ſhadows and appearances of certainty. This ſweetned <hi>Socrates</hi> his Cicute, and made him a cheerful Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr for Philoſophy.</p>
                  <p>And all wicked men that go on merrily and ſecurely in their wayes, do frame ſome imaginary certainty to themſelves; which (it may be) they found upon ſure principles, but falſly apply'd; as this, <hi>That God is merciful,</hi> or the like.</p>
                  <p>All this I bring to ſhew that the ſoul do's catch at certainty, and Aſſurance, and will reſt ſatisfi'd with nothing elſe. For, for men to apprehend themſelves uncertain of happineſſe, what is it elſe but to be for the preſent miſerable? Nay, would not ſome (do you think) chooſe rather to be certain of a tolerable miſery, then to be in continual ſuſpence of happineſſe? And truly ſuch men as have no Aſſurance of obtaining this great end of their being, they are of all creatures moſt miſerable.</p>
                  <p>The Foxes have holes, and the birds of the aire have neſts, and ſhall not the ſons of men have where to lay their heads? Every being loves certainty: How do Naturals combine together and unite their forces, that they may ſecure themſelves by an happy aſſociation? Nature will have a Plerophory, won't admit of a <hi>vacuum,</hi> the leaſt ſchiſme and rupture would prove fatal and put it upon uncertainties. Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> ſpies this in thoſe fallings down of water, that threed and ſpin themſelves into ſuch ſlender <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tillicids, that thus they may preſerve their continuity, and when they can reach no longer ſo, then they fall in as plump and round a figure as they can.</p>
                  <p>And if every Being loves Aſſurance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſurely ſuch a noble Being as the ſoul of man, cannot be ſatiated with a changeable good; it can't fix it ſelf upon a moveable centre.

for the other, and ſo to tremble at the very thoughts of eternity; is not this a piece of the gnawing worme? and muſt the ſoul live in this perpetual ſlavery? Is there no redemption from it? Did not Chriſt come to take away this ſting among the reſt? Did not he come to draw thee to himſelf, to quiet thee in his own boſome? Return thee to thy Reſt, O my Soul! Return to thine Arke, O my Dove! And look upon this Goſpel-Plerophory, as one of thoſe great priviledges that were purchas'd for thee by a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this, thy Soul, thy darling, 'tis fully provided for, for eternity. Thy lot is falne to thee in a faire ground, and thou haſt a goodly heritage; Could thy ſoul open its mouth any wider? Could thy ſoul deſire any more then this, to be ſure of being for ever compleatly happy? What would the damn'd in hell give for a poſſibility of happineſſe? What would ſome wounded ſpirits give for good hopes and probabilities? when as thou in the mean time haſt an overflowing Plerophory. What would the one give for a drop to coole their tongue? What would the other give for a pure ſtream to waſh their bleeding foules? When as thou all the while art bathing in the fountain, art ſailing in the Ocean, art ſwimming in the Rivers of pleaſure. Thine underſtanding may well reſt ſatisfi'd, for t'is ſure to fixe its eye upon an eternal beauty; upon the face of its God. Thy will may reſt it ſelf in the embraces of its deareſt object: for 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſed to the faireſt good, and is ſure to enjoy it with an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluble union. Thy purer and more refined affections may ſport themſelves in the Sun-beams of heaven. There may thy love warme and melt it ſelf, and there may thy joy dance and exult. All that thou haſt to do here below, is this; Thy Virgin-ſoul that is here aſſur'd and contracted, muſt wait a while for the Nuptials, for a full fruition of its God, for a full conſummation of its joy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This muſt needs ſweeten all preſent conditions to thee. Eat then thy bread with joy; and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God accepts thy perſon, and ſmells a ſweet odour in thy ſacrifice. Are there any pearles in the Goſpel? thou may'ſt lay claime to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Is there any balme in <hi>Gilead?</hi> thou haſt a ſhare in it. Are there any Goſpel-priviledges? thou know'ſt they are thine, and are intended for thee. Do's God beſtow tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals

                  <p n="1">1. Thou are ſecure againſt the ſrownes of the world, for heaven ſmiles upon thee. Thou may'ſt laugh at the falſe judging and eſteems of men. It may be, the world brands; I, but the Spirit ſeales. It may be the ſeed of the Serpent hiſſes; I, but the holy Ghoſt breaths. What, though thou beeſt fourty years in a Wilderneſſe? Nay, what though thou beeſt ſeventy years in <hi>Babylon?</hi> Won't <hi>Canaan,</hi> and won't the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> make amends for all?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou art ſecure in times of judgement. As <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> The ſword of him that layes at him cannot hold, the ſpeare, the dart, nor the habergeon. The arrow cannot make him flee, darts are counted as ſtubble; he laughs at the ſhaking of the ſpear. Who is like him upon the earth, one that is made without fear? When God thunders upon the men of the world, he ſpeaks but in a ſtill voice to thee; he darts lightning flaſhes in their faces, but he <hi>liſts up the light of his countenance upon thee.</hi> Judgements are intended for the ſweeping away of Spiders webs, not for the ſweeping away of Gods own jewels. Or if they be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in a common calamity, yet how is it roll'd up in ſweetneſſe to them? when as the other can taſte nothing but gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. Their body may be toſs'd a little in the world, but their ſoul lies ſafe at Anchor.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the houre of death. Thou know'ſt that providence then, means only to break the ſhell, that it may have the kernel. Let them tremble at the knockings and approaches of death that know not what ſhall become of their precious ſoules: Men who through the fear of death have been all theirlife-time ſubject unto bondage? But thou may'ſt ſafely trample upon the Adder, and play in the Cockatices den. The Martyrs (you know) did thus, when they embrac'd the flames, and complemented with Lions, and devour'd torments, and came to them with an appetite. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of the love of God in Chriſt, this and nothing but this pulls out the ſting of death. 'Tis true, that death has loſt its ſting in reſpect of all that are in Chriſt; but yet ſuch as know not
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50910:199"/>
that they are in Chriſt, fear death ſtill as if it had a ſting: Only an aſſured Chriſtian triumphs over it; <hi>O death, where is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The reall preſence of a mercy is not enough, but there muſt be the appearance of a mercy, and the ſenſe of it, before it fill thy heare with joy, and thy mouth with praiſe. A doubting Chriſtian is like a bird entangled and in a ſnare, the ſoul has not its comfort, nor God has not his praiſe: But an aſſur'd Chriſtian is like a bird at liberty, that flies aloft, and ſings moſt cheerfully; It begins thoſe <hi>Halelujahs</hi> in time, that muſt laſt for ever; It breaks out into the <hi>Pſalmiſts</hi> language, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſſe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>

And this is ſufficiently warranted from the juſt order and method of this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Apoſtolical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>Make your Calling and Election ſure;</hi> Firſt your Calling, then your Election; and by your Calling, your Election: <hi>Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Analytica</hi> beſt becoming creatures.</p>
                  <p>Many have handled this point at large; I ſhall do it very briefly, and I ſhall give you all that I intend to ſpeak to it in theſe ſix particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Election in it ſelf is ſecret and myſterious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For (1.) it is from eternity, and ſo there was none could know it but God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; none could know Election, but he that made an Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A Being that is ſpann'd by time, cannot reach to what was done from everlaſting: You cannot imagine that Non-entity ſhould liſten and hear what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was whiſperd in the Secret Councel of Heaven. Thou goeſt only by the clock of time; but thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees were written with an eternal Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>beam; thou turneſt up thy houre-glaſſe of time, but theſe were meaſured by an infinite du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Was it poſſible that <hi>Eſau</hi> not borne ſhould ſee God frowning on him; or that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould perceive a ſmile? Thou art as far from meriting Election as a Non entity and thou art as far from knowing it as a Non-entity. (2) God has a minde to keep it ſecret, and therefore he has ſet a ſeale upon it; not only a ſeale of certainty, but a ſeale of ſecrecy. You know creatures
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50910:200"/>
themſelves have their cloſet-determinations; men have their thoughts under lock and key; they have not windows into one anothers breaſts, much leſſe into the breaſt of a Deity. Thou cauſt not fathome ſometimes a ſhallow creature, and do'ſt thou think to reach to the bottome of infinite depths? Has God given thee ſecret ſprings of working; has he made the wheeles and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thy ſoul ſecret, and undiſcernable, and may he not have the ſame priviledge himſelf? So then, if God has put a vaile upon Election, do'ſt thou think to ſee into it? When he has ſhut and claſp't the book of Life, do'ſt thou think to open it and read it?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Vocation comments upon Election. Gods decrees, that were ſet from everlaſting, do bud and bloſſome, and bring forth fruit in time. Election buds in a promiſe, and bloſſomes in an offer of grace. The Book was written before the foundations of the world were laid; but it was not publiſht till God himſelf gave it an <hi>Imprimatur.</hi> The Letter was dated from eternity; the Superſociption was writ in time, in Vocation. Now you know though the Letter be writ firſt, yet the Superſcription is read firſt by him that receives the Letter. 'Twas decreed from eternity that Decrees ſhould be known in time. And the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the fulneſſe of time, is the time when Gods decrees are fulfilled. When the decrees of God are ripe, then he lets the ſoul taſte them; and then they are ſweeteſt. Then thou perceiveſt that thou art a veſſel of honour, when God puts thee upon an honourable imploiment. That fountain of love which ran under ground from everlaſting, bubbles up and flowes to thee in time. That <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that was in Election, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Vocation. Thus thoughts of men, when they would appear, they put on words; they take wings to themſelves and flie away.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. There is a ſtrict and an inſeparable connexion betwixt Election and Vocation. For who is there that can blaſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Heaven, or who can reverſe the Seale of the Almighty? Who can break one linke of this golden chaine? To be ſure, 'tis not in the power of created Beings to evacuate and annihilate the counſels of God. A creature, as it had no influence upon Election, ſo neither has it any power to alter it. A ſhadow does not alter the Sun, but rather ſhews you what time of the day it is.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50910:200"/>
And then to be ſure God himſelf will not reverſe his own ſeale. <hi>Nulla eſt litura in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> God is ſo full of light, as that there is no ſhadow of change in him. Therefore, has God pickt thee out as a Jewel, and laid thee up in a ſecret repoſitory, in the Cabbinet of his ſecret councel? He will then bring thee out, and ſhew thee in time; he means to poliſh thee, and put a luſtre upon thee; he means to ſet thee as a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in his Ring, and to put thee upon the band of a Saviour. Did God from all eternity reſolve to ſet thee as a captive ſoul at liberty? Truely then thou needeſt not doubt, but that he will in time break open the priſon-doors; and beat off thy chaines and thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etters, and give thee full inlargement. God has been preparing a feaſt for thee from everlaſting, a feaſt of ſweet and fat things, a refined, an Evangelical feaſt: To be ſure then he will invite thee in time; he will ſtand at thy door and knock; nay, he will compell thee to come into it. God glanced an eye of love upon thee, when thou layeſt hid in the barren wombe of nothing; to be ſure then in time he means to wooe thee, and to winne thee, and to eſpouſe thee to himſelf in faithfulneſſe and in truth.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Election and Vocation, though in reſpect of us they have gradual and climbing accompliſhments; yet in reſpect of God they are equally preſent. For there is no ſucceſſion in eternity. There can be no <hi>Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> &amp; poſterius</hi> where there was no beginning. 'Tis true that our finite Beings, as they cannot ſufficiently graſpe an infinite Eſſence, ſo neither can they meaſure an infinite Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And therefore, our underſtandings put many times ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>periods</hi> there, where there ought not to be the leaſt <hi>Com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> becauſe we ſpan out things by our own narrow Duration.</p>
                  <p>For Duration is nothing elſe but <hi>permano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ia in eſſe,</hi> a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and abiding in Being, the ſpinning out of Entity: And therefore as the ſoul cannot ſee the face of God, ſo neither can it ſee the vaſtneſſe of his Duration, which is adequate and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the degree of his Entity. So that we being but of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, are not competent judges of Eternity. And as the ſoul im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in a body, can but darkly conceive of ſpiritual Beings, and cannot behold the luſtre and oriency of an Angel; nay, it cannot behold its own beauty, much leſſe is it able to behold the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50910:201"/>
glory of God himſelf: So being here converſant with tranſient things that have their <hi>Ortum &amp; Occaſum,</hi> their <hi>Fluxum &amp; Reflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> their Spring and Autumne, their bounds and their bottome, and dwelling among temporals; 'tis not ſo well acquainted with the vaſt Duration of Eternity. And yet it can far better behold the back-parts of Eternity, then the face of it; Eternity <hi>à parte pòſt,</hi> then Eternity <hi>à parte antè;</hi> becauſe the ſoul it ſelf is meaſured by that Duration. Whereas only that one Supreme Being, God himſelf has the compleatneſſe and perfection of Eternity. No wonder then that our underſtandings put ſeveral <hi>periods</hi> there, where there ought not to be the leaſt <hi>comma,</hi> becauſe we ſpan out things by our own Duration; that which bubbles from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, comes flowing to us in time. But Vocation is as eternall as Election; In reſpect of God, <hi>Jacob</hi> was as ſoon call'd as he was choſen, and that not only in reſpect of the ſecret counſel and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God; but whenſoever God does actually call <hi>Jacob,</hi> he calls him <hi>ab Aeterno;</hi> for Eternity is not at all ſpent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by continuance, but is alwayes <hi>in vigore viridi.</hi> 'Tis a flouriſhing Duration that never withers, nor decayes. Indeed Vocation is nothing elſe but Election pulling off her velle, and ſmiling upon the ſoul, and telling her that God loves her, and manifeſts and diſplayes his love to her.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. It is altogether irregular and anomalous for the ſoul. 1. To prie into Election. 'Tis dangerous to tread on the higheſt round firſt; and here it is impoſſible. Thus the ſoul forgets that it is a creature, it forgets its own Duration, and would be meaſuring it ſelf by Eternity. The windowes of the ſoul muſt be ſet open for the entertaining of ſuch light as do's more immediately flow in upon it; and the underſtanding muſt cloſe and comply with ſuch objects as are beſt proportioned to it. Now you know that thoſe things which are firſt intelligible in their own nature, yet are not alwayes firſt preſented to the view and eye of the ſoul. For whatſoever is firſt in Being may firſt be known; Entity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the root and juſt foundation of intelligibility. And yet ſometimes ſecondary and junior Entity is faine to prepare the way like a <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> for one that comes after it, and yet was in worth and being before it. Thus ſometimes the cauſes of things lurke, and lie coucht, they hide their heads, only a little flouriſh out at the Latteſſes, peeping
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50910:201"/>
out of an effect or two. Thus the Text may be in Hebrew, when the Commentary is in Latine; many may underſtand the one, that cannot read the other. Election, it is the Original; Vocation, 'tis the interlineary gloſſe for the help of weak beginners. If God ſhould let thee ſee into Election before Vocation, it were the only way to fruſtrate and diſappoint his own decree. For if God ſhould ſhew thee thy name in the book of Life, before thy heart were changed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; what would this but make thee ſinne more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and turne his grace into wantonneſſe? Whereas the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God never determines the end, but it alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the means; and as the end is alwayes glorious, ſo alſo are the means powerfull and efficacious. Now thou canſt not more clearly demonſtrate that thou art in a good tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and proximity to the end, then by a thanfull uſe and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable application of the means. And what do they do but lay a ſnare for their own ſoules, that catch and entangle themſelves with ſuch a deſperate fallacy as this is; If we be elected, we ſhall be unqueſtionably ſaved; and if we be not elected, we ſhall be unavoidably damned, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may do what we liſt. O what a bold and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous inference is this! What is this elſe, but to diſtill the rankeſt poiſon out of the richeſt and moſt ſovereigne cordial? To kindle Hell out of a ſparke of Heavenly truth, which if it were blown up gently by the Spirit that breathed it, and kept within its juſt bounds; 'twould only cheere, quicken and enliven the ſoul. Becauſe thou doſt not as yet know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou art a veſſell of honour, wilt thou therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently daſh thy ſelf in pieces? becauſe thou doſt not for the preſent certainly know that thou ſhalt come ſafe to the Haven, wilt thou therefore court the waves, ruſh upon a Rock, and make Shipwrack of faith and a good conſcience? would'ſt thou do thus in temporals? Why, thou doſt not know how long thou ſhalt live, the number of thy dayes is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fixt, and thy time is an appointed and determined time: wilt thou therefore refuſe to leane upon the ſtaffe of bread? Wilt thou not repaire thine earthly and decaying tabernacle? Wilt thou not maintaine the oile in the cruze? that <hi>Balſamum radic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50910:202"/>
afforded to thee? Wilt thou break thy glaſſe in pieces, becauſe thou canſt not tell how long it will run?</p>
                  <p>Is it not a mercy that God vouchſafes thee the means? Why ſhould'ſt thou diſtruſt of obtaining the end, more then any other? There is not a curtaine that hides Election more from thee then from any other; 'tis equally hid to all, till it ſhine forth upon ſome in the uſe of means, till the curtaine be drawne, and then it will equally ſhine out upon thee, if thou uſeſt the ſame meanes. If all ſhould argue as thou do'ſt, there would none be ſaved; if all men, becauſe Election is abſolute and uncertaine, ſhould reſolve to live as they liſt; who would then ſet his face towards <hi>Canaan?</hi> where would God have any glory in the world? What would become of his great Name? but he will root out ſuch an unſavoury principle as this is out of the hearts of all that love him; and that truth which is made a fat all ſtumbling block to ſome, ſhall prove a ſolid foundation of joy and ſweetneſſe unto them. The very poſſibility of Election ſhould baniſh all ſuch thoughts as theſe. Who can tell but God may have been gracious unto thee, and have fixt an eye of love upon thee? Oh then breath after him, pant and long for him, deſire him to expreſſe his minde to thee, to communicate his love to thee.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, though thou doſt not know Election, will meere love do nothing? Though thy God did not intend to glorifie thee; yet thou ſhould'ſt intend to glorifie him; Though he do's not chuſe thee for his ſervant, yet thou ſhould'ſt chuſe him for thy Lord. There is worth in him, though there be none in thee.</p>
                  <p>Reſolve that into what condition ſoever he throw thee, though into hell it ſelf, that there thou wilt love him, and there thou wilt praiſe him, and long for him; that there thou wilt adore and honour him, and wilt grieve only for this, that thou canſt honour him no more; that thou wilt admire his goodneſſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his juſtice to thee; I, and his goodneſſe to thee too, that layes leſſe upon thee then thou deſerveſt. Such thoughts as theſe would make hell it ſelf lightſome.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. As Election is ſecret and myſterious, ſo Vocation may be eaſily known. That Aſtrologer was deſervedly laught at, that was ſo intenſely gazing upon the Starres, ſo admiring their twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling beauties, as that unawares he tumbled into the water; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50910:202"/>
before, if he had but been pleaſed to look ſo low as the water, he might have ſeen the ſtarres there repreſented in that cryſtall glaſſe. Such as will needs be prying into the ſtarres, that will aſcend up into heaven, and gaze upon Election; they do but dazle their eyes, and ſometimes by this are overwhelmed in the depths of Satan: whereas they might eaſily ſee the ſtarres in the water; they might ſee Election in Sanctification, in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now Vocation does plainly and eaſily appear by that great and eminent alteration which it brings along with it. It is a powerful Call, 'tis an audible and quickening voice; the voice of the firſt trumpet that awakens men out of the graves, and makes them happy, by having their part in the firſt Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; great and ſudden alterations they are very diſcernable. Now here's a moſt notorious, and ſignal change made; <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new:</hi> here's a change from death to life, from darkneſſe to light; and what more diſcernable then this? A living man may know that he is alive, and that without any further proofe or demonſtration, whatever the <hi>Scepticks</hi> old or new would perſwade us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; Will you not allow a man to be certaine that he lives, till a jury of life and death hath paſt upon him?</p>
                  <p>Could not the blinde man in the Goſpel (think you) perceive when his eyes were opened? could he not eaſily tell that now he could ſee and diſcerne variety of Objects? or muſt he only conjecture that he ſees, and gueſſe at a Sun-beame? muſt he ſtill at noon-day go groping in uncertainties. And is there not an eaſie and ſure difference between thoſe thick veiles and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the night, between thoſe dark and Ethiopick looks, and the virgin bluſhes of the morning; thoſe beautiful eye-lids of the day? The ſmilings and flowerings out of light, much more the advancement of light to its Zenith and Noon-day-glory? And why then cannot an Intellectual eye diſcerne as well, that now it ſees? that now it looks upon God with an eye of love, with an eye of faith, with an eye of confidence? and that now God looks upon him with an eye of tenderneſſe and compaſſion, with an eye of grace and favour, with an eye of delight and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation? Who but an <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> will go about to perſwade a man to disbelieve his eyes? and if a corporal eye deſerve ſuch
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50910:203"/>
credit, why may not a ſpiritual eye then expect as much? <hi>Say not</hi> then <hi>in thine heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven, to bring down</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance <hi>from above?</hi> who ſhall unclaſpe the book of life that is ſealed, and turne thee to thy name? or who ſhall bring thee a certificate that it is written there? <hi>Behold, it is nigh thee, even in thine heart:</hi> The work of grace there, the Law written on the tables of thine heart, by the finger of the Spirit is the exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and counterpane of that Decree; the ſafeſt way, the beſt way, the only way to make ſure of Election, is firſt to make ſure of thy Vocation; <hi>Make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi>

Then I hope this Diſcourſe may prove not unprofitable, truly nor unſeaſonable neither in this confident age, when every ignorant one is ſo prone to lean unto his own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that he thinks himſelf too good to be taught, whereas indeed he hath not yet wit enough to learne. But it is the Devils ſubtilty to dazzle them with new light (as Boyes do Geeſe) that they may wink conceitedly while he pulls them naked, and makes them become ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.

But <hi>Reader,</hi> I muſt intreat thee neither to condemne this piece becauſe it is imperfect, nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne it for being little.

But indeed it was intended only for a taſt, and to bear the Mace into the world before that learned and elegant Treatiſe, which this ingenious Authour hath left behinde him concerning <hi>The Light of Nature;</hi> Which now waits only to ſee what entertainment this will meet withall.

And ſuch is our knowledge of God here, and ſuch our communion with him; only ſome broken beams of glory, ſome glimpſes of his preſence ſcattered here and there, in this Ordinance, and in that, Glaſſes of his own making, meanes of his proper inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>

is our knowledge of God here! What poor manifeſtations have we of his preſence, in compariſon of that ſight which we look for hereafter! when his Eſſence ſhall be diſplay'd with a moſt glorious Emphaſis.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Seeing through a Glaſſe is a vaniſhing and tranſient Viſion, as Saint <hi>James</hi> expreſſes it; <hi>A man having ſeen his natural face in a glaſſe, goes his way, and preſently forgets what manner of man he was.</hi> A dying ſpecies could not make any ſtrong impreſſion.

                  <p>Our Apoſtle hath applied it to our purpoſe; <hi>Knowledge paſſes away,</hi> in reſpect of that weak and imperfect way of knowledge which we have here; for thus Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gloſſes upon his own Text; <hi>When that which is perfect is come, then that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſhall be aboliſht.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, when we conceive of him in a ſuperlative way, in a way of eminency and tranſcendency: and thus the forenamed Authour (if he be the Authour) ſpeaking of his Being, ſaith that <gap reason="foreign">

Many divine perfections are ſcattered and broken amongſt the creatures, as the ſame face may be repreſented in ſeveral Glaſſes; and all the excellencies of the creatures are collected, and meet eminently in God, as ſeverall faces may be ſeen in one Glaſſe. The creatures muſt be winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all imperfections, and the fineſt and choiceſt of them muſt be taken to give ſome weak reſemblance of a Deity; the rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of the Roſe, and the purity of the Lily; nay, the top and excellency of the Creation muſt be brought to ſhadow out the Spouſes beauty; and yet that this knowledge is weak and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, will eaſily appear. 1. Becauſe theſe inferiour Beings are ſo groſſe and materiall, as that the pureſt of them, the very quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence and <hi>flos creaturae</hi> is meer dregs, if compared with ſo pure an Eſſence; its gold becomes droſſe, its ſilver tinne. And when heavenly perfections are ſet out by the creatures excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, it is but a ſtooping low to humane capacity: The ſoul would be dazeled at ſo bright a Majeſty, unleſſe he were clouded with ſuch expreſſions. 2. This way of beholding him breeds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther admiration then begets knowledge; for when we hear of ſo goodly an Eſſence that hath all excellencies bound up in one vaſt volume, we wonder what that ſhould be: and admiration is at the beſt but <hi>ſemen ſcientiae,</hi> or <hi>abrupta ſcientia,</hi> as the learned <hi>Verulam</hi> calls it, <hi>a ſtupified kinde of know'edge.</hi> 3. This rather ſets the ſoul a longing, then gives it any true ſatisfaction. For when we hear there is ſo choiſe a thing, we long to know what it is; which was ſigne we knew it not before, or but very weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For true knowledge ſatiates the ſoul, there is a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and acquieſcence in it, eſpecially when it is converſant about ſo high an object; ſo that this way is but dark and full of riddles.</p>

                     <hi>But then] Then</hi> when a believing ſoul returnes to God that gave it, it ſees him face to face, and fixes its eye upon him to all eternity. As ſoon as ever the ſoule is unſheath'd from the body, it gliſters moſt gloriouſly; as ſoon as ever it is unclouded from corruption, it ſhall beam forth moſt oriently; as ſoon as it is let looſe from this cage of clay, it ſings moſt melodiouſly: nothing hinders a Chriſtian from a ſight of God face to face, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of a groſſe earthy body; it is deaths office, to break down this wall of ſeparation, that the ſoule may be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſence of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Then,</hi> at that general day of refreſhment, when God ſhall ſit upon his Throne in beauty and excellency, as a centre of light, ſtreaming forth to the glorious circumference of the foure and twenty Elders, that ſit <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This vaſt volume of the creatures ſet out by God himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>errata</hi> in it, was printed in ſo fair a character, as he that ran might read it; and the leaſt letter in it made ſhew of a moſt Divine impreſſion. But alas! ſin, beſides weakening of the ſouls eye, hath ſoyled and defaced the book; and hence we come to ſee in it ſo darkly. And yet ſtill the letters are viſible, and carry with them the print of a Deity. The world is, as one calls it, <hi>Aenigma Dei.</hi> And it is full of looking-glaſſes: for God hath communicated ſeverall reſemblances of himſelf to the creature, as the face ſheds that image or ſpecies upon the glaſſe whereby it ſelf is repreſented. I need not ſpeak of the bleſſed Angels, thoſe pure and cryſtal mirrours, what glorious repreſentations they give of their Creatour: Look but into your ſelves, and you will finde immortall ſouls ſhewing forth that image according to which they were made; or if you will look up to that vaſt and poliſhed look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe, you will ſee <hi>The heavens declaring the glory of God,

The Heathens they ſhall be judged for not ordering their lives and dreſſing themſelves according to this glaſſe; for reſiſting thoſe reliques of primitive light that ſhined out ſo ſtrongly upon them.

God in much mercy hath given them glaſſes, and they will not vouchſafe to look in them: they were always an obdurate and ſtiff-necked people, rebelling againſt the Prophets, &amp; they go on to fill up the ſins of their fathers. Well, but yet the <hi>Seers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſaw but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and they ſaw in them very darkly.</p>
                  <p>For 1. Prophecies (as the learned Verulam) have <hi>gradus &amp; ſcalas complementi,</hi> climbing accompliſhments, ſpringing and germinant accompliſhments. A Prophecie in the bud is not ſo eaſily ſeen as when it ſhoots out further, and ſpreads it ſelf in larger growth: ſuch paſſages in <hi>Eſay</hi> as ſeem to us clear as the day, were to them dark and Enigmatical: and we ſee how obſcure St. <hi>Johns</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſeems to us. And the devil, who was always Gods Ape, he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitated here; for his oracles were wrapt up in ſo many clouds, and withal ſo full of fallacies, as none ever could tell their meaning till event had given the interpretation. The Prince of darkneſſe would make all his ſayings wear his livery: Divine prophecies are as clear as cryſtal, if compared with his cloudy oracles.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Prophecies at beſt are but weak and imperfect things, and therefore they alſo ſhall be aboliſhed, no need of them in heaven: they were very beneficial to the Church militant, to acquaint her with approaching judgements, and prepare her for intended mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; but when happineſſe is preſent and compleat, no need of them then in the Church triumphant.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have ſeen how they under the Law ſaw but darkly: &amp; if Gods peculiar people had ſo little knowledge of him, in what groſſe and palpable ignorance did they live that had none of this his light ſhining upon them; for <hi>in Judah was God known, and his Name was famous in Iſrael. He hath not dealt ſo with every nation, neither had the Heathen knowledge of his Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now if we look upon our ſelves that live under the light of the Goſpel, even we in this Sun-ſhine ſee but darkly.</p>

The greateſt part of the world reject them: the Greeks eſteem them fooliſhneſſe: they think there is not ſo much in them as in a riddle; in that there is ſome hidden ſenſe, but theſe are plain fooliſhneſſe in their eſteem; and <hi>Evangelium</hi> to the Jews is no more then <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are many <hi>Practical truths</hi> which are meer riddles to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirits; as to forſake all for a perſecuted Chriſt, to cut off right hands, pluck out right eyes, pray for enemies, not to do evil that good may come thereof; theſe principles they can hardly digeſt; and there are many Chriſtian priviledges w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they know not what to make of, aſſurance of Gods favour, communion with him, hidden Manna, joy in the holy Ghoſt glorious &amp; unſpeable. Theſe &amp; ſuch like puzle their apprehenſions; for they never entred into the heart of a natural man to conceive, it is too narrow for them to enter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are many <hi>paſſages</hi> which to Chriſtians themſelves are dark and enigmatical, ſuch as we cannot eaſily underſtand. The book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is all veil'd with obſcurity, the firſt thing we meet with almoſt are ſeven Seals: it is full of hidden ſecrets, and who is there that can unſeal the book? Our adverſaries the Papiſts catch at this, and are ready with a double inference: The Scriptures are enigmatical; therefore clear them with Traditions, therefore keep them from the people.</p>
                  <p>But 1. When we ſpeak of the Scriptures darkneſſe, it is but comparatively in reſpect of thoſe bright manifeſtations we ſhall have of God hereafter. A pearl may be clear and orient, and yet dark in reſpect of a ſtarre: a ſtar may be bright, and yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure if compared with the Sun.</p>

2. All truths belonging to the Eſſence of a Chriſtian, are plain and perſpicuous: and there is an aſſiſting Spirit, which though they perhaps may ſcoffe at, and ſome others may unjuſtly pretend to, yet without doubt it ſhall lead Gods people into all truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Is their Cabala ſo pure? are their Traditions ſo clear and cryſtalline, as that we ſhall ſee in them better then in the word? If you cannot ſee in a pellucid ſtream, do you think to ſee in a muddy ſtanding pool?</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, The Scriptures are enigmatical, therefore keep them from the people. Nay rather, therefore explain them to them: therefore ſet up a faithful Miniſtery, whoſe <hi>lips may preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and acquaint them with the myſteries of ſalvation, and open to them theſe hidden oracles. And let the people themſelves <hi>ſearch the Scriptures, dig for knowledge as for ſilver, and for wiſdome as hid treaſure.</hi> Again, they had better ſee in a glaſſe, though but dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then not to ſee at all; truth in a cloud, in a riddle is more ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then a black and palpable ignorance.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They keep the Scriptures from them, not becauſe they ſee in them ſo darkly, but leſt they ſhould ſee in them too clearly; And above all they lock up the <hi>Revelation,</hi> not as it is obſcure, but becauſe it threatens the ſeven hills ſo much. And thus we have lookt upon the third particular, the Glaſſe of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>In ſpeculo providentia.</hi> Here Gods glorious attributes ſhine forth, his wiſdome, juſtice, goodneſſe, and the reſt of that glorious conſtellation. And Providence ſets before us examples, they are glaſſes in which we may ſee either the beauty of holineſs, or elſe ſins deformity. And it is no ſmall felicity of this latter age, that we have the uſe of theſe glaſſes, the benefit of ſo many form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er examples; and yet we ſee in them but darkly, they are <hi>a cloud of witneſſes,</hi> as it is <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. though in another ſenſe. Providence is very myſterious and there is no readier way to Atheiſme then to queſtion it when we cannot give a ſufficient account of it. The <hi>Indians</hi> have a cuſtome, once a year to caſt a golden buſhel into the Sea: and thus they think they ſet a meaſure and bound to its proud waves, ſo as it ſhall not invade their land. Their cuſtome is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous enough, and yet they are far more vain that go about <hi>Doum ſuo modulo metiri,</hi> to circumſcribe an Immenſe being with the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row compaſſe of their reaſon.

Sixthly, <hi>In ſpeculo Sacramentorum.</hi> Such great and tranſcendent myſteries as the apprehenſions of Angels cannot reach unto, are here preſented to the ſenſes.</p>

                  <p>Now our Saviour in theſe words, does as it were, take a paire of ballances in his hand, the ballance of the Sanctuary; and he puts the whole world in one ſcale, and the ſoul of man in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>For though all men, or moſt men that know what a ſoul is, will eaſily grant that their ſouls are precious enough; yet they don't attend to thoſe ſeveral reſpects in which they are thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; much leſſe do they take notice of thoſe ſeveral reſults and conſequences that flow from it.</p>

they came from the Father of ſpirits, from the Father of lights. God lights up ſouls in the world; they bubble forth from that fountain of ſpirits, that ſpiritual Eſſence.

I know that queſtion's full of briers and thornes; but yet we may very well ſay thus much, that ſome Scripture-paſſages favour and countenance this moſt, that God ſtill breaths into men living ſouls, that they flow immediately from him in a way of Creation; and that the ſoul and body do ſtill differ in their <hi>Original.</hi> That's the firſt, the excellency of the ſouls Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>

                  <p>Do but look upon the ſeveral workings of the ſoul. Conſider the ſeveral layings out of the ſoul, and you'l ſee they have worth in them. Do but view the wheels and motions of the ſoul, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral faculties and employments of them, and you'l ſee they are all choice and precious.</p>
                  <p>What ſhould I tell you of the Underſtanding crown'd with Beams, compaſt and ſurrounded with Light; of the Will ſitting
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50910:217"/>
like a Queen upon her Throne, and ſwaying the Scepter of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in her hand, with all the affections waiting and attending upon her.</p>
                  <p>There's a five-fold excellency in the workings of the ſouls of men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The workings of the ſoul are <hi>quick and nimble.</hi> Material Beings move heavily. Matter clogs them, and dulls their motion. They go like the Chariots of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the Red-ſea; but ſpiritual Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they move freely and preſently, like the Chariots of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minadab,</hi> they run with a cheerfull ſpontaneity. What quicker then a Thought? what nimbler then the twinkling of an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Eye? 'Tis true, there is a weakneſſe and irregularity in the ſouls motions, when its beſt workings are too flitting and deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, too gliding and tranſient: but take the ſoul as 'tis regular and orderly in its motions, and then the freeneſſe and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of its working; 'tis the high priviledge of a ſpiritual Being: For God, that is a pure Spirit, is Omni-preſent in his motions. And the Angels, that are miniſtering Spirits, make haſte of thoſe glorious errands they are ſent about: The wings of the Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims flye very ſwiftly. And the ſouls of men, that are next in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they are next in Being; they do the will of God on earth as 'tis done in heaven, with ſuch freeneſſe and alacrity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They are <hi>vigorous and indefatigable.</hi> The wings of the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims are not weary with flying, nor are the wheels of the ſoul weary with going, the ſparklings of the ſoul never vaniſh; but every motion has immortality ſtampt upon it. Spiritual Beings in all their motions are never weary, nor out of breath. But material Beings, as they are dull and ſluggiſh in their motion; ſo they are faint and languiſhing The body, that's ſoon tyr'd. And yet (which is worth the obſerving) only animate Beings are capable of wearineſſe: The Sun is not weary with ſhining, but is alwayes ready like a Giant to run's race; nor the fountain is not weary with flowing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the bird is preſently weary with flying. Only animate Beings are weary, not by vertue of the ſoul, but becauſe the body can't keep peace with the ſoul. Thus many times the ſtring breaks, when the Lutaniſt is not weary. <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi> The ſoul would fain be working, when the body is not ſerviceable. That which wearies the ſoul moſt, is to be quencht in its motions, to be dull'd by an
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50910:217"/>
earthy body, by the interpoſition of that to be clouded, to have its wings clipt, ſo that 'twas ſaid of that noble Platoniſt <hi>Plotinus,</hi> that he ſo liv'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he was loath to be in the body, as others were loath to be in priſon, as if he had cry'd out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> And therefore the ſouls of juſt men made perfect, that are ſet at full liberty, they are never weary in their workings, never weary of praiſing God, never weary of ſinging Hallelujahs to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Vaſt and comprehenſive.</hi> All beings they are within the ſouls Horizon. What can't it graſpe in its thought? what can't it take in its eye? It can take in the ſeveral drops of Being, and it can take in much of the Ocean of Being. I deny not but ſome men have ſuch narrow and contracted ſouls, as they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with nothing but outward and droſſy objects; they can ſcarce have a wiſh, thought, minde only earthly things; their Corne, and their Wine, and their Oile. But this only ſhews their ſouls degenerated from their native perfection, from their primitive glory. For the ſoul of it ſelf is more large and ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſcornes to be bounded with material objects; it ſelf is a ſpirit, and ſo it delights more in ſpirituals. Nay, it won't be bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with reall objects; it will ſet up Beings of its own, <hi>Entia Rationis;</hi> Reaſon's creatures; ſuch as the hand of Omnipotency never gave a reall Being to.</p>
                  <p>And then the deſires of the ſoul how vaſt are theſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive? the ſoul can quickly open its mouth ſo wide, as that the whole world can't fill it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Self-reflexive and independent</hi> upon the body. And theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are the choiceſt and moſt precious workings of all, the very flower and quinteſſence of an immortal ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When the ſoul ſhall ſit judge upon its own actions; when it ſhall become <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum ſuiipſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The workings of the ſoul are <hi>ſecret and undiſcernable.</hi> The creatures eye cannot pierce them. <hi>Who knows the things of a man, but the ſpirit of man that is in him?</hi> The Devil can't tell
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50910:218"/>
the thoughts of men; at moſt he has but a gueſſe and ſhrew'd conjecture, unleſſe they be ſuch as are of his own caſting in; he has reaſon to know theſe, for they are his own.</p>

What mutual rage, and envy, and malice, and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings would they then behold? Yet leſt men ſhould abuſe this priviledge, and from hence take liberty to ſin, God often puts them in minde of this, that he ſearches and ſees the heart; 'tis his great prerogative, and he is greater then the heart, then the ſoul, he knows all things.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond particular, the excellency of the ſouls <hi>Operations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The excellency of its <hi>Capacity.</hi> Do but conſider with your ſelves, what a reaſonable ſoul is capable of. 'Tis capable of the image of God. The ſoul, it has his ſuperſcription; <hi>In the image of God made he him.</hi> Now there's little or nothing of Gods Image to be ſeen in the body; for God is a Spirit, and ſo ſtamps his Image upon the ſpirits of men. And here indeed are ſome ſhadowings out of himſelf, ſome faint and languiſhing repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of a Deity. The ſoul 'tis made in the Image of God, and 'tis capable of ſuch ſtamps and impreſſions as God is pleas'd to put upon it. 'Tis endow'd with reaſon, the apple of the ſouls eye. 'Tis capable of knowledge, of learning, of all the advancements and ennoblements of reaſon; but what ſhould I ſpeak of theſe, this will ſeem to ſome in the world no great matter; as good be without them, or it may be better in their fond eſteem; well then, 'tis capable of grace, of glory; ſure they won't ſlight theſe too. 'Tis fit to be a companion of Angels, to bear them company to all eternity. Nay, 'tis capable of communion with God himſelf; they are the friends of God. The ſouls of men muſt make up a Church for him. They are fit to be the Spouſe of Chriſt. 'Tis the Apoſtles phraſe, <hi>That I might preſent you Virgin-ſouls unto Chriſt.</hi> They are capable of ſuch things, as <hi>neither eye has ſeen, nor ear heard, nor e're enter'd into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> the ſoul it ſelf cannot conceive, what great things a ſoul is capable of. Though the workings of the ſoul were more vaſt and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive then they are, yet they can't reach them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The excellency of its <hi>Duration.</hi> Do but think upon this a while; how that it ſhall run a line parallel to all eternity. The
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50910:218"/>
body indeed, 'tis ſoon reſolv'd and crumbled into its firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou muſt returne.</hi> But <hi>the ſoul returnes to God that gave it.</hi> As it did not depend upon the body in ſome of its workings, ſo neither does it depend upon it in its Being. 'Tis a very remarkable ſpeech that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Gaius; I wiſh</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>that thy body proſper, even as thy ſoul proſpers.</hi> For moſt men in the world we might very well invert the wiſh; we wiſh their ſouls proſper'd, even as their bodies proſper. But Saint <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks it, of a lively and vigorous Chriſtian, ſtrong in the faith. <hi>I wiſh thy body proſper, even as thy ſoul proſpers.</hi> For many times you know, in an aged and decay'd body, you have a lively vigorous ſoul; Old men are moſt famous for wiſdome, <hi>Neſtor</hi> is for councel: In a languiſhing and conſum'd body, you have many times a flouriſhing and well-complexion'd ſoul. Men of the livelieſt ſouls, are not alwayes of the ſtrongeſt and goodlieſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, none of the longeſt lives. Sometimes the ſoul is ſo acute as that it cuts the ſheath of the body aſunder. Sometimes the Lutaniſt ſcrues up the ſtrings ſo high, as that they crack immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately. Many times the ſoul is in the full, when the body's in the wane.</p>
                  <p>That which we uſually call a lightning before death, ſome think 'tis but the ſouls finding of its former liberty, that's now to be looſen'd from the body, to be enlarged and ſet out of priſon; and that makes it ſo chearful. To be ſure there are (at leaſt) ſtrong and pregnant probabilities of the ſouls immortality to a natural eye, to a Philoſophical eye with common light: And they that tell us of the ſouls Mortality; we may very well queſtion, what manner of ſouls they have; to be ſure as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>They are become like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> Others are ſo far in love with the ſouls immortality, that they would have every ſoul immortal; ſenſitive and vegetative ſouls. But it ſhall ſuffice us that the ſouls of men are ſo, and this is the fourth excellency of the ſouls of men; the excellencie of their <hi>Duration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is the firſt head of Arguments by which you ſee the preciouſneſſe of a ſoul, from the ſeveral excellencies of the ſoul it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) If you would know the worth and preciouſneſſe of a ſoul; Conſider what value and eſteem they put upon it, that are beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the worth of it. This is one of the wiſeſt and ſureſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:50910:219"/>
wayes, to know the worth of a thing; to conſider how they prize it that beſt know it.</p>
                  <p>See then how they value ſouls, that know them beſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>God himſelf,</hi> the Creatour of ſouls, 1. The Father of ſpirits; He muſt needs know the worth of ſouls, for he made them, and he weighs the ſpirits of men, he has often put them into the ballance, and he knows the worth and weight of them. Now ſee how he eſteems them; He has laid out his thoughts from everlaſting, for the bringing in of ſome ſouls to himſelf; He has pickt them out as his Jewels. The counſels and contrivances of heaven have been ſpent upon them. Now do you think that God would lay out his thoughts upon them from everlaſting, unleſſe they were very precious?</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the great Purchaſer of ſouls; he bought them, and ſo muſt needs know the worth of them. It was no ordinary price that he paid for them neither; <hi>You were not ranſom'd with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things,</hi> &amp;c. Now do you think that Jeſus Chriſt would have laid down his own life, ſpent his own precious blood for them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they had been very precious? There's nothing that does ſpeak the worth and excellency of a ſoul, then what was laid down for them to redeem them. And theſe words in the Text are the words of him that bought ſouls; the words of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, the great Redeemer of ſouls, he tells you, that one ſoul is more worth then a world.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>The Angles,</hi> they are Spirits themſelves; and ſo are more acquainted with the nature of Spirits then we are. See, how they eſteem them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Good</hi> Angels; what care do they take for ſouls? They are miniſtering Spirits for the good of ſouls. They pitch their Tents about them; they have charge of ſouls; they rejoyce at the converſion of a ſoul. Heaven is alwayes full of joy, brimfull of joy; but it runs over with freſh joy, when a ſoul is brought in to a Saviour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Evil</hi> Angels, thoſe great Plunderers of ſouls, thoſe black and damned Potentates of Hell; the Devils, theſe know the worth of ſouls too well.</p>
                  <p>For (1.) What variety of temptations have they for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling of a ſoul. How many thouſand hooks and baits for the catching of a ſoul? How many deſignes and ſtratagems for the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:50910:219"/>
ruining of a ſoul? what ambuſhes and underminings for the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſoul? how does he ſpread abroad his nets, and fill the world with ſnares, for the entangling of a ſoul? what ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine windings and workings, what depths and methods of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, what flatteries and inſinuations, and all for the deluding of a ſoul?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How does he rage when a ſoul is pluckt out of his paw? The whole legion of them is in an uproar and commotion; when they have loſt one of their priſoners, they look upon it as a great loſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How does he envy Jeſus Chriſt, the ſaving of one ſoul? How does he think ſouls too precious for him? If all the powers of darkneſſe could hinder it, there ſhould not be one ſoul tranſlated out of their kingdome.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. How does he glory and triumph in the conqueſt of ſouls? If hell were capable of joy, it would have it then; when ſouls are captivated by this Prince of darkneſſe. Theſe are his <hi>ſpolia ampla,</hi> the goodly trophy's and monuments of his victory.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. How many factours and agents does he imploy to bring in ſouls to his kingdome? how many are ſerviceable and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall to him? and how does he go up and down like a roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour? Do you think he would take ſo much pains about ſouls, if they were not worth it?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. In his formal Contracts; he does not ſtand long a cheapning, he'l give them what they'l aske, he knows he can't outbid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. A ſoul is worth more, he knows, then he has to give for it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. How does this torment him, that he is in a chaine, and can do no more hurt to ſouls? that there is an hook in this Leviathan, that he is reſtrain'd and limited ſo as that he cannot have his will of ſouls?</p>
                  <p>So that by all this you ſee, the <hi>evil Angels</hi> the Devils know the worth of ſouls too well.</p>
                  <p>And this is the ſecond head of Arguments, by which you ſee the preciouſneſſe of ſouls, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Arg. Becauſe <hi>other things are precious</hi> in reference to the ſoul. The worth of the ſoul puts a luſtre upon other things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Precious <hi>Faith;</hi> why is that ſo precious? becauſe 'tis for the ſaving of a precious ſoul; 'tis ſuch a radical and eſſential Grace;

Cordials to revive a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoul; balme for the healing of a wounded ſoul; reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for the recovery of a languiſhing ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Precious <hi>Ordinances;</hi> Why? but becauſe God does here in eſpecial manner diſplay himſelf, and reveal himſelf to ſouls; He gilds them with his own glorious preſence; they are the wells of ſalvation, out of which ſouls muſt quench their thirſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Precious <hi>Miniſters;</hi> why ſuch a luſtre upon that Calling more then upon others? why they ſo honourable, but becauſe they are more immediately converſant about ſouls? The converting of ſouls, that's the crowne of the Miniſtery; <hi>You are my Crown, and my Joy,</hi> ſayes <hi>Paul</hi> to his converted <hi>Philippians.</hi> No wonder then if contempt be pour'd out upon the Miniſtery, if once they come to neglect ſouls; if <hi>Cura Animarum</hi> be made but a ſlight buſineſſe. <hi>But they that convert ſouls to righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſayes the Prophet <hi>Daniel, they ſhall ſhine as the ſtarres in the firmament,</hi> they ſhall have a more bright and maſſy Crown, anſwerable to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree of ſervice.</p>

Do you think the Spirit himſelf would ſo intreat, do you think the Holy Ghoſt would be ſo importunate with them elſe? Nay, theſe ſouls are ſo precious, as that he will have ſome for himſelf; he will take no denial, no refuſal; Go and <hi>compell</hi> them to come in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

3. Know, that the <hi>World is kept up</hi> for this very end, for the bringing in of ſome ſouls for a Saviour. Do you think that God is at this vaſt coſt and expence in maintaining this vaſt fabrick of the Creation, only for men that oppoſe him, and provoke him, and violate his Lawes? No, 'tis for the gathering of his Jewels, for the binding up ſome precious ſouls in the bundle of Life. If 'twere not for this, the very pillars and foundations of the world would crack aſunder.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Think upon the great <hi>Preparation</hi> that is made for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of ſouls; how that Chriſt is gone to prepare a place for them. What treaſures of love and ſweetneſſe, what heaps of joy are ſtor'd up for them? what a weight of Glory? what Crowns? what Thrones? what glorious and unexpreſſible, and unconceiveable Priviledges ſhall they then enjoy?</p>
                  <p>Thus by all theſe ſeveral Arguments you have ſeen the worth and preciouſneſſe of ſouls.</p>

How are they become the reproach of him that made them, the body's ſlaves, the devils captives, the ſcorn of every luſt and temptation. Nay, you might even melt and diſſolve into tears under this ſad and ſerious conſideration, that ſo few of theſe precious ſouls ſhall be ſaved; that there are ſo many of them that drop into hell irrecoverably. And though there be a generation of men in the world that will never go over this narrow Bridge, unleſſe they put on Spectacles, that ſo they may tumble in more Artificially: men that lay down ſuch large and reaching principles of ſo vaſt a latitude, as that they ſcarce make it poſſible for any to be damn'd: men that widen the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row gate in their own apprehenſions; yet God has reveal'd his minde expreſſely, and 'tis the conſtant voice of the Goſpel it ſelf, that there are but few of theſe precious ſouls that be ſav'd.

                  <p>Now when men are told of the worth of their ſouls, when they are put in minde of their preciouſneſſe again and again, when they have all means for the welfare of their ſoul, and when they are directed in the wayes that tend to the ſaving of the ſoul; when they are convinc'd that ſuch and ſuch luſts fight againſt their ſouls; and when they know that the preſent ſeaſon of grace is all they are ſure of, for the welfare of their ſoul; If they ſhall ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly refuſe their own mercy, and wilfully and violently ruſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their own ruine; though their ſouls were ten thouſand times more precious then they are, yet they periſh deſervedly.</p>

Others that do take ſome little acquaintance with their own ſpirits; yet how do they leave them in a rolling and fluctuating condition; how do they venture Eternity? upon what ſtrange uncertainties do they leave a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul? as he that was ready to die, ſaid, <hi>He ſhould know by and by, whether the ſoul were immortall or no;</hi> that was all he made of it.

ſo that 'tis matter of amazement &amp; aſtoniſhment, that the ſouls of men being ſuch precious Beings, ſhould look to their own welfare no more: And it can be reſolv'd into nothing elſe, but into that ſame firſt and grand Apoſtaſie from their God, the fountain of their life and happineſſe. When they loſt their God, they loſt themſelves; and when they fell off from him, they Apoſtatiz'd from their own Eſſence. And now they minde the body, and take care for things here below, and neglect themſelves; If there be any that can repair the ruins of Nature, or that can wrangle a little for mens eſtates; theſe ſhall have honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem in the world, and the things of the world at their command: But they that take care only for ſouls, theſe muſt live upon meere benevolence; as if the Miniſters of the Goſpel were nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed but ſouls; as if they were properly Angels, that muſt aſſume a body, and deliver their meſſage, and then muſt diſapper. This does ſtrongly convince that men prize their bodies and their goods above their ſouls; becauſe men of ſuch employments, Lawyers and Phyſicians theſe finde better entertainment in the world, then the Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is alſo that men neglect the ſeaſons of grace, opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of mercie, advantages for their ſouls; which they would not neglect in other things. The Sabbath, the market-day for ſouls, how is it ſlighted, prophaned? yet the Sabbath was made for man; for the ſoul of man chiefly, for that is the chief of man. And yet God had us'd very ſtrong and powerful means to engage men to ſeek the welfare of their own ſouls. For out of his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love and goodneſſe he has by a ſtrict connexion, knit and united his own glory, and the ſalvation of ſouls together: He has wrought <hi>Iſraels</hi> Name in the frame of his own glory. That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now if theſe two were ſever'd, a man were bound to ſeek the glory of God, before the ſalvation of his own ſoul. For though the ſoul be very precious, yet the glory of the Creatour of ſouls is infinitely more precious. God therefore out of the riches of his grace, has ſo joyn'd theſe together, as none can put them aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. He that ſeeks the glory of God, does by this promote the welfare of his own ſoul; and he that ſeeks the ſaving of his own ſoul, does in this advance the glory of God. He that ſeeks the one, muſt ſeek the other alſo.</p>

But God has laid up ſome precious ſouls in a ſafe and ſure hand; they are laid up as a rich <hi>Depoſitum</hi> in the hand of a Saviour, and they are kept by his Almighty power through faith unot ſalvation.</p>
