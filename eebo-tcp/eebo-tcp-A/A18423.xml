            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I clapt him on the backe and told him that hee spake truth.
For I gelt him the last yeare, and eat his stones to my break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast.
But I had like to haue mar'd all by saying so. For there
was a nimble-headed Scholler that stood by, (and yet had
nothing to doe with the question) went about to proue me
a horse, and thus he began. <hi>Euery liuing beast, or Animal,
that hath in him horse stones, is a horse. But this Animal,</hi>
(meaning me) <hi>hath horse stones in him, Ergo he is a horse.</hi> I
was striken in such a maze (knowing that I did eate the
horse stones) that I was like to sinke where I stood, and euen
presently to congeale into a horse. But there was by chance
an honest Scholler by, who saw my colour quite gone, took
pity on me, and bade me be of good cheere, I shood not be
a horse. And told the tother to his face, that there was a
<hi>flacy</hi> in his <hi>argumen.</hi> And then fetcht him about with a <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and prou'd that the horse stones which I had
eaten, were consum'd, and became such stuffe as I cannot tel
you without Sir <hi>reuerence</hi> of your teeth; and that they did
not grow in me as they doe in horses: <hi>Ergo</hi> the case was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.
Then vpon this point of growing, and not growing,
there was such a sturre, that all the horse-coursers in the

I that I was not a horse. Had not I (thinke you good cause

at least. And if they die sooner, you shall saue litle.

               <p>It is even high time the world were at an end, for I think
all trades are decaying: when my father put me to the Innes
of Court he advised me in anie case to studie, so that I might
be called to the barre, and then (saith he) feare not to liue in
all plentie and credit. But I find it otherwise, for now that I
am exalted thither, my law serues mee not to get my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.
I wish I had beene bred a Tapster: that trade is now
more gainefull with froth then ours with all our words. And
for anie thing I see tis like to last to the worlds end, whereas
ours can be good no longer then people bee contentious.
And that is a speciall argument the ale. sellers vse against vs,
saying that we gaine by falling out of neighbours, &amp; frends
but they grow rich by meeting of good fellowes, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
together lovinglie. There are so manie hinderances
grownevp of late that it is impossible our raigne should
long continue although it be true (and wee complaine not)
that malice is as great among men as ever it was, and can be
wished: but the mischiefe is, their monie failes, &amp; they grow

and improvident libertie for all sorts &amp; degrees to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
so that many are grand-mothers at 30 yeares old. The
other is the multitude of Inclosures and decay of tillage.
And if we corne-men did not till all the ground we can get;
how deare (thinke you) would corne bee shortly? Many
other Reasons for brevity sake I omit, but these will hold

                  <p>To deale plainely with you all, mine opinion is,
that the world is generally more wronged and abused by
the Lawyer and merchant, then by the Farmer, who though
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8145:34"/>
he haue faults, yet gets he his liuing more honestly, and is of
necessitie to be harboured. But Sir <hi>Hermito</hi> I must referre
the full decision of their cause to your censure.</p>

                  <speaker>Her.</speaker>
                  <p>That one of them is better then the other, I doe
not see; therefore me thinkes the question should rather be
which is the worst. The Farmer that deceiues so farre as
his capacity will carry him, is condemned by his intention
to doe worse if his skill did enable him.</p>
                  <p>The Lawyer is a necessary member of the commonwelth
to finde and determine everie mans right. But if willingly
he oppugne right, and be enemie to peace, he is the <hi>Diuels
agent,</hi> and Christs enemie.</p>
                  <p>Likewise a merchant which causeth commerce and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
betweene severed nations is a man commendable. But
if he vse fraud, then is he pestiferous, and deserueth banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
where no societie is.</p>

                  <p>Sir. this Tiburnist, or hangman is the Divell. And
this fellow that hath the purse is Iudas. the figure of 30 with

That which followeth is meant of Christ, worth a hundred
worlds: for which fact the Divell put a halter about his neck

be faithfull each to other. But virginitie goes further: and
that is sequestred continencie during life, not admitting

much against my minde) that you should haue kept your

appeale to your owne court for Iustice, and hope you will
