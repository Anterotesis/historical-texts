         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There have beene wicked men, who preſuming to

to extirpate, and annihilate <hi>hereby</hi> execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

more covertly their pernicious deſignes.
The marke which S. <hi>Iude</hi> propoundeth to us to

and <hi>blaſpheme Majeſty.</hi> And would to <hi>God,</hi> that

the power of thoſe, who have in their hands the

ſmall and ridiculous cauſes, and to put in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
other <hi>Supreme Magiſtrates</hi> either Annuall, or

which is governed by our moſt Chriſtian,

teſtifying the affection, which <hi>Shee</hi> beareth to <hi>His

<hi>Shee</hi> thought good, that they ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine

of the <hi>Doctours</hi> appointed by the <hi>Facultie,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20815:6"/>
who have declared, that in thoſe <hi>two Chapters</hi> are
contained theſe propoſitions following: <hi>That the
<hi>Pope</hi> can puniſh <hi>Kings, and Princes</hi> with temporall
puniſhments, depoſe, and deprive them of their <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi>
for the crime of Hereſie, and free their <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi>
from their obedience, and that this hath ever
been the cuſtome in the Church.</hi> And not only for
Hereſie, but alſo for other cauſes; to wit, <hi>for their
ſinnes. If alſo it be expedient: If <hi>Princes</hi> be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent:
If they bee unable, and unprofitable.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
<hi>that the <hi>Pope</hi> hath power ouer <hi>ſpirituall</hi> things,
and alſo over all <hi>temporall.</hi> And that by the Law
of God there is in him both <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and <hi>temporall</hi>
power. That we must beleeve, that to the <hi>Church,</hi> and
her <hi>Supreme Paſtour</hi> power is given to puniſh with
<hi>temporall</hi> puniſhments, <hi>Princes</hi> who offend againſt
divine, and humane lawes, eſpecially if the crime be
Hereſie.</hi> They ſaid alſo, that the ſame <hi>Santarellus</hi>
affirmed in that booke. <hi>That the Apoſtles were
ſubject to Secular Princes de facto, but not de iure.</hi>
And alſo, <hi>that as ſoone as the <hi>Pontificall Dignitie</hi>
was ordained, all <hi>Princes</hi> began to bee ſubject to it.</hi>
To be ſhort, they related, that he expoundeth thoſe
words of CHRIST, <hi>Whatſoever thou ſhalt binde
upon earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 16.</note> &amp;c. Not only of <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> but alſo of
<hi>temporall</hi> power. And that he corrupteth the text
of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in cutting of the negation [<hi>Not</hi>] and
impoſeth upon <hi>Authours</hi> things,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. Our Lord hath given us power to edification, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> which they never
thought of. And they concluded, that as well
theſe things, as many others, which they related,
doe worthily deſerve the <hi>Correction,</hi> and <hi>cenſure</hi> of
the <hi>Facultie.</hi>

collected, the <hi>Facultie</hi> hath diſproved, and
condemned the <hi>doctrine</hi> contained in theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
and the concluſions of the ſaid heads, <hi>as
new, falſe, erroneous, contrarie to the word of God;
making the <hi>Pontificall</hi> dignitie to be odious; opening
the way to <hi>Schiſme;</hi> which dependeth only upon <hi>God,</hi>
hindering the converſion of Infidell, and Hereticall
