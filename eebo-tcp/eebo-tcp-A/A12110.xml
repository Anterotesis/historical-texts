            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Howe be it that lyuynge and dyinge be all at the pleasure of almyghty God, yet man may lyue by the course of nature lxxii. yeares or more: this was his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And he sayth as muche tyme as a man hath to growe in beautie, length,

bredthe, and strength. So muche tyme hath he to waxe olde, and feble to his ende: But the terme to growe in beaute, heyght, and strength, is xxxvi. yeare and the terme to waxe olde, feble and weke, and turne to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> erthward, whiche is in all to gether lxxii. yere, that he oughte to lyue by course of nature. And they that dye before this tyme, often it is by vyolence and outrage done to theyr complection &amp; nature. But they that lyue aboue this terme is by good regyment &amp; ensygnements, after the which a man hath gouerned him selfe. To his purpose of lyuing and dyeng, the sayd Shepard sayth that the thinge that we desyre moste in this worlde is to lyue longe, and the thinge that we most feare is to dye soone, thus he trauayled his vnderstandinge, and made great dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to knowe and to do thynges possyble and requisyce for to lyue longe, hole, and ioyously, which this present composte &amp; kalender of Shepar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des shewynge and techynge, ¶Wherfore we wyll shewe you of the bodyes celestial, and of theyr nature and mouynges, and this present boke is named the compost, for it comprehendeth sully all the compost, &amp; more for the dayes houres and momentes, and the newe moones, and the eclyps of the sonne &amp; the moone, and the sygnes that the moone is in euery day, and this boke was made for them that be no clerkes to bringe them to great vnderstandinge. He sayde also that the desyre to lyue longe was in his soule, the which alway lasteth, wherfore he wolde that his desyre wer accomplyshed after his death as a fore.

We purpose to shew the trees of vyces, for synners to take example by, for to vnderstande their sinnes. The which is deuided in .yii. pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall partes after the .vii. deadly synnes, and eche deadly synne is lykened to a tree, and euery tree hauing .vii. small braunches, and all these .vii trees commeth out of one tree by it selfe that is euyll, and commeth of one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and that is the deuill, and it bydeth an end, that is euerlasting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is ordeyned for all them that seeke not remedy betymes by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and repentaunce of theyr lyfe in tyme.</p>
            <p>And after these trees of vyces foloweth the paynes of hell, to shew the lay people what punyshmente is ordeyned for euery deadely synne, and that the people may the better shew theyr synnes in confession, and make cleane theyr conscyence, &amp; that they may be the house of God, so that vertues may growe and fructifie to the profyte of theyr soules. The fyrst great braunch of the tree of vyces is Pryde, and he hath .xvii braunches growing out of hym. As of vayne glory of him selfe. Uayne glory of the worlde. Praysing hym selfe in euyll. Bostinge of synne. Inobedyence. Disdayne. To tempte God. Excesse. Dispraysinge. False goodnesse. Hardynesse. Presumption. Rebellion. Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacion. Sinne wittingly. Communynge of the Sacrament. Shame to doe good. Out of euery of the whych braunches spryngeth three braunches, and out of euery of the sayde three braunches groweth three small braunches, to the number of seuen score and thyrtene, and in so many maners and wayes ye may synne in the synne of Pryde, the whych is the roote and beginning of all the seuen deadly synnes. And therefore it shall be shewed fyrste of Pryde, and after the other syxe synnes as they folowe in order.</p>

her chylde Iesus. The iii. shalbe of the xii. articles of oure faythe. The iiii. shalbe of the x. commaundementes of the lawe. The fyfth shalbe of the Fielde of vertues: For the first ye ought to know that by the oraison of our lord, that is the Pater noster, when we saye it we demaunde of God suffysaunce of all thinges necessaay for to salute &amp; helpe of our soules &amp; of our bodies, not only for vs, but for all other. And for all this cause we ought to haue the sayde orayson in great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>placion, &amp; say it with great devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God. And vnto yonge people it shuld betaught &amp; sayde to them, for though they vnderstande it not, yet it profyteth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue the kyngedome of heuen. And they say it in perfyte loue &amp; charitie, In the Pater noster, we aske vii. peticions. By eche peticion we may vnderstande vii. other thinges. As the vii, Sacramentes of holy Church. The vii. gyftes of the holy ghoste. The vii. armures of iustyce spirituall. The vii. vertues princypall that we shoulde exercyse. The seuen workes of mercy bodely. The vii. workes of mercy ghostly. The vii. deadlye sinnes that we shulde drede. The declaration is this, Our father that art in heauen thy name be made holy. In his peticion, we aske of god our father to be his sonnes, for otherwyse we can not be called his sonnes, nor be our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; that his name may be made by vs more holyer then any other thinge, wherfore we receaue the sacrament of baptisme, without that, ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may not be made the sonne of God, &amp; to receaue the vertue of meknesse against pryde, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to clothe the naked, &amp; helpe the nedy both bodely &amp; ghostly. The ii. is, thy kyngdome come to vs is this peticion. In so much thy name of God may not be perfitely halowed of vs in this worlde we aske his realme. In the whiche perfitely we shal halowe it, for to that kyngdom we be very heirs. This pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticion is the sacrament of priesthod, by the which we are taught to good wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>kes, &amp; the gift of the holy-ghost is the gift of vnderstanding, for to vnderstand &amp; desyre the kyngdome of heauen, and we arme vs wyth the helme of large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ageinst coueteous. The iii. peticion is thy wil be done in the earth as it is in heauen. For it is the faythfull will of God that his wyll shulde be fulfylled that is his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, by this peticion we make obeysau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to God in our hertes, when we desyre to do his will. By this is vnderstande the sacrament of Mariage, by the which we auoyde fornication, and the gifte af counsell of the holy ghost for to order our obeysance veritably. And so we arme vs with the armoure of saluation ageinst enuye. The fourthe peticion is, our dayely breade gyue vs this day. Here we aske of God to be susteyned with materiall breade for our bodyes, and spiritual bread for our soules, that is the bread of lyfe, the body of Iesu Christ, the whiche we receaue by faith, in mynde of hys passion. The ghyft of the holy ghost is strength to be faithfull in oure beliefe, take we the sworde of pacience ageynst the synne of yre, and vysyte the sycke men bodely, and vse vertue of temperaunce ageynst wrathe. the fyfte pety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ion is, forgeue vs oure sinnes as we forgyue all men, for trust well, he that wyll not forgyue for the loue of Godde, God wil neuer forgyue hym hys sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
<pb facs="tcp:8212:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And these .iii. peticions folowinge we aske of God to be delyuered from al euyll, as of the sinne that we haue done deadely, &amp; by these we aske of God to be assoyled and to gyue vs pardon by his mercye, by the whiche we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the sacrament of penaunce &amp; forgyuenisse of sinne the holy ghostes gifte is scyence for to vnderstande the workes of mercy and to escapt synne. And so clothe vs with lightnes ageinst couetyse, and comforte pore prysoners and gyue good councell to them that aske and nede it, and take the vertue of fayth ageynst couetyse. The vi. peticion is suffre vs not to be ouercome in temptacion by the seconde euyl that is not done, but it maye happen &amp; we fall by the waye of temptacion. Here we aske of God to be stedfaste in the fayth, &amp; that we may gladly do good workes in the vertue of hope and strength to do good dedes, &amp; withstande temptacion to the which profyteth to vs the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of confirmation whiche giueth to vs the knowledge of God by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of veritie. The gift of the holy ghost, and so take we the spere of sobernesse ageinst glotony, and comforte pilgrimes by vertue of hope. The vii. peticion is to deliuer vs frome all euyll. Amen. The thirde euill, is euyll of peyne that sinners maye haue yf they serue not God, &amp; by this peticion we aske that we may be delyuered from all peynes, and saued in Paradyce, vnto this say we all. Amen. By these we aske, so it be done as we desyre. By the whiche we receaue the sacrament of the later anoyntynge, that gyueth vs the sure way of saluation, the gift of the holy ghoste is drede of iudgementes of God, and gyrde vs with the gyrdle of chastitie ageynst lechery, and burye we them that be deade bodely, and praye for our enemies ghostly, get we in vs the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of charitie, and eschewe the sinne of lechery.</p>

The ship as sone as it is entred into the sea, vnto the ende of her viage, nighte and day is in perill to be drowned or taken with enemies, for in the sea be perilles without number. Such is the body of man liuing in the world, the marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise that he beareth is his soule, his vertues and good workes, the port or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen is death, and Paradise for the good, to the which who that goeth thither is soueraignely rich, the sea is the world full of linnes.

Of the three fyrste is ynoughe sayde, that is to knowe, the .xii. artycles of the fayth, in the whyche lyeth our fayth and beliefe, and the thinges that we oughte to demaunde of God, be conteyued in the Pater noster, wherein our hope lyeth. Also the tenne commaundementes of the lawe, and of holye Churche, where as Charitie is shewed in suche as kepe them, by probacyon of the loue of Godde, and do his commaundements and good workes. Nowe will we speake of the other .iiii. And firste of the vocation in the whiche we be, whiche is the fourthe thynge that eche man ought to knowe. Eche man ought to knowe hys vocation, and the thynges belongynge to the same be iuste and honest for his health and rest of hys conscyence. A good Shepeherde ought to know the arte of shepe ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynge, and to gouerne shepe, and leade them into pastures, and to heale them when they be sycke, and shere them in season, to the entent that throughe his defaute no dammage come to hys master. In likewise he that laboureth the corne, to knowe what grounde were good for euery manner of grayne, and ought to tyll the earth, and when time is to sowe, weede, repe, and threshe, so that hys mayster may haue no dammage by hym. Semblably a Surgyon ought to knowe howe to comforte and heale such folkes, that he hath charge of, wythoute bydinge of hys arte or Surgery. Consequently a marchaunte ought to knowe the vtteraunce of hys marchaundyse to other, with no more fraude then he would hym selfe shoulde haue. Also an Aduocate or a Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour ought to knowe the ryghtes and customes of places, that by their faulte Iustyce be not peruerted. A Iudge also oughte to knowe (bothe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes heard) who hath right and who hath wrong, and iudge egally after true Iustyce. Also a Prieste or a relygious man oughte to knowe theyr orders and keepe them, and aboue all thynge oughte to knowe that lawe of God, and teach them vnto the ignoraunt. And thus of all other vocations. For all them that knowe not their vocation be not worthy to be, and lyue in perill of their sowles for theyr ignoraunce The fyfth that all men ought to knowe, is it he haue discretion and vnderstandinge, to knowe if he be in the grace of God or not. And howe be it righte difficile, for God onely knoweth it, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we may haue coniectures that sheweth it, and sufficient for Shepherdes and lay people to know, if they be in the loue of the Lord, and if they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture to be in it, therfore there ought none to repute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues iust, but ought t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> humble them selues, and aske him mercy that maketh sinners become iuste
<pb facs="tcp:8212:51"/>
and none other. Principally we ought to know this scyence when we wyll re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the body of Iesu Christe. For who that receiueth his grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes receaueth his saluation, and who that receaueth him otherwyse, recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth euerlastinge dampnation, of the whyche thinge euerye man is iudge in hym selfe of his owne conscyence, and none other. The coniectures whereby we may knowe if that we be in the grace of God or not. The fyrste coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is when we do trauel for to clense our conscience of our soules by penance as much as if we laboured to get some great good, that we be not culpable of any deadly sinne done, or in will to do, nor in any sentence, then it is good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturinge to be in the grace of God. The seconde coniecture that sheweth in lykewyse to be in the grace of God, is when we be more prompt and ready to good, obseruinge and keeping the commaundementes of Godde, and doe all good workes that we shoulde haue accustomed. The third coniecture is when we heare gladly the worde of God, as sermons and good counsaylers for our saluation. The fourth, when we be sory and contrite at our hart to haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mysed and done any sinne. The fifth is when with good purpose and wyll of our selues we perseuer to kepe vs from sinne in tyme to come. These coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures be they wherby Shepherds and lay people know if they be in his grace or not, as muche as in them is possible to knowe. The .vi. thinge that euery man ought to knowe is God, for all men ought to knowe God, for to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyshe his wil and commaundement, by the which he would be loued with all thy harte, with all thy soule, and wyth all the force that we haue, whyche we may not do, if we knowe hym not, then who that would loue Godde, ought to knowe him, and the more that they know him, the more they loue him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hereafter shall be sayde howe Shepherds and simple people doth knowe hym. Shepherdes and simple people for to haue knowledge of God of theyr possibilitie consyderinge three thinges. The firste is, that they consyder the ryght great ryches of God, his puissaunce, his soueraygne dignitie, hys soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raygne noblesse, his soueraygne ioy and blysse. The seconde is for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder the right noble, ryght gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t and marueylous operations and workes of our Lord God. And the thirde consideration is, for they consider the innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable benefites that they haue receued of God, and that continually euery day they receaue of him, and by these considerations they come to his cognysance and knowledge. Fyrst to know God, Shepherdes and lay people consydereth his great riches, plenteous habundaunce of the goodnes that he hath, for all the treasures and rychesse of heauen and of the earth be his, and all goodnesse he hath made, of the which he is fountayne, creatour, and mayster, and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth them largely vnto euery creature, and he hath no neede of any other. Wherefore it behoueth to say that he is right rich. Secondly he is right pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issaunt, for by his greate puissaunce he hath made heauen, earth, and the sea, with all thinges conteyning vnto them, and might vndo them if that it were his will, vnto the which puissaunce all other be subiect, and trembleth before
<pb facs="tcp:8212:51"/>
him for his great excellency. And who that woulde consider euery worke of God should finde inough to maruell on. By the firste of these considerations God is knowen to be right rich, by giftes that he geueth to his friendes, and by the seconde he is knowen right puissaunt for to venge him on his enemies. Thirdly he is soueraignely worthy, for all the thinges of heauen and of earth oweth him honoure and reuerence, as to their Creatour and hym that made them, as we se children honour father and mother of whom they be discended by a generation, and all thinges be discended of God by a creation, to whome ought to be giuen great reuerence, and he is so worthy. Fourthly he is soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignely noble, for who that is soueraignely rich, puissaunt, and worthy, him behoueth to be soueraignely noble, but none other but God hath riches, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issaunce, and dignitie, as he hath, wherefore of such nobles ought to be sayde that he is righte noble. Fifthly he hath soueraigne ioye, for he that is riche, puissaunte, worthy and right noble, is not withoute soueraigne ioye, and this ioye is full of all goodnes, and ought to be our felicitie, to the which we hope to come. That is to knowe and see God in his soueraigne ioy and gladnes, for to haue with him eternal ioy that euer shal dure. And this is the first conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God that Shepherdes and other simple people ought to haue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly for to know God considering his great noblesse and maruelous workes the bountie and the beauty of the things that he hath made, for it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sayd. One may know the workman by his worke. Knowledge we then the worke of God, and knowledge we that his beautie and bountie shineth in the operations that he hath made, which if they be fayre and good, the workman that hath made them must nedes be faire and good without comparison more then any thinge that he hath made. Be it considered of the heauens and the thinges therein set, what noble and marueylous worke, howe may one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their excellence and bountie. Be it considered also as we may of the earth the right noble and marueylous workes of God, the golde, the siluer, and all maner of metalles, and precious stones in it, the fruites that it beareth, the trees, the beastes that it susteyneth, and of the bountie that it norisheth. Be it in likewise considered of the Sea, the riuers, and the fishe nourished in them. The wether, the elementes, the ayre, the windes, and the Birdes that flyeth in them, and all the vsage and seruyce of man. And consider the workeman that of his puissaunce hath all made, and by his sapience hath righte well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his workes, and gouerneth them by his great bountie, and by this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we may knowe God, as Shepeherdes and simple folkes in consideringe his workes. Thirdely for to knowe God, consider the great benefites that we receaue daily of him, whiche may not be numbred for their greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, nor spoken of for their noblenesse and dignitie. Al be it in their hartes be vi. principally noted. For the which an other Shepeherde geniuge praysing to God, sayde in this maner. Lorde God I knowe that thou haste endued me with thy infinite benefites by thy great bountie. First the benefite of my cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb facs="tcp:8212:52"/>
by the whiche thou made me a reasonable man vnto thy Image and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milytude, geuynge me body and soule, and rayment for to clothe me. Lorde thou haste geuen me my wittes of nature, vnderstandinge for to gouerne my lyfe, my health<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my beauty, my strength, and my scyence for to get my lyuynge honestly, I yelde to thee graces and greate thankes. Secondely Lorde I knowe the goodnes of my redemption, how by thy misericordious pitie, thou bought me dearely by the affection of thy moste precious bloude, peynes, and torments, that for me thou hast suffered, and finally endured death, thou hast geuen me thy bodye, thy soule, and thy lyfe, for to kepe me from dampnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherefore humbly I yelde to thee graces and great thankes. Thirdely Lorde I know the goodnes of my vocation, how of thy great grace thou hast called me againe, for to enheryte thy eternall benediction, and also thou haste geuen vnto me fayth and knowledge of thine owne selfe, as baptisme, and all the other sacramentes, that none entendement may comprise their noblesse, and dignitie, and that so many times hath pardoned me of my sinnes. Lorde I knowe that this is to me a singuler gifte that thou hast not geuen to them which haue no knowledge of thee, wherof I am more beholding and humbly bound, I yelde thee graces and thankes. Fourthly Lord I knowledge that thou hast geuen me this world and the things that be therin made for my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and vse, the office, the benefite, and the dignitie in the which I am, for syr I beare your similitude and Image which is reputed right worthy and noble wherof humbly I yelde to thee graces and thankes. Fyfthly Lorde thou hast geuen me the Skie and his faire ornaments, the Sunne, the Moone, and the Sterres, that the daye and night serueth me, geuinge brightnesse and lyght without to be recompensed of me, wherof I yelde to thee graces and thanks. Syxtly Lorde I knowledge that thou hast made Paradyse ready for to geue me, where I shall lyue with thee in ioyes without ende, if I doe thy will, and kepe thy commaundementes, and also I knowledge thy other infynite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes eche daye to me done by thy bountie, the whiche ensigneth me to knowe my God, my Sauiour, and Redemer, wherefore I humbly geue thankes to thee. By these considerations Shepherds and simple people contempleth the bountie of God, and the benefytes that they receaue of hym. And knowe we hym, and be we not in great knowledge of hys benefytes in yeldinge thankes and praysynges to hym, and recompence of your gooddes in geuinge to poore folkes for his sake, for Ingratitude is a villayne sinne that much displeaseth God. The .vii. and the laste thynge that eche man ought to knowe, that is to knowe him selfe, for it is the beste meane for to come vnto the knoweledge of God, and for to make his saluation, so to knowe hym selfe fyrst. Diuers folke knowe many thinges that know not them selfe, to whom should profite more to know them selfe, then all things in the world. They that know the things of the worlde loueth them, seeketh them, and kepeth them, and k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>owe not, ne loue not, ne prayse not, ne kepeth not God in likewise, for they know hym not. What profiteth man to win al the world, &amp; leeseth himselfe for to be damned?
<pb facs="tcp:8212:52"/>
Better it were for hym to leese all the worlde, if it were his, if he knew him selfe to be saued. Shepeherdes say that the nedefull beginninge of hys salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to knowe hymselfe, and contrarywise ignoraunce of hym selfe is the beginning of dampnation, and of all euill that may befall vnto him.</p>
            <p>A question of a master Shepherde to a symple Shepherde to wete how he knewe hym selfe and he sayd. Shepherde tell me howe thou knowest thy selfe what arte thou, aunswere to me? And he sayde, I knowe my selfe, for I am a Christian man a Shepherde. What is to be a Shepherde. And he aunswered vnto that, thou askest what man is. I say that man is a substaunce composed of body and soule. The body is mortall and made of earth as beastes be, but the soule is made of spirituall matter as Aungels be immortall. My body is come of abhominable sinne, and as a sacke full of durte and fylth, and meate for wormes, my beginninge was vyle, my lyfe is payne, laboure, feare, and in subiection to death, and my end shalbe woful, but my soule is created of god nobly and worthely to hys owne Image and semblaunce after the Aungels, the most fayrest and perfyte of all creatures, by baptisme and by fayth is made his daughter, hys spouse, his heire of his realme, that is Paradyse, &amp; for her noblenesse and dignitie ought to be a Lady, and my body as seruant ought to obey her, for reason hath ordeyned and will that it be so: and who that doeth otherwise, and preferreth his body before his soule, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eseth the vsage of reason: and maketh him selfe semblable vnto beastes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> discendinge from noble digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie into myserable seruitude of sensualitie, by the which it is gouerned, so that I knowe my selfe man. As to the seconde, he demaundeth what thinge it is to be a Christian man? I aunswere in myne vnderstandinge, that to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, is to be baptised or Christened, and folowe Iesus Christ, of whom we be sayde Christians, for to be baptised and not to folowe him, or to folowe him and not to be baptysed, saueth not man, and therefore when we receaue baptisme, we renounce the deuill and all his pompes, and we make promyse for to followe Iesu Christe, when we say (we will be baptised.) And who that kepeth this promyse hath the very name of a Christian man. And who that kepeth it not, is a sinner and a lyer to God, and seruaunte to the deuill, and is no more Christen then a deade man, or a payntynge on a wall, we say that is a man. Here demaundeth the maister Shep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>herde in howe manye thynges the Christian man ought to folowe Iesus Christe, for to accomplishe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myse of Baptisme. The simple Shepherd aunswereth: I say in .vi. thinges. The firste is cleanesse of conscience, for there is no thinge more pleasaunte to God then a cleane conscyence, and it will be made cleane in two maners, one is by baptisme when we receaue it, and the other by pacience, that is contricion of harte, confession of mouth, satisfaction of worke, and then when we be clean we be pleasaunt to Iesu Christe, which with the water of his mercy clenseth the synners that doth penaunce, and maketh them fayre. The seconde thinge in which we ought to followe Iesu Christ, is humilitie, at the example of him.
<pb facs="tcp:8212:53"/>
Lorde of all the worlde, whiche humbled him to take our humanitie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mortall that was immortall, lyue in pouertie with vs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eate oppropried paynes, and finally suffer to be crucified. Thus the Christian man ensuinge hym ought to meeke hym selfe. The thirde thinge is to holde and loue truth, and specially three truthes. The firste truthe is to knowe our selfe, for we be mortall and sinnefull, and who that dyeth in sinne shalbe damned, &amp; this truth witholdeth sinne, and exhorteth the sinner to do penaunce and amende. The seconde trueth is of temporall goodes, for they be transitory and must be lefte and this truth disprayseth them to desire the heauenly goods that be eternal. The thyrde truthe is of God, which is the ioye that all Christian men ought to desire, and this truth draweth the Christian man to loue and induseth him to do good workes for to meryte the ioyes of Paradyse. The fourth thynge wherein euery man ought to followe Iesu Christe, is pacyence in aduersitie, and in the spirite of lyfe by penaunce, confirminge of oure selfes in the state of Iesu Christe, of whome the lyfe was all in paine and pouertie which he endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for vs. The fyfth is in compassion of the poore, to the example of Iesu Chryste, that by his mercy healed the poore of all corporall infirmities, and the sinners of all ghostly sicknes, and we by compassion oughte to geue of our goodes to poore folke, and comforte them bodely and ghostly. The syxth thing wherein the Christian man ought to followe Iesu Christe, is doloure, deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, charitie, in contemplacion of the mysteries of his natiuitie, of his death and passion, of his resurrection, of his ascension, and of his aduaunsing to the iudgemente, that often tymes ought to be at our harte by holy medytacions. And as to the last, what thing a Shepherd is. I say that it is the knowledge of my vocation, as eche hath his, as afore is sayd, and also to knowe the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of all these foresayde thynges, howe manye tymes in eche we haue transgressed, for many tymes we haue offended God, and who that taketh hede shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inde omissions and offences without number, the which knowen, we ought to doubt and eschew, and do penance. And thus it is as I know man is Christen and Shepherde.</p>

Thus the sunne is to them the one halfe of the yere towarde the pole Artike, and the other halfe towarde the other pole, and therfore they haue two winters in a yere without great colde, one is when we haue winter, and the other when we haue sommer. Sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly they haue two sommers, one is in March when we haue prime time, and the other in September when we haue haruest, and by this they haue foure solstices, two hie when the sunne passeth by their zenich, and two lowe when it declineth one way or other, and thus they haue four vmbres or shadowes in a yere, for when the sunne is in the equinocces twise in a yere, in the morninge their shadowes be in the Occidente, and at night in the Oriente, and then at noone they haue no shadowes, but when the sunne is in the signes septentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onals their shadowes be towarde the parties of the signes meridionals, and so againeward. Secondly they that inhabite betwene the Equinoctiall and the Tropike of sommer, haue in likewise two sommers and two winters, and four shadowes in a yere, and they haue no difference of the first, saue that they haue longer dayes in sommer, and shorter in winter, for as the Equinoctiall lengeth, in likewise doth the dayes in sommer, and in that part of the earth is the first climate and almost halfe of the seconde, and is named Araby wherin is Ethiopia. Thirdly they that inhabite vnder the Tropike of sommer haue the sunne ouer their heades, and at the day of the solstice of sommer at noone, they haue their shadowes smaller then we haue, and there is a parte of Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opic. Fourthly they that be betwene the Tropike of sommer and the circle Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike haue longer dayes in sommer then the abouesayde, in as much as they be farther from the Equinoctiall, and shorter in winter, and they haue the sunne ouer their heades, ne toward septentrion, and that part of the earth we inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite. Fifthly they that inhabite vnder the circle Artike haue the ecliptike of the zodiake to their orizon, and when the sunne is in the solstice of sommer, it resconseth not, &amp; thus they haue no night, but natural dayes of .xxiiii. houres. Semblably when the sunne is in the solstice of winter it is natural day when they haue contynuall nyght, and that the sunne ryseth not to them. Sixthly they that be betwene the circle Artike and the pole Artike, haue in sommer dyuers naturall dayes, that be to them one day artificiall without any night. And also in winter be many natural dayes, which are to them alwaies night, and the more that it approcheth the pole, the more is the artificial day of som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer longe, and dureth in some place a weke, in other a moneth, in other two, in other three, in other more, and proporcionally the night is greater, for some of the signes be euer on their Oryzon, and some alwayes vnder, and as longe

as the Sunne is in the signes aboue it is day, and while it is in the signes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneth it is night. Seuenthly they that inhabite right vnder the pole haue the sunne halfe of the yeare on their Orizon, and haue continuall day, and the other halfe of the yere continuall night, and the Equinoctial is in their orizon that deuideth the signes, six aboue and six beneath, wherfore when the sunne is in the signes that be hye, and towarde them they haue continuall day: and when it is in the signes toward midday, they haue continual nyght, and thus in a yere they haue but one day and one night.
