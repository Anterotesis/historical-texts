            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Sir, I am for neither of thoſe intereſts ſingly, other then they ſerve to inlarge the Common-wealth of the Creation, and ſo I am for all of them (although differing one from an other in opinions) but Sir, it's like you may make uſe of all of them to ſerve your ends on them (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you be of neither of their opinions) for ſo policy can do, and will ſeldome do more then be for either of them, as they are uſefull to him, or for all of them together, if the ſpirit of people be that way.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30336:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
becauſe I perceive you are unbiaſſed as to either of them, I ſhall leave the old Proteſtants (ſo called) becauſe we will be brief at preſent, and begin with ſome Presbyters, what think you of them? are they likely to do the world that good they now generally expect, <hi>viz.</hi> eaſe to their perſons, eſtates and minds?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inno.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I think many of them are going down the wind, nay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all of them (except ſome that have of late turn'd GIBEONITES) for their ſpirit <hi>viz.</hi> perſecution for opinion is going from them apace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another form, which ſome of the wiſeſt of them go along with, and think to uſe them again in another garb, then that of Presbytery, for they think to ſweep and garniſh another dwelling for that unclean ſpirit, which if they do, for ought I know their latter end may be worſe then their beginning, for theſe are ſearching times.</p>
               <p>But Sir, in few words I ſhall tell you, they of the Presbytery were ſo violently eaten up for the zeal of the Lords Houſe, and have ſo whin'd, and pin'd, and faſted, &amp;c. that they have made that ſeeming pamper'd Palphray as poor as a Scotch Galloway taken at Worceſter, that ſo now very many of them have very ſmall trading, and have little to do, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be to receive Tithes, and read the Directory, and ſpend ſome of thoſe eſtates they have gained, if they have much left, out of their late contributions, to the CHARITABLE USES OF LOVE:—but Sir, I tell you many of the Presbyters have great hopes of a Reſurrection of their cauſe for they uſe all the skill and power they have to do it, eſpecially in the Committee of Divines, where if they can helpe it, none ſhall paſſe to preach that are friends to the Common-wealth, but rather ſuch as can ſpeak pure Scotch, and are railers againſt Sectaries of all ſorts: this, with many other great influences they have elſwhere, doth make them hope, and I think yet whine forth their many invectives, in paroboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſayings againſt the Common-wealth; but Sir, I ſhall leave them at preſent, what is your next queſtion?</p>

               <p>Sir, I ſhall tell you what I hear of many ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> ſome ſay there went but a pair of ſheers between them and their elder Brethren the Presbyters, the one going a little backwards, and the other going a little forwards, to make up the Brotherhood with LOVE: — beſides, ſome call many of theſe <hi>Norfolk Independents,</hi> becauſe, ſay they, ſuch of them are for a toleration of the true Religion, which is, as they ſay, that only which they believe and follow, <hi>viz.</hi> the form of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall Churches, the Pope was alwaies for ſuch a toleration, <hi>viz</hi> his own way of worſhip: beſides Mr. <hi>Policy,</hi> many think that Mr. <hi>Perſecution</hi> doth intend to dwell a while in that ſwept and garniſhed form, when he is wholly departed from Presbytery, as if the Pithagorian Doctrine of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miguration were true, he alwaies leaps from one form to an other, and uſually appeareth moſt in the form that is in moſt repute in the world, although it be that which (when he dwelt in Papacy and Epiſcopary) he perſecuted, but have a care thou that haſt ſaid it was not good to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute for difference in opinion, doeſt thou perſecute? who art thou that judgeſt thy Brother, doſt thou not know that every one ſhall give an account of himſelf to God? wilt thou not ſee how that arch-enemy to the Creations peace, Perſecution, hath ſerved his old Tabernacles of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy and Presbytery, he may do as much for thee that art a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Independent, it's good for thee to be moderate in this day of Gods ſtrange workings, although he make thy ears tingle at the Clouds he appeareth in; do you not know that Gods way hath been to do his greateſt works by the moſt contemptible and baſe means, to ſtain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt the honorable of the earth, that no fleſh ſhould glory?</p>

               <p>Sir, that I ſhall alſo, becauſe you ſo much deſire it (although I believe you know them already very will) but I hope we ſhall have ſome diſcourſe touching a true Chriſtian, when I have done with them alſo: but Sir, if I ſhall fail in my Opinion of them, you muſt pardon me, for I fear I ſhall want words to expreſſe their worth (compared with many in the times:) but Sir, touching thoſe that are called <hi>Seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> ſo far as I have found them, they do appear to be very wiſe, ſolid, conſcientious, honeſt, publike ſpirited perſons, that are not wedded to any formall <hi>Idol,</hi> as knowing there is none; they are ſuch (many of them) that are of penetracious judgements, and can ſee the inſides of many jugling ſelf-ended ones, that under ſpecious pretences do oppreſſe the poor and miſerable, they can foreſee the effects of things from their cauſes, and can dive into the bottom of moſt Politike deſigns, and are ſuch as well know the ſpirit of people, and do know what would be moſt pleaſing unto them, they know what men-groan under external<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and alſo mentally; they know the temper of the people is generally for true liberty to their minds, bodies, and eſtates, they are ſuch as do not affect much verboſity and jangling about Opinions, but (they ſay) they would have perſons to be ſober, moderate, and temperate to all,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30336:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and not have more the name of Chriſtians then they practiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſure Maxim in Chriſtianity, of doing as they would be done unto in all things (conſcience being judge) they are ſuch as well know the Lawyers and Preiſts—and do not affect Tithes, &amp;c.— and I think many of them are for toleration of Opinion.</p>

               <p>Well <hi>Innocency,</hi> I thank thee for thy pains in what thou haſt ſaid, touching many things relating to thoſe ſeverall intereſts we ſpake of in the Premiſes, I ſhall offer a few words touching ſome of them, I tell thee <hi>Innocency,</hi> I do love many <hi>Independents,</hi> and <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> very well, becauſe many of them have been very active for me, and therefore I muſt be civill to them, I could wiſh they were not ſo rigid, and ſo wedded to their forms as they are, if they were not, many of them would be very pretty men, but people wil not beat many of their injunctions and cenſures: but I'le tel thee <hi>Innocency,</hi> I moſt affect men (like ſome <hi>Seekers</hi>) that are weaned from Idols, and are wiſe, ſolid, moderate, well principled men, whether they be of any Church or not, ſuch as know the ſpirit of the people, and can conform unto them, theſe I affect moſt, if I might have my will, ſuch men as are for toleration of Opinions, for I ſee the people generally affect true liberty, and to be free from all oppreſſions— and beſides, I tell thee plainly I have been in ſome ſtraights touching formality, how to pleaſe many fiery ſpirits, for many of them are very confident in their way, although I ſee little Scripture or reaſon for their forms, for I ſee throrough them all, for as they are uſed, they ſerve only to beget envy and ſtrife amongſt men. and do hinder univerſall love: I'le tell thee <hi>Innocency,</hi> now I do ſuſpect M. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution</hi> to be an Impoſtor, and I fear he may do by me (if I ſhould uſe him) as he hath done by his former Tabernacles, <hi>viz.</hi> miſerably diſtract me, if not deſtroy me, by ſerving me almoſt as bad as the Divell was ſaid to do by the hogs.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Inno.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, that I ſhall briefly, and where I am ſhort, I deſire you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large in your thoughts. 1. A right Chriſtian is one that is one with Chriſt, as Chriſt is one with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21. <hi>Heh.</hi> 2. 11. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p>2. From this Union he is reconciled to God in all things, and in all the variety and multiplicity of appearances, he ſeeth but one God, and ſees all the varieties of things in their ſeverall ſpecies, be they of ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, animalls, and vegetables, or celeſtial, or terreſtiall eſſences, with their ſeverall complections; conſtitutions, and degrees of heat, cold, drought, or moyſture, with their ſeveral actions (that are of God) features, motions, and geſtures, to be the productions of the Unity, whether ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (ſo called) or direct, with all their altitudes and profundities, and latitudes, and longitudes, if ſo I may ſpeak, the <hi>Ens entium,</hi> omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent over all, thorow all, and in all things:— beſides, he ſeeth all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, adminiſtrations, manifeſtations, and operations, are to bring to the perfect Unity of the Son, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. 27. 14. he ſeeing that the ſeverall members are but one body; beſides he cannot ſee any vacuity between Creator and creature, not underſtanding what ſhould be betwixt them, to ſpeak after the manner of men.</p>
               <p>3. He is one that through Chriſt dwelling in him, doth ſee the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity ſlain, and hath gotten victory over all that did torment him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally (and alſo over much corporall ſlavery) having conquered the old man Sin, with Antichriſt, Hell, Death, &amp;c. and ſeeth no let in the holy mountain <hi>Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. He being one, that ſo far as he is born of God doth not ſin, nor can ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. 10. 22. he is in conſcience purged from ſin, he ſeeth Chriſt appearing the ſecond time, without ſin unto him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. 28. and the Lamb that taketh away the ſin of the world (for elſe he muſt have leſſe power then the ſcape-goat under <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 16. 20. 24. that ran away with the ſins of Iſrael once a year) and the bringer in of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting righteouſneſſe <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. (his own) where ſin ſhal be no more, he being the finiſher of it: beſides, he ſeeth that Law made nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as to conſcience, but the bringing in of a better hope, by, and in Chriſt, did— by which he is nigh unto God, having his heart ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, being innocent as a dove.</p>
               <p>5. He is one that (<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>v.</hi> 1.) is dead with Chriſt to the rudiments of the world, and therefore doth not live in them, as ſubject to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances in will-worſhip— being riſen with Chriſt, and ſet together
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30336:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with him in heavenly places, far above Principalities and Powers, and Might, &amp;c. and Dominion, at the right hand of the high Majeſty.</p>
               <p>6. And Sir to be brief, a right Chriſtian, after he hath been acted through the variety of appearances, and hath been led through the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall gradations of Chriſts Kingdome, <hi>viz.</hi> of love, joy, peace, &amp;c. and when Chriſt (in him) hath put down all Rule, Authority, and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ower, and ſlain all deviſion and diſtinction of the wrath and beaſtial principle, then the Kingdome and Dominion is ſurrendred to the Father, and then the creatures will is wholly reſigned into the Divine Will, and is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acted by it, it being then in it's own centre, the end having found the beginning, he being meerly paſſive, neither willing, nor deſiring, not joying, nor ſorrowing, but has then found all (and for ought I know may do all) when he is centricall; but this few attain unto, the beaſtial principle is ſo predominant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pol.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould let thee go on further to character a Chriſtian, as to his ſpirituall intereſt, but that I fear there are ſome (who like the Jewes <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. 16. who pleaſe not God, and are contrary to all men, may perſecute ſuch appearances of Chriſt in any, and call it blaſphemy— therefore prethee leave ſuch high things, and ſpeak ſomething to a Chriſtians practiſe amongſt men in the world.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Inno.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I thank you for your Caution, for though I would be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent as a Dove, yet I may be as wiſe as a Serpent, eſpecially if I meet with ſuch phariſaical Foxes;— therefore I ſhall hint ſome things that are practiſed to the world by a Chriſtian (and if you ſhall pleaſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, J ſhall propoſe ſome Queſtions unto you as a ground for further diſcourſe at ſome other time: but Sir, J ſhall go on) A Chriſtian doth make that ſure Chriſtian Maxim in Chriſtianity (<hi>viz.</hi> of doing as they would be done unto in all caſes) his rule and practiſe, conſcience being the chief Arbitrator.</p>
               <p>And he doth really practiſe this rule in doing well to any in miſery, whether they be of any Church or not, ſo long as he hath it.</p>
               <p>He doth alſo practiſe this rule in all matters of ſin againſt himſelf, whether it be anger, wrath, malice, ſtrife, debate, envy, ſlander, or what ever— and doth put conſcience to the teſt, doth any one thus abuſe me, and do I the ſame to them again? then ſaith conſcience, you do but as you have been done by, and not as you would be done by; if you ſhould ſo offend againſt others, ſinners do love ſuch as love them, and hate ſuch as hate them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30336:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>But Chriſtians do bleſſe them that curſe them, and do good to ſuch as deſpightfully uſe them, and ſpeak all manner of evill of them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Chriſtian is truly inlarged with bowells of meekneſſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to all under oppreſſion, or wrath, or darkneſſe, &amp; is acted to the ful in that love <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. to 7. he vaunteth not himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his fellow creatures, he envieth not any for any thing, he thinketh no evill, he rejoyceth not in iniquity, or in the diſparity or inequality that is in the world: (that ſome are mighty, and others miſerable) that's for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he believeth all things, beareth all things, hopeth all things, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth all things, is far from perſecuting any for Opinion, or delivering them to the divell (as they call it) for it, or into his priſons and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons.</p>
               <p>He is one that uſeth the world, as though he uſed it not, and buyeth, as if he poſſeſſed not; and although he be married, it is as if he were not, he being a child of God, and ſo a child of the Reſurrection, and one that is worthy to obtain that world (that is in ſubjection to man) they can die no more, <hi>death hath no more dominion over them, Luke</hi> 20. 3. 4. 35. 36.</p>
               <p>He wil not be found doing that which Chriſt ſaith he ſhal find the world doing, <hi>viz.</hi> as they did in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> when he ſhould appear in power and ſpirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 24. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 38. the children of this world only doing ſo, <hi>Luke.</hi> 20. 34. the Chriſtian ſeeth, that <hi>in Christ there is no diſtinction of Iew nor Greek neither bond nor free, neither</hi> MALE NOR FEMALE, <hi>for ye are all</hi> ONE <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus, Gal.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Chriſt is all, and in all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to conclude, Mr. <hi>Policy,</hi> becauſe I will not weary your patience with this kind of diſcourſe, a true Chriſtian hath for his further directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pure innocency, as the Scripture ſaith (as a Dove) his eye being ſingle, his body being full of light.</p>

                  <hi>Innocency,</hi> though many of thy characters of a Chriſtian be ſtrange to me, and may prove dangerous to worldly wiſdome, with all it's intereſts and relations, and protectors, yet J cannot but ſay there are very gallant truths in thy words, J wiſh the world were able to beare them as J am; but J muſt deſire thee to draw towards a concluſion at the preſent, and J ſhall gladly have more diſcourſe with thee at ſome other time, for now J am in haſt, having many publike matters in hand.</p>

                  <hi>Innocency,</hi> that I ſhall willingly entertain, but prethee be brief, becauſe I have much buſineſſe? what are thy Quaeces?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jnno.</speaker>
               <p>My firſt is touching the Father.</p>
               <p>1. Quaere, whether the Almighty <hi>Iehovah</hi> be not omnipotent, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent uncircumſcribed, and omniſcient?</p>
               <p>2. Whether all the ſeverall kinds of things are not (in all their varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and multiplications) the productions of the Unity?</p>
               <p>3. Whether there be any enterval, emptineſſe, or vacuity between the Creator and creatures, and if there be any thing between them, then what it is for matter, form, ſubſtance, or ſhape</p>
               <p>4. Whether that which is called the Spirit of God in Scriptures, be not truly of the eſſence of God?</p>
               <p>5. Whether that called the Spirit of God in men, be not of his eſſence?</p>
               <p>6. Where the eſſence of God is circumſcribed — if it be — ſo?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Touching Chriſt.</p>
               <p>7. Whether Chriſt, as a manifeſtation of the Father, according to number, be not him that was, is, and is to come, the yeſterday, to day, and for ever, the beginner and terminator of time, the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi> the <hi>principium &amp; finis,</hi> the <hi>primus &amp; ultimus;</hi> that is the beginning and end, the firſt and laſt, the all, and in all, the only Champion of the Father, the doer of all his ſaving work, and the reconciler of all things to God, and alſo that which was manifeſt to deſtroy all diabolicallneſſe, darkneſſe, ſin, hell, death, or whatever lets in his Kingdome of love, joy, peace, &amp;c. that are the effects of mans own vain knowing, imaginations, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29.</p>
               <p>8. Whether all Chriſts work were compleated in his humanity at Jeruſalem?</p>
               <p>9. Whether Chriſt hath not deſtroyed ever ſince the ſerpent hath built, or whether the evill hath been longer then Chriſt the Unction.</p>
               <p>10. Whether Chriſt had not enemies, before he appeared in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity at Jeruſalem?</p>
               <p>11. What appearance of Chriſt that was that Scriptures ſpeak of, to have been in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19. and to be that rock the Iſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>raelites followed, that they eat and drank of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4.</p>
               <p>12. What Chriſt that is, that is ſaid to be in men the hope of glory
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:30336:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to be formed in them, and to be in them, except they be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates — <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. <hi>Gel.</hi> 4. 19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Touching the Word of God.</p>
               <p>13. Whether there be any thing in Scripture called the Word of God, but God himſelf that made the world, that is ſpirit and life, and only quick and powerfull, and able to divide between joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or whether any thing be the eſſentiall Word, but God? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2.</p>
               <p>14. Whether the (Word) God be not the only truth that needs no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter but himſelf, that in himſelf is the only determiner of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies amongſt men, that in his time will ſhew who is the only King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and to be that truth that ſhall make us free, not like that called truth, which is made the only bond?</p>
               <p>15. Whether the letter of Scriptures be of any advantage to men, except the quicking word of power be (like the day Star) ariſen in them, where by they experiment thoſe teachings of God in themſelves, that was in them that write the Scriptures?</p>
               <p>16. Whether the Scripture miſunderſtood, hath not been made the inſtrument of the murther and oppreſſion of many millions of poor harmleſte creatures, and the engine of all the tyranny in Europe, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Touching the Divell, and Hell.</p>
               <p>17 Whether the Devil (God bleſſe us) be a corporeall and elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſſence, (yea or no) with great clawes and eys, as many country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have believed?</p>
               <p>18 What and where the Hell and torments (ſo much feared by ſinners) are; whether it be in any locall place on the ſuperficies of the terreſtriall world, or in the centre of it, or in the conſciences of ſinners—under wrath and darkneſſe?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Touching Heaven, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>19 Whether there be not Heaven to be had in man, that is quickened together with Chriſt, and ſet together with him in heavenly places?— <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>20. What are meant by the clouds that Chriſt appears in, whether it be meant of elementary clouds that are exhaled from the earth, or clouds that the wiſe world will not think he will appear in? <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 7.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Touching Sin.</p>
               <p>21. Whether Sin be any thing elſe but the effects of mans vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7. 29. being darkned with wrathfull Jdolatry, againſt the light of in them, although there is nothing in it ſelf an Idoll? whether
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30336:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſin be of neceſſity, that the Creation cannot be without it, or whether it be accidentall, or contingent, (ſince it muſt be deſtroyed?)</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Touching the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>22. Whether any Gentile, if he had lived within half a mile of <hi>Moſes</hi> power, ſhould have participated of the Jewiſh priviledges, except he had been proſelited, and if not, then whether he was to conform to their Laws, if it were when <hi>Moſes</hi> lived, eſpecially that of keeping their Sabbath in that manner as they did it?</p>
               <p>23. Whether any Gentile living without <hi>Moſes</hi> power, were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhable, for breaking any of the Moſaicall Laws, in the form they were in, or were to be done to death for not keeping the Sabbath, and if not, why any Gentiles now ſhould be tied to keep it, or one like it? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gentiles had any other direction to worſhip, then the teachings of God in nature, J mean without their own inventions, and before they became vain in their imaginations, and if they had not, then although they were directed in nature to adore a ſuperiour entity, yet where were they tied to time, as ſuch a day, or place, or to do this, and leave the other undone, or elſe you ſhall die the death?</p>
               <p>24. Whether or no a Chriſtian that is entred into his reſt, and ceaſed from his ovvn works, doth eſteem any day above another; or rather, whether a true Chriſtian doth not keep ſeven Sabbaths every week?</p>
               <p>25. Whether or no, if one ſhould keep a true Chriſtian Sabbath of reſting in God, and from all mans own works, of what nature ſoever, and ſhould do the works that a Chriſtian may freely do, then whether one may not be put to death for it, by many phariſaicall ones that wear Philacteries of commandements in their foreheads, only, being within full of rottenneſſe.</p>
