            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Haggai 2.23.</bibl>
               <q>In that day, saith the Lord of Hosts, will I take thee, O <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> my servant, the Son of <hi>Shealtiel,</hi> saith the Lord, and will make thee as a Signet; for I have chosen thee saith the Lord of Hostes.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Prophecy of <hi>Haggai,</hi> for the time and date of it, was directed to the Jewes soon after their Captivity, and containeth a mixture and composition of expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and promises. The chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est expostulation is for the Peoples backwardnesse in building the Temple. The Israelites upon their Return from bondage, fell on good Husbandry, to set up their Houses, to sow and plant, and to plough their ground; they thought it yet time enough to settle upon the costly work of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Temple; and indeed flesh and bloud would think this delay excusable, if not reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to get their own private wealth setled before they set upon the work of publick magnificency. But God looketh for the first service that his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104361:3"/>
worship and glory should have the first prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence. <hi>For me,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>and then for thy selfe and thy child. Noah</hi>'s first care af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his comming out of the Ark, was to build an Altar of thankfulnesse, which are the two first structures we read of in Scripture: and it is observable, that God commanded him to build an Ark; but his own thankfulnesse sets him on the building of an Altar: and this he doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently; he pleads not the preservation of store, or tarrying till there were increase of all things; but rather takes of every Creature, clean and unclean, as he had with him in the Ark, and offereth. Some count it for a cheek given to <hi>Iacob</hi> for his backwardnesse, that God calleth to him to pay his vow, and to go up to the Mountain to build an Altar. God sendeth two Prophets unto the <hi>Israelites, Haggai</hi> and <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi; Haggai</hi> reproves them for not building the Temple; <hi>Malachi,</hi> because of the Priests por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was delivered for other uses. Here, that the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> may the better stir them up, he useth gracious promises in his expostula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is a promise of setling Religion, and maintaining his publick worship, <hi>I will fill this House with glory, c.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 7. he would pitch his Tabernacle among them, and make this place of his rest glorious. What promise can be more precious than this? than for God to say, <hi>here will I dwell and have a delight in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104361:3"/>2. After having setled Religion and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, he would make a fence to secure and preserve it: and that is the promise of peace; <hi>In this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of Hosts. Peace</hi> doth preserve <hi>Religion,</hi> but War defaceth and ruineth it. The Churches had rest and were edified, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. To have <hi>Ierusalem</hi> built in boysterous times was a sad prediction, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. they went but slowly forward with a sword in one hand and a Trowel in the other. Blowes will not build up, but blow down the Church. When the Temple was building, there was not the noise of any Instrument to be heard; but when it was a ruining, they brake down the carved worke thereof with Axes and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He would blesse them with prosperity. Peace and poverty are poor comfort: but to make peace in the borders, and to fill them with the flowre of Wheat, these are high mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. They are the Ingredients that make up a compleat Blessing. A Nation blessed by God with piety, peace, and plenty may sing the song of the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> of the Vineyard. There is 1. <hi>Turris Religionis.</hi> 2. <hi>Propugnacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum pietatis &amp; securitatis.</hi> 3. <hi>Torcularia a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantiae.</hi> Here is one mercy encompassing and incircling another, bunches and clusters of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: not simple blessings, but the meeting and kisses of mercies. Were we but our own Carvers we would say, enough Lord, thou hast richly loaded us with thy benefits, neither could we
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104361:4"/>
find room for <hi>Esau</hi>'s desire, Hast thou not one blessing more, my Father? but even here God sends one thing to make up all compleat; and that is, the blessing of <hi>Magistracy</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For it is not sufficient to have Religion, but there must be <hi>Defensor Religionis:</hi> not only Peace, but <hi>Custos Pacis:</hi> not only Plenty, but <hi>Anonae Curator,</hi> without which neither Peace, Plenty, nor Religion can continue long: and this, in the last place, <hi>viz.</hi> the setting up of the Supream Magistrate. This mercy is like the work of Creation. When God had finished the World, and blessed all in it, he made Man to be Lord over all; so God brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth here <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> to dress his Garden, and to over-see his Inheritance. Here is piety, peace, and plenty, and all three supported by one Sovereign authority. Happy are the people that be in such a case.</p>
            <p>The Text contains in it God's gracious intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> for to put honour upon him. You may consider it under three notions.</p>
            <p>As under the notion <list>
                  <item>1. Of Prophecy.</item>
                  <item>2. Of Promise.</item>
                  <item>3. Of a Reward.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The first was under the notion of a Prophecy, acquainting him with the future events of the earth; what should betide him and his People. It's the priviledge of God's Church and chosen ones to have the <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> made known unto them, the successes of ages and generations, the risings and fallings of People and States; God
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104361:4"/>
discloseth them unto his Servants. He will not conceal from <hi>Abraham</hi> his purpose of overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah. Ioseph</hi> is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the future condition of <hi>AEgypt.</hi> He telleth <hi>Daniel</hi> of the beginnings and endings of all the great Monarchies of the World. The great Famine under <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> which none of the Sages of the time knew of, was revealed to a poor Prophet of his at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the people of it. <hi>Daniel</hi> the beloved Prophet, and <hi>Iohn</hi> the beloved Disciple, did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know, and foretell the destinies of all generations ensuing: As his love was on them, so his care was for them to prepare them for <hi>Future Events. I told you these things</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>that you might remember when they came, that I told you of them.</hi> This is the great end why God discloseth things future, that we might sit our selves for them. Sudden surprisals are far more uncomfortable than expected events. Things which are foretold teach us, that they are not the casualities of blind Fortune, nor the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of unreasonable men; but the gracious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensations of our God.</p>
            <p>As under the notion of a Promise that doth betoken some good to <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi> The Jewes were now in a sad condition. Their eyes might behold the miseries and ruines and poor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of Church and State. It's true, the tide was now turned, and they came out of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; but things went so hard with them, such
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104361:5"/>
poor beginnings had their Commonwealth, their Neighbours maligning, and opposing their work, that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> might not despair of ever seeing the work finished, or himself and his people in their former condition; for the upholding of his heart God sendeth him such promise that might not only support, but advance him forward with cheerfulness. In the poorest condition that can be the Church of God is rich in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and he is no poor man that hath rich men for his debtors, though he be destitute of present supplies, yet he hath Bills in abundance; who hath dispised the state of small things? <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> hath layd the foundation, and shall see the top-stone.</p>
            <p>Under the notion of a <hi>Reward</hi> assured unto <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> for what he had done; he had been zealous for God's Temple and worship, and God doth not only accept of it, but reward him for it. <hi>Honorantem me honorabo,</hi> he that will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, God will honour him. Hath <hi>David</hi> a purpose to build God an House? God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiteth his Intentions, and saith, <hi>I will build thee a sure House.</hi> What comfort and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence did this bring to <hi>Nehemiah!</hi> he contended with the Elders and compelled them to bring Tithes into the Temple; and then his heart breaks forth unto God, <hi>Lord remember me for good:</hi> and remember <hi>David</hi> and all his troubles, his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. What were those afflictions? his toil, his pains, his trouble to uphold Gods worship: his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness not only to do good for the Church, but to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104361:5"/>
suffer for it. Remember the afflictions of <hi>David</hi>; and it followes; the sure mercies of <hi>David</hi> shall be performed.</p>
            <p>The text is, <hi>a Royal Charter,</hi> sealed to <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel,</hi> and in it a promise of future advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know that the <hi>Text</hi> is interpreted in a mystical sense concerning <hi>Christ.</hi> And indeed <hi>Luther's</hi> saying is true, that then we understand the Prophets aright, when we find <hi>Christ</hi> in them. <hi>Christ</hi> is the true <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the true anointed of the Lord; the <hi>Diadem, Scepter</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> of the Throne of <hi>David</hi> belong to him. But this hindreth not the intendment of it lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> or the application of it to those that be as <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> the anointed of the Lord: and so we may use it, but with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, that <hi>Christ</hi> only hath the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence; he is the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords, before whom all the Kings of the Earth must throw down their Crowns, and give him homage. But by him, and after him, the Text is a royal Charter made to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> wherein are these particulars.</p>
            <p>1. The time and season, when this shall befal, <hi>In that day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Author and advancement. <hi>The Lord.</hi> 
            </p>
            <p>First, I will take thee.</p>
            <p n="1">Secondly, I will make thee.</p>
            <p n="2">Thirdly, I have chozen thee. <hi>It is the Lord, the Lord only.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The person to be advanced. <hi>Zerubbabel my servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:104361:6"/>4. The advancement it self. <hi>I will make thee as a signet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The ground and reason, and withall, the stability of the advancement; the assurance of it is sealed with the Seal of the living God: it passeth through three Seales, the ratification thrice repeated. <hi>Thus saith the Lord,</hi> and again, and the third time sealed with the broad seal of Heaven. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hostes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. And first of the time wherein this Chater should be made good to <hi>Zerubbabel. In that day,</hi> and it's called a day of overthrowing the kingdomes of the Heathens, when the Chariots of the horsmen shall come down, when Heaven and Earth shall be shaken: <hi>in that day Zerubbabel shal be exalted.</hi> So these words may have the force of several things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The force of a supposition, or an <hi>etsi</hi>; and then this is the meaning, though all the world shall be in an uproare and confusion, yet <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi> shall be exalted.</item>
               <item>2. The force of a condition, or a <hi>potius,</hi> rather then <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> shall not be exalted, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of the Heathen shall be overthrown.</item>

            <p n="1">1. The first of a supposition, <hi>etsi.</hi> Though all the earth be in an uproare, yet <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Throne shall be set up. And this supposition is not meerly imaginary: no impossible thing to see the world in an uproare. We must not <gap reason="foreign">

it strange to see this lower region full of stormes and tempests, the roaring of the waves, the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, and the madnesse of the people, are put all together; and this speaks the world, as truly subject to tumults, as the Sea. Tempests there are <hi>venti Typhonici,</hi> unquiet spirits, whose work is to take peace from the Earth, and to bring all to confusion: and now suppose all this; yet <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> shall have a charter of safty, Gods Church, his chosen ones, his darlings, they have a patent of security. When God sendeth forth his judgements, he gives charges, as <hi>David</hi> did to his Souldiers, that they should spare the life of his Son. Let not <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> my servant be harmed. The world it is in a tumult, as <hi>Psa.</hi> 2. <hi>Why do the Heathen rage, and the people of the Earth imagin a vaine thing? Yet have I set my King upon my holy Hill of Sion, David,</hi> and the Sons of <hi>David</hi> are Sealed up; the Psalmist de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes to put their cases to imagin them, and so to strengthen their faith, <hi>Psal. I will not fear though the Earth be removed</hi>; when the earth doth quake, then doth <hi>David</hi> stand immovable, see the courage of his Faith in the rebellion rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against him, Ps. 3. 4. <hi>I will not be afraid for ten thousand men, that have set themselves against me round about.</hi> See his security in the midst of these dangers. <hi>I laid me down and slept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Condition, <hi>potius:</hi> rather than <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> shall miscarry, he will overthrow all that shall oppose him; nay, he will shake Heaven
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104361:7"/>
and Earth, the whole creation. Nothing too costly to redeem him from destruction. <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel's</hi> advancement met with great opposition, the Prophet compares it with a great mountain: but <hi>what art thou great mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt become a plain, Zach.</hi> 4.7. All op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, that rise against him shall become flat. God is the God of nature, and the Lord of the whole world, and so he is merciful to all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but when they come in comparison, or stand in opposition to his Church, they shall be all parted with. Thus <hi>Isaiah</hi> sheweth how much he esteemed the welfare of his chosen; <hi>Isa.</hi> 43. 34. <hi>I gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for thee</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>and</hi> Sheba <hi>for thy ransome. I will give men for thee, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for thy life</hi>; One <hi>David,</hi> one <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is more dear than thousands of Heathens and Aliens.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the force of a <hi>Quando,</hi> It sets forth the time when, and herein are three gradual periods. 1. In the day of adversity he will stand for <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubbabel,</hi> and defend him: usually when the Church is in adversity, God suffers the men of the World to be in prosperity: and so when the day cometh, he will remember his own, and do good to them. The Sun of prosperity shineth not in both their Hemispheres at once God usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally sets a pillar of cloud betwixt them: when it is dark on the one side, it is light on the other. <hi>The world shall rejoyce, but thou shalt have sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> saith our Saviour. <hi>David</hi> saith, the time of the <hi>Church's</hi> affliction is but till the pit be digged up for the ungodly. The Ark of Gods people then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:104361:7"/>
rises higher, when the world lieth lowest &amp; sinketh under water. 2. In that day when he shal revenge the opposition of the Church on their enemies, <hi>Zerub.</hi> shal be exalted. High revenge on the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church, is accompanied with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable mercies to the Church; St. <hi>Paul</hi> shewed that the Lord destroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> in an extraordinary way, so likewise he preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth his own in an extraordinary manner; judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the enemies of the Church are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the Church. <hi>He slew mighty Kings, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> Their oppositions of the Church are not only repaid with fury, and revenge on her enemies, but recompenced with comfort on her self. 3. In that day, that great day, that last day, the throne of <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> shall be exalted. The promise reacheth unto the time when there shall be a full accomplishment of all things: Other judgements were but <hi>praejudicia ultimi judicii,</hi> even then, when all Thrones shall be cast down, <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> Throne shall be exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In that time that he makes up his Jewels, <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> shall be remembred, then shall he set him as a signet in his right hand. And indeed till then neither <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the Type, nor <hi>Christ</hi> the Anti-type shall be at their full glory. Christ indeed sitteth now on his throne, but he treadeth not on his footstool. <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool,</hi> when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and the powers thereof shall be shaken, then shall Christ and his Saints appear in glory. Here is the happinesse of true Christian Kings, they shall not be terminated, they shall
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:104361:8"/>
not end with others; but shall raign with <hi>Christ</hi> for ever. When <hi>Pagans</hi> &amp; <hi>Heathens</hi> shal be brought to the barr of justice, true Christian Kings shall be taken up, as assisters to the Bench: Here <hi>Christ</hi> reigneth in and by them, where they shall reign with <hi>Christ.</hi> I now come to the second part of my Text, The person to whom, <hi>Zerubbabel my servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By compellation. He calleth him by his name, he directeth a special message to him.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is an honour to be owned of God by name, It's a testimony of his favour to <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> &amp; to such, it sheweth how high he esteemeth of them, like the great officers of State, their names and persons are precious; or as the great Constellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in heaven &amp; stars of just Magnitude, for which we have particular names, and not for the rest.</item>
               <item>2. It's affectionate as well as honorable, it's the language of love thus to speak in those personal sweet expressions. God delighteth thus to express himself to his servants, <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observes that it is a signe of Gods displeasure, either not to speak, or not to speak by name, <hi>I have called thee by name,</hi> saith God to <hi>Moses.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. It is comfortable, especially in the daies of trouble when adversity besets us, thus sweetly to be called by him; <hi>Fear not Abraham,</hi> said God to his servant. <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. Thus <hi>David</hi> incourageth himself. <hi>O God thou hast known my Soul. Fear not</hi> Jacob. <hi>Be of good-chear</hi> Paul, <hi>Christ</hi> saith to his persecuted Disciples. Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the blessing when he was in destresse, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104361:8"/>
the blessing assured him by the imposition of his name. <hi>Thy name shall be called Israel,</hi> for thou hast prevailed.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="2">2. He describeth him by his relation, <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel my servant</hi>; a title of high honour and worth. Noble men are more honourable in their Courts, attendances, and service unto their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne than in all the commands they exercise in their own country. <hi>King Iames</hi> of blessed memory, counting up the titles which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put upon Christian Kings, glorieth in this most, that God calleth them the servants of the Lord. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> esteems it servile and trivial, and mocketh him for it, as <hi>Micah</hi> did <hi>David</hi> for dancing before the Arke; but this our gracious Prince made it his blessing. Indeed though it be a title otherwise communicated to all the servants of the Lord, yet it doth most especially belong to those that are in supream authority. <hi>Moses</hi> my servant, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> my servants, a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle given by God to those that are immediately subordinate to himself: and it were wisdome to preserve these titles to that they belong to. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles given by God are real conveiances, and not to be transported (as the Cardinal would have it) to inferiour subjects. <hi>Zerubbabel is the servant of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Officio,</hi> The high calling of Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is an office which they perform to God. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them Gods servants and Ministers. Supremacy is not any intrusion or usurpation, as <hi>Corah,</hi> and his complices would have it; were it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104361:9"/>
so, it were good to be rid of it; or were it an aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 'twere good to forsake it; were it but a permission made for a time, it must in time give place: but it is an authority from God, set up by original institution. The Apostles call it the Ordinance of God, <hi>David</hi> compares it to the Sun at Noon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Speciali functione. Zerubbabel</hi> Gods servant, by a special service, above all other imployments, even the restoring of Gods worship to the full beauty thereof, and the building of the Temple. This was the work expected from <hi>Zerubbabel.</hi> The Jews say that the keyes of the Temple were laid every night under <hi>Solomons</hi> pillow, they hang not at their priests girdle. When Kings serve God as Kings, when they do that service which none but Kings can do for him: to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish the truth of religion, to maintain and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it, to safeguard the Church, to see men be religious, and not suffer them to be sacrilegious, is the great service that belongs unto Kings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Gratiosa acceptatione,</hi> God graciously accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the service that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> did for him. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> might meet with those that would quarrel and wrangle with his proceedings: But let others malign him; here is his comfort, that God, whom he serveth, accepteth of him. It's the lot of the servants of God to be liable to the quarrels of disaffectionate men; so <hi>Moses</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved one; so <hi>David,</hi> the man after Gods own heart
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104361:9"/>
though for a while, the People had very Loyal and Honourable thoughts of Him, <hi>He did seem to please them</hi>; yet 2 Sam. 3. There did arise discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent about his Government and ruling over them. Well, what saith God of him? notwithstanding all this, this is his Testimony of him: <hi>He feedeth them with a faithful and true heart, and ruleth them prudently with all his power.</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son, even his Government was complained of as too heavy: yet all the burdens he loaded the people withal, were an over-charge of wealth. The Taxes and Summes for the building of the Royal Temple and Palace were not imposed on the Israelites, but the Strangers among them. The Spirit that is within us lusteth after envy, and sheweth it no where more then toward our Superiours. We should consider their temptations and allurements, and compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate them and pitty their failings and weaknesses, and pray for their proceedings, and acknowledge the benefits we receive by them. They may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overcharge us; but are alwaies a shield and defence unto us. <hi>Tully</hi> telleth us of those Sicilians, that because of the great benefit they enjoyed by the Roman Government, would not quarrel with them for some few trivial matters. So should we do here.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Exclusivè Zerubbabel</hi> is Gods Servant, This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest cutteth off all other ministrations that can be laid on him. The King's service is the Supream dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. He findeth no equal on Earth, much less Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour: Dominion is the image of God not of the Pope: This Signet is not <hi>annulus piscatoris,</hi> the ring
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104361:10"/>
of <hi>Peter</hi> or his feigned Successor, the Pope. I'ts true, when the Imperial Power turned Vassal to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Scripture calleth it the Image of the Beast. But a lawful Supremacy is a most legible impression of the image of God. There is a service in Government, and that an hard one too, so that the Subjects Duty is the easier of the too. <hi>Diis mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noribus in unum Iowem conversis: veritas nominum est salus proprietatum: facilius est imperantibus obedire, quàm obedientibus imperare.</hi> It's a more easy thing to obey than to govern or rule, so <hi>Hug</hi> on the hard taske of Government. Kings are serviceable to the good of the People, but not unto their Power; not like to the Pope, that can hear his Cardinal Sing, <hi>Ecclesia data est Papae.</hi> The Church is brought in by a Father saying, I am not thine, but thou art mine, and all things else. This sheweth how Kings may be said to be servants. He is properly a servant, that is so in respect of his imployments for another, and from another. The Supream power hath imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and his authority, and so his servant. But <hi>respectu finis,</hi> their end is to the great good of others. St. <hi>Paul</hi> determines it <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God for our good.</hi> So then this truth, that Kings and Princes are servants of God, must be unto them <hi>monitorium officii</hi>; it should put them in mind their duty: so to govern as to remember they are under government. I know it a preposterous Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme, to preach unto the people the duty of their Kings, or unto Kings the duty of their people. It was the method of the Pharisees, when they found fault with Christ or his Disciples; they would
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:104361:10"/>
complain of Christ to his Disciples, <hi>why eateth your, Master with Sinners?</hi> and of the Disciples to Christ <hi>why do not thy Disciples fast?</hi> Just the spirit of the Pharisees, to beget jealousies, and for dissention to tell the King that his Subjects are false, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the King usurpeth. This is not to give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one his true portion: every truth is not for every person. This here, that Kings and Princes are Gods servants, secureth their persons, sealeth upon them a charter of a protection. Princes in point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour are bound to safeguard their servants. <hi>David</hi> pleadeth for this priviledge in his danger. <hi>Undertake for thy servant for good,</hi> Psal. 11.8. King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> prayed, <hi>Lord I am oppressed, undertake for me. David</hi> prefixeth this title unto his Psalm of thanksgiving. <hi>A Psalm of David the Servant of the Lord.</hi> Likewise it must bind us to our obedience, and not onely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle our hands and pinion our arms not to offer vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but bridle our tongues from speaking any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent speech. How dare you speak against my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Moses</hi>? It was the check that God gave not to the common murmurers, but unto those that were som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body in the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, even Princes. And Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him <hi>Servant</hi> was not to teach <hi>Aaron</hi> to call him fellow servant, but <hi>my Lord</hi> as it followeth.</p>
            <p>This affordeth us three great excellencies in the governing of Gods people.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In his person, Monarchy.</item>
               <item>2. In his stock and original, Nobility.</item>
               <item>3. In his descent, a lineal succession in the Royal Family.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Three great excellencies in this Government.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:104361:11"/>1. In the Person, <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The Supream Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity sealed in Monarchy, hath this priviledge and advancement above other formes of Government, that it carrieth a more ample stampe of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution. We condemne not other formes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they are not aberrations; but justly praise the form which God chuleth for his own. The Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites for a time were under Judges, but the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Government was to be in Kings. Its true the first King was extorted by the People: but that hindreth not that the office of Kings was by Divine intendment. It was promised to <hi>Abraham, Kings shall be born of thee.</hi> This Royal Charter was drawn up before <hi>Sauls</hi> time. That which blemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed <hi>Saul</hi>'s setting up was the peoples overhasty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to enjoy a King. <hi>Saul</hi> the King and <hi>Saul</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle were both born out of time, the one too soon the other too late: but both their functions were of, Divine Institution.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his <hi>stock and original nobility</hi>; the son of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altiel.</hi> God taketh notice of his nobility and dignity, and putteth honour on it. It's an ill Symptome of the worst of times (<hi>quae non instant, sed extant</hi>) when the vile shall rise up and behave themselves irreverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the Nobles, especially the Nobility out of which God raiseth the Princes of his people. <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed art thou O Land, when thy King is the son of Nobles</hi> Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when they inquired of her, whom she would have to succeed after her, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. My Throne is the Throne of Kings. No mean person must be my successor. The precepts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy tell us, that Nobility is in a great capacity
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104361:11"/>
for rule and authority: Every shoobuckle will not make a signet, or bramble a King.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As he establisheth Monarchy and raiseth it out of Nobility; so he preserves it in a constant des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent from <hi>David.</hi> This is that which <hi>David</hi> calls the establishment of his throne. Lord thou hast spoken that of thy servants house, there shall sit a man for ever on his Throne. Rather then this course should be interrupted, God taketh such care to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil this succession, that he will set <hi>Ioas</hi> a young child on his Throne. It was the exception made against <hi>Herod, Quod nec nascendo, nec vivendo Rex suit.</hi> He was neither a King by birth, nor by life. This he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary succession preventeth much inconveniency which would fall out by reason of a <hi>vacuum.</hi> A <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> is of a strange nature, which makes things of a low condition to ascend higher.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Author of this advancement.</hi> 'Tis no other then God himselfe. I will, take thee, I will make thee, I have chosen thee. God is the fountain of all lawful authority: unto him the shields of the Earth belong, supremacy and soveraignty which are the beams of Majesty. Promotion comes neither from the East nor from the West, nor any point of the Compass. <hi>Magistracy</hi> is the Image of God which fell from the Heaven to the Earth. <hi>Exemplum habet de coelo.</hi> Lo our Saviour sheweth <hi>Iohn</hi> so. It is written in the Law, <hi>I have said ye are Gods.</hi> He it was that made them so. We must not have gods of our own making; the holy Oyle wherewith they were anointed is his, <hi>with my holy Oyle.</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>I have anointed him.</hi> The Throne they are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104361:12"/>
placed in is Gods Throne, 1 Chr. 29.23. <hi>Solomon sate on the Throne of the Lord.</hi> The Judges they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised Gods Judgements. For the judgement is Gods, <hi>you shall not therefore respect persons in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Deut. 1.17. Hence they are called the sonnes of the most high, hence they are all the sons of God. In his thigh is there names written. All this betokens their high descent. This thing considered, that Kings are authorised by God; it will prove a comfort that our Government is of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and God will bless his own ordinance. Mens inventions, though never so wise, have no such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise as his institutions. They that set up <hi>Abimeleck</hi> to be King over Israel took delight in him, and he in them: but how long did he last and their joy continue? But if God setteth one over us, let us not question how he shall save us. <hi>Gedeon</hi> suspected himself, and <hi>Moses</hi> groaned under his burden, yet both of them prevailed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>advancement</hi> it self. I will make thee as a Signet. <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> shall be unto God as his seale ring. It's a Symbolical expression: take it literally, and no great matter to be found in it. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>Annulus nihil valet ad hereditates quas expecto.</hi> It is not so much the <hi>Ring,</hi> as the thing sealed with the <hi>Ring:</hi> the purpose unto which it was destined is that which putteth the excellency on it. <hi>Materiam saperabit opus,</hi> and so we may consider it threefold.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a seal and testimony, and conveyance of authority, in the ruling of places unto great officers.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104361:12"/>
By a <hi>Ring</hi> Governments were disposed of. <hi>Ioseph</hi> was thus admitted to advancement: <hi>Pharaoh</hi> took off his Ring, and put it on <hi>Iosephs</hi> hand. <hi>Alexander</hi> declared his Successor by delivery of a Ring. So then, the impression or Signet of Supream Authority is fixed on <hi>Zerub.</hi> 'Tis his Royal Charter. None shall lift up hand or foot against thee in the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> saith <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to <hi>Ioseph</hi>; all other governments must pass under this seal. As <hi>Ambrose</hi> speaketh of the King given to <hi>Ioseph.</hi> It was for a seal unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Let the metal be what it will, without this Sculpture it beareth no authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Rings were for ornament. The Ring and the Robe were brought forth for ornaments <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. And such is the power of Magistracy; it is the ornament of the Creation, the lustre of all the great Workmanship of God. He made the Sun to rule the Day, the Moon and Starrs to rule the Night: But the splendency of these lights is the beauty of the Creature: Take them away, and what remains but horror and darkness? See how God describeth the beauty of his people. I deckt thee with Gold and Silver, and thou wast comely. A due proportion of Soveraignty and subjection, is the beauty of the body politick: and also, as every good government hath its beauty, so the Royal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is most beautiful. It setteth forth the Glory of Gods name, that he governs by Kings and Princes, they are his anointed, as the great constellations of the Firmament. <hi>Solomon</hi> reckons it amidst the foure happinesses. And Kings against whom there i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>no rising up.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:104361:13"/>3. God will make <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> his signet; and this betokeneth care and custody. He will weare, keep, and hold him as a signet. The Scripture doth represent this care of God by a signet, in name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three places wherein God setteth it for safe custody.</p>
            <p n="1">1. On his right hand: and this his usual way of wearing Signets. Set me as a signet at thy right hand. So then <hi>custodia dextrae,</hi> this is the first, and this containeth an ordinary preservation. There are crosses and mischances, which dayly happen to the life of man, unto which even Princes are subject; did not this good right hand of the Lord protect them in their going out and coming in? In all the turnings and passages of their lives this hand pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects them. They are <hi>viri dextrae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. There are extraordinary cases and hazards, and they require more powerful preservation: and for them there must be a stronger place. Set me as a seal on thy arm. Beside the preservation of his hand, he hath for his Anointed the deliverance of his arm, of his strong arme, of his outstretched Arme. <hi>David,</hi> to shelter himself from ordinary dangers, cryes out, God is my house, its he that makes <hi>David</hi> to dwell in safety: But in great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses, as when the conspiracy was raised against him, he puts himself in a strong protection. God is not onely my house, but my rock, my fortress, my strong tower and refuge. For daily preservation, let thy hand be on the man of thy right hand: but

in strong assaults, awake, awake, put on strength thou arm of the Lord.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly there is yet a closer and safer place, and it is his heart: The Spouse saith, set me as a seal on thy heart. And this betokeneth great care. The heart is Loves Pallace, in it she keeps her Jewels; and such a sure Keeper God is. He stretcheth out hand and arm to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>Zerubb.</hi> No snatching him out of his hand. Here is the safety of Gods people, of his Anointed <hi>Zerubbabel</hi>; his hand shall hold him fast, and his arme shall strengthen him, and his heart shall be a hiding place, and a Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>
            <p>The ground of this advancement, <hi>for I have chosen thee.</hi> This election is a sure foundation, this Charter of God is <hi>sigillum signatum,</hi> this prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an impression from the Great seal. This election is like the great stone which supported the Throne of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar.</hi> I will place his Throne on this Throne, saith God. Its like building on a Rock. Let the storms come, and the wind blow, this rock of election will keep it immoveable: Yet will I make <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome steadfast.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Election</hi> appeareth in five things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ex Electione, non tantum ex permissione</hi>; this is too weak and Sandy a foundation. Permission
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104361:14"/>
falls short of approbation, and Kings are not carried by this, but by Gods steady Election. In the Kingdom of Providence there is nothing of casualties and permissions, the Spirit of God which governeth the world is a Spirit of Counsel, and not of temerity. So then <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> raigneth by Gods election and purpose; it's not a matter of meer tolleration or bare permission.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Exelectione tam cum rejectione aliorum. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> saith, Gods choice must stand when all other competitors are rejected. It was this election that transferred the Kingdom of <hi>Saul. Speak not of him, for I have rejected him.</hi> This advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>David</hi> and not <hi>Eliah.</hi> Anoint him not; for the Lord hath refused him. Though all Israel set their faces towards <hi>Adonijah,</hi> to make him King; yet <hi>Solomon</hi> shall have the Crown. Let others be what they will be, either for parts, power or favour, it is not the mettal, if the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving stamp of God be wanting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Ex electione cum dilectione.</hi> Election cometh from dilection. The delight which God taketh in the prosperity of his people, putteth him on to place a Lord over them. Should we expostulate with God as they did. Wherein hast thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us? This would be a clear evidence of it. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> taketh notice of the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Israel in this. Blessed be the Lord thy God that taketh delight in thee, to place on his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104361:14"/>
Throne so wise a King. Because the Lord loved Israel to establish them for ever, therefore he gave them such a King. If we pass by this token of Gods love, the Queen of the South will rise up in judgement against us, her speech will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne us.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Ex electione cum deliberatione.</hi> Election pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from deliberation. It implies study and search and great consultation. We must under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> leave out all ill circumstances, and take in all its perfections. God doth it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly out of the full depth of his Counsels, and forecast of his providence, all things being consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. The setting up of Magistracy over us is a work of consultation. God pitcheth on <hi>Zerubb.</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> on <hi>Ioseph. Can we finde out such a man?</hi> This work is one of the chiefest pieces of Gods providence in the World: not any one that comes next to hand can serve the turn: no God maketh searchings and inquiries, and then concludes, <hi>I have forund me out a man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Electio personalis.</hi> The election it's persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, it's fixed on a person. Election is not a meer description of a form of a power; but carrieth the designation of the person: it doth not onely frame a model, and constitute an Office, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain a place; but chooseth out a man. God sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not qualities or notions or formes, setteth not up Platonical Ideas; But consecrates a person.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104361:15"/>
For conformation of all these, is that great rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication at the end of all. He hath spoken and will make it good: he that saith it is the Lord of Hosts. This promise is not like a Papal grant, which disposeth of Kingdomes, but affordeth no help or assistance to those unto whom it giveth them. Let them fight for them, if they will have them: The Lord of Hosts will make them good. It's observed that the Prophets after the Captivity, never almost named God, but with this title, <hi>The Lord of Hosts.</hi> When <hi>Zerubb.</hi> and his people are at the weakest, God affords him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self strongest. This title is <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> lifeguard; it standeth round about, in the front as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; in the close of the Text as in the rereward: it speaks unto him, as the Prince of the host of God. These heavenly Auxiliaries, these Chariots and Horses of fire, shall resume him from all the Chariots and Horses of the Heathen; th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se being with <hi>Zerubb.</hi> no matter who oppose him: by faith in his name shall be discomfit them all.</p>
            <p>Let us <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, apply this Text unto our selves; let us see the blessing we enjoy; let this put us in mind to stand on these termes with God, if the promises of his people may be made good unto us, it is not for every Nation to do so; onely for the people in Covenant with God. It is a comfort to us to have a <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> to be a Prince, and Leader to this people of God. <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> some give it, a <hi>stranger</hi> from <hi>Babel,</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:104361:15"/>
one that renounceth communication with the Whore of <hi>Rome. Zerubb.</hi> is one appointed by God to fan out the chaff from the Wheat. This our Governour shall be as a Torch of fire amidst the heap of Chaff, and all their Superstition as stubble before him.</p>
            <p>Is it not a comfort to us that a son of <hi>Shealtiel</hi> is a Prince over us, one of the Royal Race, no stranger or servant, no Assyrian or Philistim; but an issue of Royal Progenitours, designed to his Throne by God himself from the birth, Womb, and conception? Is it not a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto us, that our <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is counted a servant of God? and that not onely by place; but by piety: not onely High Steward of his House, and so servant by office, but by devotion. What a mercy this is, we may acknowledge, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the imprecation of <hi>David; set an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man to rule over them,</hi> or the commination of the Prophet, <hi>A Leopard shall rule over them.</hi> Let us now acknowledge our happiness, who have no <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for our King, one that knoweth not God, and feareth to know the Lord; but one that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously both knoweth and feareth God. Did <hi>England</hi> ever know a Prince more frequent, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and attentive in the service of God? It's a commendable thing in a private person, how much more in a King to keep his dayly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant houres of prayer, to bring his children up in the Worship of God: to teach them betimes to know the God of their Fathers. He is the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104361:16"/>
of the Lord, and all these pretious, titles which God laies upon his servants, belong to him: <hi>servus quem elegit, quem comprobavit, quem sustentavit, filius ancillae:</hi> He is his choice Servant, in whom his Soul delighteth, his servant, whom his hand upholdeth, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the son of his handmaid, and a true Member of the true Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>Lastly, so we pray and hope, and trust, he is a servant of his, whom he will use as a blessed instrument of his glory: he is a servant of his own, on whom his stamp is. <hi>Clemen Alex.</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids four sorts of Characters to be on any <hi>Signet.</hi> The contrary are not to be found in him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The stamp of an Idol; our <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> is free from this Character. He neither nameth, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor worshippeth any God, but the God of Israel.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No instrument of cruelty to be engraven on it. Our <hi>Zerubb.</hi> is free from this: he beareth the signature of clemency on him; and this is a Royal virtue. Kings must sing the song both of Mercy and judgement; but the sweetest song is that of mercy. Do justice and love mercy: he both doth it, and delighteth in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No Embleme of <hi>Intemperance.</hi> This Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al signet, which we behold; beareth sobriety:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104361:16"/>
It's a confessed virtue emninent in him. He hath learned that it is not for Kings to drink wine. He is far from the Disease which the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of in the Kings of his time; he doth eat and drink for strength, and not for intemperance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. No <hi>wanton</hi> or <hi>Luxurious stamp.</hi> Our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Signet beareth the seal of Chastity. What Virgin hath he deflowred? Whose bed hath he defiled? Whose Virginity hath he assaulted? Bishop <hi>Latimer</hi> presented a great person with an Handkerchief, this written on it, <hi>whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and adulterers God will judge</hi>: this is his Motto. Survey the World, and see how many such Princes your thought can present you with. Surely their names may be written in a small compass. We may and should boast of Gods mercy: All Christendome cannot afford such another.</p>
