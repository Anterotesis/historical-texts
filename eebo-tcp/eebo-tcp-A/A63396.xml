            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The laſt week the Earle of <hi>Ormand</hi> and Sr <hi>Charles</hi> march't forth, both of them about 1 and 2 of the clock in the morning, and when they weare without the Town, my L. of <hi>Ormand</hi> with his forces march't toward <hi>Finglas,</hi> and Sr. <hi>Charles</hi> with his marcht towards <hi>Santrey,</hi> in both which Towns the Rebels lay in garriſon, the Towns are both al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt one diſtance fron hence, the fartheſt of them is accounted but 2 miles and they are about a middle diſtant the one from the other; Sr <hi>Charles</hi> quickly put his Rebels to ſlight, who ſeemed to bee furious at firſt, and made great ſhews with their coullers diſplay'd, but durſt not ſtand to ſight; Sr <hi>Charles</hi> burnt the Towne and the next Towne to it, and then marcht towards my Lord of <hi>Ormand,</hi> who was then in fight with the Rebels of <hi>Finglas,</hi> and twas reported that he was in danger at that time; the Rebels ſeeing another Army comming towards them from the way of <hi>Santrey,</hi> thought it had been their own comming to helpe them, but as ſoon as they perceived the contrary they fled; their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall (being a man too familliar amongſt us) amongſt the reſt of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell rout fled, leaving behind him his hat, ſcarlet coate, and blue pluſh lump lin'd with fur, which were no ſooner ſeen but were known to be <hi>Luke Neterfeelds,</hi> the L. <hi>Neterfeelds</hi> ſon, who is likewiſe a Rebell, after

they had pillaged the Town, they ſet the <hi>Iriſh</hi> houſes on fire, hanged ſome, brought ſome 4 or 5 priſoners, releaſt ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken by them, and ſhould have been hanged that very morning: The Rebels that were in both Towns were thought to be at leaſt 6000, and both our Armies were not above 4000. It is thought that there were ſlaine of them that day almoſt 200, but I heare not of above 2 or 3 of ours. The 10 day of this Month, Sr <hi>Charles</hi> marcht forth towards <hi>Tallow</hi> and the Mountaine foot, about 4 or 5 miles from <hi>Dublin,</hi> where there were thouſands of Rebels that night, but perceiving Sr <hi>Charles</hi> coming towards them, of which tis thought they had intelligence, they fled, but he burnt 4 of their <hi>Iriſh</hi> Towns where they were; and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers bringing home their pillage, came into <hi>Dublin</hi> before Sun-ſet: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 10 of the clock that night, he took other Souldiers and marcht to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Swords,</hi> which is about 6 mil. from hence Northward, where he was with his Army before break of day the next morning, and as ſoon as it was light he began to charge the Rebels, but at a great diſadvantage, for he was forcd to keep the body of his armye in a lane, and the Rebels ſhot from their works and tampars of earth: but the wings of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mey got into the next fields where they did very good ſervice, but within an hours fight he put them to flight; and after the Souldiers had made their pillage, they burnt the Town to the ground, not leaving one houſe ſtanding: there were ſlaine of them that day about 150, and of ours but 4 men, whereof one was Sr <hi>Lorence Caray</hi> my L. <hi>Fancklands</hi> brother, who was ſhot in the head as he was bringing up his men to fight, and is to be buried on Sunday next. Sr <hi>Charles</hi> with the army returned to <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi> that night, where he was of the Proteſtants bleſt; but by the Papiſts curſt: for ſome of them could not forbeare, but openly to wiſh that all our Army were in the ſame caſe and ſerved as Sir <hi>Lorence</hi> was, one of them, as I heare, was hanged this morning. Sr <hi>Charles Coots</hi> name is terrible to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and I could wiſh that the E. of <hi>Ormands</hi> were ſo too but as long as his Troopers are moſt of them Papiſt, and ſo many Papiſt to his ſervants, that they lay, eate and atend on him, I feare it will not be. Our Parliament is proroged till <hi>June</hi> next, the Rebels threaten to bring 60000 before <hi>Dublin</hi> very ſhortly, but we feare not their worſt, had we but here but 8 or 10000 Souldiers more, ſo that we might go to meet them in the field, and yet leave ſtrength enough to defend our City. On Monday laſt there was a ſupply of victuals ſent from this Port by Sea to releave our Souldiers in <hi>Droghedagh,</hi> the which I pray God to ſend them ther ways they are like to ſuffer; and the Town loſt, the which God forbid they have been now beleager'd above 2 Months, the Rebels are grown more bloudy in their cruelties and mercileſſe dealing with thoſe

                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vnday, <hi>Jan.</hi> 16. Sir <hi>Simon Harcourt,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Temple</hi> hearing that the late riſen Rebell, <hi>Dominick Mack Carty</hi> was drawing toward the Towne and Caſtle of <hi>Eniſhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non:</hi> with intent to victuall and man it better, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: conſidering how neere that Caſtle ſtands unto <hi>Kingſale,</hi> lately recovered, and how bad an enemy likely to prove, if we ſhould ſuffer the Rebels, not only to neſtle there, but even to paſſe by our doore, and to relieve them in a Bravado, deſired of God diſpenſation for breach of the Sabbath, and after ſome ſhort prayers, and recommending our ſelves unto God: with refreſhing our bodies with ſuch food, as the condition of the time, and place, would permit: We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced 200. Horſes, and 115. Foot, and five ſmall field Peeces, with this equipage; we came unto the foord of <hi>Eniſhannon,</hi> being very exceeding broad, but not very deep, hard chalky clay, being the ſiedge of the Foord: An arme of the Sea flowing up from <hi>Kingſale,</hi> three <hi>Iriſh</hi> miles: we muſt needs paſle this Foord unto <hi>Eniſhannon,</hi> other way there is none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monſieur Mack-Carty</hi> paſſed along the other ſide of the Foord upon the Strand, in paſſing good order, as ever ſaw Rebels, ſince I came over, his Horſes being at leaſt foure or five hundred compleately armed: his Foot two thouſand, and about ſixe or ſeven hundred compleatly armed with Pike, half Pike, Musked, or Calliver, (which makes me ſuſpect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſeeing that a Rebeell but lately riſen, and of no great note, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very firſt exploit that ever he took in hand, as we heare of, ſhould in ſo ſhort a time be able to raiſe ſo many men, and in that manner to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them) we expected not, till he ſhould bid us now come over: but forthwith ſent over our Cavalery to charge him, and a little to ſtay his haſt, and to peſwade him to take us along with him to <hi>Eniſh.</hi> if we could not obtain ſo much as to be there before him: Sr <hi>Simons</hi> 200. Horſes were

as good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as ſerviceably fitted, as ever were horſes, that went out of <hi>England,</hi> and the Cavallieers that ſate them, as experienced Fire-men: Yet their marching ſo far in the water; and the enemy ſtanding on the dry ſtrand, much broke their charge, and advantaged the Enemies, who received their charge boldly, and anſwered it ſtoutly: at leaſt whether that they wanted powder, or (which I rather beleeve) their powder was dame, being carried in bags by their ſide, (as their manner is) whether it was one or the other, their Piſtols would no longer fire, which <hi>Mack-Cartie</hi> percelving, cauſed his Cavallery to retire: and advanced his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantery againſt onr Cavalery: and not the worſt in front you may be ſure.</p>
               <p>We victualled and mannerd the Caſtle with ſuch proviſion and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition as we could well ſpare, untill we ſhall heare farther from you; and on Monday were backe againe at <hi>Kingſale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tueſday the eighteene we heard newes that <hi>Bandon</hi> Bridge was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſurprized by the Rebell <hi>Mac Con;</hi> and moſt fortunately relieved by Sir <hi>Richard Greenvill,</hi> a very fine Eegliſh Towne walled in, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the Farle of <hi>Cork;</hi> the manner thus: Sir <hi>Richard</hi> at his arivall to <hi>Corke,</hi> it being a thicke and foggy aire, was ſomething ill diſpoſed; Captaine <hi>Thomas Fineh</hi> Captaine of the Fort, perſwaded him to take his Troope, and to ſcoure the Countrey, paſſing as far as <hi>Bandon,</hi> thereto lodge a night or two, being a moſt ſweet ayre, thereby not only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create himſelfe, but alſo to revive the drooping hearts of his deare Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, with the preſence of ſo worthy a Commander: Sir <hi>Richard</hi> conſented, and the next morning being Monday, <hi>Ian.</hi> 11. with 80. Horſes, and only thirty Muskettiers, paſſed thither; when he came upon an hill, within a mile of the Towne, he heard their Drum beat, and ſaw their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours fly, The Town ſtanding in a bottome; likewiſe about ſome hundred ſhot play, wondring that they played ſo faſt: within half a mile we heard lamentations of women, and crying out of children, we liked not that: Sir <hi>Richard</hi> cauſed his Trumpets to ſound, his Horſes and Muskets to order and thus they all crying courage countreymen, a <hi>Grinfield,</hi> a <hi>Grinfield:</hi> we came to the gates, which by reaſon of the great confuſion in the Towne, were not opened ſcarce within a quarter of an houre.</p>
               <p>Being entred, they found the enemy to have entred in the Low Towne thorough the water, betwen two buts of wale; ſome 40 were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and ſcirmiſhing with the Townes men: the reſt to the number of 600. were paſſing the foord a maine; when they ſaw our trumpets and ſuch a number of freſh Horſes in that equipage, and the ſhot plainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, they in the paſſage retired with all ſpeed they could make, into the wood and bog, ſome Two miles above the River, never ſtaying for their fellowes in the Towne, who were all ſlaine to the number of 45.

                  <hi>Bandon</hi> men were either ſlaine or dangerouſly hurt: Thus was that prety Town happily relieved, but all other newes is not of this nature, I wiſh it were,</p>
               <p>Towns of greater importance are taken, that way we had ſuſtained ſome harme, had not Sr <hi>Simon,</hi> ſo wiſly conſidered the Rebels advantage, (having not only the ſtrand, but divers high and broken ſandy banckes behind him ſhocked with his ſupplies) and cauſed his infantery upon the falling back of his horſes to come up anckle deep in water in one whole body and to powre in ſuch a valley of ſhot into the Rebels groſſe, that they dropped wonderfully, neither could their ſhot at that diſtance reach onr men, as appeared afterward, being moſt of them Calivers: Sir <hi>Simon</hi> perceiving how the game plaid, would not ſuffer his men to move any further, but to play their ſhot at ſuch diſtance, which he perceived ſufficiently anoyed their Enemies, and did them much harme; at the third volley, the Enemies Infantery gave over and retired to the banks upon their horſes, how much they retired as neare as could be gueſſed, ours at diſtance advanced, till at length, the Enemy gave the freedome of the ſtrand: then after one volley more, our horſes now under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir <hi>Thomas Temple,</hi> having recovered the ſtrand alſo, as now our foot had already the bancks. At laſt, having found wher they got up two horſes a breaſt, (the foot in the mean time awing the Enemie, fell upon them in ſuch a fierce manner) that no reſiſtance in a manner was made; there was dead upon the ground eight hundred horſes and foot, with <hi>Mac-Carty</hi> and his two baſtard brethen, whoſe heads were ſtrait way ſmitten off, and carried upon poles unto <hi>Eniſhannon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whither being come, the Town made, nor could make no reſiſtance; The Caſtle would not anſwer; whereupon Sir <hi>Simon</hi> with his five pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces battered the gate, and wicket, entered by force, found thirty deſperate Villans in it, hanged ſome of them over the Caſtle wall, ſome in other parts of the Town. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>
