            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both of men and beasts, lying upon the face of the earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, as in the time of warres hath been seen, which doth so corrupt the air, as that thereby our Corn, Fruits, Hearbs, and Waters, which we daily use for our food and sustenance, are infected: also it may come by some stinking dunghils, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and standing pooles of water, and unsavory smels which are near the places where we dwell, or by thrusting a great company of people into a close, narrow, or streight room, as most commonly we see in Ships, common Gaoles, and in narrow and close lanes and streets, where many people doe dwell together, and the places not orderly kept clean and sweet. But most commonly, in this our time, it is dispersed amongst us, by accompanying our selves with such as either have, or lately have had the disease themselves, or at least have been conversant with such as have been infected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: But for the most part it doth come by receiving into our custody some clothes, or such like things, that have been used about some infected body, wherein the infection may lie hidden a long time, as hath been too too often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, with repentance too late in many places, It may also come by Dogs, Cats, Pigs, and Weasels, which are prone and apt to receive and carry the infection from place to place. But howsoever it doth come, let us assure our selves, that it is a just punishment of God, laid upon us for our manifold sins and transgressions against his divine Majesty: for as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, <hi>Quicquid patimur ab alto venit,</hi> What crosses or afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons soever we suffer, it cometh from the Lord, either for a triall of our faith, or a punishment for our sins. Wherefore to distinguish any farther thereof I think it needlesse, for my intent is in breif sort, so exactly as I can, to shew the meanes how to prevent the same, as also how to cure it when we are infected. But before I enter to treat thereof, I think it not amisse, to shew what forewarnings and tokens are given us before hand of the coming thereof, thereby the better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the same by prayer and repentance.</p>

Warnings of the Plague to come.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>AVicen,</hi> a noble Physitian saith, that when wee see the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall course of the ayre, and seasons of the year to be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as when the spring time is cold, clowdy, and dry, the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest time stormy, and tempestuous, the mornings and evenings to be very cold, and at noon extream hot, these do foreshew the Plague to come. Also when we see fiery impressions in the firmament, especially in the end of summer, as comets and such like, and that in the begining of harvest we see great store of little frogs, red to ades, and myse on the earth aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding extraordinarily: or when in summer we see great store of toades creeping on the earth having long tailes, of an ashy color on their backs, and their bellies spotted and of divers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and when we see great store of gnats swiming on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or flying in great companies together, or when our trees and hearbs do abound with Caterpillars, Spiders, Moaths <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which devoure the leaves on the trees and hearbs on the earth, it sheweth the ayre to be corrupt, and the Plague shortly after to follow. Also by the beasts of the field we may perceive it (especially sheep) which will go mourning with their heads hanging down towards the ground, and divers of them dying without any manifest cause known unto us. Also when we see young Children flock themselves together in companies, and then will faine some one of their company to be dead amongs them, and so will solemnize the buriall in a mournfull sort, this is a token which hath been well observed in our age to foreshew great mortality at hand. Also when we see rivers of water to overflow without any manifest cause, or suddenly vanish away and become dry: And when clear well-springs do suddenly become foule and troubled. Also when the small-Pox doth generally abound both in young and old people, all these do foreshew the Plague to come.</p>

Sheweth how to prevent the Plague.</head>
                  <p>THere are three principall meanes how to prevent this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious disease: The first and chiefest is to acknowledge our manifold sins and wickedness unto almighty God our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, with a hearty repentance and amendment of our former sins committed against his divine majestie.</p>
                  <p>The second means is to fly far off from the place infected, and as <hi>Rondoletius</hi> saith, not over hastily to return thither again for fear of an after-clap: which saying is confirmed by <hi>Vale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> in these words, <hi>Non enim morietur in bello, qui non est in illo:</hi> and the farther from it, the safer shall we be, yet were it a very uncharitable course that all which are of abillity should do so, for then how should the poor be relieved, and good orders observed: but for Children it were best to send them far off from the place, because their bodies are most apt to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as also for that they cannot so continually use antidots and preservatives, which by their great heat may indanger them almost so much as the disease it self.</p>
                  <p>The third meanes consisteth chiefly in three points, which are these: Order, Diet, and Physicall helps. For the first you shall have a care that your houses be kept clean and sweet, not suffering any foule and filthy clothes or stinking things to remain in or about the same: and in summer season to deck your windowes, and strow your floors with sweet and wholsom hearbs, floures, and leaves, of Mints, Balme, Penniroyall, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, Time, Majoram, red-Roses, Carnations, Gelliflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and such like for your windowes, your floors to be strow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with green Rushes, and Mints, Oaken and Willow leaves, Vine leaves and such like: your windowes which stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North and East, do you alwaies keep open in the day time, if the ayre be clear, and that no infected and unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory smell be near the same, as Fogs, dunghils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and every morning before you open either your doors, or windowes, as also in the evening when you go to bed, cause a good fire to be made in your Chamber, and burn some odoriferous o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

sweet perfumes in the middest thereof, as hereafter I will shew you, or in stead thereof some Juniper, Frankincense, Bay leaves, Rosemary, Lavender, Majoram, or such like, which you must alwaies have dried in a readinesse, and so in the fume or smoke thereof to breath and perfume the clothes which you are to weare.</p>

                  <p>FOr our diet as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth us, we must have a care not to exceed in eating and drinking but to keep a mean therein, and in any case to beware of surfeting and drunkenness, which are enemies both to the body and soule, but as we may not exceed in eating and drinking, so to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure great hunger and thirst is most dangerous, our meat ought to be of a facile and easie digestion, partly tending to a drying qualitie; as Cocks, Capons, Hens, Pullets, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, Pheasants, Quailes, Pigeons, Rabbets, Kid, Veal, Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Birds of the Mountains, and such like; but Beef, Pork, Venison, Hare and Goats flesh is to be refused, and so are all water fowls, as Duck, Swan, Goose, Widgen, Teal, and such like, because they are hard to digest, and do increase ill blood, and naughtie juyce in the bodie: Lambs flesh, because of his exceeding moisture is also to be refused, Eggs in the Summer not good, but in Winter tolerable: All Fishes which are of a hard flesh, whether they be of the Sea, or fresh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are to be allowed. In fresh Rivers the Perch, Barble, Gudgeon, Loch, Cool, Trout, and Pike are good; and for Sea fish, the Gilthed, Turbet, Sole, Rochet, Gurnard, Lobster, Crab, Praunes, Shrimps, Whiting, and such like eaten with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44138:13"/>
There are some Authors which hold opinion, that Fish is better to be eaten then flesh in the great fervent heat of the year, because they doe make a more cold bloud in the body then flesh; another reason is, because they doe live under the water, they are not infected with any contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aire, as Beasts and birds may be, and therefore more wholsome, but in my judgement flesh is more wholsome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth-breed a more pure, and fine Juyce in the body then any Fish whatsoever; your bread ought to be made of pure wheat, not too new, nor too old, but of one dayes ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, or two at most is best: Rie bread is to be eschewed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his great moisture: your drink is best beer or ale, not too strong or new, but the staler and clearer it is the better, at your meals a draught or two of Claret wine is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, but in hot weather it were good to allay it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle water, for wine doth warm the stomack, help digestion, and comfort the heart.</p>

                  <p>Walk not into the open ayre in the morning before the Sun hath had some power to cleanse and clear the same, and in any case goe not abroad when great fogs and mists are upon the earth, for it is dangerous: but if urgent occasions move you, then before you goeforth of your doors be sure to eat some preservative first, and then take some good and odoriferous Pomander, Nodule, or Nosegay in your hand, as before is shewed you. The extream heat of the day is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to be refused to walk in, because it chafeth the bloud; as also in the evening after the Sun is set, for then unsavory and unwholsome Fogs arise out of the earth, and in any case if you can avoid it come not neer any any place infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but use to walk in the open aire and dry ground.</p>
                  <p>Use <hi>Venus</hi> combates moderately, but none at all were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the best time to use them is three or four hours after sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, before you sleep, and then rest upon them.</p>
                  <p>Beware of anger, fear, and pensiveness of the minde, for by their means the body is made more apt to receive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>Use pleasant and merry recreations, either with musick,

pleasant company to talke withall, or reading some good books.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, Every evening and morning in hot weather to cause cold water to be cast in the streets, especially where the infection is, and every day to cause the streets to be kept clean and sweet, and cleansed from all filthy things which lye in the same.</p>

                  <p>Now when you have been with any one so infected, before you go into the company of any whole and sound people, it were necessary you do stand by a good fire, having all the clothes about you which you did wear when you were with the sick, and then turn and aire your selfe well thereby, so shall you be sure the lesse to endanger others by your company. Thus have I as breefly as I can devise set down all the ordinary meanes which my self have used, and by others known to be used for preserving you from this contagious and dangerous disease, which in the most part of people will suffice, but for such as dwell whereas they may have the counsell of a learned Physitian, I do wish them to take his advice, especially for purging and letting bloud, because none can so exactly set down in writing the perfect course thereof (which may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood rightly of the common sort) so well as he which hath the sight of the body: for that many bodies are oftentimes troubled with some one humour abounding more then another, which here to treat of would be too tedious, neither can it profit the common people, for whose sakes I have taken this paines: and now will I shew the signes to know when one is

                     <p>When the Carbunckle or Blain doth suddenly dry up, as if it were scorcht with the fire, and that the place round about it doth shew to be of a wannish blew colour, is a deadly sign: if in the skin appear green or black spots, the excrements of divers colours with worms in it either dead or living, having a vile stinking savour, and spitteth stinking and bloudy matter, doth betoken death.</p>
                     <p>When the sick complaines of great and extream heat in the inward parts, and yet cold outwardly, the eyes staring or weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the face terrible, the said excrements or urin passing away, and the party not knowing thereof, are evill signes.</p>
                     <p>When in the fourth or seventh day they are taken with a fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, or do fall into an extream bleeding at nose, or have a great flux with a continuall vomiting, or a desire to vomit and do it not, extream pain at the heart, watchfullness, and the strength clean gone, are deadly signes. When the party being very sick, yet saith he feeleth himself well, his eyes sunk deep in his head, and full of tears, when he thinks all things do stink, his nailes looking blew, the nose sharp, and as it were crooked, the breath thick and short with a cold sweat in the brest and face, and turning and playing with the clothes, the pulse creeping or scarcely to be felt, and greivous unto him to speak, these are infallible signes of death at hand. Some, before any of these signes are perceived, do dy, and some likewise which have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them appearing, and yet do escape, such is the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of this disease: there are many other symptoms which do happen in this contagious disease, which would be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to declare, but these as the chiefest may suffice.</p>

               <div n="1" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. I.</head>
                  <p>WHen we perceive any to be infected with this contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disease, we must with all possible speed seek all the meanes we can how to prevent the malignity thereof, whose property is at the first to assault the principall part, which is the heart, and therefore requires present help; for unlesse some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done within eight or four and twenty houres, little will it then prevail to attempt it, for by that time nature is either subdued, and clean overthrown, or else hath thrust the same to the exterior parts, or otherwise digested it: yet may we not neglect at any time, to use all the meanes we can, in helping and furthering of nature to the uttermost of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, because we doe oftentimes see nature so wearied, and weakened in expelling of this venemous matter, that unlesse some help be added to assist and comfort her, the party, for lack thereof, dyeth, which otherwise might be saved: For I have oftentimes seen by diligent helping of nature, that to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and brought to good passe, which I have judged most despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. There are foure intentions required for the curing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; that is, by bloud-letting, Cordials, sweat and purging: but the manner how to execute the same, hath bred great conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both amongst the old and later Writers, which here to treat of were too tedious, for unto the learned it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, and for the commonalty little would it availe them, therefore in brief will I shew you what I have observed touching the cure.</p>
                  <p>First, if it be in a Plethorick, sanguine, and strong body, and hath pain in the head, great heat at the heart, thirstnesse, the pulse strong, and labouring, or beating strongly, and hath great and large veines appearing; these ought presently to be let bloud in that side where yee perceive the greif doth prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44138:17"/>
it selfe to come forth, and not visibly appearing, tending to maturation: For then we may not draw bloud, but use all other meanes we can devise, in helping nature to expell it, neither may you draw bloud, if the party have a flix or lask (which is an evill sign) in the beginning of the disease, for by that meanes you shall hinder nature greatly, but onely give the party Cordials; neither may you stop the flix in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but if it be extream, and that it stay not the second day, then must you give some purgation, which may leave an astringency behind it, as hereafter in the cure of the flix shall be shewed. For as <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> in his first book and one and twentieth Aphorisme, doth admonish us, we must consider and mark, how nature doth incline her self, for that will teach us what we are to doe.</p>
                  <p>Now if you perceive the botch or carbunkle to appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the chin about the throat, then presently draw bloud in both vein<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>es under the tongue, and immediately after that apply a cupping glasse; with scarification in one side of the neck next unto the fore, thereby to draw it from the throat, for fear least suddenly it choke him up, and then apply Chickens rumps, or Hens rumps to the botch, the feathers being first pluckt away from the rump, and a grain of Salt put into the tewell, and so hold the bare place to the greif untill the Chicken die, which will be within half an hour, and then apply another, and so continue in changing them so long as they doe die, and lastly apply a mollificative Cataplasme or plaister to the same place, as in the fift Chapter following is shewed, which is made with <hi>Unguentum basillicon,</hi> and to the botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>Epithemation</hi> and Cataplasme in the seventh Chapter following. But if it be in the neck, he doth complain, then let him bloud in the <hi>Cephallica</hi> vein in the arm, of the same side where he complaineth.</p>
                  <p>If in the groin or flanke he doth complain, then let him bloud in the foot on the same side, and open the vein called <hi>Maleola,</hi> or <hi>Saphena,</hi> the quantity must be according as the age and strength of the party requireth, but at most draw not above six or eight ounces: For <hi>Avicen</hi> willeth us, to preserve bloud as the treasure of nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44138:17"/>But in a weak, spare, and cachochimious body (as <hi>Galen</hi> teacheth us) we may not draw bloud at all, for thereby should you greatly indanger the Patient, but help such by Cordials and sweat.</p>
                  <p>And here you shall understand, that unlesse Phlebotomy be done at the first, that is, within six or eight houres atmost, it will be too late to attempt it, neither may you doe it if the sore doe appear up in height tending to suppuration, for then should you hinder nature, which like a diligent workman, hath discharged and thrust forth that venomous matter, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would have killed us.</p>
                  <p>And here touching Phlebotomy or bloud-letting, you must have this speciall care, that you draw not bloud on the opposite side, as if it be on the left side the sore appear, then draw not bloud on the right side; if it appear in the flanke, then draw not bloud in the arme, but in the foot, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise you shall draw that venomous matter from the ignoble unto the noble parts, and so kill the body.</p>
                  <p>And although the party complain not more in the one side then the other, yet by the pulse shall you perceive on which side the venome lieth hidden, for on that side where nature is opprest, there shall you find the pulse more weak, feeble, and uneven, greatly differing from the other side.</p>
                  <p>And here you shall understand, that in some it hath been seen, that nature of it self at the first, hath thrust out that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous matter in some place of the body, with a botch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing high, and tending to suppuration, or a carbunckle, or spots called purples. Now here if you draw bloud, you doe then greatly indanger the body; but in this case you must one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give Cordials, and use all the meanes you can to bring it outward, either by maturation, or evaporation, as hereafter shall be shewed you.</p>
                  <p>And here you shall further understand, that where the age, constitution, nor strength of the party will permit that Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy be done, yet for the better help of nature you must apply Ventoses, with reasonable deep scarification, unto the next place adjoyning, where the party complaineth, thereby the more speedily to draw the venomous matter unto the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficiall
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44138:18"/>
parts, and there to apply the rumps of Chickens, as before is taught you, and so apply to the place some strong maturative, and atrractive plaister, or Cataplasme, as hereafter shall be shewed you. If the greif be in the head or throte, then apply Ventoses to the neck: If it be in the emunctuaries of the heart, then apply them to the shoulders: If in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctuaries of the liver, then apply them to the buttocks or thighs, now when this is done, either by Phlebetomy, or Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toses, then within an hour or two at the most after it, you must give the sick some good Cordiall Medicine, which hath power to comfort the heart, resist the venomous matter, and also procure sweat, whereof out of the following you may make choice as you list.</p>

First, by giving to the sick oftentimes some Cordiall Electuary to keep it from the heart, then (if no great pain be in the outward part) you must apply a cupping-glasse with scarification, directly against the place where the greif is felt, and let it remain thereon a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or halfe an hour, then take it away, and presently apply the rumps of Chickens, Hens, or Pigeons to the place (as before hath been shewed) that being done, then lay some attractive and maturative plaister or Cataplasme to the place, which here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is shewed, and every sixth hour you must apply the cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping-glass, as also the rest, untill such time as you have brought the venomous matter to the outward parts, there to be visibly seen, or at least, by feeling to be perceived, which commonly is effected at the second time, then use no more cupping, but onely apply a maturative to the place.</p>

                  <p>THe Carbunkle or blain doth first begin with a little Pustula or wheal, and sometime with divers Pustulaes or wheales to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, with a great burning and pricking pain in the place, which Pustulaes are like a scalding bladder, seeming to be full of water or matter, yet when you open it, little or nothing will come out of it, and when they are broken, will grow to a hard crust or scarre, as if it had been burnt with a hot Iron or Caustick, with a great ponderosity or heavinesse in the place. In some it comes in the beginning, without any Pustula at all to be perceived, but with a hard black crust or a scarre; sometimes it lyeth hidden in the inward parts without any outward appearance at all, as if it be in the lungs, then there is a difficulty of breathing, with a Cough and foul spitting.</p>
                  <p>If it be in the Liver or Spleen, then the party feeleth a great pain and pricking in the same side; if in the Kidneyes or Bladder it doth chance, then is there suppression or stopping of the Urine, or great pain in the making of water; if it be in the Brain, then a <hi>delirium</hi> followeth, but howsoever it chance to come, the party infected therewith hath a Fever, with other accidents, as before in the 13. Chapter of the first Treatise is declared; if it begin with a green, black, or blew colour, or of divers colours like the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, then is it a deadly signe, and so is it, if once it appear and then suddenly vanish away; but if it be red or yellowish, so it be not in any of the principall parts, or emunctuaries of the body, as the heart, stomack, armpit, flanke, jawes, or throat, then it is laudable, otherwise in any of these places very desperate and dangerous to be cured, but wheresoever it doth chance, unlesse it may be brought to suppuration, it is deadly.</p>

Sheweth what the Small Pox and Measels are, and whereof it proceedeth.</head>
                  <p>FOr that oftentimes those that are infected with the Plague, are in the end of the disease sometime troubled with the small Pox or Measels, as also by good observation it hath been seen, that they are fore-runners or warnings of the plague to come, as <hi>Salius</hi> and divers other writers doe testifie: I have thought it good and as a matter pertinent to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Treatise, to shew the aids and helps which are required for the same.</p>
                  <p>I need not greatly to stand upon the description of this disease, because it is a thing well known unto most people, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of adusted bloud mixt with flegm, as <hi>Avicen</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, which according to both ancient and latter Writers doth alwaies begin with a Fever, then shortly after there ariseth small Pustulaes upon the skin throughout all the body, which doe not suddenly come forth, but by intermission, in some more or lesse, according to the state and qualitie of the bodie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected therewith: for in some there ariseth many little Pustulaes with elevation of the skin, which in one day doe increase and grow bigger, and after have a thick matter growing in them, which the Greeks call <hi>Exanthemata</hi> or <hi>Exthymata:</hi> and after the Latines <hi>Variola,</hi> in our English tongue the small Pox,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44138:30"/>
and here some Writers doe make a difference betwixt <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola</hi> and <hi>exanthemata;</hi> for say they, that is called <hi>variola</hi> when many of those Pustules doe suddenly run into a clear bladder, as if it had been scalled, but the other doth not so, yet they are both one in the cure, they doe most commonly appear the fourth day, or before the eight day, as <hi>Avicen</hi> witnesseth.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The cause of the Pox and Measels.</head>
                     <p>The primitive cause as <hi>Valetius</hi> saith, is by alteration of the aire, in drawing some putrified and corrupt quality unto it, which doth cause an ebullition of our bloud.</p>
                     <p>The cause antecedent is repletion of meats, which do easily corrupt in the stomack, as when we eat milk and fish toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at one time, or by neglecting to draw bloud, in such as have accustomed to doe it every year, whereby the bloud doth abound.</p>
                     <p>The conjunct cause is the menstruall bloud, which from the beginning in our mothers wombs wee received, the which mixing it self with the rest of our bloud; doth cause an Ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the whole.</p>
                     <p>The efficient cause is, nature or naturall heat, which by that menstruall matter mixing it self with the rest of our bloud, doth cause a continuall vexing and disquieting thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an unnaturall heat is increased in all the body, causing an Ebullition of bloud, by the which this filthy menstrual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44138:31"/>
is seperated from our natural bloud, and the nature being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and overwhelmed therewith, doth thrust it to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pores of the skin as the excrements of bloud, which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if it be hot and slimie, then it produceth the Pox, but if dry and subtil, then the Measels or Males. But <hi>Mercurialis</hi> an excellent writer in Physick, in his first Book, <hi>de morbis puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, cap.</hi> 2. agreeing with <hi>Fernelius</hi> in his Book <hi>De abdit is rerum causis, c.</hi> 12. doth hold opinion, that the immediate cause of this disease doth not proceed of menstrual bloud, but of some secret and unknown corruption, or defiled quality of the aire, causing an Ebullition of bloud, which is also verified by <hi>Valetius,</hi> and now doth reckon it to be one of the hereditable diseases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause few or none doe escape it, but that either in their youth, ripe age, or old age, they are infected therewith. The contention hereabout is great, and mighty reasons are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned on both sides, therefore I will leave the judgement thereof unto the better learned to define; but mine opinion is, That now it proceedeth of the Excrements of all the four humours in our bodies, which striving with the purest, doth cause a supernatural heat and ebullition of our bloud, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies beginning with a Fever in the most part, and may well be reckoned in the number of those diseases which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Epidemia:</hi> as <hi>Fracastorius</hi> in his first Book, <hi>De morbis contag. cap.</hi> 13. witnesseth this disease is very contagious and infectious, as experience teacheth us: There are two speciall causes why this disease is infectious: The first is, because it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth by ebullition of bloud, whose vapour being entred into another bodie, doth soon defile and infect the same, the second reason is, because it is a disease hereditable; for we see when one is infected therewith, that so many as come neer him, (especially those which are allyed in the same bloud) doe assuredly for the most part, receive the infection also.</p>

                  <p>For the first intention, if the age and strength of the sick will permit, and that the Pox or Measels appear not, it were then good in the first, second, or third day to draw bloud out of the Basilica veine in the right arme, if he be not under the age of fourteen years, but the quantity must be at the discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him that draweth it, either more or lesse as occasion is offered: but for children and such as are of tender years, and weak bodies, it were not good to draw bloud out of the arme, but out of the inferior parts, as the thighes, hams buttocks, and the Emeroidall veines, especially if the party be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, or else to apply ventoses to the loynes, buttocks, or hams, which may boldly be used both before and after they do appear, either with scarification, or without, as cause requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, which is a speciall good meanes to draw that Ichorous matter from the interior to the exterior parts; but for sucking Children, it were best to apply bloud-suckers unto any of the foresaid places, which is a thing that may be used with more ease then ventoses, neither do I wish either of them to be used un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse necessity require it, which is, when the matter lieth lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the interior parts, not offering it self to appear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly: otherwise I hold it better to leave the whole work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nature, specially in sucking children: for when we see that nature is ready, or doth endeavour to expell the malignity which is in the interior parts to the exterior, which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by reviving of the Spirits, and mitigating of the Fever: here we ought not to use any meanes at all, but leave the whole operation to nature, which we must onely help by keeping

the sick body in a reasonable heat, being wrapt in a scarlet, stammell, or red cloth, which may not touch the skin, but to have a soft linnen cloth betwixt them both, and then cover him with clothes in reasonable sort, and keep him from the open ayre and the light, except a little, and also from anger, using all the meanes you can to keep the sick in quietnesse, and if the body be very costive, then to give an easie Glister.</p>

successe for preventing thereof: which is, you may not do any thing unto them untill they grow white, and that they are come to maturation, which when you perceive, then with a golden pinne, or needle, or for lack thereof a copper pinne will serve, do you open every pustulae in the top, and so thrust out the matter therein very softly and gently with a soft linnen cloth, and if you perceive the places do fill againe, then open them againe as you did first, for if you do suffer the matter which is in them toremain over long, then will it fret and corrode the flesh, which is the cause of those pitts which remaine after the Pox are gone, as <hi>Avicen</hi> witnesseth: now when you have thus done, then annoint the places with this oyntment following.</p>
                  <p>Take Elder leaves, one handfull, Marigolds, two handfulls, French Mallowes, one handfull, Barrowes morte or grease, six ounces.</p>
                  <p>First bruise the hearb in a morter, and then boyle them with the grease in a pewter dish on a chafer and coales, untill the juice of the hearbs be consumed, then strein it, and keep it to your use, the best time to make it is in the middle or the latter end of May.</p>
                  <p>You must with a feather annoint the places grieved, and as it drieth in, annoint it againe, and so continue it oftentimes, for this will soon dry them up, and keep the place from pitts and holes, which remain after the Pox are gone.</p>
                  <p>Also if you annoint the Pox with the oyle of sweet Almonds newly drawn three or four times a day, which you must begin to do so soon as the Pox are grown white and come to matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will cure them without pitts or spotts, and easeth the pain and burning, and helpeth excoriation.</p>
                  <p>Some do onely oftentimes wet the places with the juice of Marigolds in the summer season, and in winter the juice of the roots will serve: and by that onely have done well.</p>

prescribing outwardly Applications, but proceeded by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes, and Alexiteries, as will appear in <hi>libr. de Theriaca ad Pis. cap,</hi> 16. Wherefore, unlesse we will utterly disclaim or relinguish the method and prescripts of these worthy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and prosecute new wayes and inventions, to oppose this man-yelling Monster, we must attempt it not with Poysons but Antidotes. And <hi>Galen</hi> defineth those to be Poysons, which agree not with nature, either well or ill affected at any time; for though there are some Poysons, which if they meet in the body with a contrary venome, so fight with it, and oppose it, that both doe perish in the conflict betwixt them; so that the party, by their colluctation and strugling together, escapes with his life: yet all of them agree in uniform opinion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that where they meet with no opposition, they ruine the party: And therefore conclude, that <hi>Arsenick,</hi> worn by a healthy man, finding not onely no contrary Poyson to make conflict with, but no Poyson at all, must necessarily thwart, and oppose, and make an onset on nature her self.</p>
                  <p>And to confirme their opinions, I have purposely intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the judgements of other learned Phisitians concurring with them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gerardus Columbus,</hi> a learned Phisitian, reporteth, that it hath been observed, that the wearers of these Amulets, upon unusuall heating their bodies, have fallen into sudden <hi>Lipothi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and Swounings, with other fearfull accidents, which continued upon them till the Amulets or Placents were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from them; and that others, though not instantly, yet after some time, have by late and wofull experience disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their malignity, by falling into malignant and pestilent Fevers, some of them ending with death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Franc. Alphanus,</hi> a Phisitian of <hi>Salerne,</hi> relateth of one, who wearing <hi>Arsenick,</hi> and heating himself with playing earnestly at Tennise, fell down suddenly dead.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mattheus Hessus</hi> also thus writeth, As Cordiall Bags or Amulets ought not to be disavowed, so empoysoned Amulets can be no way commended; nor doe I remember, that ever any received good from them, who abstained from other
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44138:40"/>
Antidotes: But this I certainly know, that divers persons, who carry about them Quick-silver in a Nutshell, by the vain perswasions of some Imposters, have died of the Plague, and the counsellours and advisers of such like Amulets, have been the first have betaken themselves to their heeles, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding more in their running than cunning: and yet these Quacks perswaded the ignorant people, with glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises and protestations, that whosoever carried Quick-silver or <hi>Arsenick</hi> about his neck, should be as safe, as if he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased a protection from the King of Heaven</p>
                  <p>Historians also report, that <hi>Caracalla,</hi> though he were a wicked Emperour, prohibited by publick Edict or Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that no man should wear about him superstitious Amulets.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Theophrastus</hi> the great (not without cause) esteemed <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ricles</hi> to have a crazed brain, because he saw him wear an Amulet about his neck.</p>
                  <p>And hereunto Doctor <hi>Francis Herring,</hi> an able Phisitian, as a Corollary to what hath before been written, addeth the experience of some <hi>London</hi> Phisitians, who report, they have seen foul holes made in the breasts of those that have worn those Amulets, and have observed divers to die, who have religiously worn them about their necks, as well as others.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the venters and setters out of these deceitfull wares, make them as a scout, to discover the infection when it beginneth to seize on a man, by clapping close to the heart, to guard that principall part, as the cheif Tower: It is a meer deceit and collusion: for whensoever the body is heated, this event followeth necessarily, though no other infection be near, but the poysonous and venomous <hi>Arsenick</hi> itself, whose salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is rather <hi>Ioabs</hi> imbracing, or <hi>Iuda</hi>'s kissing, than friendly preservatives.</p>

                  <p>There are two speciall causes of the Plague.</p>

                  <p>The air is infected, when the temperatenesse of the air is changed from his naturall state, to excessive heat and moisture, which is the worst temperament of the air, the vapours drawn up by the heat of the Sun being unconsumed, rot, putrifie, and corrupt, and so with the venome infect the air: Also dead Carkases lying unburied, as it often chanceth in Warres, evaporations of Pooles, Fens, Marishes, stinking and noysome sents and Kennels, and Astronomers say, Aspects, Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Oppositions of ill Planets, and Eclipses of the Sun and Moon.</p>
                  <p>Also disordering ones self, either in diet or exercises bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth one into the Pestilence; therefore in time of contagion, outrages and surfets are to be avoided, as also all excesse of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drinking, sweating, bathing, lechery, and all other things that open the pores of the body, and enter thereby ill aires, which invenome the lively spirits.</p>

                  <head>The infection of the Plague entereth into a man after this sort.</head>
                  <p>In a man are three principall parts (that is) the Heart, Liver, and Brains, and each of these hath his cleansing place:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44138:41"/>
If they appear in the neck, they shew the Brains to be chiefly vexed, if under the arme-holes the Heart, but if they appear in the share, the Liver is most infected,</p>
                  <p>For when a man hath taken infection, it presently mingleth with the bloud, and runs to the heart, which is the cheif part of man, and the heart putteth the venome to his cleansing place, which is the arme-holes; and that being stopt, putteth it to the next principall part, which is the liver, and it passeth it to his cleansing place, which is the share, and they being stopt, passe it to the next principall place, that is, the braines, and to their cleansing places, which are under the eares, or under the throat, and they being stopped, suffer it not to passe out, and then it is moved twelve hours before it rest in any place, and if it be not let out within the space of four and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours by bleeding, it brings a man into a pestilentiall Ague, and causeth a botch in one of those three places, or near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them</p>

                  <p>If the matter be gathered under the arme-holes, it comes from the heart by the Cardiacall vein, then bleed on the same side by the Basilica vein, the innermost vein of the arme,</p>
                  <p>If the botch appear behind the eares, above the chin, or in any other part of the face or neck, bleed out of the Cephalica vein on the same side; you may bleed with cupping Glasses, and Scarification, or Horseleeches.</p>
                  <p>If the botch appear in the share, bleed in the ankle on the same side, in any case not in the arme, for it will draw up the matter again.</p>
