            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

which suffer for thy Gospell sake?</hi> And so beholding on the one side my jmperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vnablenes, sinnefull miserie, and vnworthines; and on th'other side the greatnes of Gods mercie, to be called to so high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, I was as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed and overcome for a while with joy and gladnes, concluding thus with my selfe in mine heart, <hi>O Lord thou shewest power in weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wisedome in foolishnes, Mercie in sinfulnesse: who shall let thee to choose where and whom thou wilt?

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25437:38"/>
when they were enemies to him, and full of sinne. Hee is and wilbe the same God still. As rich in mercie, as mighty, as ready, as willing to forgiue sinnes now without respect of persons, as hee was then; and so wilbe to the worlds end, to all that call vppon him. It is no arrogancie, nor presumption in any man to burthen God with his promise, chalenging his ayd and assistance in all perils and daungers; Calling vpon him in the name of Christ, for whose sake, whosoeuer commeth to the Father, is sure to receiue more then hee can wish or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</hi>

care her poore Soule was cast; it was lamentable to behold; because she went not with her fellows to giue her life in the defence of her Christ and his Gospell, for of all things in the world shee least expected this restraint.

Let vs not run away when it is most time to fight. Remember none shall bee crowned but such as fight manfully.</hi> You must now turne all your cogitati<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ns from the perill you see: and marke the felicitie that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the perill: either victorie of your enemies in this World, or else a surrender for euer of your right in the inheritance to come. Beware of beholding to much the felicite or miserie of this world: for the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and too earnest loue or feare of either of them draweth from God. Thinke with your
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:25437:62"/>
selues: the felicitie of the world is good: but yet none otherwise then it standeth with the fauor of God. It is to be kept: but yet so farre forth as by keeping of it wee loose not God. It is good abiding and tarrying still among our friends here: but yet so that we tarrie not therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in Gods displeasure, and to dwell hereafter with Deuils in fire euerlasting. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnder God but may bee kept, so that God, being aboue all things we haue, be not lost.</p>
                  <p>Of Aduersity iudge the same. Long imprisonment is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but yet libertie vppon euill conditions is more painfull. The prisons stincke: but yet not so much as sweet houses whereas the feare and true honour of God lacketh: losse of goods is
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:25437:62"/>
great, but losse of Gods grace and fauour is greater. I must bee alone and solitarie: it is better to bee alone and haue God with mee, then to bee in company with the wicked, and want his presence. I am a poore simple creature, and cannot tell how to answere before such a great sort of Noble and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wen: it is better to make answere before the pompe and pride of wicked men, then to stand naked in the sight of all heaven and Earth, before the iust GOD at the latter day. I shall die then by the hands of the cruell man: hee is blessed that looseth his life full of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and findeth the life of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ioyes. It is paine and griefe to depart from life and friends: but yet not so much as to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:25437:63"/>
depart from grace and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it selfe. <hi>Felicitie nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie then can apreare to be great, if it be wayed with the joyes or paine of the life to come.</hi>

               <p>This prison was within a

Court where the Prebends Chambers were, beeing a vault beneath the ground, and the window beeing jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed with a pale; of height by estimation 4 foot and a halfe, and distant from the same three foot, so that she looking fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beneath might onelie see such as stoode at the pale. Her Brother in the meane while sought her, with no lesse danger of life, then dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of many impediments hee could never know where she lay, till comming by gods vnsearchable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence very earlie thither in a morning (her Keeper being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gone to Church to ring, for he was Bel-rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) chanced to heare her

And this was 5 weekes after her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither. All which time no creature was knowne to come at her, more then her keeper.</p>
               <p>Her lyjng in that prison was onely vppon a little short straw, between a paire of stocks and a stone wall: beeing allowed 3 farthings a day; that is a halfe peny

bread, &amp; a farthing drinke: neither could shee get any more for her money: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she desired to haue her whole allowance in bread, and vsed water for her drinke. Thus did she lye 9 weekes, during all which time, shee never chaunged her apparell: whereby she became at the last a most piteous &amp; loathsome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to behold.</p>
               <p>At her first comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this place, shee did gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously bewaile her state with great sorrow and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, reasoning with her selfe: <hi>Why her Lord God did with so heauie iustice suffer her to be sequestred from her louing fellowes, into so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame miserie.</hi> In these do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous

               <p>Then did the Bishop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer her from that filthie hole, and sent her to West-gate, where after shee had been changed, and for a while been cleane kept, her skinne did wholly pill and scale off, as if shee had been poysoned with some mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall venom, where shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the 19 of Iune, on which day shee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved

                  <head>¶ The second Letter written to a faithfull Woman in her heauinesse and trouble of mind: most comfortable for all to read that are afflicted or broken hearted for their sinnes.</head>
                  <p>GOD our Father for his mercies sake in Christ, with his eternall consolatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so comfort you, as I desire to be comforted in my most need: yea, hee will comfort you my deare Sister, only cast your care vppon him, and hee neuer can nor will forsake you. Whom he loueth, hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to the end: none of his chosen can perish. Of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:25437:107"/>
which nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber I know your selfe to be one my dearely beloved Sister. GOD jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the faith thereof dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more and more in you: hee giue vnto you to hang whollie on him, and on his providence and protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For who so dwelleth vnder that secret thing and helpe of the Lord, hee shall bee Cocke-sure for evermore. He that dwelleth I say: for if we be flitters as was <hi>Lot</hi> a flitter from <hi>Zoar,</hi> where God promised him prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if he had dwelled there still, we shall remoue to our losse, as hee did into the Mountaines.</p>
                  <p>Dwell therefore, that is trust, and that finally to the end in the Lord, my
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:25437:107"/>
deare Sister; and you shall be as <hi>Mount Syon.</hi> As the Mountaines compasse <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>: so doth the Lord all his people. How then can he forget you who are as deare to him as the apple of his Eye, for his deare Sons sake. Ah deare heart that I were now with you to bee a <hi>Symon</hi> to you, to helpe &amp; carry your Crosse with you. God send you some good <hi>Symon</hi> to bee with you and helpe you.</p>
                  <p>You complaine in your Letters of the blindnesse of your mind &amp; the troubles you feele. My dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, GOD make you thankefull for that which God hath given you: he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eyes to see what
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:25437:108"/>
&amp; how great benefits you receiued, that you may be lesse covetous or rather jmpatient for so (I feare me) it should be called, and more thankfull. Haue you not receiued at his hands sight to see your blindnes, and thereto a desirous and seeking heart to see where he lyeth in the midde day, as his deare Spouse spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of her selfe in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles?</hi> Ah <hi>Ioyce,</hi> my good <hi>Ioyce,</hi> what a guift is this? many haue some sight, but none this sighing, none this sobbing, none this seeking which you haue (I know) but such as hee hath married to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his eternall sweet mercies. You are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:25437:108"/>
with the Magdalen to kisse his feet, but you wold with <hi>Moses</hi> see his face: forgetting how he biddeth vs <hi>seeke</hi> his face, <hi>Psalme</hi> 27. yea, and that <hi>euer more, Psa.</hi> 105. which signifieth no such sight as you desire to haue in this life, who would see God now face to face, whereas he cannot be seen, but covered vnder some thing, yea, somthing which is as you would say cleane contrary to God: as to see his mercie in his anger. In bringing vs to Hell, Faith seeth him bringing vs to Heaven: in darkenesse it beholdeth brightnesse: in hyding his face from vs, it beholdeth his merry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. How did <hi>Iob</hi> see
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:25437:109"/>
God, but you would say vnder Satans cloake? For who cast the fire from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven vpon his goods? who overthrew his house, and stirred vppe men to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Cattle, but Satan? And yet <hi>Iob</hi> pierced tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough all these and sawe Gods working, saying, <hi>The Lord hath giuen, the Lord hath taken, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In reading the Psalmes, how often do you see that <hi>Dauid</hi> in the shaddowe of death saw Gods sweet loue? And so my dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued I see that you in your darknes &amp; dimnes by faith do see <hi>charity</hi> &amp; britnes: by faith I say, because faith is of things absent, of things hoped for, of things which
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:25437:109"/>
I appeale to your owne conseience whether you desire not. And can you desire any thing which you know not? And is there of heauenly things any other true knoledge, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith?</p>
                  <p>Therfore my deare heart, bee thankefull, for before God I writte it, you haue great cause. Ah my <hi>Ioyce</hi> how happye is that state in which you are. Verilie, you are in the blessed state of gods deare children: for they mourne, and doe not you so? and that not for worldly weale, but for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall riches; <hi>Fayth, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charitie.</hi> Do not you hunger and thirst for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes? And I pray you, sayth not Christ, <hi>happie are
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:25437:110"/>
such.</hi> How should GOD wipe away the teares from your eyes in heaven, if on earth you shed no teares? How could Heaven bee a place of rest, if on Earth you did find it? How could you desire to be at home, if in your journey you found no griefe? How could you so often call vpon God &amp; talke with him as I know you doe, if your enemie should sleepe all the daye long? How should you else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where bee made like vnto Christ, I meane in joye, if in sorrow you sobbed not with him? If you will haue joye and felicity, you must needs feele sorrow and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. If you will go to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you must saile by hell.
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:25437:110"/>
If you will imbrace Christ in his robes, you must not thinke scorne of him in his ragges. If you will sitte at Christs table in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, you must first abide with him in his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If you will drinke of his Cup of glorie, forsake not his cup of jgnominie.</p>
                  <p>Can the head corner stone be reiected, and the other more base stones in Gods building bee in this world set by? you are one of his living stones in this building: be content ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be hewen and snag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at, that you may bee made more meet to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to your fellowes which suffer with you Satans snatches, and freats of the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:25437:111"/>
flesh, wherethrough they are enforced to crie, Oh wretches that wee are, who shall deliuer vs? you are of Gods corne, feare not therefore the flayle, the fanne, milstone, nor oven. You are one of CHRISTS Lambs: looke therefore to bee fleeced, halled at, and even slaine. If you were a market sheepe, you should goe in more fat pasture. If you were for the faire, you should be stalled and want no meate: but because you are for GODS owne vse, therfore you must pasture vppon the bare common, abiding the stormes and tempests that will fall. Happy &amp; twice happy are you my deare sister, that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:25437:111"/>
God haleth you now whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you would not, that you might come whither you would. Suffer a little and be still. Let Satan rage against you, let the world crie out, let your consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence accuse you, let the law leade you, and presse you downe, yet shall they not prevaile, for Christ is Emanuell, that is, GOD with vs. If God be with vs, who canne bee against vs. The Lord is with you; your Father cannot forget you; your spouse loveth you. If the waues and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges arise, crie with <hi>Peter,</hi> saue Lord I perish, and hee will put out his hand and helpe you. Cast out your ankor of Hope, and it will
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:25437:112"/>
not cease for al the stormie surges, till it take hold on the rocke of Gods truth and mercie.</p>
                  <p>Thinke not that hee which hath given you so many things corporally, as jnductions of spirituall &amp; heavenly mercies, and that without your deserts or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, can deny you any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall thing desiring it. For if he hath given you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, hee will giue you to haue and enioy the thing desired. The desire to haue, and the going about to aske, ought to certifie your conscience, that they bee his earnests of the things which you asking, hee will giue you: yea, before you aske, and whilst you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:25437:112"/>
to aske, hee will grant the same as <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, to his glorie and your eternal consolation. He that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his owne Son for you, will not, nor cannot think any thing too good for you, my heartely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If he had not chosen you as certainly he hath, he would not thus haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you: hee would never haue justified you: hee would never haue so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied you with his gratious gifts which I know to be in you, praysed be his name therefore: hee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver haue so exercised your faith with temptations as he hath done, and doth, if I say hee had not chosen you. If hee haue chosen
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:25437:113"/>
you (as doubtlesse deere hart he hath don in Christ, for in you I haue seene his earnest, and to me you could not deny it, I know both where and when) if I say hee haue chosen you, then neither can you, nor ever shall you perish. For if you fall, hee putteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand: you shall not lie still: so carefull is Christ your keeper over you. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was Mother so mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full over her child, as he is over you. And hath hee not alwaies been so?</p>
                  <p>Speake woman, when did he finally forget you? And will he now trow ye in your most need doe otherwise, you calling vpon him and desiring to please him? Ah
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:25437:113"/>
my <hi>Ioyce,</hi> thinke you God to bee mutable? Is hee a changeling? Doth not he loue to the end the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whom hee loveth? Are not his gifts and calling such as he cannot repent him off the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for els were he no God. If you should perish, then wanted hee power: For I am certain his will towards you is not to bee doubted off. Hath not the spirit, which is the spirit of truth, told you so? And will you hearken with <hi>Eue</hi> to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit which would haue you to despaire? God forbid it, for to doubt and stand in a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mering, would cause you that you should never truely loue God, but ever serue him of a servile
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:25437:114"/>
feare, least hee should cast you off for your vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vnthankfulnesse, as though your thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or worthines, were any causes with God why hee hath chosen you, or will fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally keepe you.</p>
                  <p>Ah my owne deare heart, <hi>Christ onely, Christ onely, and his mercie and truth. In him is the cause of your election. This Christ, this Mercie, this Truth of God remaineth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, is certaine for euer, I say for euer.</hi> If an Angell from Heaven should tell you contrarie, accursed bee he. <hi>Your thankefulnes and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse are fruits and effects of your election, they are no cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. These fruites and effects shall be so much the more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:25437:114"/>
and effectuall, by how much the more you wauer not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, arise and remember from whence you are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len. You haue a Sheape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard who neither <hi>slumbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth nor sleepeth, night nor day. No Man, nor Deuill can pull you out of his hands. Night and day hee commandeth his Angells to keepe you.</hi> Haue you forgotten what I read to you out of the Psalme, <hi>The Lord is my Sheepheard, I can want nothing.</hi> Doe you know that GOD sparred <hi>Noah</hi> into the Arke on the one side, so that hee could not get out? So hath hee done to you my good Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, so hath hee done to you. <hi>Tenne Thousand shall

                        </gap>ft hand yet no euill shall touch you.</hi> Say boldly therefore, <hi>Many a time from my youth vppe haue they fought against mee, but they haue not preuailed, no nor neuer shall preuaile, for the Lord is round about his people.</hi> And who are the people of God, but such as hope in him? Happie are they that hope in the Lord: and you are one of those my deare heart, for I am sure you haue hoped in the Lord: I haue your wordes to shewe most manifestly, &amp; I know they were written vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly.</p>
                  <p>I need not say, that euen before God you haue sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply confessed to mee, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:25437:115"/>
that oftentimes no lesse. And if once you had this hope, as you doubtles had it, thogh now ye fele it not, yet shall ye feele it againe: for the anger of God la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth but for a moment, but his mercy lasteth for euer. Tell mee my deare heart, who hath so weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned you? surely not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion which came of him that called you. <hi>For why should ye wauer? Why should ye wauer, &amp; be so heauie hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? whome looke yee on? on your selfe? on your worthines? on your thankefulnesse? on that which God requireth of you, as Faith, Hope, Loue, Feare, Ioye, &amp;c. Then can yee but wauer indeed: for what haue you as God requireth? Belieue
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:25437:116"/>
you, hope you, loue you, &amp;c. as much as ye should doe? No, no, nor neuer can in this life.</hi> Ah my dearely beloued, haue you so soone forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that which should bee had in memory? namely, that when you should bee secure and quiet in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should your faith burst throghout all things, not onely that you haue in you, or else are in Heaven, Earth, or Hell, vntill it come to Christ crucified, and th'eternall sweet mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, and his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in Christ. <hi>Heere, heere is the resting place, heere is your Spouses bed: Creepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and in your armes of faith embrace him, bewaile your weakenesse, your vnworthines,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:25437:116"/>
your dissidence: and you shall see he will turne to you. What sayd I you shall see? Nay, I should haue said you shall feele he will turne to you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You know that <hi>Moses</hi> when hee went into the Mount to talke with God, hee entred into a darke cloud: and <hi>Helias</hi> had his face couered when GOD passed by. Both these deare friends of God heard God, but they saw him not, but you would bee preferred before them. See now my deare heart, how couetous you are? Ah, be thankefull be thankefull; but God be praised your couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is <hi>Moses</hi> couetousnes: well with him you shall be satisfied, but when? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:25437:117"/>
when hee shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. Heere is not the time of seeing, but as it were in a glasse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Isaak</hi> was deceived because hee was not content with hearing onely.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to make an end of these many words, wherewith I feare me I do but hinder you from bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exercises: in as much as you are indeed the child of God, elect in Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beginning of all times: in as much as you are given to the custody of Christ, as one of GODS most precious jewels: in as much as Christ is faithfull, and hitherto and for euer hath and shal haue al pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, so that you shall never
