         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

OF
YOUTH
Bespoke for GOD:
IN A

Lately Preached to
YOUNG MEN.</p>

            <p>THE greatest and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Honour of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Creature is to serve
Him who is the best Good
and the last End, which is
the design of this little Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.
The Excellency and
Necessity of what is here
treated, justly merits a larger
<pb facs="tcp:100863:3"/>
Volumn. But I studied Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
and that upon a two-fold
account.</p>
            <p>First, Because I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
that there might be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
or no Variation from the
Sermon as it was Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
either in Altering or
Enlarging, though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of each I have done,
yet so I hope, as to please
both thee the Reader, and
they who had the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Hearing the
same.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Because I was
willing that more might
<pb facs="tcp:100863:3"/>
have a share in it, which
possibly could not
have been,<note place="margin">When a Book is of too, great a <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Poor cannot purchase it.</note> if I had
not endeavoured to
crowd my Meditations in a
little room. Birds when they
come to a full heap of Corn,
chirp and call for their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
Goodness and Light
are of a diffusive Nature.
And now since this is Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifed
into the World,
(which was not intended by
me) such as it is I offer it
to thee as the product of
my sincere and cordial Love
to the Souls of young Men.
<pb facs="tcp:100863:4"/>
Let not the Plainness of the
Matter, and the Homeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Style offend thee;
I designed it not for a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Pallate, being preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto a plain Countrey-people,
I aymed at their
Edification, and not at any
Popular Applause. The
Treatise is usefull for all that
are enquiring after true Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity,
especially the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
sort of People, being
such for the most part that
were present when this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
was Preached. What
thou (Reader) apprehendest
<pb facs="tcp:100863:4"/>
not Sound, carry it to the
Touch-stone of the Word,
and if but a Mite of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Knowledge may be
(through Gods Blessing)
added to thy Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
let God have the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and the Author hath
his End, who is</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLES. XII. 1.</bibl>
               <q>Remember Now thy Creatour in the
Dayes of thy Youth, while the Evil
Dayes come not, nor the Years
draw nigh, when thou shalt say,
I have no pleasure in them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>GOD set up two great Lights
in <hi>Solomons</hi> Heart, one
shewing the Excellency
of Christ,<note place="margin">Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astes, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> in the <hi>Canticles;</hi> the
other, the Vanity of the Creature,
as in <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> which is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and it is
called <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> because <hi>Solomon</hi>
was so called: And that either
because he speaks unto a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
at once, or else because of
his Wisdom, with which he was
indeed (after a copious manner)
endowed. The whole Book is a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100863:6"/>
declaration of <hi>Solomons</hi> repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
written in his old age, as may
be gather'd both out of the title
of it, and the closure of it in, the six
last verses, and also out of the
whole body of it, being written
upon a serious view of the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and practices of his life past,
and the great and manifold expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
he made and found therein.
He treats chiefly of the worlds va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
true felicity, the maladies of
old age, &amp; the Advantage of being
good betimes. Hence it is that
young men in the conclusion of all
are call'd upon to mind their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
and that whatsoever they
are employed in besides is vanity
of vanities, and no wise yielding
true satisfaction, but anxiety and
torment unto their souls.</p>
            <p>Remember now thy Creator in
the dayes of thy youth, while the
evil dayes come not, nor the years
draw nigh when thou shalt say, I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100863:6"/>
have no pleasure in them.</p>
            <p>The words in general do press
unto a duty of the greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world; wherein you
may take notice of these several
things.</p>
            <p>1. The Act, Remember. 2. The
Object, Creator. 3. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct
of Time; Now, in the dayes
of thy youth, exegetically repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>while the evil dayes come not,
nor the</hi> years <hi>draw</hi> nigh, <hi>when thou
shalt</hi> say I have no pleasure in
them.</p>
            <p>The words will afford us many
points of Doctrine. I shall only
observe two, and so insist upon
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. That above all things
whatsoever, we should not forget,
but Remember our Creator.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100863:7"/>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. That there is great reason
why we should remember our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
in the dayes of our youth,<note place="margin">The evil dayes spoken of in the text, and the years wherein we have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, is old age.</note>
even while we are young, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
old age over-takes us.</p>
            <p>These in order; and with the
first I begin, viz. <hi>That above all
things whatsoever, we should not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
but Remember our Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prosecution of this Point,
I purpose, through Gods assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in this wise:</p>
            <p>1. I shall set my self to amplifie
it. 2. To Apply it.</p>
            <p>The amplification will consist of
Explication and confirmation.</p>
            <p>1. Explication, and so I shall
shew you. 1. What this <hi>Creator</hi>
is. 2. What it is to <hi>remember</hi>
our Creator. 3. What it is to
remember our Creator <hi>above all
things</hi> whatsoever.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>First, I am to shew you,</hi> What
this Creator is, whom we are call'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100863:7"/>
upon in the text to mind, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
now thy Creator in the dayes of
thy youth.</p>
            <p>In the Hebrews it is (Thy
Creatours) alluding to the
Trinity, so that by Creatour
we are to understand God the
Father, God the Son, and God
the Holy Ghost; for though the
Creation of the world is peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ascribed to God the Father,
and look't upon as his proper
work, in respect of order and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
as he is the first person of the
Trinity, yet not so as to exclude
the rest;<note place="margin">Quoad ordinem, Patris oper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di modus est à se, per Filium, &amp; Spiritum Sanctum.

speak unto here; <hi>Let us,</hi> but unto
the Son and the Holy Ghost.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What it is to Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
our Creator; It is not onely a
bare thinking on him, and that
now and then, but to remember
our Creator implyes these several
things.</p>
            <p>First, To know him; to know
that he is, and what he is. That
God is, and that he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
is, <gap reason="foreign">

a Law written
in the heart of man,
and that which the
book of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
teacheth as
well as the book of
the Scriptures. But
now who This God
is, and the right mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
him, many are at a loss;
and the candle-light of Nature
(without the help of the Holy
Spirit in and by the Scriptures)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100863:8"/>

knowledge of God by them be
a comprehensive knowledge, what
God is in his Essence, in his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
in his persons &amp; in his works,
no man or Angel hath, doth, or ever
shall know; Though we must (if
we would remember our Creator
aright) know something of each,
yet he must have the wisdom of
God, and so be a God, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth

remember your Creator in this
sense? such who do not experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
know God, that he is; and in
measure, What he is, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be said to Remember him.
Remember your Creator, that is
no less than the Import of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <hi>Remember your Creator:</hi> That
is of no less Import than the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words of King <hi>David</hi> to his
Son <hi>Solomon; And thou Solomon
my Son, know thou the God of thy
Father,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To Remember our
Creator, implyes a reverent <hi>Fear</hi>
of Him. <hi>Remembring</hi> of God is
<hi>fearing</hi> of God. <hi>Prov. 23. 17. Be
thou in the Fear of the Lord all the
day long.</hi> How darest thou to say,
that thou Remembrest God, when
thou <hi>fearest</hi> him not, and hast but
little dread of his Greatness in thy
Heart?<note place="margin">Where the Fear of God is, there Sin is conquer'd as to its reigning Power, and it shall no more storm Walls, demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Castles, break through Guards, beat up Quarters, and let in Enemies.</note> Thou canst fear
Afflictions, Death, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Evil approaching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
thee, and for the
diverting whereof, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyest
thy self to the
Means in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but how little doest
thou use thy Strength and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100863:10"/>
against Sin that cursed
thing, and which rendreth thee
obnoxious to the Wrath of God,
which if thou fearest not here,
shalt hereafter to thy sorrow and
eternal detriment.</p>
            <p>Thou canst reverence a Person
of Quality, or any Earthly Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
and when Access unto him
is granted thee, how great is thy
Care and Diligence in demeaning
thy self before him? and how dost
thou tremble lest by any uncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

offend him,<note place="margin">By the <hi>Fear of God</hi> Men do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that which is Evil, but are also inclin'd to do that which is Good.</note> knowing that in case
of Default, thou mayst not onely
meet with Repulse, but also Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty?
And shall the Presence of
Worms so awe thee, and not God,
in whose presence the blessed
Saints and Angels cover their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as being unworthy of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
him?<note place="margin">Prov. 16. 6.</note> It's no marvel why
Conscience bears so little sway
now adayes,<note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29.</note> why Piety is so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
countenanc'd, why Gods Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100863:11"/>
is so little preferr'd, why one
Man even becomes a Devil to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and why Young men Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
not their Creator. The
Reason of all lies here;<note place="margin">So did not I (<hi>said good</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah) because of the fear of God.</note> The <hi>Fear
of God</hi> is not before their Eyes,
nor his Greatness studyed by them.
Our Creator is God over all Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for evermore, the Lord of
Hosts is his Name; all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are at his Beck and Check;
he is the stronger side, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
fears the Lord, need not
fear any thing else. Confidence
and strong Confidence is in the
Fear of the Lord,<note place="margin">Prov. 14. 26.</note> yea a Fear-freeing
Fear this Fear is.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To Remember our
Creator implies setting the Mind
on work on the Excellencies of
him.<note place="margin">Pulchra sunt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente te Domine, &amp; ecce tu inenarr abiliter pulchrior qui fecisti omnia. <hi>Chrys.</hi> All those things which thou hast made, are beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull, but thou thy self art infinitely more beautifull.</note> 
               <hi>Psal. 104. v. 34. My Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of him shall be sweet.</hi> The
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100863:11"/>
Excellencies of God are many,
great and incommunicable: Many
and wonderfull are the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of the Creature, but not to
be compar'd with God's; because
all Creature-Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are but Deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.<note place="margin">Some Eyes have been dazled too much with the glitterings of the Creatures, so as to take the Servant for the Master; and have been so much in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Glass, as that they forgot the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Beauty that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented. What Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Adoration hath the Sun had? even almost as much as the great Creator of Heaven and Earth himself. Strange! that they should see so dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as not to discern the Face from the Veil that covers it. For the Sun is at best but <hi>umbra Dei,</hi> and <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becula citò transitura,</hi> a mere spot, a cloud, if compar'd with so bright an Essence; and as He saith notably, the same Worshippers must needs be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Atheists in the Night-time.</note>
And what are the
Streams, compar'd to the
Fountain; the Rivers
to the Ocean, and the
excellencies of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to the Excellencies
of the Creator? being
in him primitively and
incommunicably, yea
the proper subject and
seat of all Excellencies
whatsoever, God is. And
canst thou Ovain young
man set thy Heart on
these transitory Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of the Creature,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100863:12"/>
and yet canst not look up so high
as to the Creator, and take a
View of his glorious and transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Excellencies that have and
do ravish the Hearts of all their
Contemplators? <hi>Davids</hi> Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Creators Excellencies
were sweet unto him. Call back,
O young Man, all thy stragling
Affections; it is high time now,
they have been long enough seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rest in these terrene things,
and finding none. Call home (O
vain man) thy Love, thy Joy,
Hope, Grief and Fear: These are
to the Soul, as the Souldiers to
the Centurion; <hi>If he said to one,
Go, he went; if to another, Come,
he came:</hi> These (say some) are
the Messengers of the Will; these
(say others) are the Wheels, the
Chariots, the Wings, the Feet of
the Soul. But now if thy Love,
which is the first, and General of
all the Affections, should be set,
not on God, but the World; if
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100863:12"/>
your Hatred should be directed,
not against Sin, but Good men,
or (which is worse) against Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
it self; if your Zeal should
not be pure Flames for Divine
Glory, but a burning Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Truth of God; if your
Fear should not be a flight from
Evil, but an Apostasie from Christ;
if your Anger should be a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
at anothers Eminencies,
and not at your own Exorbitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
if your Hope should not
be a well-ballanced Expectation
of Happiness, but a blind and
venturous Presumption of Mercy;
and if your Grief should be a
trouble that you cannot be and
doe more evil; Ah how vile, how
irregular, how dangerous are Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
thus misplac'd! When
Love and Hatred keep to their
right Centres, and move towards
their proper Objects, to love no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Good, to hate nothing
but Evil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:100863:13"/>Fourthly, To Remember our
Creator implies to recollect our
selves, and return unto him as the
Fountain of our Salvation, <hi>Psal.</hi>
22. 27.</p>
            <p>All the Ends of the World shall
remember and turn unto the Lord.</p>
            <p>By Sin we have Apostatiz'd
from God; are we yet return'd
unto him? is there a Conversion
of the whole man unto God?
Are Old things past away, and
all things become New? Hast
thou a New Heart? till then thou
canst not remember God with any
Affection. Hast thou a New Will?
till then thou canst not do as thou
oughtest. Hast thou a New Eye? till
then thou canst not see the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
that there is between things
Spiritual and Temporal. Hast thou
a new Appetite? till then thou
canst not know what is bitter, or
what is sweet. Every Faculty is
become the seat of Sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Necessity there is, of a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100863:13"/>
Change. The Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is dark, and stands in need
of Divine Illumination. The Will
is contumacious,<note place="margin">Man is defiled <hi>à capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te ad calcem,</hi> from Head to Foot; that (as the Philosopher saith concerning the Soul, It is in every part; where there is Life, there is the Soul, for the Soul is the Life; so) whatever is in us, and cometh from us, and is acted by us, receiveth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement from us. Sin is like a Leprosie, over the whole man; like a gangrene sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over the whole Soul.</note> and
needeth the Almighty
Power of God to make
it flexible. The Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is weak, and needeth
supernatural strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The Affections are
dull, and need spiritual
Operation. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is benumm'd,
and needeth the beams
of God's Spirit to warm
it, and quicken it, that
it may no more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead,
and be as a blind Guide.
And thus our whole Life is crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and perverse; hast thou gotten
it made strait by a sincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Reformation? The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures are a Rule, hast thou
measured thy Life by it? The
Curse of the Law hangs on thee,
why dost thou not satisfie its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100863:14"/>
and Appeal to the Grace
of God in Christ for freedom
therefrom? Thy miseries (O Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
man) are many, great, and
intolerable, why dost thou not
endeavour to extricate thy self
out of them? Read this Scripture,
O <hi>Graceless Prodigal: Psal.</hi> 9. 19.
<hi>The wicked shall be turned into Hell,
and all the Nations that forget
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Recollect therefore your selves,
oh <hi>Old Men,</hi> before your dayes
are quite concluded. <hi>Remember
your Creator Oh Young Men, while
the evil dayes come not, nor the
years draw nigh when thou shalt say,
I have no pleasure in them.</hi> Is it
not better to <hi>live</hi> than <hi>die, turn</hi>
than <hi>burn?</hi> O Sirs, persist not till
it be too late, but choose God
your chiefest Good, onely Good,
suitable Good, and everlasting
Good.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, To <hi>Remember our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
implies a <hi>due Considering what
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100863:14"/>
may Please or Displease him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 10. That ye might walk
worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing.</p>
            <p>But how few are there that
make this their work, studying
how to please God? Doth not
the Course of their Lives rather
tend to the contrary? Who lives
to please God, but rather to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
him? How little is Gods
Favour now adayes esteemed of?
Most of us are ambitious of doing
things that may please Persons
highly dignified in this World,
but the pleasing of God is look'd
upon as a superfluity, and that
which may be as well omitted as
perform'd; as if Gods good word
would not honour us so much as
a Mortals, and His Favour do us
more good than the Favour of
Man, whose breath is in his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils,
and must suddenly perish.
Mans Favour is good in its place,
but when compar'd with Gods,
there is vast difference as to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100863:15"/>
Nature,<note place="margin">In thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is life, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 5.</note> Property, Effects and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity
of it. Foolish therefore is
he who preferres the pleasing of
Man before the pleasing of God,
and chooseth rather the one than
the other; that can remember
what pleaseth the Creature, but
not what pleaseth the Creator.
This is preferring the less before
the greater, and the Servant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Master. How stands it
therefore with us? Are Gods
Smiles our Heaven, and his
Frowns our Hell? Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that we take in hand, but
we seriously pensitate and ponder
it in our Minds, saying with our
selves, Will this and that make
for Gods Glory? if so, I'le do it;
if not, I shall forbear. But, Oh
Christians, how many are remiss
in this kind of spiritual Exercise,
excusing themselves with Phrases
that will not excuse them at the
Day of Judgement. This is too
strict, say some; what need is there
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100863:15"/>
of it, say others? and, Who can
do so, is the language of many:
But I wish I might have the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of telling part of my
Mind to such persons. Is there
not a Necessity of Remembring
our Creator, if we would prosper?
but can we remember him aright,
if we please him not? and if we
please him not, can we be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, To <hi>Remember our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
implies a remembring his <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi>
and <hi>retaining a thank full sense
thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Psal. 106. 21. They forgat God
their Saviour, which had done great
things in Egypt.</p>
            <p>Doest thou often think on the
Mercies of God, so frequently
and bountifully conferred on thee?
Doest thou often revish thy Soul
in calling Mercies past to mind,
living upon Mercies <hi>present,</hi> and
<hi>depending</hi> upon Mercies to come?
<hi>Remember your Creator,</hi> will surely
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100863:16"/>
bear this Interpretation without
any wrong to the words. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
what your Creator has done
for you, his Mercies bestowed
on you in such and such a kind, at
such and such a Time, in such and
such a Place, among such and such
Company. It is a sign that we sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
esteem, and heartily remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
a Friend, when we do not
forget his Kindness, but do even
write them down in our <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum</hi>
Book: And so it stands
good in this Case also; if we say,
we remember God, and forget
his Mercies, we lie, and the Truth
is not in us; it being that which
cannot stand together. Such who
have received Mercies from the
hands of God, yea such Mercies
without which they could not
have subsisted, and yet are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull,<note place="margin">Hostis Gratiae, inimica salutis. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note>
forgetting both God
and his Benefits too, surely such
of all are most ungratefull. Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
above us, and beneath us,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100863:16"/>
Mercies before us and behind us,
Mercies on the right hand and on
the left, renders us (if still we are
barren) the most ungratefull Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
that ever lived on Earth. To
be unthankfull, where there is the
greatest reason of being thankfull,
is Folly in the Abstract. And
where Mercy is not a Load-stone
to draw to God, it will be a Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
to sink into Hell. Vinegar
you know 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Filius Vini;</hi>
and the sweetest Wine degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
into the sharpest vinegar.
And as nothing is more cold than
Lead, yet nothing more scalding
than that when melted; so nothing
is more sweet than mercy, when
thankfully received, yet nothing
more terrible than that when abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
Grace abused turns to fury,
and Mercies forgotten turn to sore
Wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly and lastly, To</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
our Creator, <hi>is to</hi> serve
<hi>and</hi> obey <hi>him; and this indeed is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100863:17"/>
the summe of all,</hi> Deut. 8. 11. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
that thou forget not the Lord
thy God, in not keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
and his Iudgements, and
his Statutes, which I command thee
this day.</p>
            <p>Many,<note place="margin">Every wicked man car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries (saith one) the Devils, Pack.</note> nay more serve the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and their own Lusts, than there
do serve God. God made man for
himself, but he hath less from
him than any other Creature.
Man should serve God, and that
in the first place; but instead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he serves himself first, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and his Lusts first. Oh, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
Degeneration, and the
Cursedness of our lapsed Estate!
One would think it incredible,
that the Creature should not serve
the Creator; we may Wonder at
it indeed, and yet Believe it we
must, because that it is, nothing
is more certain; God who is Truth
it self hath said so, and we by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Experience find it so: here then
is a <hi>Mystery of Iniquity,</hi> That Man
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100863:17"/>
should Renounce God who made
him, and Side with the Devil
who hates him, and will Eternally
destroy him, if still sided with:
That Man should take more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in Self-destruction, than in
Self-felicitating: That Man should
sell himself to sin, and take more
delight therein than in Obeying
one reasonable Commandement:
Why should all this be, O vain
man? Are the wayes of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal,
his Demands impossible,
his Commands intollerable? Have
a care of harbouring hard thoughts
of God, who hath said that his
<hi>Yoak is easie, and his burden is
light,</hi> Matth. 11. 29.</p>
            <p>If thou hast but a mind to be
engaged in the Service of God,<note place="margin">God's Spirit is an assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note>
let not the Difficulties that attend
it discourage thee; but know,
that God can by the sweet Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of himself (whilest thou art
in his Service) chear thy Heart,
and make that which seemed hard
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100863:18"/>
and difficult, the very Delight of
thy Soul. <hi>Iacobs</hi> meeting with,
and enjoying of <hi>Rachel,</hi> rendered
his hard and long Service easie and
delightfull unto him: And so a
feeling of Gods Spirit moving on
thy Heart, when thou art enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in any Religious Exercise,
will make it joyous and not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
a Delight and not a Burden,
a Heaven, and not an Hell.</p>
            <p>Besides, holy Obedience is only
hard and difficult to the Ignoble
part of a Saint, <hi>viz.</hi> the Flesh, not
to the Noble part of a Saint, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Soul. All the Wayes of God
(though tending to the pulling
out of right Eyes, and cutting
off of right Hands) are wayes of
Pleasantness to the Noble part of
a Saint. So far as every Christian
is Renewed, he is best when he
can serve God most, according
unto the Apostle; <hi>I delight in the
Law of God after the inward Man:
with my Mind I serve the Law of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100863:18"/>
God, though with my Flesh the Law
of Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remember thy Creator;</hi> that is,
Remember him so as to <hi>love, serve,</hi>
and <hi>obey</hi> him. And thus you have
heard first and last the full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of these words; <hi>Remember
thy Creator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing I am to speak
unto by way of Explication, is
this. What is it to <hi>remember our
Creator</hi> above all-things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
which may fall under these
three heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Loving</hi> God above all things
whatsoever.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Fearing</hi> God above all things
whatsoever.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Obeying</hi> God above all things
whatsoever.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, <hi>Loving</hi> God above all
things whatsoever. Here is Love
in its highest stature, and such a
kind of Love God requires; nay,
no other Love will he acccept of;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100863:19"/>
either of that kind we must give
him, or none at all. The prime of
our Affections must God have;
and indeed who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves<note place="margin">Love is due to God, not onely for the Good he hath done us, and for the Good that we hope for from him, but for the Good that is in him. Yea God is to be loved for himself. <hi>Du Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> Treatise of <hi>Peace and Contentment of Mind.</hi>
               </note>
them more than
He? who shall have
them, if not He? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
our selves have
not so great a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our selves, as He?
We and our selves, and
all that is ours are
Gods; yea we are more Gods
than our own. How is it then,
that God is no more lov'd than
he is, and that even some who
profess Love unto him, do not
love him above all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever?
Surely here lies the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Ignorance, Ignorance, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance;
<hi>Ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> sayes
the old Poet; what we <hi>know</hi> not,
we <hi>love</hi> not. Did persons but
<hi>know</hi> God more, they would <hi>love</hi>
him more. O who would not
but love that infinite Love and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:100863:19"/>
Excellency, though he had no
Interest of his own in it! God is
Love it self, and if we will not
love Love it self, surely we are
distracted.</p>
            <p>Doest thou therefore, O my
Soul, Remember thy Creator? and
doest thou so Remember him as
to Love him?<note place="margin">Tota Lex Christi tribus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terulis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluditur: <hi>Ama.</hi> Deum ama, &amp; omnes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasti. <hi>Drexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</hi>
               </note> and doest thou so
love him, as to love him above
all things whatsoever? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I fear, if weighed in the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
would be found wanting
as to this, which is the summe
and substance of Christianity! And
shall I here expostulate with the
Young man? What sayest thou?
Art thou willing to give Christ
the First-born of every Affection
in thy Soul? Doest thou love
God above all things whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?
Doest thou love him above
thy Relations, Estate, and very
Life? Canst thou preferre Gods
Glory before all Secular Interest
whatsoever, and even deny thy
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100863:20"/>
very Life for him, if called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?
This indeed is Love like
Gold tried in the Fire. Verily,
when Carnal Relations come in
competition with, and stand in
opposition unto Christ, we must
hate them; when our Friends
would prove Snares, and hinder
us from doing our Duty,<note place="margin">Christus inter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos maximus.</note> we must
either <hi>leap over</hi> them, or <hi>tread up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

that most famous Patron and

               <hi>that Laborious
and Pious Divine, concerning</hi>
Love to God, <hi>being as followeth:</hi>
I wish (since Love is the greatest
thing my Saviour can give, for God
is Love, and the greatest which I
can give my Saviour,) that his love
to me may be reflected back again;
that my chiefest Love may be as a
Fountain seal'd up to all others, and
broached onely for him who is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
lovely, that I may hate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Mother, Wife, Child, House and
Land, out of Love to him; that
many Waters of Affliction may not
quench this Love, but rather like

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:100863:21"/>Again, Doest thou love <hi>Christ</hi>
(O Young man) above thy <hi>Estate</hi>
or this present World? Hast thou
put thy Love to Christ in one
Ballance, and thy Love to the
World in another;<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Francis Xavarias</hi> counsel'd <hi>Iohn</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi> to meditate eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, a quarter of an hour upon this Text: <hi>What shall it profit a man to gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul,</hi> Mark 8. 36?</note> and
doth thy Love to Christ
weigh down thy Love
to the World? or is not
thy Case like the young
Man in the Gospel, who
was Christs Hearer, but
not his Follower: When
Christ said unto him,
<hi>Sell all and give to the Poor;</hi> it
is said, <hi>Abiit tristis,</hi> he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<hi>sorrowfull, Mat.</hi> 19. 22. Doth

            <p>Again,<note place="margin">The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> carryed the Image of Christ in his heart as a Saint, the Message of Christ in his mouth as a Minister, and the Mark of Christ in his body as a Martyr.</note> Is Christ (O young Man)

Can wicked Men be content to

            <p>Heroick <hi>Luther</hi> hath an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and indeed it is like
himself: <hi>I would rather</hi> (saith he)
<hi>be a Martyr than a Monarch.</hi> And
the same said again, <hi>Disce mori ut

            </p>
            <p>Such who do preferre Christ,<note place="margin">The way to Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise is by a flaming Sword, the way to Canaan is through a howling Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is by the Gates of Hell.</note>
think not much to die for him;
and that it is so, see it confirm'd
in this Cloud of Witnesses. The
Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> was kill'd with a
Saw, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> with Stones, <hi>Amos</hi>
with an Iron-barre, and St. <hi>Luke</hi>
was hanged on an Olive-tree: So
that this is clear, he who preferres
his Life before Christ, is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of him. He that with <hi>Iudas</hi>

and <hi>Spira</hi> will rather sin than suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
must with them suffer a Hell
on this side of Hell.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Fearing</hi> God above
all things whatsoever. Thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thy Father and Mother, thy
Master, and such who have the
Rule over thee; but doest thou
<hi>fear</hi> thy Maker? How many, I
fear, (especially Young men) may
I find tardy in this? Why now
to <hi>remember</hi> thy Creator above
all things whatsoever, is to <hi>fear</hi>
him; and to fear him above all
things whatsoever, is to fear him
in an otherguise manner than one
Mortal fears another. Civil or
Natural Difference among us here
below, commandeth proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Reverence, and if such Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
be due from one Creature
to another, when they are all
made of the same coarse earthly
Mould, and must all be buried
in the bowels of their common
Mother, the Earth; when there
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100863:22"/>
is no Essential, but onely an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal
difference between them:
What Fear and Reverence then
is due from us poor dust and ashes
to the God of the Spirits of all
Flesh, the King of Kings, and the
Lord of Lords, between whom
and his Creatures there is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
distance! O be perswaded
(above all things) <hi>to fear</hi> that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and fearfull Name, <hi>The Lord
thy God.</hi> That Name which is
the greatest prop of thine Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
commandeth thy Fear and
Reverence, when thou hearest:

when he hears from God; <hi>He

and worships,</hi> Exod. 34. 8.</p>
            <p>And so when thou <hi>prayest,</hi> put
up thy Petitions to God with a
great deal of Trepidation, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that though thou takest upon
thee to speak unto the great God
of Heaven and Earth, yet still
thou art but Dust and Ashes.

as to a Father,<note place="margin">Tantâ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verentiâ ut si Deo, &amp; tantâ fiduciâ ut si amico.</note> but with Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
as to a God. Thou art at
best but a Begger, and a <hi>proud
heart</hi> will not suit a <hi>Beggers purse.</hi>
The <hi>Eastern</hi> Christians when they
called on God, threw themselves
on the ground.</p>
            <p>The Lord will give Grace and
Glory; no good thing will he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

Grace to the humble.</p>
            <p>God sets himself in <hi>battel-array</hi>
against a <hi>proud man,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi>

To this man will I look,<note place="margin">Deus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius est illis qui dolent quòd ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catis suic offenderunt, ac proinde trepidant, quum cogitant se damnationem aeternam esse meritos. <hi>Piscat. in loc.</hi>

            <p>Again, when thou approachest
to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> is another
special time when God should be
more than ordinarily reverenced

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Obeying</hi> God above
all things whatsoever. All Service
must be denyed, rather than Gods
must be neglected: Not that I
would hereby encourage Servants
unto Neglect in their Masters Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy,
that is not my drift; that
which I would have Servants and
all do, is <hi>serving</hi> and <hi>obeying</hi> God
in a right manner. And now God
is <hi>obey'd</hi> and <hi>serv'd</hi> in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

would serve God as you should

Scripture-Reasons.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Rea. 1.</note> Above all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
we must not forget, but
<hi>Remember our Creator,</hi> because He
hath <hi>commanded</hi> us: <hi>Remember
thy Creator.</hi> Doth it become a
Child when commanded, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute
his Fathers Command? Is
it not his <hi>Father</hi> that commands
him, and therefore he must do it?
Why, is not God the Father of
us all by Creation, and are we
not obliged to Obey him? The
Wind and Seas do obey him, and
shall We turn Rebels? All Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
pay Homage unto him, and
shall Man refuse? <hi>Doth the Oxe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100863:26"/>
know his Owner, and the Ass his
Masters Crib;</hi> Isa. 1. 3. And shall
not we whom God hath endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Reason, and made <hi>capaces
Religionis,</hi> capable of Religion?
Are all the Creatures at Gods
beck, and ready to obey him
whensoever he desireth it, and yet
shall we spurn against him, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him to wrath, and grieving
his holy Spirit? Why cannot we
find in our hearts to obey our
Father, Creator and Lord? Is he
not our Sovereign, and have any
gone on in a course of Rebellion
against him, that did ever prosper?
Is it not a vain thing to stand it
out with God, or contend with
the Almighty? Would it not be
more advantagious to lay down
the Weapons, and crie <hi>peccavi,</hi>
than to wrestle and be foyl'd,
fight and be kill'd? Is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to remember our Friend, that
he may remember us, when the
proudest and most ambitious
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:100863:27"/>
shall e're long see their need of
him.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Rea. 2.</note> We must not forget,
but above all things <hi>Remember
our Creator,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Religion that was first in Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, is now become last in mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution.</note> because it is <hi>the End

to love, serve and obey his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
and God hath made him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
though now by Sin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Rea. 3.</note> God who <hi>made</hi> us,
can <hi>destroy</hi> us; our Creator is our
Preserver;<note place="margin">God can easily look us into the Grave, &amp; frown us into Hell.</note> as we had our Being
from God, so on him doth our
Being depend. The same Power
that made the World, upholds
the World; the same God that
made us out of nothing, can make
us into nothing: It concerns us
therefore that all of us do see to
this main thing, <hi>Remember thy
Creator.</hi> Are we not in Gods
hands, as the Clay is in the hands
of the Potter; we are his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and he may do with us what
he pleaseth, and who shall gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100863:27"/>
or oppose him in the least?
Let us now therefore deferre no
longer, but remember and call to
mind our Holy Creator, lest he
becomes so angry as not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
but to destroy us for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, God is a <hi>bountifull
Benefactor,</hi> he feeds us, cloaths us,
and gives us House-room, and
therefore not to remember him,
is double Ingratitude. God shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Mercy unto thee before thou
couldst understand it; he prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee with Blessings, before
thou couldst desire them.<note place="margin">He is a beast in the shape of a Man, that will not serve that God at whose Mercy he lies every moment.</note> When
thou wast in the Womb, his
Bounty embrac'd thee; when
thou hangedst on thy Mothers
Breast, he did care for thee. How
many years are past, in which
thou wast not? yet God erected
this House of thy Body for thee;
gave thee a Reasonable Soul,
made thee a Man and not a Stone
or a Serpent; And yet wilt thou
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100863:28"/>
not love this God, take delight
in this God, fear this God, serve
and obey this God? Is it not in
and by him that thou livest, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
and hast thy being? Is not
the Aire which thou breathest in,
his? Is not the Night and Day
his, whose Intercourses serve for
thy Labour and Rest? Is not the
Earth his, whose Fruits do nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
thee most plentifully? Yea
doth not this Benefactor wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
form, furnish and conserve all
the Creatures for thy sake, some
whereof serve to <hi>obey</hi> thee, some to
<hi>nourish</hi> thee, some to <hi>cloath</hi> thee,
some to <hi>cure</hi> thee, some to <hi>chastise</hi>
thee; but all of them to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi>
thee? What sayest thou now,
wilt thou resolve to think now
and then on this precious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of ours? Muzzle not, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
you, the mouth of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but give it leave to speak
its mind freely.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, We should not</hi> forget,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100863:28"/>
               <hi>but above all things</hi> remember <hi>our
Creator, because he is our</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer

there that give their young and

now Young Men, hearken unto
this, and flee Youthfull Lusts;
God requires the Cream of your

in the dayes of your Youth,
because <hi>too soon</hi> you cannot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

Good is never too late. I am sure
the way to be Good, is never too

is seldom true. True Repentance
(without doubt) cannot be too

late; but then, late Repentance
is very suspicious, being seldom
true: Could we have served God
in our Mothers Womb, yet we
could not serve him too soon.
And those who shall serve him to
Eternity, cannot serve him too
much. <hi>Hark, young men, hark,
but let it not amaze you; We can
never serve God too soon, because he
lov'd us from Eternity; and we
cannot serve him too much because
he loves us to Eternity.</hi> Never

God and Jesus Christ. When we
take a far Journey, it is requisite
that we have the Morning before
us. Sirs, to goe from Earth to
Heaven is a great Journey, let
us then be carefull to set out in
the Spring and Morning of our

Old, but walk while thou hast
Light, lest the Darkness and Night
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100863:34"/>
of Old Age and Death overtake
thee, when no man can work. If
therefore, young Men, you would
ever be serviceable to God, let it
be while your strength lasts, and
before it quite fails. Give not
the Devil the Prime, Bud, Blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
Flower of your Age, and
the Cream of your dayes, and in
your Old Age (when you can
do nothing) offer your selves to
God; as if he were bound to have
you then, and onely then when
the Devil has done with you:
And O unreasonable Creature,
that hast nothing for thy Maker
but the Devils Leavings, <hi>viz.</hi> Old

                  <hi>Remember

your Creator in the dayes of your

unto <hi>Early Seekers;</hi> Prov. 8. 17.
<hi>They that seek me Early, shall find

            <div type="part">
               <head>Application.</head>
               <p>Is there good Reason why we
should <hi>Remember our Creator in
the dayes of our Youth?</hi> Then let
my Message to you (O Young
Men) this day be accepted. The
Reasonableness of my Message I
have shewed in several Respects.
Did I press you to things that
might tend to your hurt, it were
something; but I am onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating
you this day to be kind
unto your Souls, and make your
peace with God: <hi>While the dayes
come not, nor the years draw nigh,
when ye shall say, I have no pleasure
in them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Result of all therefore is;
Young men, <hi>Remember your Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
by whom it is that you <hi>live,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100863:38"/>
move,</hi> and have your <hi>Being.</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
him not, lest he forget you,
but seek him Early, and ye shall
find him. Motives hereunto I think
very convenient. As,</p>
               <p>First, If <hi>Honour</hi> will sway you,<note place="margin">Motive 1.</note>
know that it is the Honourablest
thing in the world to Remember
your <hi>Creator in the dayes of your
Youth.</hi> Is it commendable for a
Child to obey his Earthly Father,
how much more commendable is
it then for us to Obey our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father? Shun (O Young
Men) the Worlds Ambition, and
make this your Ambition (with
good <hi>Iosiah</hi>) to set out <hi>betimes;</hi>
with spiritual <hi>Isaac,</hi> to give your
selves to Meditation while ye are
young; with heavenly <hi>Iacob,</hi> to
prize and seek the Blessing, while
others in the use of their vain
Sports lose it; with King <hi>Solomon,</hi>
to <hi>know</hi> the God of your Fathers;
with righteous <hi>Obadiah,</hi> to fear
the Lord from your Youth; and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100863:39"/>
with Ingenious <hi>Timothy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to know
the <hi>Scriptures</hi> from a Child. And
what a Cloud of young Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
are here? and are they not
Honoured, Renowned and made
Famous, and that for their <hi>soon
beginning?</hi> The like will be with
you, Young men. <hi>Remember</hi> your
<hi>Creator</hi> in the <hi>dayes of your Youth,</hi>
and he will Honour you. But alas,
how few are the number of these
young Branches!</p>
               <p>How few are there of the Sons
of Wisdom, that being enticed by
Men, consent not! But how Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
is it (I say) for young
Men, like <hi>Samuel,</hi> to minister and
serve before the Lord while he
was but a Child! and how come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was the Carriage of those Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
that sang <hi>Hosanna's</hi> unto
Christ! Contemplate often (Young
men) these Looking-glasses; imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
and copy out these patterns
and Presidents; Besides, King
<hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, that <hi>Phoenix</hi> of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100863:39"/>
his time; that truely Noble Prince
<hi>Henry,</hi> and the young Lord <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington;</hi>
with many others, who
blossomed as the Almond-tree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Motive 2.</note> The <hi>longer</hi> you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
the <hi>more difficult</hi> will the <hi>set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
upon</hi> your Duty be. Much
Sloath and Procrastination will at
last take away the very Heart and
Desire of seeking God; but now,
Youth improved, will make the
Performance of the Duty more
facile. Opportunity improv'd,
(sayes one) facilitates every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Employment, making a
work come off sweetly, smoothly
and with facility. It is as the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Knife upon the Joynt,
when we would divide the Bone.
It is Wind and Tide to the Oars
of Industry.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Motive 3.</note> The more <hi>Wrath</hi> you
will treasure up unto your selves,
by having more sins to <hi>answer for.</hi>
The sooner we begin, the less we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100863:40"/>
shall have to answer for; but the
longer we deferre, the more we
shall have to answer for.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Motive 4.</note> Young Men shall
come to <hi>Iudgement</hi> as well as those
of riper years: You think that
you have a Priviledge by your
Age; Youth must have its course,
(say some;) they must sow their
wild Oats. But now the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of the Spirit is otherwise. <hi>In
the Morning sow thy Seed, and in
the Evening withhold not thy hand,
for thou knowest not whether shall
prosper.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> doth tie up
your untamed Age to the <hi>horns
of the Altar,</hi> saying, That even
<hi>You must cleanse your wayes, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
heed thereto according to Gods
Word.</hi> Think not (I say) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you are Young, you shall
be excused: For <hi>the dead, small
and great</hi> shall stand before the
Lord, and you that now take
your pleasures, know, that for all
that, ye shall come to Judgement,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100863:40"/>
and your Pleasures shall have an
End. Methinks that Scripture in
the 11 of <hi>Eccles. v.</hi> 9. should cool
the Courage of such Young men
who go on in their Career to Hell
in the midst of their Pleasures.
<hi>Rejoyce, O young Man, in thy youth,
and let thy Heart cheer thee in the
dayes of thy youth, and walk in the
wayes of thy heart, and in the sight
of thine eyes; but know thou, that
for all these things God will bring
thee into Iudgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, You will not Repent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that you have <hi>call'd God to mind
so soon.</hi> But thou shalt esteem
Gods Grace the more for it; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in the sense of it, and in
Comfort conclude thy Life when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
God shall call thee hence.</p>
               <p>I would fain lay down some
Cautions and Exhortations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Young Men of this Age,
which if observed by them, I am
confident would help them much
in <hi>remembring</hi> of their great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100863:41"/>
But should I doe this, it
would make this little Book
swell too much, which for the
Poor's sake I would prevent; and
yet a little too I will venture.</p>
               <p>First more <hi>generally,</hi> have a care
Young Men of laying a stress on
Parentage, Birth, Education, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
and your Natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
They are all but painted
shews of Righteousness, and
crack'd Titles to Heaven. Faith
comes not by Birth, Generation,
or Education; and he who is Gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is not alwayes Believing.</p>
               <p>But (Secondly) more <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly,</hi>
I would caution you from
these Vices, which tend much to
the Corruption of Youth:</p>
               <p>First, I would caution you
from <hi>Love of the World. If any
man love the World, the love of
the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.
15. O let not the World lye so
neer your Hearts, as it did to the
Young Man's in the Gospel. You
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100863:41"/>
can never Love your Creator so
as to <hi>die</hi> for him, if the World
get root in your Heart. Have a
care (I beseech you) of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Gifts of God before God
himself. All Creatures that the
Lord made, he made for Man,
and Man for himself: But this is
a fearfull Contempt of God and
disestimation of his Majesty, when
the Creature is better lov'd than
God; as <hi>Evah</hi> for the love of an
Apple lost the love of the Lord;
and <hi>Esau</hi> for a Mess of Pottage
sold his Birthright; and the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darens</hi>
counted their Swine more
precious than the Son of God,
<hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> He that loveth these
bodily, worldly, and perishing
Riches, cannot love the spiritual,
heavenly and eternal Riches.
Love not this World,<note place="margin">Noli (anima) diligere ea quae sunt in mundo, peribit Mundus, &amp; omnia quae sunt in eo exurentur. Ger. Meditat.</note> because the
Devil is the God of it; love not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100863:42"/>
this World, because it cools thy
Affections to God and the things
of God. Love not this World,
because it is the Bird-lime of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual<note place="margin">Amor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renarum viscus est spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narum. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                  </note>
Punishments; Love not this
World, because the Love of the
World is Enmity towards God.
The Riches in this World are
call'd <hi>Thick Clay, Hab.</hi> 2. 6. which
will sooner break the Back, than
lighten the Heart. O that I could
but disswade Young men from
this <hi>peccatum peccatorum,</hi> sin of
Earthly-mindedness. Consider, O
young Men, what <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes
of this World, who knew as much
as ever any did as to the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of <hi>sensual pleasures.</hi> Three
Advantages <hi>Solomon</hi> had above
others to know the Vanity of the
Creature. (1) In regard of his
<hi>Wisdome, 1 Kings</hi> 4. 29, 30.
(2) <hi>Riches, 1 King.</hi> 10. 23. (3) In
that he gave himself to <hi>make trial</hi>
and <hi>Experience</hi> of the Creature:
Yet, <hi>Vanity of Vanities</hi> (saith the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100863:42"/>
Preacher) <hi>Vanity of Vanities, all
is Vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Five times <hi>Vanity. 1. Vanity,</hi>
not <hi>vain</hi> onely, but <hi>Vanity</hi> it self
in the Abstract. 2. <hi>Excessive Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
Vanity of Vanities,</hi> Hebraism,
superlative, by doubling he sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
<hi>most vain, imperfect, uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
transitory, void of Content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
full of Grief.</hi> 3. An <hi>heap of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities;
Vanity of Vanities;</hi> an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braism,
and imports <hi>most great
Vanity. 4. An universal Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
all is Vanity. Fugiamus
hinc ubi nihil est, ubi inane est om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
quod magnificum putatur.</hi> Let
us flye from this World, wherein
is nothing but Vanity. <hi>Nihil si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem
a somni Vanitate differt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
praesentium figura, sive illae
tristes sint, sive prosperae:</hi> The most
excellent Shews of this Life are
but Dreams, which may affect for
a time, but do vanish so soon as
the man awaketh. And this is
the first Caution, <hi>Love not the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100863:43"/>
World.</hi> The Love of the World
is an Obstacle that must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
where Love to Christ and
to thy Soul (Young man) is to be
shewn.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would caution you
from <hi>Evil Company.</hi> I know very
well, that we are mighty apt to
follow a Multitude to do Evil;
I know that Youth, above all, is
apt to keep Company, especially
<hi>had</hi> Company. And how many
have been brought to Ruine
thereby?<note place="margin">Wirness <hi>Thomas Savage</hi> that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent Sinner.</note> Have not many at the
Gallowes laid their sins at the
Door of <hi>bad Company,</hi> forewarn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all to shun the same, and take
Example by them. Every man is
as his Company: The Heathen
could say, <hi>Noscitur ex comite qui
non cognoscitur ex se;</hi> He is known
by his Company, that cannot be
known by himself. A Mans Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is as it were a Commentary
on his Life. A Company or Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
(and I pray Young Men
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100863:43"/>
do you especially take notice of
it) is not the Rule you should
walk by, as for <hi>doing Evil,</hi> so for
<hi>doing Good.</hi> He that doth Good
because a Multitude
doth it,<note place="margin">Non saciendum, quia Multifaciunt. sed quia Bonum ut Bon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  </note> will also do
Evil because a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
doth it. <hi>We must
not</hi> (saith <hi>Austin) do a
good thing because Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
do it,<note place="margin">Si potenti<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>res faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, non faciunt, sed gaudeo quia faciunt.</note> but because it
is Good: If others doe
that which is Good</hi> (saith
he) <hi>I will rejoyce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they doe it, but I will not do
it because they do it,</hi> &amp;c. Keep
good Company we must, it is
profitable, but we must not make
their doing Good as the Grounds
of our doing Good. Shun Evil
Company; Is it not an hard thing
for a Bird to flie away that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the Lime-twigs? Why
Evil Company are the Devils
Lime-twigs; And what is the
Reason that many a man doth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100863:44"/>
continue in Sin, who is convinced
of the Evil of it, but because he
is held fast in the Bands of his
wicked Company?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would caution you
from <hi>Pride.</hi> This is a Vice which
is incident to all more or less, but
especially to young men. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
young men, beware of
Pride, for it is that which will
rankor all your Graces; know
that you are vile in Progress,
Egress and Ingress. Unconverted
young Men, do you also beware
of Pride, for it tends to your
hurt, as well as it doth to the
other; for that self-conceitedness
of yours is that which helps to
barre your Hearts against Christ.
Young Men, be cloathed with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility;
let every one of us look
with one eye upon Grace, to keep
the Heart cheerfull; and with
the other eye upon Sin, to keep
it humble.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I would have young
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100863:44"/>
men to beware of <hi>Lust,</hi> it being
their Complexion, Constitution,
and beloved Sin; the sin that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
their Age, and therefore
so much the more diligence and
pains must be taken in the Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
thereof; and I know not
any thing that is so proper here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
as being moderate in Diet,
keeping the Body down by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Fastings in private between
God and thy own Soul upon that
Occasion. <hi>Flee Youthfull Lusts,</hi>
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly</hi> and lastly, Beware of
<hi>Hypocrisie.</hi> Perhaps the Devil may
flatter you, with telling you, That
if ye can get the Shape, Figure,
and Form of Godliness, it is no
matter for any thing else, thou
mayst (saith he) go for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
eminent enough among men.
Ah, but tell the Tempter, It is
onely <hi>Piety</hi> that hath the Promise
of the Life to come, and though
thou mayst goe for a Christian
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100863:45"/>
amongst Men, and seem well
enough in their sight; yet know,
in Gods sight thou shalt be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd;
God will one day pull
off thy paint, discover thee, and
shew thee to the world in thy
proper Colours. The very Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Intents of thy Soul he
knows, thy heart he can read
without a Commentary, and those
things that are secret, which thou
keepest under Lock and Key, he
knows; and though thou mayest
deceive Man, yet thou canst not
deceive God. <hi>Deus nee f<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

nec falli potest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I should now give some Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
but I cannot, because of
being prevented as to that which
I spoke before. <hi>Remember your
Creator in the dayes of your youth:</hi>
And as Helps hereunto take these,
and enlarge upon them your
selves.</p>
               <p>1. View often the <hi>Creation</hi> of
the World; what Man in the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100863:45"/>
World can forget God, that has
himself and the whole Creation
to contemplate at any time?</p>
               <p>2. Call to mind his <hi>signal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
vouchsafed unto you, in
such a Time, at such a Place,
among such Company. Can the
Begger soon forget that hand
which he constantly receives his
Alms from?</p>
               <p>3. Study the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi>
Who can soon forget a holy God,
that may read of him every day
in the Holy Scriptures?</p>
               <p>4. Attend upon the <hi>Ministry
of the Word.</hi> You in <hi>London</hi> may
hear from God every day, and
surely cannot soon forget him.</p>
               <p>5. Keep <hi>good company,</hi> and then
you cannot easily forget God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
you converse with his
Friends; and 'twill be marvel if
they do not talk of him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
unto you.</p>
               <p>I shall conclude with the words
of the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:100863:46"/>
                  <hi>Remember now your Creator

of your Maker. <hi>Amen.</hi>
